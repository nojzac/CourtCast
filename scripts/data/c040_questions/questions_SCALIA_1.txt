No, but I think -- I think the Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals that --    -- applied a particular standard.  And certainly it had to have been.  Didn't the Court of Appeals have a particular standard as to what constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the -- by the safe harbor exemption?

The statute says --    -- the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.    No, but it lists the other reasons:  on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service.  And -- and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn't qualify.

In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?    Without any qualification for disability, illness.  No.  I just want the money.

03-1500 +++$+++     Mr. Chemerinsky, I suppose that opening statement suggests that you think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the First Amendment. 3  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    They also refer to one God, to a theistic ruler of the universe.    All right.  But then you have to narrow your opening statement and say that certainly the State can acknowledge the existence of a unitary God without offending the Establishment Clause.    But the prayers in Congress don't do that and our Thanksgiving proclamations don't do that.  They invoke a God, a unitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates of some religions that believe that there are a lot of gods.    We don't pray to gods, the prayers are always to God.  You know, I don't see why the one is good and the other is bad.  It's no answer to say, well, you know, the former has been around for a long time.  Well, it has but it suggests 8  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 what the framers and what our society for several 2 hundred years has believed the Establishment Clause 3 means. 4 And it does not -- it is not too sectarian 5 if it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it 6 becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten 7 Commandments.   Who are you kidding? I mean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten Commandments. And what that message says is that these commands that are engraved on the human heart come from God. Why put it that way? You know, instead of that, just quote the State statute against murder. That's not what they're doing. 23  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 They're saying these basic principles of 2 human behavior that we're governed by come from God. 3 And that message would be conveyed so long as you use 4 the terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what 5 the Ten Commandments stand for.    Doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own?  As I say, I don't think most people know what the text of the Ten Commandments are, but they do know that it stands for the fact that our laws are derived from God.  That's what it stands for.  Why isn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the State of Texas to use it?
03-1566 +++$+++    And no money damages.   There has to be an ongoing suit. You think this section does -- does not permit somebody to initiate suit against one party and at the same time against the United States as a necessary party.   Why what is the case?   Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would -- would only be -- the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.   Whereas, this suit here -- it doesn't matter how reasonable it is. If it's wrong, it's wrong. I mean, it's quite a different -­
03-1601 +++$+++     Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments.  Right?    And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.   Unless they have chosen to waive it, which --    -- one must assume in this area they haven't.    So you have to regard this as intentionally overriding some provisions of in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.    In for a penny, in for a pound.    If they've -- if they've   If -- if you acknowledge that ￼1 immunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under 2 California and other State law, for municipalities to be 3 subject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that 4 they make. And that is the typical fashion that this -- 5 this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of 6 providing judicial review of agency action. 7 Another consideration that supports the view 8 that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act 9 provides an entire process for the implementation of the 10 Federal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive 11 requirements that identifies the agencies to implement 12 them. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA- 13 like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial 14 evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like 15 the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of 16 time. 17 18 mechanism 19 much like 20 21 significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as 22 a whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches 23 specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the 24 common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with 25 corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as It then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted for judicial review.  In that sense, it is very the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson. That elaborate process is particularly 12  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 an action for suit -- I mean, an action for damages in 2 court or an enforcement action in the commission in 3 sections 206 and 207.

One -- one could say that not only is claim preclusion the answer to Rooker-Feldman, it's also the answer to the asserted mootness here. I mean, you -- you don't have to move to dismiss it as moot. All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question. Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot? I mean, you'd think there would be a case on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that because the other side is always going to plead res judicata.   Or give up. But is there any case in which mootness is established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of another court giving you what you are asking for from this Court? Page 37  1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005   I think I wrote that opinion. (Laughter.)
03-184 +++$+++     Of course, what you're asking us to do would -- would just solve your problem in this case, and -- and in the future, I suppose they could revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report.

Well, they could -- they could use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll consult with the -- with the deciding judge.    Well, they confer with each other.  Maybe, maybe.    Well, now, wait.  Under the Due Process Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than just access to the report.  You -- if -- if you're really relying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I think you would be saying that after reading the report, you should have the opportunity to argue to the -- to Dawson here, to -- to the Tax Court judge that the report should not be adopted.    Isn't that part of your due process case?    You think it satisfies due process just to show you the report, and then --    Well, then -- then you're not relying on Morgan II.    There wasn't a need to disclose the point that Morgan II made.  It was he who hears must 19 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 decide.    They -- they never say so in their opinion.    They always say that they adopt the trial judge's report.  Don't they? 24 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    But you're -- you're not that the APA governs this.    Isn't there an express for -- for --    Why does 7461 require its -- its disclosure?  Because it does say that the -- it's only the decision of the Tax Court.    That reports of the Tax Court that have to be disclosed.

Have I searched that person because I -- I observe something external?    Is there no difference between an investigation and a search?  and -- and your statement there's a search whenever No.  It seems to me your brief here both seem to assume that the police investigate.    But that's not so.  They -- one can investigate without searching.    Suppose a policeman follows me around.  He just -- just follows me around, observing with his -- with plain eyes, nothing else.

And maybe -- maybe I'd have a harassment action against him if he does it, you know, blatantly.  But is that a search?    Okay.

So you're still holding stock worth $60, if worth means its market value.  Right?    And we're dealing with a special rule that looks to market value.  Right?  You don't have to have the -- the representation made explicitly to the plaintiff.  It's a representation that was made to the market at large which caused the market value of the stock.  Right?

The issue isn’t whether there will be any judicial review.  The issue is whether there will be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are -- that are not -- for which judicial review was not provided.  Any major employee action -- judicial review, as I understand it, is available, and it is only relatively insignificant actions for which judicial review is not available.  Isn’t that right?    He could have refused -- he could have refused the search, in which case if there was any significant personnel action taken against him for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of whether the search was constitutional or not.    That’s often the case where -- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental action, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to court by resisting it.    But that search was a consequence of his employment.  It -- this wasn’t a search of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with the Government.  It was a search that he was required to submit to as an employee.  So to -- to describe it as unrelated to employee action seems to me unrealistic.  The only reason he submitted to it was that if he didn’t, he would have -- he would have been subject to an employee action.    Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, if this is indeed serious, are you sure that it’s not a personnel action?

That’s the residual category. But one of the specifically named categories, before you get to that, is a decision to order psychiatric testing.  Now, if that kind of a decision could be a personnel action, why couldn’t a decision to conduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a personnel action?    I’m not adding it.  There’s a residual category at the end:  or any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.

And that's precisely what we have here.    I don't think it has to do with expertise.  I think it has to do with immense national importance.    Well, that's symbolic speech. I'm talking about actual speech. What expression is the university -- real, you know, words - - words -- is the --    -- university --    -- compelled to utter by this legislation?    No, I suppose when you -- when the police knock at the door and say, you know, "I have a warrant," I suppose somebody has to say, "Come in."  Is that MR. compelled speech?  Does that --    Does that -- does that raise a first-amendment problem?    Suppose that a law-school faculty could decide that it does not favor a particular war, and use that as the basis for excluding recruiters, "By allowing this recruiter to come on 57  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 campus, you are making me speak, in effect, to our students, saying, 'Join the Army and fight the war that we're now engaged in.'" not --  that."  Now --  difference?   same thing.   same situation would apply if the university faculty does not favor the particular war that the United States is --    -- engaged in, and, therefore, obstructs the effort to raise --   come on campus.    It's obstruction when you refuse to give them what you give what you give everybody else.    -- fighting a war.

Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --    Capital murder, as its name implies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are mitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is not proper.    That's a moral judgment, isn't it?    And even if the State had said the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State- prescribed moral judgment.  If the State had said capital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors, that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't it?

I mean, they're -- they're two different words --    I think the Fourth Circuit we had a case that -- that answered that not a case involving this particular --    -- but a case involving 10 provision 11 12 13 another provision of -- of the banking laws.    And -- and whatever -- whatever the outcome, whether it was equality or non- equality, and whatever the rationale, whether it was the purpose to be served or something else, the Court held that the word located in a banking statute which had both the words established and located in it --    -- meant where they have a branch.  And -- and that seems to me a very persuasive indication for a lawyer --    -- who's trying to figure out how to advise his client.

There is 2 also, of course, an exhaustion remedy inherent in Title 3 II, because, in order to get a reasonable modification, 4 you have to ask for the modification in the first 5 place. 6 We also think that the PLRA applies, in all 7 its provisions, to Title II claims. And one important 8 provision to keep in mind is 1997e(e) -- 42 U.S.C. 1997 9 e(e) -- which is a limitations on the damages that are 10 available. And, under that provision, in order to get 11 damages for emotional or mental injury, you have to 12 also show some sort of physical injury. And the lower 13 courts have interpreted that to require at least the 14 kind of more than de minimis injury you need under the 15 Eighth Amendment. And I think the PLRA, together with 16 Title II, in the particular area of damages, which is 17 what Justice Kennedy has pointed out is the particular 18 area of concern under the Eleventh Amendment, is even a 19 further narrowing of the relief that's available and a 20 further narrowing of the prophylaxis under the Title 21 II. So, I do think the PLRA is actually something that 22 actually helps make sure that the remedy here is 23 congruent 24 25 May I ask and proportional.

I mean, the medicals are a given in any settlement I've ever heard of.  There it is, black on white.  This is how much was paid.    That's the compromise.

Okay, but once -- once the -- once the -- the foolish insurance company figures out that that is what is going to happen, future settlements will be very difficult I would gather.

The only thing you 6 can say is, there hasn't been a discharge. It's -- 7 because it's the same body of water.    If, in Miccosukee, liquid of the same composition had been taken from another body of water, and from -- not the body of water that was adjacent and which we held was the same body of water - - with the same composition, and that had been added, do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same way?

Mr. Hart --    Mr. --   Well, core -- core government functions isn't -- isn't the mean --   -- you know, Government and I think some States gave test either.

So the mere fact that -- that your county is exercising some, quote, core government functions, that -- that doesn't -- doesn't get you there.    It wasn't sovereign immunity.  It was -- charities had immunity until very recently.  Some States still had it when I was in law school.  You couldn't sue a charity for tort.    Well, that's bridge immunity, not sovereign immunity.  I mean --    -- it doesn't come -- it doesn't come within the Federal Constitution.    Well, no, I'm not talking about textually.

04-495 +++$+++     General Petro, before you get into the details of why -- why you think the process here was all that was due, I'm -- I'm more concerned about the preliminary question of whether there was a liberty interest here.  I -- I know you haven't challenged the existence of it, but I'm not sure that lets me off the hook. We -- we had a case some years ago in which both 3  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they 2 conceded in the -- in the court of appeals that the 3 statute existed and wanted us to say what this 4 presumptively existing statute said. And we held, since 5 there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been 6 properly enacted, we had to reach that question first 7 because we were not going to speculate on what a, you 8 know, hypothetical statute said. 9 And I think you're asking us to do sort of the 10 same thing here. You're -- if -- you know, without even 11 conceding or -- the Government doesn't concede anyway. 12 The United States doesn't.    So there's -- there's no Eighth problem.    So if you wanted to, you could 10 11 put all of your prisoners in maximum security. Right?    Wasn't solitary confinement involved in Sandin?   Didn't we say in Sandin that solitary confinement was -- was not enough to -- to create --   I thought there -- there was at least annual review. Isn't -- wasn't there an annual --    And a good thing too. (Laughter.)    That's not the whole class,    You have a class action.

04-514 +++$+++     So there -- there is nothing from the court that -- that says we -- we shorten or extend the time.    Then I guess that the -- that the conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the court has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must issue 7 calendar days after.

It novel for the Court on the basis of what it thought the weight of the evidence was.  It's one thing to say, "If he's denied or granted a motion for a new trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of discretion," but for the appellate court to do that de novo and assess the weight of the evidence, it seems, to me, quite unusual.   "But" --   -- you know, "we certainly was not enough evidence, and, therefore, we trial."

That's an important consequence.    Do you think -- do you think it's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be jurisdictional but an employer couldn't?

By 12   defining the term "air pollutant" comprehensively, 13   Congress has not prejudged what may cause endangerment, 14   but it has allowed other pollutants to be regulated as 15   their harms become appreciated.  It is EPA's 16   interpretation that fails the common sense test.  They 17   have suggested that the term "air pollutant agent" 18   creates an independent test so important that it may 19   prevent some harmful compounds from being regulated 20   without providing any hint of what the term means or how 21   it applies in this case.

He doesn't like to hear that he is wrong.    Maybe it's a simpler argument than this first one we've been wrestling with.    That's fine, but that still does not convert the termination decision into, into a, an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's  ￼23 24 25 sponsor to the administrator.    Sure, you can oversee it and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in the two-step process but the -- but the determination whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   of in what capacity these decisions would be made.  My 2   point in referring to it is simply to say that it is, it 3   is a form over substance argument to say that there is a 4   difference between decision to terminate in which the 5   plan administrator then has a choice of implementing it 6   by either transferring the assets and liabilities to 7   another plan or purchasing an annuity, versus as the 8   Government and as the, I mean as the Petitioner would 9   have it, that that's a completely different transaction 10   from merger as a means of implementing --    And that in the case of a merger the assets are not distributed to the beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan, which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan but the beneficiaries of other plans.    Does it make a commitment, a commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities under the now deceased plan? 10 11 12   The law requires that.  In any plan merger or transfer 13   of assets and liabilities from one plan to the other, 14   the fundamental requirement is that all benefits earned 15   to the date of the transfer must be protected on both 16   sides of the transaction for all participants.    The other side said that 39  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   of appeals that held that the argument was waived.  The 5   court of appeals said that because this was not the district court found that the argument was waived, or the court of appeals did.    Well, I don't think, I just 10   I don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary 11   decision that he has to, once he has found an insurer 12   that is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the 13   benefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look 14   throughout the rest of the world to see if there is 15   anything that might be better for his plan participants. 16   I think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an 17   irrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that 18   insurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home 19   free.  You're saying he is not home free.  He has to 20   consider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully 21   providing all benefit liabilities might be better for 22   the plan participants.  I -- I think that's, that's 23 24 25 placing on him an obligation that I don't see there.    Right.
05-1508 +++$+++     Before you get into the substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill. Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94 legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the prior regulations?    The prior regulations were promulgated when?    My goodness, that's a long time before.    So there's no reason to believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is 12 there?    Indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?    Was this the same Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?    Why, why would the Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula    Counsel, I thought you said 21   expenditures or revenues in the State.  That's what's 22 23 24 25 -- being distributed.    Such revenues or expenditures in the State consist of, the word "such" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the State, and that prior reference in subsection A is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil.

They're for different - Subject to Final Review 1   incentive grant program, or EFIG, provisions that we 2   identified in the briefs and one of them I would 3   acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument, 4   although I don't think it's persuasive.  But it's the 5   other one that I'm focusing on, and what the other one 6   does is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's 7   regulations and so what Congress said in 1994 is that 8   for purposes --    I still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case.    Mr. Srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about.    What I don't understand about the Government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 don't you do for both?

Let me --    Let me ask you the same 13   question I asked -- I asked the Government.  Why don't 14   you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply 15   it to, to 2.A?  You don't even think of doing that in 16 17 18 19   different type of comparison.  And I also note that in 20   2.A it refers to percent instead of percentile, which 21   refers to two numbers being compared.  Percentile refers 22   to an entire ranking of value, so the processes are 23   somewhat different.  Now we're not, I'm not contending 24   that this statute is absolutely clear and a model of 25   draftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th 50 2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but it's the same language in 2.A.
05-1541 +++$+++     In the law, we don't -- we 5  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision 2   of its whole purpose and effect.  And as I understand 3   the purpose of this especially short statute of 4   limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose 5   of the property that it has seized, and to be able to 6   give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you 7   know, many years later and saying this property should 8   not have been taken.  How is that purpose served if 9 10 11 13   pre-deprivation type remedies.  They are the ability of 14   a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to 15   prohibit the Government from either selling property or 16   conducting a levy.  Those are clearly pre-deprivation. 17               The other two are primarily post deprivation 18   remedies.  And so the object that the Government was 19   trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it 20   from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis.  I 21   don't believe that the Government's underlying purpose 22   is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live 23   in harmony.  And without having an exclusivity provision 24   expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346 25   on its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third 6 indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a longer statute?    What if the amount wasn't paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized 10 11 12   by the Government.  Would the 1346 action still lie?  Or 13   is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to 14   satisfy the tax?    I'm helping you.

Isn't that what happened? 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23    So it wasn't remanding for a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence. It made the determination that he had not waived it, and then remanded for investigation into what that mitigating evidence would be.

This case does not involve a 4   conviction under California's car theft statute, which 5   is Penal Code 487(d), which requires an intent to steal. 6   Rather, it involves a conviction under California's 7   Vehicle Code, which covers varied and less serious 8   conduct including liability with or without the intent 9   to steal and also expressly reaching accessories after 10   the fact, which the Government concedes would make it 11   broader than the generic definition of theft. 12               The question is whether a conviction under 13   this statute is a theft offense and therefore an 14   aggravated felony triggering the extremely serious 15   consequences of automatic deportation from the United 16   States, a permanent bar from the United States, and in 17   the sentencing context a sentencing enhancement from 2 18   to 20 years for illegal reentry.

The bottom 22   line issue here, Your Honors, is whether the fact that 23   someone is driving in violation of traffic laws in and 24   of itself can be justification for the use of deadly 25 force.

But I don't know that fairness was the -- was the object of the original right to counsel in the -- in the Bill of Rights, which -- which only applied to -- to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you couldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one.  I hardly think that -- that fairness is the object of that.    When -- when was our first holding to that effect?    In the '30s.  Gee, that's    But until the 1930s that element didn't exist.    Until the 1930s, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.    Well, excuse me.  As far as the Constitution is concerned, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.

So you don't -- you don't agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all it's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.    So he's right that it's ultimately not decided by the Federal court.

And your argument is 10   consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to 11   defendants, in fact -- or more productive of ultimately 12   reliable determinations, in fact.  And that I take it is 13   your basic point. 14               So I think you've answered what for all of 15   us is a problem.  And that is we don't have a clear 16   analytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to 17   consequences, you have got an argument.

And it's -- seems 11   to me odd to call something a "complaint" which is, in 12   fact, an order.  They're not complaining about anything; 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   Justice Scalia.  And it's not a hybrid quality that the 23   industry particularly likes.  But it is the first time 24   that the Government asserts its state -- its claims as to 25   what's wrong, in a binding legally operative document, 51 they're saying, "Pay the money."    You know, usually a complaint, you're -- you make your point, and say, "What do you say? What's your answer?"    And this is an order.  "You're -- boom, "Pay."

And that would prevail over 10 11   this -- 12 13 14 15 16 17   front and says "notwithstanding 2415."  It's its own 18   animal to itself.  And there is a clause at the front of 19   2415 that says "except as otherwise provided by Congress." 20   And so, Congress often takes exceptions.  And when it 21   modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an 22   exception to the 2415 regime.  So, Congress knows how to 23   conduct specialized situations and take things outside of 24   2415 when it needs to.  But it enacted Section 2415 as a 25   catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't 56    -- because it's more --    -- specific.

And if you give 5   deference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself.    Yes.    Depending upon how broadly you  1          Mr. Fisher also suggested that there's a 2   difficulty with numerous district courts deciding these 3   issues as opposed to the FCC.  Well, I would suggest that 4   Congress decided that these kinds of actions can go 5   either to district court or to the FCC.  And in fact, by 6   making damages actions, the scope of damages actions, as 7   opposed to other remedies, co-extensive, did anticipate 8   that there would be that result.

And if they 25   are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the 9 interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.

So if a school 12   district provides a free and inappropriate public 13   education, then it's the parents' obligation -- or not 14   obligation -- they have the choice of whether to 15   supplement the inappropriate public education with 16   additional services, or to replace the public education 17   with one that provides an appropriate bundle of 18 services. 19               So I guess my point is that even in a case 20   where the parents don't necessarily seeks reimbursement, 21   they still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a 22   free appropriate --    F --    And which is the statutory 6 7 8 9 10   18(a)? 11 12   version of the blue brief, Your Honor.  That's the    I thought you said 14.    Are you sure it's not    It's in 18(a) of mine, too. Maybe I have a different brief there.    But then you were denying them, as I understood the argument.

I think it -- I think it much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than that, that Congress would want to make all -- all betting operations like this a violation automatically of two criminal statutes.    I find that sort of, you 4 that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   together, but that isn't a cause for concern.  It just 5   reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal know, very strange.    But even if --    To make the paying off of the winners a separate crime from running the gambling operation seems to me quite extraordinary.    I find that extraordinary. You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing. I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad.    Straighten that out in the definition of the crime, rather than in the --    What continues?  The  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Seventh Circuit has done, is to interpret proceeds in a 2   way that makes no sense for the statute in order to deal 3   with these concerns about promotion cases that can be 4   dealt with in the other ways that Justice Breyer raised. 5   And there are really four --    Of course it is.

This is a Labor Day 20   weekend coming up.  We know you will send the jury out 21   on Friday afternoon.  You're not going to wait too long 22   for that verdict probably.  And everybody is told -- 23   you're going to be out of here by Saturday.  Mr. Yeager, 24   you're going to be out of here by Sunday. 25               So we're talking really about Mr. Brooks 20    When the dean says it's okay, that's all right.    It sounds like the right answer to me.    What does that have to do with anything?    So he broke his promise.  I mean sue him or something, but I don't see how it has anything to do with whether a fair jury was -- was --    And then feigned a mental illness by his -- his great-escape escapade, and that is -- that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to bring before the jury.

It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply.    I don't see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.    Yes.    Right, and the district court at best for you, at best, finds personal  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same 2   call that I made before.  Dismissed for forum non 3   conveniens.    Unless there's something at again, we talked about the policy issues of why the 12   Government came in with the position they did.  They 13   suggested that the United States had a very distinct 14   interest in avoiding delay, burdensome discovery, and 15   difficult legal issues; and frankly, my thought is the 16   same as yours.  Any party has those desires to avoid 17   those issues and come to a ruling in their favor. 18               In this case we would hope that with an 19   adoption of personal jurisdiction first, then the court 20   would be required to rule on our motion to reevaluate 21   forum non conveniens and we might be able to convince 22   the court to be able to pursuit the case here.  In this 23   particular case, that is the goal that we seek because 24   that is, as you say, all we have to do at the end of the 25   game with it. 29  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7   jurisdiction?  And what do you think? 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17    Yes, I agree.    I agree.  So how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result.    I guess we should ask the other side, but I think I know what their answer will be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal 18   Bridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case.  In 19   that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens 20   and the -- I believe it dealt with the country of 21   Mexico.  The parties had obtained a ruling in Mexico 22   saying that the Mexican courts were not to take 23   jurisdiction of the case.  Under those circumstances the 24   court was required to take back the case because it no 25   longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate 30  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the dispute.  So I think that's the one example of the 2 3 4 5 6 7   and actually not on the bills of lading issue.  You did 8   raise that point and there is still the potential of 9   arbitration taking place under the various charter 10   parties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the 11   remaining parties in the action.

My problem is, it's 10   more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing 11   a decision by a court that a particular use of this 12   statute was unconstitutional.  You say it was, the 13   statute was unconstitutional as applied.  That's sloppy 14   language.  It really means that this application of the 15   statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was 16   unconstitutional. 17               I think that's something different from 18   saying that it was an order of the court upon the 19   constitutionality of any provision.

There's nothing in this preamble -- the 11   other side keeps characterizing the preamble, which they 12   don't include in their statutory appendix, as saying, we 13   don't like the employer doing it.  That's not what it 14   says; it's on page 3.    Well, the question of when the contract is done is different from the question of when the money is paid. - Subject to Final Review    He is asking with when the money is paid.    You're not going to go through all of these one by one, are you? 10 11 12 13 14   to have a record.  For example, on the burdens there is 15   an affidavit from an accounting firm submitted by the 16   defendants that says this is really not burdensome at 17 all.    -- shall be used -- shall be used for collective bargaining or for any -- any activities involving unions.

If the employer 19   is allowed to spend the State's money to -- to bargain 20   with nonunion employees and you know medical 21   researchers, whatever, negotiate contracts with them, 22   but the State says you can't do it for collective 23   bargaining, then that is exactly the Livadas case.  That 24   is the case in which the State is saying your 25   entitlement to a State benefit turns on whether you are 49  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   unionized or not.  In this case we'll let the employer 2   do this with nonunion employees, but not with unionized 3   employees.

That's the ICJ determination.  Would this Court 24   have a role in reviewing that judgment?

And we will be a party 15 16   doubt, and I would say that if the treaty purported to 17   give the authority to make binding adujudications of 18   Federal law to any tribunal other than this Court, that 19   it would violate Article III of the Constitution.    Once again, there is a constitutional problem, is there not, if they are automatically enforceable?

They mean it does not automatically become part of United States law.    And it follows from that, that you have to change United States law?

Is there no such thing as  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    Remind me why Section 9 doesn't get you there -- because of the "if" clause.

But ultimately none of this matters, because under 4   section 706(e)(2), the question is whether the system as 5   a whole, which includes the accruable, discriminates on 6   its face, whether it's intentionally discriminatory; and 7   the insight behind that rule was, as I said before with 8   the example of a height discrimination, a rule that 9   discriminates on the basis of height intentionally 10   discriminates on the basis of height every time it's 11   applied.    Go on, finish.  I --    I don't understand why you say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   company.  Now, that doesn't seem to be facially 22   discriminatory at all.    No, but it didn't.  Not -- not during the period for which it is used in -- in the retirement system.    After the new legislation was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority. But -- but during the period before that occurred, it was not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was lawfully not counted towards seniority. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   to the -- to the employees.  I don't see how that is 18   facially discriminatory. So what you have is a retirement plan that says all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work are -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited    You need pretty clear language to persuade me of that.    You mean there are a lot more suits coming behind this one --    There may be still some of those people around.    I mean, you're scaring me. (Laughter.)

But 3   isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?    Is this included in the question presented anyway?    The Second Circuit simply said you could not deprive an individual of the right to a court trial.    And the issue is whether -- 7  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   now, if -- if we held that you can require the 2   individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we 3   could confront the question of whether, if the union is 4   in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the 5   individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal, 6   that would invalidate it. 7               But it has nothing to do with the question 8   presented:  Is an arbitration clause which clearly and 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17    I -- I hate to get into this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the union and -- and the employees.

And the Second Circuit could look into all of these details.    And inquire into the New York law that you're talking about now and that I don't recall being in any of the briefing.

Well, you can have quiet hot dog stands during the daytime. (Laughter.)    But what can't happen with other littoral property is that folks can't come in and lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your house?    And people pay a lot more money for beach -- beachfront homes, for that reason, don't they?    And that's quite different from having a house behind the beach at Coney Island, 13   1 2 3 4 5 6   and the records?  That is, there -- this -- what is 7   referred to as “the foreshore,” was that wet all the 8   time?

Nobody -- nobody thought it ￼10 11 12 13 14 15   other people along -- along the same coast?

The governor is going to ￼10   the time.  And I think there's -- there's no evidence 11   to suggest that Congress was not acting reasonably in 12   understanding this as a significant problem.  And --    I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed with -- with the argument --    I mean, this -- this is a recipe for the Federal Government taking over everything.

Or is it 20 years before ￼13 14 15 16   of the case.  There’s no reason to look beyond that to 17   broader purposes.  But if one does look to the purpose 18   of SORNA and what Congress had in mind, the interstate 19   travel requirement and attaching that the travel took 20   place after SORNA was enacted is what Congress wanted 21   to do.  It accomplishes the purpose.  Congress wrote 22   SORNA because it was concerned that there was divergent 23   approach to registrations that were taken by -- by States, 24   that they had inconsistent applications of registration 25   programs.  This was creating loopholes that allowed sex 12 necessarily, the travel took place after SORNA was enacted. And I think the statutory language disposes   1   offenders who were unregistered not to register, and the 2   congressional response to that was to create a uniform 3   universal system of registration that it hoped all the 4   States would enact that would facilitate exchange of 5   information between the States and with the Federal 6   Government. 7               And the purpose of the SORNA criminal 8   provision in that context is that it was designed to 9   discourage people from traveling, unregistered sex 10   offenders from traveling, after SORNA was enacted to 11   evade the new SORNA registration requirements.  For 12   that purpose, travel before SORNA is immaterial.  It’s 13   travel after SORNA is enacted that -- that brings into 14   effect the congressional purpose that they were trying 15   to accomplish.  Congress wanted to keep out of the 16   channels of interstate commerce unregistered sex 17   offenders who were trying to evade the SORNA 18   requirements.  That’s necessarily prospective. 19               As to people who were unregistered sex 20   offenders who either had never traveled in interstate 21   commerce at all or who had traveled before SORNA was 22   enacted, they are identically situated for SORNA's 23   purposes. They are outside the system.  They are not 24   registered.  No one knows where they are.  They are not 25   attempting to evade SORNA at that point.  They are 13 ￼ conviction, SORNA takes effect, interstate travel, failure to register.  1   subject to prosecution, not by the Federal Government, 2   but by the States under the new, more punitive regime 3   of criminal punishments that Congress tried to induce the 4   States to enact as part of the States’ --    Perhaps Congress --    But I was interested in the second, which mentioned other provisions in this -- in this very statute that -- that use the present tense.    You have to change the language "is required to register" to "has committed  ￼10 a" -- 11 12 13 14   to -- you don't have to do that.  I guess my problem 15   with your argument -- you say, "is required to register 16   under SORNA."  But you can be required to register under 17   SORNA before SORNA is enacted to the extent that SORNA 18   is retroactive.  You ask someone:  Why are you 19   registering?

If It has used it in other cases, but I think --    Is the right to trial by jury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?

It is either there or it is not there. And if it's there, it doesn't seem to me to 34  1   read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the 2   Second Amendment, whether you’d want to label it 3   fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers 4   in their view of what liberty meant.    That may be --    That may be the reason it   1   make any difference why they chose to put that one there 2   as opposed to other ones that they didn't put there. 3   It's either there or not.

But today --    And to say that that wasn't the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about what it consists of.    Then so --    -- even if you assume that the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to the State's depriving the people of arms. now.     You’re switching horses    Let's just focus on your argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue. 19 does.    Eleven of the colonies had a guarantee at the time the Constitution was adopted, and I believe something like 44 States currently have in their constitutions protection of the right to bear arms.    Does that suggest anything about -- about how fundamental it is generally?    "Subject to such regulation" certainly excludes banning them entirely, which is what you assert can be done.    What's the purpose of a State constitutional guarantee which has at the end of 50  1   it "subject to such regulation as the legislature may 2   proscribe," if that regulation includes banning it 3   entirely?  That -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   so -- 24 25  ￼4 5 6 7 8 9    -- would make a nullity of the constitutional requirement.

See, the right to keep and   1   firearms that responds to local conditions, to local 2   threats of violence, and so on that occur.  And I don't 3   see any reason to think that there will be a 4   jurisdiction that would try to sufficiently ban firearms 5   that people wouldn't have a reasonable means of 6   self-defense.

It's up 4   to the Spanish government to assert that that suit 5   should not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly 6 okay?    There were a lot of long sentences in there -- (Laughter.)
08-1569 +++$+++     Well wait.  There’s -- there’s some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part  4 5 6 7   well.  To the extent a statute is going to direct a     So that makes (A) the same   1   that they -- that the elements in the principal 2   paragraph of (A) are.  The point I’m -- the point I'm 3   trying to make is that, with respect to firearm type, 4   which is at issue here, is that the firearm type 5   provisions are introduced by specific language that 6   says -- that tells the reader these are relevant to a 7   person convicted of a violation; these are not relevant 8   to whether --    Yes.  entire statute, even if it's not being used in the most precise sense, in the sense that a violation of this subsection appears in subparagraph (C), it appears in subparagraph (D), which is not --    I guess I agree with you that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an element, too.    The guidelines -- do you think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that would be upheld?    Do you think it would be upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?    And if it mentions nothing      That's right.  That’s --    That's her question.    I’ll amend what I said. 16 thing makes sense.    I got it.    It's also on 3a of the government's brief.    Right.    Right.    It says “in addition to” at 15   for by such crime of violence, be sentenced to” 5 16   years, 7 years, 10 years.  And then if the 17   firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since 18   your -- I assume that that introductory language "in 19   addition to the punishment provided for" is implicit in 20   (B).  It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit 21 in (B).    We have tall lawyers today. What is this, tall lawyer day? (Laughter.)
08-192 +++$+++     I don't understand what
08-205 +++$+++     So that can't be the justification --    -- because if it were, the statute would be vastly overbroad.    Yet this law freezes all of    Oh, he wants to put up a    I don't understand that 10   answer.  I mean, if that's what you were concerned 11   about, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could 12   have said all corporations that have a net worth of more 13   than, you know, so much or whatever.  That is not what 14   Congress did.  It said all corporations.
08-214 +++$+++     And punitive damages, of course, requires that you first find the guilty person 12 13 14 15 16   there.  And what I was trying to answer the question is 17   if someone does abuse the litigation process, that is 18   what Vaughan v. Atkinson addressed.  And it -- it 19   awarded attorneys' fees, which -- which are unusual.  It 20   is an exception to the American rule.  And it is a 21 22 23 24 25 deterrent for anyone to try to play fast and loose with --    We've got to call it something else, don't we?    Excuse me, that the maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the punitive damages claim could be made?
08-240 +++$+++     Now, wait, wait --    I thought you said there is a termination by the company if it fails to provide one of the three basic elements, right? Scalia.    Yes or no?     And there has still been a termination?    You're saying you can terminate a third of the contract?     And they are not contingent on each other, so that at any time the company could terminate one of them and stick the station owner with the other two?    Not continues to be.  You must continue to be.    That sounds like a very strange way to write the contract.    Do you really think that that's how those contracts should be interpreted? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   the relationship of the parties.  The contract's over. 18   You no longer have the right.  Fuel will not be coming. 19   You may not use our trademark, or you may no longer use 20   our premises.     Why isn't that constructive termination?    I mean, the conduct is you stopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me.    Well, I don't understand what your number two consists of unless it consists of an act that the other side would call constructive -- or the government would call constructive termination.    Yes. 19  ￼ 22 23 24 25    I think there’s always an unclear line between those two.    Why isn't the contract claim alone enough?  1   supposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a 2   reasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he 3   has a contract claim, right?  And then at that magical    "In the context of termination" is what the statute says.    What background principles 23   eviction.  But --    What do you do about the claim of -- of the -- the Petitioners that only one of the three contracts has been terminated?  1   termination.  And that is how the law operates in every 2   other area in which this doctrine applies.  So if a 3   civil rights plaintiff claims discrimination on the 4   basis of race or gender, she cannot stay in her job and 5   at the same time claim that she was fired.  I mean ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16   And that's how the Act defines franchise.  It defines it 17   by all three elements of the franchise, and so if one of 18   them is terminated, that is a termination.    The other two continue -- continue in effect?

The key is 25   to measure the progress that has, in fact, been made and 8    I assume it's -- 10 11 12 13 14 15   whole State.  It seems to me you could comply with the 16   State Constitution.

It said it ten times to the fact that the 22   original judgment was on appeal, and then it simply did 23   not pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a 24   statewide funding remedy in light of the fact that we 25   can now look at what has happened in Nogales.

They have chosen 2   to tax vessels and, as I said, not all vessels.    You are going to get a 19 20 21 22   oil and gas property.  That is something of tremendous 23   fiscal importance to the State of Alaska.  I think that 24   there is little practical risk that the State is going 25   to assign the right to tax that property. 6 it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.    Do you think it would be    It's only discrimination that counts?    Right.  How many days it remains in port.    Which means, the argument could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use 10 11   of the port.  And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause 12   was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New 13   York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing 14   taxes on ships that bring in goods.    But you don't think a daily -- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port violates the Tonnage Clause?    Not felt by the other States, felt by the consumers in other States. Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil. 23 24 25 don't want to -- to leave behind -- the Court had questioned on the Tonnage Clause.    It's a neat tax, you know, get somebody else to pay your taxes.

Congress did not 25   assume that section 5 was necessary.  It took a very 51    Thirty-three members of the House and nobody in the Senate.    Wasn't Virginia the first State in the Union to elect a black governor.    And it has a black chief justice of the supreme court currently.

But -- I -- since they defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can –- can they possibly have any claim left with regard to an interim hearing?

It doesn't have to do anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.     But you say if it -- you don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you -- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a 20 21   answer to a very different case.  It's a case where 22   you have a class action of people whose cases fell 23   through the cracks and never got the procedures they 24   were entitled to.  It doesn't seem at all responsive to 25   the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it 15    Ten years?    Ten years?

In 7   Geraghty --  1   the merits and the denial of the class certification –- 2   were still active before the Court.  Here you didn't appeal the dismissal of the class certification or the mootness of it.    As it turns out it -- it wouldn't have been gratuitous. (Laughter.)    Okay, you want –-     Why -- why -- to -- to have an as-applied challenge, regardless of whether the Illinois law provides a -- a remedy, wouldn't you be able to individually assert under section 1983 unconstitutional action?

The mootness was not a result of any settlement between the city and --    I don't understand.    They got all of their property back?    No, I don't understand. They got their cars back, right?    But we don't do Munsingwear orders where -- where the mootness is a result of a settlement.    A settlement?    So you have at least one case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement.

Did he say    Could I come back to your distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search. What would you require before you would allow a cavity 16 17 18 19   trained to do that, Your Honor.  I would submit that if 20   a child has something stuffed up one of their cavities 21   -- and I assume we mean private parts, the very private 22   parts -- that the first thing to do would be to send 23   them to the hospital.  I mean, we just don't have that 24   clinical training.    No cavity search in school, no matter what?    I assume a school can 18   assign a student to study hall.

They could do that, couldn't they?     Well, let's talk about 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   responsibilities.  And I have two points on that. 23               One is there’s nothing in here that gives 24   the SEC the power to assume the responsibility.  It 25   simply says the board need not comply with that    Don't -- don't you think that's what it means, though, realistically?    When you no longer have responsibility to perform a government -- governmental act, you no longer have authority to perform it.    "For cause" doesn't mean for failure to obey the President's instructions, does it?    That's why it's called an 19    I’d love to say that. That would be wonderful.    Thank you. 22  5 6 7 8 9 tell the SEC whom to appoint to the board. And in terms of the question that Justice Scalia asked earlier, I don't think it's a statutory principle that you pretend --     I don't understand that. It's okay for them to appoint principal officers, but not inferior officers?    Oh.  Oh, I see.    I wish you had said that. You really had me scared there. (Laughter.)    You’re saying they are not inferior officers and also not principal officers, but merely employees?    And who appoints -- who appoints the inferior officers at the -- at the SEC?    All those appointments are presumably invalid.    That would be a shame.    I -- when I was OLC, I would -- I advised the President, you can't interfere with -- I think, if the President called up the FCC and said, I want you to rule this way, I want this kind of a rule from the FCC, I think there would be an impeachment motion in Congress.    Congress set up that agency 22 23 24 25   that.  That is what Humphrey's Executor upheld, but this whole purpose of it, wasn't it?    But what does the Treasury Department tell the SEC to do?

And I really want to deal with that. 3               This notion that they could pass rules to 4   govern the investigative activities of the board is a 5   myth.  The attorney general in Morrison had the ability 6   to promulgate rules for prosecution, but he couldn't 7   tell Alexia Morrison how to proceed in that individual 8   case.  He couldn't say:  Anything she does with respect 9   to Mr. Olsen, I need to pre-approve. 10               Why?  Because the independent counsel, under 11   that statute, had the prosecutorial authority.  Under 12   this statute, the board has the prosecutorial authority, 13   and everyone knows you can't govern the kind of manifold 14   decisions that prosecutors need to make through some 15   kind of bulky notice-and-comment rulemaking.  And that ￼16 17 18 19   exercise the powers they have, removal and the like.  We 20   don't assume that they exercise powers that they don't 21   have simply because they can theoretically get it.  What is why it is utterly mythical to pretend that they have this power. Justice Scalia, we assume that people  1 –- 2 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 don't create fictional realities which allow severe usurpations of executive authority on the basis of fictional --

That's quite different from a motivating factor in the decision.

If that's so for the employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have been decreed?  Why don't they change every year?    Okay.  So, then my reading makes perfect sense.    You don't really have to establish that, do you?  All you have to establish is that it is -- there is no way in which "newly awarded compensation" means entitlement to compensation.  That's all you have to establish.    You don't have to show that it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never used to mean entitlement to compensation.

Isn't there a group left 16   out of this thing, even under -- even under the 17   Government's interpretation of it?  What happens to 18   people who are receiving compensation for temporary 19   total disability or for partial disability?  They 20   don't -- they don't come under either one of those two 21   categories, even under the Government's interpretation, 22 right? 23 24 25    Oh, that's right, but 10   they -- 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   sense? 18 19 20   say the statute doesn't make sense.

What do you respond to the point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also  ￼ 1   convoluted than that.  It is that because domicile, 2   lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean 3   the ability to form a lawful intent to remain 4   permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit 5   said you could only form such an intent if you are a 6   lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the 7   Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR 8   status from parent to child. 9               I think the more straightforward way to read 10   the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the 11   intent to remain permanently in the United States from 12   parent to child, based in part on the parents' 13   establishment of a domicile, and based on the common law 14   rule that the child's domicile follows that of his 15 parents.

I could not, Justice Scalia, sue 13   the FDA for accepting the use code, at least based on 14   existing law, because the FDA's position is that their 15   role with respect to patents is purely ministerial. 16   That has been upheld for about a decade now, including 17   multiple courts of appeals, the Federal Circuit, and the 18   D.C.

Mr. Waxman, if you don't want to be interrupted, you have to pause between sentences. (Laughter.)   I understand. That's right.  You've given a -- you know, an appealing example of a small county that has one -- one hospital, and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital. Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be pursuing a situation in which there is a natural monopoly. It's a question of whether the monopoly would be owned by the State or not. But your argument, if we follow it, embraces a quite different situation, a very large county which has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as some hospitals do. And what you're saying is that this operation can take over all of those hospitals and eliminate all of that competition. Isn't that so?   Yes.

And that's because Section 502(a)(3) 17   itself does not allow for a plan, like Petitioner, to 18   obtain a general right to equitable relief.  All that 19   the Petitioner can -- can seek here is equitable -- 20   appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of its 21   plan. 22 23 24 25 51 And so, in the absence of an expressed provision, like a subrogation clause, it would not be entitled to pursue a -- a general right to subrogation.

11-1351 +++$+++     But why -- why did they feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort victims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act?    I mean -- you know, injured tort victims are injured tort victims.  It does seem -- you know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance, Congress would be concerned and, the other, not  ￼ 1   problem of medical malpractice.  12 years later, when 2   they got around to the Westfall Act, they weren't 3   looking at medical malpractice. 4               They were looking, generally, at a whole -- 5   the whole problem of government employees being sued 6   after this Court's decision in the Westfall case, a 7   problem that particularly affected, actually, lower 8   level government employees who were -- it's clear, 9   couldn't take advantage of the discretionary function 10   exception. 11               And, when they are looking at the broad 12   universe of employees, they took a different approach 13   and decided, well, we're just going to -- some people 14   are just going to be out of luck because this is the -- 15   the determination that Congress made -- felt was 16   appropriate there. 17               But, when it was looking at the specific 18   problem of medical malpractice in the Gonzalez Act, it 19   definitely took the position, as everybody said at the 20   time and as the structure of the Act itself showed, that 21   they wanted to preserve remedies.  And there are two 22   provisions in the Westfall Act that make that clear --    What was that case, where no action against the United States is available?    Not -- not by reason of the -- of the battery?    I understand.    Yes, yes.    I see.    It -- it --    It's right on the same 23  ￼ 1   thing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am 2   strengthening you -- your last point -- that provision 3   ends, "if the circumstances are such as are likely to 4   preclude the remedies of third persons against the 5   United States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28." 6               That clearly envisions that, in the ordinary 7   case, those remedies against the United States would not 8   be precluded.

11-1447 +++$+++     Isn't this unreal?  I mean, you are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the agency says, if you do X, you get the permit.  And X is -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition. Okay.  He refuses to do X.  The permit is denied with a general statement like this:  The permit is denied because he has refused to do the -- the necessary mitigation. Isn't it clear that the reason he's refused to do the necessary mitigation, is he has refused the last demand of the agency?

11-1545 +++$+++     Well, don't, because I don't -- I don't think it's so clear. (Laughter.)    Look, what you've told us    Chevron Step Zero jurisdiction.  That doesn't clarify things very much for me.  What if -- what if the statute in this case said, the FCC shall have no jurisdiction to establish time limits within which the States must act? 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   be --    Okay?  Would that be a jurisdictional question?    That's -- that's no different from our holding in any case that the agency has no authority to issue this rule.  It has rule-making 13   ￼ 1   authority, but this rule goes too far, which is to say 2   Congress did not give the agency authority to go this 3 far.    Did -- did it say, in all of those cases, we give no deference to the agency's contrary determination because this is a jurisdictional question?  Did it say anything like that?    I didn't think so.    Very -- very often, I could decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running away from the question of deference vel non because things have been so confused by Meade.  So they simply 16   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 decide the question assuming no deference to the agency. That doesn't prove that, in that particular case, the agency wouldn't have been entitled to deference.    Whether it was or not, it would have come out this way.  So those three cases don't -- don't prove what you say they prove.     And that's all you think that Skidmore deference means?  You will listen to opinions that make sense, right?    But just to agency opinions, it makes sense, not to --

I think you could say that. 20               And the reason is, as I indicated, it's 21   something that happens even without this law that, when 22   you arrest somebody -- and there are some offenses that 23   are -- you can arrest and release under state law, but 24   before you release the individual, you generally want to 25   ascertain that that individual is going to show up at 14    So, you'll concede that the -- that the state has to accept within its borders all people who have no right to be there, that the Federal government has no interest in removing?

There is a commitment to -- what they're 7   trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if 8   it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the 9   future.  That's a commitment.    Well, but there is a 20 21 22 23   second distinction.  So, that's one.  But the second is 24   that -- remember, there is a purchase in your that can be binding in any way that they will prescribe a drug for anyone. And remember, there is the second -- the 25   hypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing  13 ￼ 14 1   store.  But the second part of the Secretary's guidance 2   is that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription, 3   they're not exchanging anything with the drug company. 4   There -- nothing is acquired from the drug company. 5   That is a very significant difference.    Pick one.    Is it the transfer of title or a commitment?    Ah.  Okay.    It's a finding of logic, for Pete's sake.  These are prescriptions.  You can only get a prescription from a doctor.  Obviously, the number of prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of prescriptions given by doctors.    That's a different point.

I hope that in your earlier 16   colloquy with Justice Kennedy, you -- you were not 17   retreating from what our cases have repeatedly said, 18   that there is no First Amendment value in falsehood.    I suppose that even in the commercial context we allow a decent amount of lying, don't we?  It's called "puffing."

11-393 +++$+++     Yes, they sure do.    That's true, but is it    Excuse me.  Why do you say -- I didn't follow that.  Why?    Is there any dictionary that gives that --    How do we know that?  When people speak, I assume they're speaking English.    -- that definition of "essential"?  It's very imaginative. 10 11 12 13   dictionary. 14   ￼ 1   talking about the interstate -- you know, (B) is headed 2   "Effects on the national economy and interstate 3   commerce."  So, we know the context that Congress is 4   talking about.  It is more or less quoting from the 5   Court's Commerce Clause statement. 6               But if one looks at the very preceding 7   finding, which is Finding (H), which is on 42 over onto 8   43, Congress at that point also uses the word 9   "essential."  In the second sentence, it says this 10   requirement -- and again, we're talking about the 11   minimum coverage provision -- "is an essential part of 12   this larger regulation of economic activity," which is, 13   by the way, an exact quote from Lopez, in which "the 14   absence of the requirement would undercut Federal 15   regulation," also an exact quote from Lopez. 16               But what it's referring to is essential -- 17   an essential part of ERISA, the National Health Service 18   Act, and the Affordable Care Act.  It can't possibly be, 19   even the plaintiffs haven't argued, that those acts 20   would all fall in their entirety if you took out the 21   minimum coverage provision. 22               And as a second example of the same usage by 23   Congress, the statute that was before the Court in 24   Raich, section 801 of Title 21, the Court said that the 25   regulation of intrastate drug activity, drug traffic, 66  ￼ 1   was essential to the regulation of interstate drug 2   activity.  Again, it is simply not conceivable that 3   Congress was saying one is so indispensable to the 4   other, the way the United States uses the term here, so 5   indispensable that if we can't regulate the intrastate 6   traffic, we don't want to regulate the interstate 7   traffic, either.  The whole law criminalizing drug 8   traffic would fall. 9               So, I think once you look at the finding for 10   what I believe it says, which is we believe this is a 11   useful part of our regulatory scheme, which the Congress 12   would think in its own approach would be sufficient --    Why put -- why put Congress to that false choice?

But you also say that these monitors are so situated that it is impossible to tell from the monitor who is responsible 11  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 for the pollution; is that right?    So whose fault is that?     Okay.    Oh, I understood that.    Can you put in the permit stuff that the statute does not require?  ￼ 1     of that same river. 2                 Because the monitoring stations at issue are 3     actually located within the rivers themselves, the court 4     of appeals erred in concluding that a discharge of 5     pollutants occurred when, quote, "the still-polluted 6     stormwater flowed out of the concrete channels where the 7     monitoring stations are located, through an outfall and 8     into the navigable waterways." 9                 And because the court of appeals rested its 10     liability determination on that erroneous premise, the 11     judgment should be vacated and the case remanded to the 12     court of appeals.    Did we use our usual language, and did it go back, and the -- and the court of appeals considered --    -- considered the issue we had refused to consider?    Okay.

What is different about Strickland that it enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing to any principle of law? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   rule? 21 22 23 24 25    The only new law is not a new pronouncement which nobody had ever thought of before, but only a pronouncement that rests upon an evolution of mores; is that it?    That's what I thought you    Well, I think it's an easy question to answer.    That's fair.  That's fair. The dissenters ought to reconsider, you're saying.

They are -- they are entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V. Is everything that -- that comes into Texas in the main channel of the Red River water from Reach V?    What --    Reach I.  Okay.     I -- I don't understand what you just said, "They're riparian States, so they don't track diversions."    Why does that follow?    Okay.

12-123 +++$+++     I assume this is one of those difficult merits questions you were alluding to, it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the partnership in question, isn't it?    I don't -- I don't see how it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question before us. 10 11 12 13   owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins.  What 14   exactly is being taken from the handlers?  Is it the    Well, some of the raisins were their own.  Some of the raisins were their own.    At least as to that, that wouldn't be true, right?    Why?  Why -- why does it withdraw for the one and not the other?    No, I don't mean the Page 18 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 19 1 Sections 14(a) and 15(a) of the AMAA. I don't think 2   that's in dispute.  So only producers are -- are 3   regulated by this program.  Only producers have a right 4   to go through their remedies in the Department of 5   Agriculture. 6 7 8 9 Only producers have to do that.  It's -- it's a -- it's completely a producer --    What was the first?  I 5 6 7 8 9   jurisdictional?    What -- what isn't

12-133 +++$+++    You -- you -- I don't 16 17 in front of 18 19 understand. 20 that -- on that issue?   Let me ask you. Your effective vindicability principle depends upon a comparison with what you could do in Court.   It doesn't?   Yes, but if you couldn't do it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration agreement be -- be harming you? I don't understand that.   Or in court.   Suppose this class could not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal court. Are you asserting that there is some arbitration principle that -- that allows you to create some new class?   So you have to make -- you have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal court, don't you?   It isn't. So that any class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required.   But he wants a class. What 39  ￼ 1 he wants in the arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf 2 of a class, doesn't he?   -- this is a very procedure.   You should have said, "I accept," very quickly. (Laughter.)   What -- what are the arbitration fees? It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees. Do they include lawyers' fees?   Okay. So I don't know, --   So what are you comparing  ￼it to in court litigation?   A filing fee?   That's what I thought the question before us.

12-207 +++$+++     That proves absolutely    I know. (Laughter.)    Mr. Shanmugam, I -- I wouldn't have made the concession that you've made, that this case is about reasonable expectation of privacy. If there's no reasonable expectation of privacy, there's no search. But, here, there is a search.  You have a physical intrusion.  You -- you pull a guy's cheek apart and stick a -- a swab into his mouth.  That's a search, reasonable expectation of privacy or not.    Well, I thought you did.    He gave us one and two.  I have been waiting for three.  Will you drop the shoe? (Laughter.)    Yes, but, if we believe 60  ￼ 1   that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's 2   legitimate or not, you can't demonstrate that the -- 3   that the purpose is immediate identification of the 4   people coming into custody, you just can't demonstrate 5   that now.  Maybe you can in 2 years. 6               The purpose now is -- is the purpose you 7   began your presentation with, to catch the bad guys, 8   which is a good thing.  But -- you know, the Fourth 9   Amendment sometimes stands in the way.
12-236 +++$+++     Well --    Okay.  That's just repeating your -- your first argument.    Wait, so --    Other than the judgment. Page 13 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 14 1   at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys' 2   fees looks to the end of the case and not to the 3   beginning.  It looks to the judgment.  And if it's a 4 5 6 7 8 9 judgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply with the statute, it's still a judgment.    That's your first argument. I understand. 10 11 12 13 14 15   wanted to withhold attorneys' fees.  The canons of 16   construction here all caution the Court to be -- to be 17   extremely reluctant to extend or -- or find that 18   Congress is willing to pays attorneys' fees in -- in 19   this context.  And that's for -- and that's for several 20   reasons.

12-307 +++$+++    Well, it's just -- all these statutes use the term "marriage," and the Federal government says in all of these statutes when it says marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the State acknowledges them to be married or not.   Does it -- does it create a federalism problem?   Yes.   Well, it's not doing that, it's just saying for purposes -- just what it's doing here. It says, for purposes of all these Federal statutes, when we say marriage, we mean -- instead of saying we mean heterosexual marriage, we mean, whenever we use it, heterosexual and homosexual marriage. 98  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 If that's what it says, can it do that?   Nine. And -- and so there has been this sea change between now and 1996.

12-416 +++$+++     Why -- why are payments not 3   ￼ 1   to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market? 2   I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging 3   the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to 4   allow the person challenging the patent to have 5   exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular 6 area. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Does that violate the antitrust laws?    That -- that doesn't impress me.  What else?  What's your second point? (Laughter.)    In order to make money.  I 4  ￼ 1   mean, that's -- that's what it wants is money.    This -- this was not a problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?
12-418 +++$+++     That would be an execution of a Federal power --    -- the power -- the power to prevent that crime and to punish it.    Yes.    So it's just by a preponderance of the evidence we think this guy probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime.    So just -- just more -- more likely than not is the test.    I find that difficult to believe that --    -- that whether it's ex post facto and impermissible or not is simply eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling it civil.    I'm talking about the -- ex post facto.    Because it's civil. to grasp.    I -- I find that difficult    But how does protecting the public at large from people who have committed a crime in the armed forces, how does that have anything to do with regulating the armed forces?    That's part of his ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 54 1 it's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just 2   that there's no per se rule that says it can't.  The 3   Court would --

12-547 +++$+++     200 years -- 200 years? Did you say that?    I -- I would have thought your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have thought your first response to -- to the question would have been to deny that you say it's clear because the supreme court of Michigan has said so.  I thought your argument is it's clear because it's clear.    It should have been your first point.  The premise is simply wrong.  You're saying it was clear because the statute's clear.    You -- you rely on Reese as establishing the principle that you cannot supplement the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    I assume you'd need a case in which the prosecutor was pretty -- pretty clear that a diminished capacity defense would prevail.  Otherwise, it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel,  ￼ 1 where the court finally says, is it part of the statute, 2 and it says no.
