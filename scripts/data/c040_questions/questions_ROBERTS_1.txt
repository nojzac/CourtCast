04-1067 +++$+++     Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT    What about the telephone call between a husband and wife, and the wife tells the police, "Listen in on this call"? She's consented to the monitoring of the conversation, the husband has not.  Maybe he even begins the call by saying, "I -- don't let anybody else listen to this." It's clear that that is admissible, isn't it?    Well, that --    -- begs the question -- it begs the question to say "it's a distinct individual right to privacy."  It's a little academic to talk about his individual right to privacy when 33  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 -- ￼1 he's sharing the home with someone else.

Why is it -- why do you not compromise the 3 expectation to the extent of giving the other person 4 the right to consent?    Reasonably, the person realizes he would be outvoted?    So, it does go to his presumably objectively reasonable views of what nature of privacy he has.    So, if he thinks, "Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife.  I think she's going to consent and let the police in if I'm not" -- then his objection shouldn't control?

So, we have to agree 54  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 with you, though, that our Treaty partners in this area 2 have, sort of, a zero-tolerance approach to enforcing the 3 Treaty.

Well, doesn’t it seem odd -- and this is sort of the logic of -- in Fausto and some of the other cases -- that when you have a major action, you have to exhaust before you can go into court, but if you have something that doesn’t qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to 7 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- court right away?    Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, you have a -- a statutory claim that essentially mirrors the constitutional claim.  The statute requires the testing to be random and impartial.  If we think there’s a difference between the constitutional claims and statutory claims with respect to their treatment under the CSRA, how do you handle that?  Does he have to exhaust the statutory claim but not the constitutional one?    I still don’t understand how they proceed.  Does he have to bring -- can he go right into court on the constitutional claim even if the statutory claim has to go through the grievance procedure?

The Federal Circuit's vacatur of summary please the Court: This case concerns a very broadly worded patent claim, claim 4 of the Engelgau patent, that the Solicitor General and the United States Patent and Trademark Office have both told this Court is invalid under Section 103 of the Patent Act and was issued in 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   district courts are  vested with authority and this 25   Court is vested with authority to render a judgment of judgment in this case is grounded in a judicially devised test that is fundamentally inconsistent with --    You don't have a  ￼1   of motivation to devise something. - Subject to Final Review 2 3   sense.    Thank you,  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the Court will want to have available to it the red brief and also this big, which is the supplemental joint appendix which has some of the patents in it, and I'm going to quote from both of them. I think you can't understand what motivation means and what the whole test that the Federal Circuit is employing means --    Well, which way does  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   get them granted.  And the more you narrow the 2 3 4 5   the point of these bar associations' either.  These bar 6   associations, including the American Bar Association, 7   the American Intellectual Property Law Association, have 8   lawyers on both sides of all these cases.  They're 9   looking for a test that has balance and that is what the 10   Federal Circuit has done.  Now, let me just say --    Where in claim 4 do you say it's putting it together in a particular way?    Right, page 8.    Who do you get to be an expert to tell you something's not obvious.    I mean, the least insightful person you can find? (Laughter.) 49    Well, that's because the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, on prior art, as opposed. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   not correct.  Even under a capability standard, even 17   under an extraordinary innovation standard, you are 18   going to compare something to prior art.  You're going 19   to take what exists now and compare it to what existed 20   before, no matter what standard you're employing.  And 21   what they did is they compared it to the prior art, 22   which is Asano, and the Federal Circuit said, all right, 23   you want to say it will come from Asano.  It would not 24   come from Asano for either of two reasons. 25               The first is you would never use Asano. 51 To I would say common sense.  And so they say we have to find something in prior art to show that this was non -- that this was obvious.    And just -- what makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving    But just to follow up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic control on a part of the car that doesn't move?

The Arkansas law can go 4 beyond -- just looking at the assignment provision, 5 beyond what the Federal law requires you do as a 6 condition of participation in Medicaid. Correct?    Okay.  So if we read the Medicaid statute to require something less than what your position is here, then you lose.    Okay.

This is an as-applied challenge and now you're telling us that it's already been decided.  It's a classic bait and switch.

Does "delay" -- your -- isn't that something that's neither within "loss" or "miscarriage"?    But I guess -- I -- following up on Justice Stevens' question, your theory with respect to negligent transmission is that the Postal Service should be liable in the same way that private parties are.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER    You concede, though, don't you, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the 3  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 conduct here?    Well, you have a person who's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price that they offer to different purchasers.  Now, I know your argument about the structure, but the actual language does seem to encompass the activity.   Well, just to --   -- get to your first point, the statute talks about discrimination in price between different purchasers, and not different actual purchases.    It doesn't seem it's that much of a stretch to cover would-be purchasers, potential purchasers.   I understand --    I understand your argument that there's no injury or impact in competition for resale of the trucks.  What's wrong with looking at the statute as being concerned to protect competition to be the Volvo dealer?  In other words, you know, they're competing -- if Volvo's restructuring its approach, they're competing to be the favored dealer, even though they don't compete with other Volvo dealers directly.    Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT   I thought the Volvo policy had two dealers competing for the same sale, they 9 gave the same discount to each dealer.   But that was for a resale to for resale to different purchasers.   Nobody's buying two --   -- nobody's buying two two different purchasers.    Mr. Phillips, when you lose   If I may.

It's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a bigger discount.   Well, sure, but, I mean, that's -- I mean, long term -- of course, Volvo can terminate you, as a dealer, tomorrow. And -- --   Well --   -- well, what -- but it -- under the Robinson-Patman Act, it can.   -- case that the Robinson-Patman because they're Act is directed to is when you lose sales giving bigger discounts to other sellers.

But Volvo's interest may be in as -- making as much money off of sales this year, and they may not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller, are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.   Oh, no, you just go back and 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody look again, else was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten the bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to be a dealer for a longer time.

So you --    It said that your alibi defense, that had been rejected by the prior jury, was relevant under the eighth amendment.    Okay.    That --    -- that brings up a question I have.  Particularly under the resentencing provision, it looks like the sentencing trial is going to be just a rerun of the guilt trial, because your main evidence that you want to put in is alibi evidence, "I didn't do it."  So, you're going to say, "Here's" -- the mother is going to say, "I -- he was at 43 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 home." And then, presumably, the State gets to put on 2 all of its witnesses, saying, "No, here are the people 3 who saw him do it," and blah, blah, blah. And so, it's 4 just the same trial all over again. 5 6 different 7 -- 8 9 10 11 know, that's the whole problem here.

And you -- and you want to retain the right to put in whatever evidence is relevant on those questions.    Well, then what was all the discussion about the mother's having -- then, when you go back, you can put on anything, whether it was presented before, or not, right?  Because the eighth amendment requires that, according to the Oregon Supreme Court.    Okay.

The fact 12   that the intent was formed outside the limitations 13   period doesn't make the present payment of a 14   disparate wage because of sex any less intentionally 15   discriminatory.  But the difference in the 16   conceptions, which frankly isn't answered by the 17   plain text of this statute itself, should be resolved 18   in light of the practical consequences of the 19   differences in the rules. 20              The Solicitor General acknowledges that a 21   paycheck accrual rule applies at least in a case of a 22   policy of discrimination, but that's a very difficult 23   rule to administer for the EEOC, which must make a 24   determination of timeliness before it even has 25   authority to investigate a claim.

05-1120 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus 6 7 8 9 10 11   quickly and then turn immediately to standing.  Although 12   the case before you arises in an important policy area, 13   it turns on ordinary principles of statutory 14   interpretation and administrative law.  EPA made a 15   decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute 16   plain errors of law reviewable under any standard. 17   EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority 18   over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even 19   if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. 20   That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law. 21               As a fallback position, EPA declined to 22   consider if these substances are endangering public 23   health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made 24   more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in 25   section 1202 of the Clean Air Act.  Although EPA 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R.

Or, aren't you limited to 5   the specific legal challenge you're raising here?    Same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?    How is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed? 10 11 12 13 14 15   shown.  The injury doesn't get any more particular than 16   states losing 200 miles of coastline, both sovereign 17   territory and property we actually own, to rising seas.

That's not all they  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that time.  And EPA has a lot of discretion in 2   evaluating that, that uncertainty. 3               And if the EPA determined that the level of 4   uncertainty was such that it was not reasonable to 5   anticipate endangerment, that is perfectly appropriate. 6   It would also be appropriate if the agency determined 7   that there was so much uncertainty that they couldn't 8   even form a judgment on that.  That would be applying 9   the endangerment statute at the same time it put off. 10   But the point is they did not say any of that.  They 11   instead relied on impermissible grounds.

05-1126 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs. I think the most important point that I can make today is that this is a case about the substantive requirements of antitrust law, and just as in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court articulated the substantive requirements for pleading a claim under the securities law, and just as in Anza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   General Contractors, in Trinko.  And in the instant 18   case, the Court is faced with the question of what a 19   plaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim 20   and show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust 21 laws. 22              In that regard, I'd like to direct the 23   Court's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's 24   complaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the 25   joint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for 3  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   plaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract 2   combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.  The 3   complaint states, and I quote, "in the absence of any 4   meaningful competition among the defendants," and, 5   quote, in light of the parallel course of conduct 6   that each engaged in to prevent competition, the 7   plaintiffs -- the defendants conspired.    Thank you Mr. Richard, Mr. Kellogg, you have four minutes 11 12 13 14 15   like to make.  First following up on Justice 16   Ginsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have 17   an authority to issue purely investigative 18   complaints.  The Department of Justice of course can 19   issue civil investigative demands, but for private 20   plaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery, 21   particularly to the sort of massive discovery at 22   issue here, is to establish some basis for thinking 23   the plaintiff -- the defendants have done something 24   wrong.

Is it a cause of 2   action for being seized until he was arraigned?  Or is 3   it a cause of action for being seized for the eight and 4   a half years that he was locked up until he was, the 5   criminal case was resolved in his favor? 6               My sister argues that it was just, the 7   Federal remedy is only until you're being arraigned, and 8   that the state remedy for malicious prosecution doesn't 9   exist if the Seventh Circuit has construed Illinois law 10   to say that there is no malicious prosecution when you 11   win the Federal case, when you win the criminal case, 12   because the evidence has been suppressed.  The false 13   imprisonment, state false imprisonment was dismissed by 14   the district court, under his reading of Illinois law 15   that the cause of action accrued at the time of the 16   arrest.  Not at the time he was released.  And the 17   Seventh Circuit when that issue was raised on appeal to 18   them in a brief by both sides chose to reject it without 19   discussion. 20               What, the cause of action that respondent 21   proposes is none, for the eight and a half year seizure. 22   There is no state cause of action in Illinois.  And 23   there is no Federal cause of action.  It is just tough. 24   You are seized for eight and a half years, and you can't 25   go to state court, you can't go to Federal court.  You 50  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   should have sued immediately after you were arrested to 2   get a little bit of damages, but that's all you can get. 3   And have a nice day; we're sorry. 4               That, I don't think is consistent with Heck. 5   I don't think it is consistent with this Court's 6   jurisprudence about the meaning of Section 1983.  I 7   don't think it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment 8   and it should not be the rule that the Court adopts. 9               The statute of limitations problem isn't 10   really a problem because all of the evidence that's 11   material to the legality of the arrest, to the legality 12   and the -- whether the confession was the proximate -- 13   was proximately caused by the arrest or proximately 14   caused by the incarceration, has been developed in the 15   criminal case.  When there's very strong interest in 16   seeing that the facts are fully determined and fairly 17   determined for both sides.  It is not that the police 18   officer who sued eight -- eight and a half years later 19   is much less is much less prejudiced than Mr. Wallace 20   is, who comes out of prison after eight and a half years 21   with no remedy. 22               The questions about the multiple causes of 23   action that can arise:  if you're beaten, you have to 24   sue immediately after you're beaten; if you're beaten 25   but a confession is extorted from you, your right to sue 51  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 starts with the confession is used against you at trial -- and if there's some constitutional violation which necessarily impairs the conviction, then you can sue after you successfully defended a criminal case -- is really an administrative nightmare that really could be solved by a Federal tolling rule that all Section 1983 cases are tolled; the statute does not start to run until the criminal case has been resolved. - Subject to Final Review In most cases, then, instead of being filed in district court -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   limitations.

That will weed out all of the really nonsensical 21   cases that would otherwise be filed under respondent's 22   rule, when you file the 1983 action the same day you 23   file the motion to suppress and the district judge says 24   well, this goes on my state calendar of 5,000 cases and 25   the clerk's office is troubled with collecting the $350 52

That's an obvious 9 10 11 14   this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary 15   can't engage in federally authorized activities unless 16   and until it gets the State's permission.

It did so clearly and 13   decisively, and described a methodology which was 14   unambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized 15   statistical standard, and assisted in actually 16   promulgating -- and -- the intent of the Impact Aid Act, 17   which is to benefit impacted local educational agencies 18   or school districts and not fund the general educational 19   program of the States. 20               In so doing, Congress removed from the 21   Secretary the previously delegated authority to 22   establish by regulation the equalization formula.  The 23   Secretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations 24   in response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he 25   was engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any 3  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   interpretations of statutes.  Instead, the Secretary 2   sought and announced that he was proceeding under an 3   exception to the public notice and comment laws, 4   5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely 5   reflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory 6 language.    You're not certain about the hypothetical but you're certain about the statute, aren't you?    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT    What's the case that says "unambiguously foreclosed"?    In the EFIG statute?    But in this statute 27  ￼that here? - Subject to Final Review 1   the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. 2   Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it 3   took language from the regulation; it didn't take the 4   part that said look to the appendix.    And it didn't do 14 15 16   it didn't have to.  It makes sense --    What is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a State?    Which State has one school district?  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   address that disparity under (b)(ii)?  In other words, 7   the school district which has only 57 students, it seems 8   to me could be taken out of the calculation under    In the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary 9   (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more 10   representative school districts, not the special case of 11   the particularly isolated school district or whatever.    Why do you have to    I would have thought - Subject to Final Review 1   even though I think the language really says exactly 2   what your opponent says it says?    Thank you, Counsel.

It is only per pupil 13   when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils. 14   If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   is an extraordinarily technical area, which is precisely 2   why Congress left this issue to the agency to work this 3   out.  When Congress -- when Congress used the terms 5 4   percent and 10 percent, and again I'm not, I'm not 5   reading Congress's mind to say that when Congress used 6   those terms, those percentiles, Congress must have 7   intended some national uniformity.  This is a national 8 9 10 11 12 program and Congress expects these programs to be applied somewhat uniformly across -- across the country.    Go ahead.

Do you understand the hearing 2   that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is 3   the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation 4   evidence that he now wants to present?

05-1629 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1629 Gonzales versus 1 2 3 4 5   Duenas-Alvarez. it please the Court. The Ninth Circuit held that the term theft 10 11 12 13 14   That holding is incorrect.  Indeed, it is so clearly 15   incorrect that even respondent does not defend it. 16   Respondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his 17   violation of the California vehicle theft statute is not 18   a theft offense under the INA, not because the 19   California statute covers aiding and abetting and the 20   theft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but 21   because the California statute covers a certain kind of 22   aiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable 23   consequences rule, and a theft offense does not. 24               That theory is slightly narrower than the 25   Ninth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same 3 offense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting.  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reasons.  One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's 2   holding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit 3   the number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated 4   felons based on a conviction obtained in any 5   jurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes 6   between principals and aiders and abetters and it is 7   ordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a 8   particular case was not convicted as an aider and 9   abettor.  Respondent's theory would have the same effect 10 11 12 13   mechanical point?  As you probably know from your brief, 14   I don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and 15   I'm just not used to it.  I had thought -- and I guess 16   I'm wrong -- that if the natural and probable 17   consequences theory were used to prove, let's say, 18   ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out 19   as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate 20   charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be 21   the natural and consequences extension of aiding and 22   abetting so that there would at least be on the record a 23   charge of assault. 24               And I take it that's not the case.

But it's not    So if the Government says -- Congress says, we think OPM should have a recreation center for its employees and it should have all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract with a company that runs recreation centers -- okay -- that's a contract with the Government.  And then that entity enters into a contract with somebody else to supply the basketball hoops.  Would you say that that last contract is a Government contract?    Yes.

FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT    How is this -- to go to your first point, how is this specifically identifiable?  No court has said that there's this -- you only want the medical expenses, and no court has said there's this much for medical expenses.  You have to figure out how much of the recovery is allocable to medical expenses.  In fact, already did that.  They cut out some percentage for attorney's fees.  It's far removed from the traditional sort of res that we deal with in equity.    So we -- how enforced?  I mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you do that legally not equitably.    Are these claims subject to the qualifications that go along with the equitable lien, the make-whole, whatever the applicable rules are?    So that wouldn't apply here because you're relying on the contract.    So what if the plan said -- you know, this is an insurance company.  They don't like litigation -- we are subrogated to double whatever the medical expenses are that we contributed? That's our recovery.  It's an equitable claim, but it's going to be enforced according to the terms of the plan.    But you would still call that an equitable claim?

So this would be a pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to sanction.    Counsel --    Counsel, if you -- on the removal question, if there's a dispute about whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?

Because the whole -- one of the reasons you have reasonably short time is that you get the witnesses there, they remember it. If you have to file within 15 days with the prison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, "Do you remember what happened?" "Yes.  This, this, and this." "Who else was there?" "These people were there." You wait 3 months, the prisoner files a complaint, they ask the guard, "Do you remember?" "Not really.  It was 3 months ago." "Who else was there?"

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ    Well, that doesn't carry  ￼ 1   State law when it meant to include State law.  I mean, the 2   -- if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a 3   parallel construction; it's not broader.  I think perhaps 4   the government would say, "Well, we're talking about 5   offenses."  That's a little different from a felony, but 6   "offenses" is actually a broader term. 7              I'll mention an additional statute, which was 8   not in the appendix -- 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H). 9   This provision -- it's a similar provision; it defines a 10   "serious drug offense" as an offense that is punishable 11   under the specific sections of the Controlled Substances 12   Act, or an offense under State law that, had the offense 13   been prosecuted in a court of the United States, would 14   have been punishable under the CSA. 15              An additional textual indication is, it's agreed 16   -- and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against 17   the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under 18   924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal 19   crime.  924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be 20   prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that 21   clearly refers to a Federal crime.  The definition of 22   drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for 23   purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress 24   would have wanted to include State felonies in a 25   definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision 7  ￼1   that all concede applies only to Federal predicate 2   offenses.  And -- 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    But has it ever been applied in a -- to a statute that specifically says that the term "aggravated felony" applies to an offense described in this paragraph, whether in violation of Federal or State law?

There's no recovery for 13   assault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice 14   just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an 15   element of the claim how do you draw a distinction 16   between that and the existence or nonexistence of any 17 act at all.    There is at least considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for  ￼ 1   purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification 2   is conclusive.  And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it 3   suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal 4   court rather than be immediately remanded without the 5   availability of review.

But on the other hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do if you're applying a new decision that's that been made  ￼1 apply. 2 - Subject to Final Review    Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Ms. Forsman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES A. FORSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    So it seems to me that the question is what was the law, what was the clearly established law at the time of the state 39  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   drafting, but the only way to make those sections 2   compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when 3   2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the 4   timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is 5   who is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted 6   it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by 7   this Court, that established by the rule.  So that's the 8 first part. 9               And the second part is that it's not dicta. 10   It is an actual holding of this Court that is to be 11   looked to to determine whether or not the state court 12   was wrong.  And so the only way to read that is to say, 13   listen, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity, 14   and what does retroactivity mean?  Retroactivity means 15   like a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined 16   that a new rule is retroactively applicable -- and 17   certainly between AEDPA and the Teague exceptions, which 18   you did say in Horn versus Banks, by the way, should be 19   analyzed differently -- although it has not been tossed 20   up to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning 21   of the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that 22   Teague is still alive and well and that when you look to 23   the application of whether a rule should be applied 24   retroactively you look to the Teague exceptions, so we 25   also look -- 40  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   2254(d)(1).  The language -- the reason that we know 5   that Congress was cognizant of Teague is that there is 6   language throughout AEDPA, particularly in the sections 7   that we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from 8 Teague.    Thank you, Ms. General Chanos, you have two minutes REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER    You can finish your    Particularly if it is Justice Harlan you're quoting. (Laughter.) 47 - Subject to Final Review 1   adversarial testing would add little to its reliability. 2               Following that admonishment from this Court, 3   the Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be 4   reliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio -- Idaho 5   versus Wright. 6               Finally, I would just point out that 7   although Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may, 8   in fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague, 9   as was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as 10   was Duncan in DIStefano as was Mills in Banks.  Yet this 11   Court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those 12   important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to 13   the level of Gideon versus Wainwright.  The same should 14   be true with your decision here with respect to 15   Crawford. 16 Finally, as Justice Harlan stated in the case of MCKay, talking about where this Court's 17 18 19 20 21   sentence. 22 retroactivity jurisprudence has come from, no one, not --  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

05-705 +++$+++     We'll hear argument next in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones 1 2 3 4 5   Telecommunications.  Mr. Fisher. Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's pay phone compensation regulations allege just that, 10 11 12   violations of regulations.  The regulatory violations do 13   not give rise to private cause of action under section 14   206 and 207 of the Communications Act.  The proper point 15   of departure in this case begins at section 276.  There 16   Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing 17   pay phone providers compensation for the services that 18   they provide to callers who make dial around calls. 19   There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample 20   authority to enforce the system it created 21   administratively. 22               But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else 23   in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's 24   implementing regulations should give rise to a private 25   cause of action for damages in Federal court. 3  ￼22 23 24 25 complaints like this all the time.    When you say it was always thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?    It doesn't cover certain    Do you have a position on whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the Commission's determination of whether or not their action creates or gives rise to a right of action?    There are two different, 44  1   thing that Congress decided that a complainant could 2   bring either to the Commission or to court is exactly the 3   same.  There's no way to drive a wedge between them. There are other provisions of the Act, as Mr. Fisher said, where Congress specifically authorized the Commission -- an action before the Commission for 4 5 6 7   damages.  But those are -- those provisions which 8   Mr. Fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to 9   do with common carriers.  They have to do with automatic  ￼ 1   it seems to me, two different Chevron questions.  The one 2   is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust 3   and unreasonable.  The other is the question of whether 4   or not they have anything to say about whether that means 5   there is a private right of action in court.    So you would have a different position here if 276 said something like, we think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have  ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   Englert mentioned a couple.  I mean, there's probably 18   numerous ones that wouldn't be.  And in fact, the     But you don't know, the cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or he may be across the country.

05-983 +++$+++     We'll hear argument this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City 10 11 12 13 14   should be without limitation.  But I would like to focus 15   today on petitioner's primary and first theory, which is 16   that parents are real parties in interest in IDEA suits 17   regardless of the claims being asserted. This case asks the Court to decide to what extent non-lawyer parents of a child with a disability may litigate an IDEA case pro se in Federal court. Under two distinct theories, the answer to that question 18               Under 28 USC 1654, a party has a right as a 19   matter of Federal statutory law to litigate their own 20   case.  Accordingly, when a parent sues under IDEA, it is 21   our position they are suing in their own right and are 22   suing on their own case.  This is particularly so 23   because the right to sue provision that Congress enacted 24   in IDEA uses the broad phrase "any party aggrieved" when 25   it allows judicial review of an adverse administrative 4  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   hearing officer's decision.  The parties agree that it 2   is the underlying administrative complaint or the due 3   process complaint that frames both the claims that can 4   be brought eventually in court, and also identifies who 5   the parties are that can appear in court. 6               Those complaint provisions in IDEA, and 7   there are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven 8   of our reply brief; all eight of those provisions refer 9   unambiguously to the parents' complaints.  Congress did 10   not describe this due process complaint that starts the 11   whole dispute process as the child's complaint, the 12   child's complaint by and through the parents, or the 13   parents' complaint on behalf of the child. 14               Accordingly, when a parent files that due 15   process complaint, they are the real party in interest, 16   and again, the provisions make no distinctions about the 17   kinds of claims that can be brought.  It shouldn't 18   matter that when they get to Federal court that -- or 19   there shouldn't be any limitation on who is the real 20   party in interest in Federal court, or what claims may 21   be asserted.    Which just begs the 11   question, doesn't it?  I mean, you're assuming that the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    The statute already 10   presumably attorneys can be found to take the 11   meritorious cases.  And What we are probably dealing 12   with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though 13   the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their 14   fees. 15 16 17 18   litigants.  Here because you are dealing with a minor 19   child, really, it is an all or nothing proposition. 20   Either bring the case and you have the potential to 21   recover attorneys' fees, or the case doesn't get brought 22   at all.  And this is borne out by the statistics cited 23   in our position and the amicus briefs from the Council 24   of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the Autism 25   Society of America. 13    It doesn't say they  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   believe that Congress thought of it as the parents 2   because of all the statutory references to the parents' 3   complaint.  Of course, we don't take the absurd position 4   that the child could not also be a party to those 5   proceedings. 6               But in any event, my point was simply that 7   the express Lesesne argument that some courts relied on 8   to suggest that Congress consciously decided not to 9   allow parental lay representation, I mean, that argument 10   simply doesn't have a strong foundation, because the 11   provision on which that argument is based, which is 12   1415(h)(1), is ambiguous at best.  And, in fact, could 13   suggest just the opposite. 14               I'd like to address a point that Respondents 15   have relied on --    Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Bergeron? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT    I think I understand your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' 45  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a 2   parent.  And I understand your argument to be that a 3   parent can never be a prevailing party.    So how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards? 10 11 12 13   it to simply liability.  It said repeatedly obligations 14   and conditions.  And that's exactly what Rowley was    Right.  But you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to 23   education, that if they litigated, they would have pay 24   the other side's attorneys' fees.  But if they knew that 25   in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the 53  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   parents could prosecute it, and that might result in 2   overturning their decision and that might result in 3   greater expense, well, in that case they would not have 4   bought into this deal at all.

I don't understand 12 - Subject to Final Review 1   there, after having defined the term "employee," the 2   word "employee" is not repeated in those definitions. 3   They talk about "a member" or "an officer" or "an 4   individual."  And so it's much like the circumstance 5   here, where a more generic term is used in the broader 6   definition, but it makes sense to read in the original 7   definition. 8               The same thing I think you can see in the 9   middle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code 10   that we've given this Court.  The word "debtor" is 11   defined in a certain way, and then later on in the 12   definitional provision, the term "debtor's principal 13   residence" is defined as "a residential structure" and 14   such and such.  Again the word "debtor" is not repeated 15   in the broader definition, but we think the only way to 16   make sense of it is to import the definition of the 17   single term into the broader term.

06-11612 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-11612, Gonzalez v. United 10 11 12 13 14   attorney's consent to conduct jury selection.  The 15   record does not reflect the Petitioner personally 16   consented or ever learned of his attorney's consent. 17   Whether defense counsel CAN unilaterally waive a 18   criminal defendant's right to an Article III judge at 19   jury selection, as occurred in this case, is a serious 20   constitutional question.  Applying the constitutional 21   avoidance doctrine, this Court should avoid answering 22   this question by interpreting the "Additional Duties" 23   Clause of the Federal Magistrates Act to require 24   defendant's explicit personal waiver of the right to an 25   Article III judge at felony jury selection. 3 and may it please the Court: Petitioner was not present at the bench conference and did not have the assistance of an interpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    In practice, it's - Subject to Final Review 1   difference between the magistrate and an Article III and 2   why you like this particular magistrate -- it's the 3   attorney that does all the questioning, after all --  it 4   seems to me is -- is a burden.  It's not justified by 10   more a tactical decision than a theoretical one.  I mean 11   you can explain to your client the difference between 12   Article III and a magistrate, but he's going to be more 13   interested in your judgment about, oh, judge so and so 14   doesn't let you get away with anything on voir dire, you 15   know, he runs a tight ship.  This magistrate will let me 16   raise all sorts of other things.  I mean, it's like an 17   objection at trial, in other words.  It's going to be a 18   tactical decision rather than a theoretical 19   constitutional one.    Thank you, Mr. Newton, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E.

06-1164 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-1164, John R. Sand & Gravel Company v. the United States. Mr. Haynes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER    Are you asking us to, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor overrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?    It's a pretty risky business, though, to rely on a dissent in determining whether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not, isn't it?    Irwin.  I thought that was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you --    -- where Justice    But it hasn't recodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?    So you think we do have to overrule Kendall and Soriano?    Or at least say that we already did in Irwin?    No, I know, but it seems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up today, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's 12 13 14   right. 15               But the point is it came up 100 years ago 16   and it was decided, and the question is whether we 17   should overturn that decision.
06-1181 +++$+++     We'll hear argument 10 11 12   for voluntary departure.  Congress has also provided 23 24 25 Government's view, if the official does not act quickly enough, the alien is denied an adjudication.    What percentage of motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?    So how many -- do you know how many are filed on an annual basis? 10 11 12 13   all aliens, for all removal proceedings.  Since 14   voluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all 15   removals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions 16   to reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients.    Counsel, another way 11   to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to 9   Ginsburg. 10 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 regulation and not the statute. Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be much more concerned about that interpretation -- that the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling rules and all of that. But, I take it, the vulnerability of that regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.    So if we don't address it here, there's going to be another case in a year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?    No, I mean he -- you should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.    Well, in all these cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits that you have availed yourself under voluntary departure, and then the motion to reopen is not automatically withdrawn. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   option to our client.  Our client tried to do that, but    Well, is your position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken  ￼23 24 25 bars are triggered and they cannot get the same relief from outside the country.    So you -- you almost have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the time for deportation as well, right?    Well, under your position, I guess, is what your position is on that. 22  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    In other words, the government cannot enter a deportation order during a voluntary departure period.

06-1286 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight, Trustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Rubin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER    Counsel, you agree that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?    But they don't have 13 14 15 16 17   obligation.  It is true that there may be a trustee who 18   is expert in this.    Well, isn't that 11   just like an individual investor?  If you have an  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   uniquely trustlike concern.    Oh, no.  It's a  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reasonable -- let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable 2   investment for a trust.  He just wants to know which one 3   is the best one.    Well, when it's filled out --    -- he knows it's on Form 1041 rather than 1040.    So an individual might have more than one child he wants to provide for and as far as a remainder, there may be more than one 12   grandchild.  It could be exactly the same -- an 13   individual could have exactly the same objectives as a 14   trustee.
06-1287 +++$+++     You want to be able to challenge the state's chosen methodology for determining market value?    So if the, so if the district court says this methodology, Methodology A, most accurately yields true market value, that is giving 5  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   how it varies based on the particular circumstances.  If 8   he says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted 9   value approach is the best way for determining market 10   value, he's not going to in the next case or the 11   district court isn't going to be able to say, I think 12   reproduction cost is the best method.  You're going to rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?    Well, I don't see 13 14 15 16   that's not accurate.  I think what will happen is that 17   the circumstances change every day.  Let's just take a 18   pretty simple example.  Let's assume that in year 1 the 19   district court decides to use discounted cash flow.  In 20   year 2 it turns out that CSX or some other railroad 21   property is sold, so that you have an actual direct 22   sales comparison data available to you by which to make 23   the market value.    So if a district court says in one case Method A is the best way to get market value and another district court says Method B and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?    Isn't that how it standard Federal method of determining what rates affect the taking of property --    Yes, if it's challenged --    The rate of return in a public utility.    My question -- my question assumes that the methodology leads to a value 15 - Subject to Final Review 1   seeking, Justice, to answer Justice Scalia's question, 2   is to have the independent de novo assessment by the 3   district court.  I mean, that's the real purpose of the 4   statute, is to provide a Federal forum.    Well, of course you can challenge it.    Thank you, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. Mr. Calvert. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN R. CALVERT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    You know, if this comes down as it probably will in every case, to a battle of competing experts, are you aware of any other area where we say that a district court cannot look at the methodology used by an expert in determining whether or not to give credence to the expert's opinion?    So why should we create a special rule here for the State?    So if there are problems with a particular methodology, the methodology can be challenged?    Right.  And your argument is that it's not reasonable because it must overstate the value by a particular percentage or If you say it's not reasonable because it overstates value by 50 percent, is a methodology that overstates value by 20 percent reasonable or not --    -- keeping in mind all the methodologies here range from 8 -- 6 billion to 12 billion.    I mean I assume that's in the normal context of the adversary process. In other words, the district court does not necessarily have to come up with a number independent of what the parties present to it.    It can decide which of the presentations is closer to true market value.

Well, why doesn't -- I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has the right to tax Lexis under business activities in 10   capital gain.  Almost -- I mean, it seems to me it would 11   be pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's 12   business, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of 13   the capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.

So that's pretty far  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               First of all, it does not alter in the 2   slightest the jurisdictional rule.  The jurisdictional 3   rule given to us by the habeas statute is still a 4   bright-line rule.  There may be some cases where the 5   petitioner is asking to -- the Court to inquire into the 6   lawfulness of -- the two inquiries in this case, the -- 7   both of them governed by the Due Process Clause -- the 8   lawfulness of the detention for security threats, and 9   the lawfulness of the proposed transfer.  Those are two 10   different inquiries.  Those are the two inquiries. 11               There may be some instance where that 12   request is made fairly shortly after the decision was 13   made to continue to detain.    Let me try and move you to the merits.    I had thought that the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge custody.  And it seems to me that the last thing your clients want in this case is to be released.    You don't want the district court to say you win, you can be released tomorrow at noon.    Well, I thought you wanted to block the transfer.  I mean, the Iraqi authorities can pick him up at the gate.    I thought the relief that was awarded by the district court also enjoined 20   court pointed out, the -- first of all, they can try a 21   prisoner in absentia.  All we object to is that -- a 22   physical transfer of Mr. Omar or Mr. Munaf, while the 23   lawfulness of that transfer is being determined.  And 24   that is all we sought.    The bright line is getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.    Mr. Margulies, let me make sure there are no other questions.  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   these other matters we do not need in order to prevail. 2   The district court, examining two claims under the 3   due-process clause, will examine whether there is legal 4   authority to detain a person, to detain these prisoners 5   as security internees or security threats.  That is a 6   classic Hamdi inquiry.  And they will examine under the 7   due-process clause whether it is lawful to transfer 8 them.    Thank you, Mr. Margulies.    Mr. Garre, seven

The language, structure and history 8   of the interest abatement review statute supports the 9   court of appeals' decision as to principles of sovereign 10   immunity.  Under Petitioner's theory the specific 11   restrictions on the remedy that Congress created may be 12   avoided by the simple expedient of filing a challenge in 13   another forum.  Nothing in the interest abatement review 14   statute or this Court's precedent permits that result. 15               The place to start is the language of the 16   interest abatement review statute.  Section 6404(h) 17   provides the tax court shall have jurisdiction over an 18   interest abatement action brought by taxpayers who meet 19   the net worth limitations set out in another part of the 20   code and who file their claim within 180 days of the 21   Secretary's mailing of a final determination not to 22   abate interest.

That hasn't come up during the 9   argument today.  It is barely mentioned in Petitioner's 10   brief.  That subsection -- it is on page 5a in the 11   appendix to the Gray brief, lays down the general rule 12   -- the rule that tells school districts when they don't 13   have to worry about paying reimbursement.  And that is 14 15 16 17   and Carter, and that lays down the general rule.  School 18   districts that provide an appropriate placement don't 19   have to worry about reimbursement. 20               Subsection (C)(ii) then goes on to identify 21   a particular fact pattern which also happens to be the 22   most common situation in which reimbursement claims are 23   presented to the courts.  And Congress in that 24   situation, along with Subsections (3) and (4), provided 25   the courts with more concrete guidance in determining 47 when they provide a free, a public -- an appropriate public education in the first place. That -- that is consistent with Burlington  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   how to exercise their discretion in that situation. 2               The legislative history supports that 3   interpretation.

In 15   other words, I think you have a strong case with respect 16   to discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky 17   competes against Ohio bonds as well.

The first is 16   that there must be an authorized sale under the patent 17   that was allegedly infringed.  That's never been in 18   dispute in this case.  The Federal Circuit recognized 19   that Intel was authorized to sell these components under 20   the system and method patents at issue in the case that 21   have been allegedly infringed. 22               And the second criteria is that the article 23   sold must be one that falls within the protection of the 24   patent that was allegedly infringed, here the system and 25   method patents.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    Well, so was anyone 26 - Subject to Final Review  ￼17 18   Honor. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 - Subject to Final Review 1   who hired a company to do any kind of work, right? 2   Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try 3   to restrict what activities the company engaged in with 4   respect to union organizing.   -- and that that activity was pre-empted.    No, but the policy 32 - Subject to Final Review 10   implement.  We do not want to support abortions.    Why --    So that depends, as a practical matter, on the view that there are at least some employers who would be arguing in favor of 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   any State money to respond.  The State was funding one 17   side of this dispute.  And the notion that it was an 18   implied purpose of Congress in the National Labor 19   Relations Act to compel States to fund one side of a 20   dispute with a subsidy is -- would be remarkable.    Yes, but my point is that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.    I want to get back to your responses on the procedural costs of the case. You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would be with respect to accounting rules. 10 11 12 13 14 15   it to be, that you can't regulate at all?  It's not 16   simply that you can't regulate so long as it's    Does it make any difference if the argument is which is what I understood 17   particularly burdensome, but you don't have the 18   authority to regulate in this at all.    That gets to the --    That gets to the 51  ￼19 20 21 22 23 24 25 it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled to regulate at all.    You're getting back 52 - Subject to Final Review 1   spending clause question.  We're not -- I mean, we can 2   address that without deciding whether the regulations 3   are particularly burdensome.  You were saying well, the 4 5 6 7 8 9   whether the employer opposes unions.  What we are 10   regulating is what they do with the State's money. 11   That's the only regulation that's here.  We are saying 12   don't use our money for this purpose.  The only accounting is not a big problem.    But it doesn't mean that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.    That doesn't seem to 18   regulation is.  If you lose on the question of whether  ￼1 2 3 4 aside. 5 - Subject to Final Review to the spending question.    I'm putting that 7   answer to something.  The -- if this is regulation, then 8   there is a serious prospect of its being pre-emptive, 9   but this is not regulation.    If it's regulation why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   this whole line of cases where the Court has said the 2   government's choice not to subsidize an activity is not 3   regulation. 4 5 6 7   Circuit misunderstood Boston Harbor.  It thought Boston 8   Harbor created two boxes that represented the whole 9   world.  You're either a market participant or you're a 10   regulator.  That's not what Boston Harbor said, if you 11   go back and look at it.  What Boston Harbor said, if you 12   regulate you are vulnerable to pre-emption arguments; if 13   you are not regulating, then you are free of pre-emption 14   concerns.    Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Goldsmith, you have four minutes I'd just like to make a few comments in 15   rebuttal.  First of all, the preamble of the statute 16   makes it absolutely clear as to what the State's purpose 17   is.  It's at page 3a of the appendix of the petition. 18   It says it is the policy of the State not to interfere 19   with an employee's choice about whether to join or to be 20   represented by a labor union.  For this reason the State 21   should not subsidize -- and so on. 22               So clearly the State has a labor policy 23   position.  It's a position as I said at the outset that 24   is completely contrary to that of the NLRA.  The NLRA's 25   position is that employers just like unions ought to 55  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   have the right to speak in a noncoercive way to their 2   employees. 3               Secondly, it is not our position that the 4   NLRA requires the State to fund activities.  It is our 5   position that the NLRA and the decisions of this Court 6   make it abundantly clear that the States are to stay out 7   of this area altogether, period.  And that would be the 8   case whether it is the kind of statute that Justice 9   Scalia was posing a question about, whether it was in 10   effect anti-union or pro-union.  It doesn't matter. 11   They are both pre-empted. 12               The State has no business making labor 13   policy.  The decisions of this Court, the unanimous 14   decisions of this Court in several circumstances I think 15   make that very clear.  And the Ninth Circuit did find 16   that for all practical purposes, the State was 17   regulating by making labor policy. 18               If I could make two points about neutrality. 19   First of all, the statute is anything but neutral. 20   First of all, the State's policy is not one of 21   neutrality.  As I just read from the preamble they have 22   a position; the position is that noncoercive employer 23   speech interferes with employee free choice, and the 24   statute follows that position. 25               The decision to withdraw funds is not the 56  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   same thing as being neutral.  Your Honor made a 2   reference to the Hyde amendment.  The Hyde amendment, 3   Congress withdrew funds from -- from abortion 4   practitioners.  It was not neutral about abortion.  And 5   California here has made a judgment about noncoercive 6   speech.    Well, Lyng said that the -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was

The thing that concerns me about  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in reviewing that judgment, and here's -- here's the 2   question.  This Court has an obligation, has the 3   authority, to say what the law is.  In this case the 4   obligation is, in fact, to comply with the judgment, 5   itself.    Even if we determine, even if we determine that that judgment is based on a legal error?    So if the ICJ determined that the officers should each go to jail for 5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that 18   judgment?  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 aware of any -- any decision of the ICJ that says what a sentence should be for a particular individual.

But --    Well, why don't -- 18  ￼ - Subject to Final Review If the Avena judgment is binding as Federal law, is it your position, though, that the -- this Court has no authority to review the content of that Federal 1 2 3 4   law -- the judgment?

The first is because New York's 22   legislature has redefined the remedies available under 23   section 1983, they have, in effect, substituted their 24   judgment about what constitutes good policy for The important point here, Your Honors, is there are two separate related reasons that this law is 25   Congress's judgment. 5  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               In this particular case, Mr. Haywood or any 2   other plaintiff in New York State, could bring a section 3   1983 claim in State court, but only if he agrees to give 4   up his right to seek money damages. 5               Congress determined, in setting forth the 6   purpose and the effect of section 1983, that plaintiffs 7   ought to be entitled to both money damages and equitable 8 damages.    So if this were at the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a court system, and they said from the outset, look, we are not going to hear these types of cases, then this would be okay? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   mixing the two points.  Your point I understand it --    No, no, that's 19 20 21 22   they can't say, say no more.

There's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady    I -- I guess what I would say is you've got - habeas review of that claim because the district court decided it on the merits and the court of appeals decided it on the merits.

If you did, then also we have to resolve the question on the merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we would not normally take without reaching those    Our -- our cases clearly hold that when you have alternate holdings, neither one is dicta.    Well, that's fair for the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to take this procedural -- complicated procedural issue,    I guess it's -- my questions and the questions and the points --    -- that was raised about the time are related, because one reason these things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly why you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   has been in the courts for so long.

If I could have it go back 18   down, what I would do is try to find what we call "buddy 19   statements," lay statements, that would corroborate that 20   he had symptoms from time of service and well on, which 21   under a case called Buchanan is sufficient evidence to 22   base a finding of service connection.    Uh-hmm.    Well, you would phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have done and what you weren't able to do, and which you can 10   have the evidence that three people would say he was 11   complaining about the vision loss at the time.

07-1437 +++$+++     We'll hear argument Mr. Rhodes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 7 8 9    I think there's no 9 10 11 12 13 15   text of the statute that says remands are not 16   reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes 17   they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a 18   district judge to say:  Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over 19   this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a -- 20   this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court. 21   The court, I think, was outraged by a district court 22   thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was 23   too busy with more important things. 24               That was the setting of Thermtron, and to 25   reach the result that the court reached, the court had 13 point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you send it back, it's not reviewable.    And it would solve the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that this way you don't get to appeal big things like no subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal 14 - Subject to Final Review 1   to go against the language of the statute when read in 2   absolute terms.  But anyway, the court did that, and 3   then they gave a rationale for what the new test was 4   going to be.  It was no longer going to be remands are 5   no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to 6   be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was 7   it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447?  The -- it -- the 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 16   what it says.  And Thermtron involved the court saying: 17   I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with 18   other things.  I mean, it could be limited to that court read the statute to say less than it in fact did. That's what Thermtron did.    Well, "woodenly" is 15   a bit much.  I mean, they're going to read it not to say  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   things.  But I think, to answer your question, we have 5   30 years of this particular rule under Thermtron being 6   uniformly applied by all the circuit courts of appeal, 7   and they have found this to be a workable, statutory 8   interpretation to give them a framework to handle these 9   kinds of cases.  And it's not a situation where the 10   circuit courts of appeal have run away from situations 11   like this, where remands have been based upon declining 12   to exercise discretionary power to send it back to State 13   court.  They have seemed to want to work within the 14   statutory framework to review those kinds of cases. 15               And I think it would be a large departure to 16   go back and try to modify what all the circuit courts of 17   appeal, except for maybe the Federal Circuit, had 18   adopted as a workable framework in order to solve these 19   kinds of problems.    I mean, in one of those provisions they said this was only technical amendments, and if they're just doing technical amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and approve the whole thing.

And so if 47  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the conceptual relationship were established and with somebody who was not a nonmember who subsequently ended up through sales of shares to become a member, we don't think that that ex post facto development would effect the establishment of the original relationship.    Well, but the only reason -- the only reason the bank is on the reservation is because the land was collateral, right?    They didn't want to buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out 48 - Subject to Final Review  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left 2   with a land on a reservation.  Is that consensual?    Yes, but the subject of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by Indians on the reservation.  The collateral put up is other land that the corporation owns or the individuals own off the reservation.  Jurisdiction or not.    Yes.    Whatever home equity 52  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Well, they are going to add -- add a new wing onto the -- new room on to their home. - Subject to Final Review    So if Chase Manhattan gets a home equity loan application from somebody and they grant the home equity loan, they are now subject to being sued in tribal court?    What if the tribal court has a rule that forum selection provisions are not  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   tribe would adopt a rule like that, because as a 2   pragmatic matter it would make it more difficult for 3   their citizens to engage in business relationships if 4   they had a categorical ban like that.  And so --    What was the basis for the finding of discrimination?    It had nothing to do -- the bank's justification had nothing to do with the fact that the entity had defaulted earlier? - Subject to Final Review

07-513 +++$+++     We'll hear argument and may it please the Court: In February 2004, the Dale County circuit 10 11 12 13   Petitioner's arrest.  Having received that notice, 14   someone in the sheriff's department physically removed 15   the warrant from the file and physically took the 16   warrant back to the court clerk's office.  But no one 17   either then or later in the sheriff's department ever 18   updated the computer file to indicate that the record 19   had -- that the warrant had been recalled.  As a result 20   of that police department error, the Petitioner in this 21   case was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there 22   was no probable cause five months later.    So people who are, you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they go to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up as having a warrant out for their arrest.    -- that the warrant -- that the information she had given 10 minutes before was inaccurate.    How is it going to    Yes, but I mean I don't know what the situation is like --    So you are back to arguing that there was negligence, and that that's    Okay.  Cross-examine    So that's assuming bad faith on the part of the police.    They want to arrest him, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle    But you're suggesting it's bad faith --    -- because they -- because they don't want to have to worry about getting a warrant that might be wrong?    What was your point 25   anything else.  They can follow him, find the broken 63  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   taillight and then they would have gotten that guy.  I 2   thought that was the point you were trying to make?    Sure.
07-526 +++$+++     We'll hear argument next in Case 07-526, Carcieri v. Kempthorne. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    My understanding -- maybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as there is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and 3 4 5   under Federal jurisdiction.  So how -- how do you tell 6 7 8 9   was to set about and create a list.  There was a list in 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?    But I guess the point is that, given the weight that you are placing on the word "now," you would think there was some clear way to say who was recognized before then and who was 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   sharp distinction.  That is to say, it was Indians that 11 the test of recognition was in 1934. But if they were drawing -- if Congress were drawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a sharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there is no real sharp distinction.    No.  No.  No. That's not true, because now you have a very clear  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               And Commissioner Collier, who is the author 2   of the Act, says:  We will stick the words "now under 3   Federal jurisdiction in there."  And then he explains 4   exactly what was meant by that:  That would -- that it 5   would cover tribes that existed in -- in 19 -- that 6   would -- he says that would limit the Act to Indians now 7   -- and he is speaking at the time the statute was being 8   debated -- under Federal jurisdiction. 9               Those documents that the Government suddenly 10   discovered in August of this year, which were lodged 11   with this Court in the latter part of August of this 12   year, include a 1936 -- circular letter by Commissioner 13   Collier to all of the superintendents throughout the 14   United States.  This is the author of the statute 15   speaking in 1936, and he says "all persons of Indian 16   descent who are members of any recognized tribe that was 17   under Federal jurisdiction at the date of the Act." 18               Now your point, Chief Justice Roberts, is 19   that maybe it was unclear at the exact moment of -- of 20   enactment which 198, or whatever number it might have 21   been, tribes were under that, but that's the sort of 22   information that can be discerned by looking at the 23   history and the records so that a finite group could be 24   identified.

Even when you are in a 20   situation like this case, where the district is actually 21   functioning and has a proven ability to elect a minority 22   preferred candidate.  Moreover -- 23 24 25

And 2   we still haven't heard an answer.    Thank you, counsel.    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Metzler? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE P. METZLER, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    But concede for purposes of argument that it is a difficult question. Why don't we just tell the lower courts -- we do it, we go right ahead to the qualified immunity question by not  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   granting cert on one.  Why shouldn't the lower courts 2   have the same luxury?    Well, but that was 18   my question.  There are other ways for the law to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   for good and sufficient reason decide to reach the 2   constitutional question first. 3               I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there 4   is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I 5   had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought 6   it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult 7   constitutional issue and then not worry about it because 8   in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not 9   clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.    Well, right, but do  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reasonable for them to follow some out-of-circuit 2   decision.  If, for instance, the Seventh Circuit had 3   said that a warrantless home entry is okay so long as 4   the officer had breakfast in the last half-hour, that's 5   an unreasonable rule, and it wouldn't be reasonable for 6   any officer to follow that.  And the facts here are 7   about as relevant to consent as to whether there was -- 8   the officer had breakfast that morning. 9               So the officers here are not entitled to 10   qualify -- nor can they rely on the Seventh Circuit. 11   The Petitioners have not given you any reason to adopt a 12   new exception here.  They say this is based on a waiver 13   theory or that it's a private search or that it is 14   incident to arrest.  But all of those ignore the 15   substantial interest in the sanctity of the home.    Yes.    And in those 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   home entries.  If you have a warrant, you are okay.  If 41 circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between the police officer and the confidential informant?    Do you believe that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to look at in addressing this question, a case involving a confidential informant?    Why is that?    Why isn't it that the issue hasn't come up, this question of a  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a situation where the exigent circumstances are the creation of the scenario that the police have set up, the police cannot -- and you have a police officer who is being the undercover operative who has the power to make an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for other officers to come in and assist with the arrest?    No, but then he is going to get sued.    Why doesn't -- that doesn't make him an agent of the police?    Thank you, counsel.

The Ninth Circuit decision 13   should be reversed because the Washington court's 14   adjudication of this matter was not objectively 15   unreasonable.  The Washington court concluded that the 16   instruction at issue properly informed the jury of the 17   elements of accomplice liability, and the prosecutor's 18   argument informed the jury that it could only convict 19   Sarausad if he acted with knowledge he was facilitating 20   the commission of a homicide. 21               The court also concluded that the trial 22   judge did not abuse his discretion in directing the jury 23   to reread the relevant instructions instead of giving 24   the supplemental instruction proposed by Sarausad.

Because the term "terminate," at the very 4  ￼10 11 12 13   specific, but important, actions:  Franchisors' 14   termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of 15   the franchise term and the franchisors’ non-renewal of 16   the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's 17 term. 18             The statute responded to complaints about 19   franchisors exercising broad contractual rights to 20   terminate the franchise relationship that was not 21   addressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that 22   was not previously addressed by State law.  But Congress    Well, but there -- 10 11   constructive eviction must leave the job.  That is the 12   nature, even where constructive discharge and 13   constructive termination -- constructive eviction 14   claims, are recognized.  That is the settled rule.     What does Williston say about it?    Thank you, counsel. Mr. O'Neil. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 20  1 2 3 4 5 6 7   that, that might be the case.  But in the ordinary cases 8   you see a 1 percent increase in gas prices in highly 9   volatile petroleum markets.  For example, in this case, 10   where Shell raised its prices considerably but was still 11   charging less than Exxon and Chevron, as the joint 12   appendix 225 and 237 made clear, that's what you end up 13   with as claims for constructive termination, if you 14   recognize constructive termination. 15             But Congress was worried about actual 16   terminations, the exercise of contractual rights, broad 17   contractual rights, to terminate that were formerly not 18   regulated, not breaches of contract that were already 19   regulated by -- comprehensively, by State law. 20             If I may reserve the remainder of my time for 21   rebuttal.  Thank you.    Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Farraher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. FARRAHER, JR., ON BEHALF OF MAC'S SHELL SERVICE, INC., ET AL.    It's a million 19 20 21 22   Mr. Chief Justice.  But in a case where a dealer comes 23   to the court for relief and they have available to them 24   the injunctive remedy, which does not require the 25   irreparable harm component be demonstrated, it keeps the 44 attorneys’ fees and expert fees in the Federal action, and presumably you don't in the State action.    Thank you, counsel. 54  1 2 3 4   bark.  I mean, there is this huge body of 5   landlord/tenant law, and you have just a few cases, and 6   one of them, at least, doesn't appear to support you.

And that gives the percentage of with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?

I 2   understand that there are portions of the Ninth 3   Circuit's opinion that say -- that have the radical 4   change language, and again, I -- I think that that 5   language is -- just reflects the arguments that 6   Petitioners were making, that they wanted complete 7   relief from these remedial orders and that, you know, 8   the underlying judgment here was a systemic violation. 9   I mean, it's --    Thank you, counsel.

ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER    Why are we having all this talk about -- in other words, you think if there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to 5 6 7   pay a certain amount or whatever.  Then do you lose or 8   win?

Well, but just on 22 - Subject to Final Review 1   Constitution, as with the Import-Export Clause, was that 2   States with favorable port facilities were going to be 3   imposing burdens by taking advantage of their favorable 4   geography to impose burdens that are going to be felt by 5   the other States.  That is exactly what Valdez has done. 10 11 12 13   right?    Well, then, do you  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 imposed upon vessels that were going to be passed through, as Justice Scalia said, to the ultimate purchasers or sellers of the imports and exports that were -- that were in the vessel.    Well, then I think we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.    They collect it; they keep it; that sounds like a city tax.    How -- under your view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on a vessel?    So -- so you think we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally applicable property taxes are in Valdez?    Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.

Second, there is no successive jeopardy; and, 16   third, even if collateral estoppel analysis applies 17   under Ashe versus Swenson, the Atkins issue has not 18   actually and necessarily been decided.  Each of these 19   factors shows that the Ohio court's decision to go 20   forward with the Atkins hearing was reasonable, and this 21   Court therefore should, consistent with AEDPA, give the 22   Ohio courts their first chance to adjudicate Mr. Bies's 23   Atkins claim. 24               Much of the dispute in this case centers on 25   the parties' disagreement over the meaning of Ashe 3 First, there has been no acquittal in this  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   versus Swenson and its application.  But Mr. Bies cannot 2   benefit from Ashe because Ashe -- the Ashe collateral 3   estoppel rule only operates to benefit defendants who 4   have in hand an earlier acquittal, and Mr. Bies has 5   never been acquitted of the death penalty in any sense 6 of the word. 7               This Court, beginning in Bullington and 8   extending through Sattazahn, has defined an "acquittal" 9   in a death penalty context as a finding by the sentencer 10   that the death -- that the sentence of death is 11   warranted in a particular case.  And the -- the jury and 12   the trial judge in this case agreed that death was 13   warranted, and, in fact, the Ohio Supreme Court and 14   every reviewing court has agreed that death was 15   warranted.

Only plead guilty? Not, for example, whether it would be material to the defendant in deciding whether or not to take the stand?    No, but that's -- I don't see why that doesn't apply to the more fundamental question about whether the district court has to inquire 14   1   into the plea circumstances in any event.  I thought -- 2   your answer to Justice Scalia that, oh, well, all sorts 3   of things can come up at trial and the district judge 4   doesn't have to inquire into those, I think proves too 5   much.  It goes to -- and it departs from your focus on 6   the guilty plea.  That's all the judge is inquiring 7   about.  And I don't know why that obligation doesn't 8   extend to a fundamental piece of information that 9   would -- that would, under your theory, make acceptance 10   of the plea involuntary.

It shortened the period from three 10 11 12 13   potential appellant.  I mean if you say Congress is 14   concerned about situations in which the government is a 15   potential appellant.

FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER    It's an -- I thought your point -- I thought your point was, oh, this is going to be hard to do, impossible, as you say.    It seems to me -- it ￼seems to me those are the exact same problems that would 8   rule, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's very easy to say whether 9   this Court has made a decision retroactive.  It would 10   be.  It hasn't happened, but I imagine it would be very easy. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   before I sit down.  What about a situation the first 18   time where a claim is Teague-barred or procedurally 19   precluded or maybe even the defendant doesn't raise it 20   because under the facts that the first trial went The State's rule is any new decision from this Court gives the defendant a new -- gives potential rise to a debate as to whether or not that claim was previously available. Let me tick off a couple of other things 21   forward, it would have been harmless error. 22               All of those situations would raise very 23   difficult questions as to whether that claim, as the 24   State would put it, was previously available.  Even, 25   again, go back to the idea of having a new trial based 26  - Subject to Final Review 1   on new -- based on new facts and new evidence.  Trying 2   to figure out whether it's the same claim, a different 3   claim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing 4   argument.  Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact 5   same script a second time, there is going to be a huge 6   fight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a 7   different claim. 8               And finally, the State's other -- the other 9   prong of the State's test is about claims that were 10   raised before are now barred.  Now, the State 11   immediately recognizes that that's a huge problem 12   because it would bar defendants from making -- from 13   seeking habeas relief if the State made the same 14   violation the second time around.  So it invents a 15   brand-new due process principle that has never been held 16   to be -- to be in existence by this Court.  And indeed, 17   in the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas 18   situation, where the State court made the same error 19   twice, it went straight to the constitutional claim.

But the vacatur does that. You can't plant once the deregulation order is vacated.   So you would say that the injunction is limited only to a decision the agency might make to allow partial planting?   Right.    It's very odd to get an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do something under the APA.    What authority do you have for the proposition that when a court vacates an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to the agency?    So your argument is that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing up the vacatur and the injunction?    Could I go back to something you said a while ago, that "likely" does not mean more likely than not?    It's -- I thought 20   that would be obvious.

It doesn't entitle you to an order saying APHIS can't do anything in the meantime.

MIZNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Why don't you just call your motion a motion to correct an illegal sentence? Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I gather.   You're not one of the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before. (Laughter.)   I'm sure of that. But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoever - Subject to Final Review ￼ - Subject to Final Review 30 1 files these motions had simply said that, there would be 2 no problem, right?   That's the only have -­   It's the only have for challenging the sentence.   Well, you say it "would be raised." Are you saying it can only be raised under Rule 35?   That's what I would have thought. So Rule 35 is not the only vehicle for challenging a sentence?   Okay.
09-893 +++$+++    Well, sure. That's of these cases.   It's a question of ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 they don't know whether they are going to be among the 2 very few consumers who detect fraud, recognize a legal 3 claim, or hire a lawyer to do so, and come forward and 4 seek compensation. And so the Concepcions are situated 5 just like any other AT&T customer, and that is the point 6 at which fairness is assessed. 7 So from the perspective of California 8 unconscionability doctrine, the Concepcions and -- and 9 all the other AT&T customers are not differently 10 situated. It's not a question of whether the 11 Concepcions, once they have chosen to make a claim, 12 whether the contract is then fair to them; it's whether 13 it's fair to any AT&T customer.   Where do you get 21 "obvious subterfuge" in the Federal Arbitration Act?
09-907 +++$+++    And there are things like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if you're paid up, you still get the full food expense that is allowed?   But if you paid $1 for food, you'd get the full amount for 60 months?   So your argument leads to a result that's just as absurd as your colleague's result on the other side. 28  ￼    Why don't you finish answering the question?   Thank you, Ms. Saharsky.

SAHARSKY, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT   And if he paid -­ 43 ￼   If he paid a dollar, able to shield $27,999, and you're with that result?   And I understood ￼  1 a threshold showing that it's applicable to you. 2 And if I could give the Court one example: 3 When an individual does his Federal income tax forms, 4 you can take a deduction for your dependents, but you 5 can't just take a deduction for any child you have. You 6 have to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if 7 the person lives at home with you for more than 1 year 8 and have you a certain amount of expenses to support 9 them, and that is a standard deduction that you get on 10 your tax forms. The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure 11 out their actual costs. 12 It is the case in real life that there are 13 allowance amounts that are average amounts that are 14 given to people once they meet the criteria. And that's 15 what we are saying happens here. 16 Now, that is, again, only a disagreement as ￼17 to what you do with 18 ownership expenses. 19 JUSTICE 20 of the criteria the 21 allowances for housing and utilities and transportation, 22 known as the local standards, vary by location, and 23 unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed 24 the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is 25 less? Why doesn't that apply? 45 people who actually have vehicle   Ms. Saharsky, I should probably know this, but if you do ￼  1 ownership payment is designed to ensure that a vehicle 2 can still use and have access to a car, and if someone 3 has a loan or lease payment, they need to be able to 4 continue making that payment in bankruptcy, but if they 5 don't have any such payment, then they don't have this 6 need for this additional fund because -­

09-996 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bigelow.   Right.   Well, how much range are you willing to give the State? Do they have 3 months' range? I mean, if you come in and say, well, here they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed, and here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't allowed. Is that a problem under our consistency requirement?   No, it says -­   It says "as promptly as the circumstances allow." And then they go back and say there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.

I was -- that was a helpful question, in the sense that -- (Laughter.)    The Bivens action -- presumably the cap would not apply.  But it applies under State law.    Do you disagree that the -- I know you have your argument on compensation --    -- but with respect to deterrence, is there any significant difference between the two causes of action?  In other words, if you think the most significant aspect of Bivens is to deter constitutional violations, doesn't that work equally as well or perhaps more effectively under the State law than under Bivens? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   available.

Suppose that might have been regarded as such then but not under current  ￼ 1   potential unfairness of retroactivity is worth it. 2               Now, the final point here, I believe there 3   was some reference earlier to reliance in the offense. 4   And as the Government concedes, reliance is not a 5   prerequisite.  This Court can rule for Petitioner and 6   not even bother with reliance.  But the presence of 7   reliance here is an extra factor that -- that shows the 8   retroactivity to be obvious and severe.  So, the court 9   of appeals' whole premise that reliance is necessary 10   goes away.  The Government concedes the court of appeals 11   implicitly was wrong on that. 12               As a practical matter, our point is that 13   defendants rely on the known consequences of offenses 14   when they decide to plead guilty.

Yes -- well, which is it, the bargain or the sentence?  It includes the sentence, correct?    He has discretion -- he has discretion.    So, is he allowed to take into consideration all that's happened before, not just with respect to guilt or innocence or the result of the trial, but in imposing the sentence or approving it?    But nothing that he learned at trial, I take it.    Why?    That's the ineffectiveness question.  I understand that to be taken out of the case by the concessions on the other side. I'm talking about the prejudice question.    How is a judge supposed to know?    People have different -- some people are willing to take the chance. Okay?  Let's assume there's a 20 percent chance the person will be found guilty. Some people will say, I'm willing to take that chance because I just don't want the chance of going to jail; I'm willing to roll the dice.  Other people will say, no, that's too much. Now, whether you want to go to jail may cut one way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to decide?  Ask him, are you -- do you take chances?    But you can never say that there's no possibility of acquittal.  Juries can decide not to convict no matter what the evidence.    That's up to the 54  ￼ 1   jury.  It's not up to us ex ante to decide this guy is 2   definitely going to lose; so, let's not waste our time. 3   Juries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not -- 4   it's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide 5   for whatever reason we are not going to convict this 6 guy. Right?    You said there's -- I want to make sure I understand your point.  You said there was no defense.  Does that mean you didn't -- he had a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put on a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove the case and they haven't done it.

10-507 +++$+++     We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-507, Pacific Operators Offshore v. Valladolid. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    When you say on land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State offshore limit?  Does that count as land under your  ￼ 1   Mr. Chief Justice.  If there were platforms on there 2   that were themselves treated as land, that might be.  I 3   think most of the 3 miles from shore is going to be the 4   navigable waters, and that might be covered, for 5   example, directly under the Longshore Act.  But as I 6   say, one of the anomalies here is there was a direct 7   Longshore Act claim in this case, and the determination 8   was that the facility here was too far inland for direct 9   coverage under the Longshore Act. 10               So, therefore, the counterintuitive 11   proposition on the other side of the table today is that 12   in extending the Longshore Act to the outer continental 13   shelf, Congress effectively created a boomerang effect 14   that caused the Longshore Act to apply further inland 15   than it otherwise would.    Unless he spent 30 percent of his time on the shelf.  Then he's covered. 52   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D.

Counsel, I've kind thread of your argument. Is this a 21 partners, and political consultants.   Is your vagueness argument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own?

But because he didn't seek cert and he didn't file State collateral relief, we have this more complicated 10   argument with respect to 2254(d). 11               And this Court has never held either that 12   you have to seek cert in this Court in order to exhaust 13   State remedies, nor to take a -- to take a claim back to 14   State collateral review that you've already taken up 15   through the State direct review system.  So if we had an 16   exhaustion case in the future, maybe somebody would make 17   that argument. 18               But that's not what's before you today. 19   What's before you today is the hypothetical that -- that 20   Mr. Greene actually did seek cert and for some reason 21   this didn't GVR, or he did seek review in the 22   Pennsylvania courts and they refused to hear it. 23               And under the State's position, even then 24   you would bar him from getting the reliance on Gray, 25   because Gray came down after the Pennsylvania Supreme -- 10  ￼ 1   I'm sorry -- the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision.

10-680 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Now Ms. Jacobs. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, Justice quite right. That -- that was not the issue The argument in Mathis was: We're ￼him about something else; so, we don't have Miranda warnings. And that's the question 23 argument was this is a different crime; so, we don't 24 have to give you Miranda. 25 And the Court rejected that. So how does 34  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that clearly establish the law on which the court relied in this case?   Right.   Right.   Do you know where exactly in Mathis? It's only --   -- about five pages long. Can you show me where they have that discussion about custody, as opposed to a discussion about what crime is being discussed?   Exactly.   Is that clearly law?   I'm not sure you answered mine from before.   Well -- the first part, "a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population" -- okay -- "and interrogated"; i.e., questioned in a manner or whatever. Now, does that address all of the issues? Is that -- where in Mathis is the discussion about whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population?   No, no. Where in Mathis?   Right.   If the argument were 43  ￼  1 Miranda was not required because this -- this concerns a 2 different crime than what you're in prison for here. I 3 understand the idea that -- under AEDPA, that Mathis is 4 clearly established law. The issue here, however, as 5 the Sixth Circuit put it, is a warning is required 6 whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the 7 general prison population. And I just don't see that 8 anywhere in Mathis.   Counsel, you -- you mentioned several times, we were talking about Mathis, that, you know, they mentioned he was in -- in a cell, right? I've just been skimming it quickly. I don't see where that's mentioned. Do you know offhand?   And I --   I did, too. And -- well, I'll look at it again. I'm sure --   I'm sure it's there. All I see is noting that he was in prison serving a State sentence, but --   Okay. Let me --

Have we -- have we addressed that in a prior case?    Of course --    I was just going to say, of course you're making the case somewhat harder for yourself because the issue here is whether it was reasonable for him to say let me check and see what my superiors think about this and then, after that review, for him to say let's see what the magistrate thinks  16 ￼ 1   about this, right?    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wolfson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    We've been talking -- we've been talking about this for some time as if we're reviewing the adequacy of the warrant. 10 11   We're not.  We're reviewing the reasonableness of these 12   officers' determination that there was probable cause. 13               Do you think it is at all pertinent in 14   addressing that question that the officers submitted the 15   affidavit to support the warrant to Deputy District 16   Attorney Jane Wilson, who reviewed it and signed off on 17   it? 18 19 20 21   dispositive.  Is it relevant in any way?    Do you want -- do you want to encourage officers, when they're applying for search warrants, to have them reviewed by the deputy district attorney or not?    Did they enter the  44 ￼ 45 1   shot at her.

He's 7   afraid she's going to tell the police something.  Now -- 8   now, could a person reasonably read those words and 9   think he has something to hide here?  His -- and there's told you never to call the cops on me. When I first read that I thought, well, maybe he has some -- maybe this is explained in part not 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   never suggested that reading before.  And, indeed, the 17   Petitioners have -- indeed, Detective Messerschmidt 18   testified at his deposition:  No, I didn't have any 19   reason to believe that the crime was gang-related. 20               I mean, one of the curious things about 21   the -- the argument that the Petitioners are now making, 22   which is that you can go outside the warrant and import 23   into it the fact that he was a felon -- one of the 24   curious things about that is that the -- is that the 25   officers told the magistrate this is a violent crime, no something going on, and it's not just domestic? Where does that lead us if we --    And to cite Groh, a -- no reasonable officer could think that a warrant that doesn't say anything at all about what's to be seized complied with the Fourth Amendment.    Where did the --    -- may have been -- may have staying there?    And you say it was materially false that they said he resides there, and what he knew is that he may have been staying there?

It either has to be actual or imminent, and 25   it has to be concrete and particularized.  Now, again -- 55 injury-in-fact simply means particularized?    Okay.    You can -- the trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because you are talking about a property right, and you can sell 9               Here, no one's going to buy this right from 10   the -- the plaintiff, because everybody's got it anyway. 11   You don't -- you don't pay her, because she doesn't have 12   a tangible concrete right.

Well, about that argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that Justice Harlan used the term "ambiguous," right?    But he was writing very much in a pre-Chevron world.  I -- he was certainly 11   ￼ 1   not on notice that that was a term of art or would 2   become a term of art.  And, of course, I didn't know 3   him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite. 4   And you can see him saying, well, that's a good 5   argument, but....  He's not the sort of person who would 6   say this is it, this is it. 7               I don't think you necessarily can take the 8   use of the word "unambiguous" in his opinion to mean 9   what it does today.    Well, yes, that's the general principle.  But the point you made just a few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that, which is:  We're not talking about the merits; we're talking about a statute of limitations.  The whole point of a statute of limitations is some things that are bad are -- are -- are gone.    You can't go back to 20  1 2 3 4 that?    Mr. Stewart, you have 3 minutes remaining.

And that it is true that alcohol dissipates 8 over time through natural body processes. But that's 9 only after the blood alcohol level has reached its peak, 10 and that is generally about half an hour after somebody 11 has had his last drink.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    Right.  Now, the reason -- the reason we are hearing all about jurisdiction and it's kind of dressed up --    -- is simply because the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving the FCC authority to get deference, however that is phrased, is this 7(a), which speaks about nothing will limit the authority of the States.    If it weren't for that, if it were some other type of provision, that -- we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say, the FCC doesn't get deference to it.

And there have 8   been cases in which district courts have certified  1   and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to 2   decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for 3   State intestacy law or not.

Because that's -- that's, what, a class action; right?   Well, if everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came forward, it would cost you $2.7 million. And it -­   Okay. Three -­ $3 million. And you say the real problem is the huge administrative cost in trying to figure out who you owe it to. If it's that huge, all they do is somebody who comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they're -­ you know, were a homeowner on the project, give them the refund.

You really do just kind of elide the fact that 11 the statute says, "or." 12 13 meaning to the "or." We don't dispute that these are 14 three alternative ways to cram down a plan. The 15 question here is or what? And the question is the scope 16 of the alternatives and in which circumstances they 17 apply. 18 And, here, Congress turned its attention to 19 precisely the situation at hand and determined what the 20 requirements were, but not just the requirements for a 21 sale free and clear. It's not like clause (ii) says, if 22 you sell it free and clear and you allow credit bidding, 23 then that's one way to go. It's not just the 24 requirement of credit bidding.

Now, the next -­ 28     Okay.   It's a tough 29     -- even if I accept your argument that that's not the same as subject to judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get to your position? This is not something about -- a provision about what's judicially reviewable and what's not. It's a notice provision. It says these actions have to be filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review.

The Tucker Act discusses specifically the liability and the sovereign immunity of the United States, and if the statute just generally doesn't address it, then the Tucker Act is the specific one and the other statute is the general one.    You'd win under this argument, too, right?    You win under this argument, too.  It just seems to me that it's not quite right to say that FCRA -- FCRA does not specifically address the liability of the United States.

Colleges and 59 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS    It doesn't function more subtly in every case.  We have findings by both courts below -- and I'm reading from the court of appeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33.

If it doesn't make a difference, then we have a clear case; they're using race in a way that doesn't make a difference.  The supposition has to be that race is a determining factor. We've heard a lot about holistic and all that.  That's fine.  But unless it's a determining factor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't serve the purpose at all.  That can't be the situation.    You have to agree that it makes a difference in some cases.    Okay.    Just to get back to what we're talking about, you -- as I understand it, race by itself is taken into account, right?

Put in the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it. That's why all -- many of these provisions, I think, were put in, not because they were unobjectionable.

Well, why did you put the monitoring sources where they are, if that wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with 7   ￼ 1 the permit?    Where is that?  I know we've got the permit.

CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS    Counsel, I think 25  ￼ 1   there -- I see two different problems, and I'm not quite 2   sure how to come out.  One, you cannot assume that the 3   legislature's plan should be treated as if it were 4   precleared.  The district court in Texas cannot assume 5   or presume what the district court here in D.C. is going 6 to do. 7               But, on the other hand, it can't presume it 8   the other way.  In other words, it can't draw its 9   interim plan assuming that there are going to be these 10   section 5 violations because that's presuming what the 11   court's going to do the other way. 12               So, how do we decide between those two -- 13   you have two wrong choices.  How do we end up?    I don't think we do, either.  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

12-207 +++$+++     We will hear argument next this morning in Case 12-207, Maryland v. King. Ms. Winfree? ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER     Your -- your procedure limits the collection to certain violent offenses, right?  In Mr. Shamblin's case, he was granted diversion because his drug charge was a relatively low-level offense and, when the match came back, it -- it tied him to a rape and murder.  His diversion was revoked, and he's currently pending charge -- pending trial on both of those charges. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   violation?    But your argument would not be so limited, would it?  Under your theory, there's no reason you couldn't undertake this procedure with respect to anybody pulled over for a traffic 6  ￼ 1   just the fact that we have those -- those violent crimes 2   and burglaries.  Actually, we don't collect DNA unless 3   someone is physically taken into custody. 4               Now, with respect to --    Well, that is right. But I'm curious as to why your position is that -- let's say he served his time.  He's no longer subject to the criminal justice system.  He's not on parole; he's not a probationer.  You concede that the DNA evidence can be taken from him, correct?    Well, I mean, isn't that part of the -- isn't that part of the question, whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in a person's DNA?    There are two different -- two different interests.  One is we want to solve unsolved crimes; and the other is we want to be sure -- we have someone in our custody, and we want to be sure, before he is released back into the community, that he isn't a person who has committed five violent crimes before that. Now, your brief says, well, the only interest here is the law enforcement interest.  And I found that persuasive because of the concern that it's going to take months to get the DNA back anyway, so they 42  ￼ 1   are going to have to release him or not before they know 2   it. 3               But if we are in a position where it now 4   takes 90 minutes -- or will soon take 90 minutes to get 5   the information back, I think that's entirely 6   different because, there, you can find out whether -- 7   it's just tied in with the bail situation, do you want 8   to release him or not?    Well, let's put it this way.  Let's -- let's say the judge or the magistrate is going to make a bail determination and he says, well, it's important to me to know whether you are going to commit another crime. So we are not saying you have to give a DNA sample, but it will enter into my calculation if you refuse to do it.    Well, what does that mean?  Is that okay or not?    Well, we do it -- doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer?  You are pulled over, they say, we want you to take a Breathalyzer test.  They say, you don't have to, but, if 44  ￼ 1   you don't, your license is suspended for 6 months or 2   whatever. 3               Why isn't that the same thing.    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Winfree, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER    How can I base a decision today on what you tell me is going to happen in 2 years?  You say, in 2 years, we will have this rapid DNA available, but we don't now. Don't I have to base a decision on what we have today?
