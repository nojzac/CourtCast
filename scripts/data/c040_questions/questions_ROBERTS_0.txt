04-1264 +++$+++     Thank you, Mr. Mr. Bland. ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. PAUL BLAND, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    I guess what they is that there -- they insist only that the be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 provision, of course, is the provision that refers only 2 to the -- not only applies to the United States 3 district courts, that refers to jurisdiction under 4 title 28 and twice refers to the Federal Rules of Civil 5 Procedure, and that in the Southland case in footnote 6 10, this Court said doesn’t apply in the State courts. 7 Section 2 doesn’t use the word agreement. 8 Section 2 uses the word contract, Mr. Chief Justice. 9 And the word contract is a very different idea than 10 agreement. If section 2 had said an agreement in 11 interstate commerce or a transaction in interstate 12 commerce, perhaps they would have a point. But the 13 Court, instead, used -- excuse me. The Congress, 14 instead, used the word contract. Contract is one of 15 the most important words in the law. 16 Now, when the Court in Prima Paint looked at 17 this, in the first sentence, the very first sentence of 18 Prima Paint, the Court said this case involves a 19 contract involving the U.S. Arbitration Act. And in 20 the first sentence, the Court said this case is a case 21 involving contracting parties. The Court didn’t say 22 we’re going to see what the arbitrator thinks as to 23 whether there’s a contract. 24 In Prima Paint, this Court did it the right 25 way. They said section 2 -- does it apply first? Only 27  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 if it does apply, only if once after we have crossed 2 that Rubicon will we go to the next step. 3 Then the Court in Prima Paint goes and 4 discusses whether or not the interstate commerce prong 5 has been met. And there’s a long discussion of is this 6 in interstate commerce or not, and they find that it 7 is. 8 Well, under their theory, under petitioner’s 9 theory, why should the Court be deciding interstate 10 commerce? Arbitrator -- the interstate commerce issue 11 goes to the whole contract. Why shouldn’t the 12 arbitrator decide the interstate commerce issue?

How is it different here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for a certain period, and then it's being released later, at a subsequent time?  Why --    -- isn't that also a discharge?    So, you think it's a case if it's not a continuous motion; in you know, the week, it distinction the Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 distinction we would draw would be when the exercise 2 over the water, and the separation of the water from 3 the river, reach the point where it could be said that 4 we're no longer dealing with one unitary body of water, 5 as that term is defined in Miccosukee.

It's not final.  Can the district court take that into account in deciding not to issue an injunction?    Right.    Well, that's what struck me as odd there.  Footnote 27 says that's a basis for staying the injunction.  It seems to me if it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis not to issue one in the first place.    I'm curious about your nonwillful infringer.  You're devaluing the value of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply because the people who infringed it weren't willful, and I wonder why that makes sense.

Now, it depends on how one defines 7   those terms.  But as we understand it it's conflict 8   preemption, not field preemption, in the following 9   sense.  Our position is not that State laws have no 10   application to operating subsidiaries or to national 11   banks for that matter.  It's that State laws apply to 12   the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would 13   to national banks.  And as this court has made clear in 14   the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State 15   laws do apply to national banks and operating 16   subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State 17   contract law would be an example.  But with operating 18   subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with 19   corporate governance questions, for example the process 20   of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and 21   things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal 22   law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.

In 14   most cases, creditors don't, because it's not worth the 15   effort of asserting the claim for fees subsequently.  In 16   cases such as this, where you have a solvent debtor who 17   can pay all claims in full, there's no reason why they 18   should be able to get out of their contractual 19   obligations in bankruptcy.    Well, there may be no briefs from them because it isn't the question on which we granted cert, is it?    Thank you, Counsel.    Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    Why -- it doesn't?    If it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari.    Well, not everyone. I'm not clear on it.    No, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?    And if that's true -- and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.    No.  It's quite unlike the situation, for example in Timbers, where had you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest. There is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees. 10 11 12 13   just going to get there.  Timbers underscores this 14   proposition.  Timbers focused on the structure of 506 15   and it began with and it underscored, the only words 16   that it underscored were, "to the extent that."  But let    Counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and I -- earlier you told me 10   extensive dictum.  So the First Circuit comes out our 11   way in Adams versus Zimmerman.  The Second Circuit comes 12   out also in dictum on Travelers' side in United 13   Merchants.  And then the Sixth Circuit splits the baby 14   in half, or reads the code all the way up to our 15   position as we do, and then takes a detour in another 16   direction.

Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking attorneys' fees.    So we still have to 10   opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted 11   cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the 12   rule that we have to decide.

Well, you may not -- you may not rely on the distinction, but I would have thought your answer might have been that the lawyer had an equitable claim apart from the contractual provisions so that when you enforce the contractual provisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in equitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim apart from the particular provisions of the contract.

But you can't give that answer because then it starts to look like a legal claim. Instead, you get mired in all these obscure equitable doctrines because you're -- when there's a simple answer there in black and white, but it's in the contract.  And as soon as you say that, it starts to sound legal rather than equitable.    Your theory is that your argument would be exactly the same if you did not have this provision in your contract.  It's an equitable claim.  It's an age-old subrogation right. You just sue in equity saying, look, I paid the medical expenses, I'm entitled to it.  You don't need the contractual provision at all.

FOSTER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    Well, it's not defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same sentence says individual, partnership, corporation.  So you'd assume whatever an individual is it's different than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say corporation again.    So they hire more than one person.    How is that different than a normal contractual relationship that a corporation is going to have with any number of suppliers, vendors, agents?    No, but I'm trying to see what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law --    -- that would otherwise be applicable.

05-493 +++$+++     Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Multhaup. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC S. MULTHAUP ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 23  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   of our core position.  This case does not turn on the 5   constitutional factor (k) standing alone.  Rather, it 6   turns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test, 7   to the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during 8   the arguments, instructions to deliberations at the 9   penalty trial of this case. 10             Here are the two key components of our claim. 11   During arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the 12   jury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious 13   experience was not covered by factor (k).  However, both 14   counsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered 15   anyway.  Now, this is unusual, because, of all -- of all 16   the things that the district attorney and the defense 17   counsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on, 18   and it's likely that the jury would have taken note of 19   that. 20             The case then proceeded to instructions and 21   deliberations.  The jury came back to court, announced 22   that they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority 23   favoring life.  The turning point occurred when one juror, 24   Juror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the 25   specific list of factors previously given was the only 24    Why does that --    Why does that matter? Because the jury was told that the factors were merely examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.    It probably didn't fit into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   illustrative."  There was no list of mitigating factors. 20   There was only a single list, unitary list, of factors 21   that could be either aggravating or mitigating, depending 22   on a jury's decision. 23             The instruction that you're referring to, Your 24   Honor, was a -- was the result of the trial court denying 25   some, and granting some, parts of the special instructions 26    Before you move on, Counsel --    -- don't you --    -- don't you have to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the 2   judgment became final.  Isn't that kind of a hard argument 3   to make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v. 4   Payton? 5 6 7 8   opinion.  It's a straightforward application of Boyde to 9   the totality of circumstances that occurred.    Well, Penry was considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in Graham versus Collins, though.    Because if it was --    -- because, even if  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reason -- there is every reason to provide Belmontes 2   relief, where it was denied to Payton.

On the other hand the statute 4   also says that his certification is conclusive.    Well, they wouldn't have discretion in that case, though, because the statute says the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal.    I thought maybe your answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.    It would still be conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter    Well, the 12 13   jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that.  Justice Ginsburg's 14   point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I 15   take it is because these are not separate State claims 16   appended to what you thought was a Federal claim.  This 17   is the same claim that you initially thought was a 18   Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law 19   claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for 20   purposes of jurisdiction.

The 5   first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims. 6   The other three are styled as patent law claims.  And it's 7   important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in 8   Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the 9   cases, has said it's very important to look behind the 10   labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on 11   their claims.  We need to actually see what is the cause 12   of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an 13   accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing, 14   ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction. 15             I want to start by explaining why there is no 16   contract claim at issue here.  You heard today, they're 17   trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract 18   dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract.  They 19   didn't argue that below, and with good reason.  And I'd 20   just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit. 21   Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal 22   of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact 23   these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page 24   27.

The 2   causation standards are different in that instance. 3 There's a --    Under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the 19 20 21 22   impact.  It could still potentially mislead the jury, but 23   they were seeking not just to add the words "resulting in 24   whole or in part," but remove the word "directly" because 25   it connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate    But that's what Justice    You don't have to say  ￼ 1   makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't 2   appear in Section 53.  Why don't we just -- why shouldn't 3   the instruction just say, "such negligence of the 4   plaintiff contributed to cause his injury."  It's not 5   going to be a complete bar because we know the 6   immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing 7   the award by the amount of the negligence.  Why wouldn't 8   that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?    Do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?    That's why you don't have "in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part.

And 12   the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because 13   he's paying too much to the runners. 14               The first one, the more successful 15   operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money 16   laundering because its has profits.

But it is 7   another thing entirely for the Court to decline to 8   exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess.  In 9   Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already 10   quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds 11   for denying audience to a case on the merits. 12               Now, the dividing line between a threshold 13   non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases 14   be difficult.  And the Court has -- members of the Court 15   have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set 16   of cases and that is where the Court is declining to 17   exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it 18   is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive 19   dispute in another forum. 20               And this Court has -- has decided already 21   that it is permissible, for example, for a court to 22   decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before 23   deciding a difficult question of whether it would 24   possess subject matter jurisdiction over the 25   supplemental claims at all. 12 SUPPORTING PETITIONER    But not if there's, I presume, if there's an appeal.

In fact, the natural order 6   would be to decide jurisdictional issues first. 7               But as the Court held in the analogous 8   circumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are 9   circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that 10   order, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue 11   or, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden 12   of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or 13   foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the 14   end in any event. 15               If the Court has no further questions --

And so if there was some sort of 16   error, the defendant would have to make the necessary 17   showings for plain error review, and on that I would 18   like to address, since we are on the subject, that if 19   the Court disagreed with us on the merits, Rule 52(b) 20   would apply and we think that all the concerns that 21   animate a contemporaneous objection rule are at their 22   peak when the defense counsel expressly agrees to the 23   course of action followed by the court, and Petitioner's 24   rule of automatic reversal would open the door to 25   gamesmanship and sandbagging because it would allow 35

Medtronic's view of the pre-market 16   approval process is that it results in an FDA decision 17   that a particular device must be designed, labeled, and 18   manufactured in a particular way.  This view is 19   incorrect, and so I want to talk -- begin by talking 20   about what pre-market approval is and what it isn't. 21   PMA is FDA's permission to market a Class 3 device.  The 22   manufacturer PMA device develops the design and chooses 23   the -- choosing it on its own.  After the company 24   submits the application, the FDA evaluates it, based on 25   information submitted, but it does no independent 3 please the Court: The question in this case is whether Section 360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempts State law claims seeking damages for injuries caused by a device that received  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   testing, no product development, no comparison with 2   other products to see if this one is as good as or 3   better than existing products -- or even if it's the 4   best that it can be. 5               If the information submitted by the company 6   meets the statutory standard, reasonable assurance of 7   safety and effectiveness, the FDA grants PMA, thus 8   permitting the device to be sold.  So the FDA approves 9   the design and labeling chosen by the manufacturer, but 10   the agency doesn't require the manufacturer to choose -- 11   to make those choices. 12               Once on the market, a PMA device may prove 13   to be unsafe, because very often problems and hazards 14   come to light only after the device is in widespread 15 use. So --    They should have made the change to make it safer, right?    Well, if that's --    Right.  I thought that was your -- your theory was a little more nuanced. In other words, they don't require you to market a 5 6 7 8   particular catheter.  And you -- what I understood you  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   of the new device and that might take forever or at 2   least a year, let's say.  And what happens to patients 3   in that year?  They've got no device. 4 5 6 7   of tort suits.  And we know that because --    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Olson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B.

06-313 +++$+++     That was objected to and the objection was sustained, correct? 10 11 12   objection was sustained.  That doesn't mean that 13   comment -- 14 15   given.    Which in that case, 28    Well, pick which one do you think is the most directly applicable.    So Judge -- Judge  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    Well no, he specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours and that there these other generally applicable decisions and he thought the state courts had broad -- a broader range when there was no decision on all fours. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   I'm wrong.  But even -- I don't think it is also under 18   Justice O'Connor's opinion in williams versus Taylor, 19   you don't have to, this doesn't works at the level of 20   saying well, any one judge is unreasonable.  The point 21   is, it's an objective standard, not is this judge, you 22   know, somehow out of touch here?    I'm reading at the bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.    What the defense lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   message statement about five times.  She was trying in 25   that one limited instance to tackle that and say well, 43 vote for life, you are still doing your duty.    How was that message -- a different message, I guess, but he can say send a message, but the prosecutor can't?    Six.  And the jury determined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that this was the guy who did it.  So you do have to look at the penalty phase in the context of those facts. 10 11 12 13 14 15   also I think needs to be taken into account.  He was a 16   witness, but he was also a drug dealer and involved in 17   the drug trade and was a straw purchaser for these Shurn 18   families.  And in many instances --    Of course, the 17   argument by the defense wasn't -- and it's hard for me 18   to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't 19   extend beyond the particular individuals.
06-376 +++$+++     Don't you think it's kind of strange, though, if you have the interest abatement is available only for a particular category of taxpayer and not others?    If you have a net 27  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   it's anomalous.  I think if you consider the concept of 5   interest under the tax code, the way it works under the 6   tax code is interest accrues on an unpaid tax liability 7   from the time the tax is due until the time the tax is 8   paid.  So the amount of underpayment is the amount of 9   taxpayer is borrowing from the Government.  The interest worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.    Right, but you abate it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.    That's what I  ￼10   situation. 11 12 13 - Subject to Final Review 1   dollars and 300 of it is interest.    But I thought what you had argued before when people would try to seek this release was that there's no standard of review to hold the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.    But one thing you never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because - Subject to Final Review 10   there is jurisdiction in the district court.  If you've 11   paid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can 12   bring a refund action.    Is it part of the same proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?    You're making the claim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the 46 - Subject to Final Review 1   too is not a significant anomaly.  The vast majority of 2   taxpayers seek redetermination of their tax liability in 3   the tax court and those taxpayers must split their 4   claims because the interest abatement claim doesn't 5   ripen until the taxpayer's underlying liability has been 6   assessed.  Moreover, the interest abatement question is 7   distinct from the taxpayer's underlying liability.

That's the reading 5   the State gives his voir dire but it's not there. 6   Because that would prevent him from making the decision 7   that Washington requires.    You don't go as far as Judge Kozinski? (Laughter.)    Now on the that, just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea 37 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   is Mr.  Matthews' objection.  And the court makes 9   basically an unadorned grant of objection that for 10   cause.    In your view, do we look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we 41  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   give deference to the trial court's findings.  AEDPA 10   has, of course, codified that deference by saying that 11   the trial judge has to be objectively unreasonable based 12   upon the facts developed at the trial court level.    So that makes a difference in the standard of review that we apply in this case?    Substantially 8 9 10 11 12   ability.

06-427 +++$+++     Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Mr. Himmelfarb? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB 16  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim.  This 8   Court's decisions establish that when the government 9   offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it 10   has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when 11   it exercises its coercive sovereign power.  As in cases 12   where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor, 13   a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor, 14   the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic 15   competition, that a school may decline by choosing not 16   to become a member of the association. 17                 Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to 18   the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to 19   deferential review.  Deferential First Amendment review 20   is appropriate in these contexts because the Government 21   occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its 22   sovereign authority.  On the one hand the Government 23   remains the Government no matter what authority it's 24   exercising -- so it is subject to the restrictions of 25   the First Amendment. 17 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER    I'm sorry; you think it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?    It's a close call whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that is not limited to athletics telling them about their 10 11 12   school? 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   hypothetical.  There are a number of ways in which 21   schools can communicate with prospective students and 22   their families about athletics at the school, but it's 23   usually done through intermediaries.  And I think as I 24   say, Justice Stevens' hypothetical is not --    Or would it be unreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?    Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Blumstein? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. BLUMSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 25  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   what we call the TSSAA.  The case involves the First 8   Amendment's interest of the school, its students, its 9   parents, and the procedural due process interests. 10               Brentwood was severely punished, and the 11   punishment is listed in footnote 5 of our brief, for 12   communicating with its own incoming male students, 13   informing them of an opportunity, spring football 14   practice, that the students were authorized to attend 15   under the TSSAA rules.

Are you saying that Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.    Well, then what was Congress trying to do when they said strong inference? It seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no Seventh Amendment problem.

It says they will be liable to, under 12   certain circumstances, the United States, a State or an 13   Indian tribe and they are liable for -- for other costs 14   incurred by any other person.  And it just seems that 15   the most natural reading of that construction is that 16   the other refers to other than the United States or a 17   State or an Indian tribe.

It's no surprise that some of the 7   largest polluters in America have lined up in support of 8   this view, because this will allow them to reopen 9   settlements and go after parties who thought they had 10   paid up their liability and obtained settlement 11   protection by virtue of the Section 113(f) settlement 12   bar.

And it's a very complicated thing because 11   we're dealing with people often in these cases that 12   don't have assets and only limited responsible parties 13   have the assets.  So they're trying to recover what they 14   can from the others.    As you read the statute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other person doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?

No, my suggestion is 21 - Subject to Final Review 1   that's true, because the problem would be you would go 2   to the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate 3   education and you would have -- you would essentially 4   have to make a facial challenge rather than an 5   as-applied one, and the school would say, well, you 6   didn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we 7   were going to do that.  So it would be a heavier burden 8 9 10 11 13   though, for everybody in the system, it doesn't depend 14   on an impartial hearing.   You have to give notice 15   before you get to the next step.  If you're outside the 16   system, you don't have to participate in any process 17   other than to seek at an impartial hearing the right to 18   get reimbursement.  So that actually there's less 19   bureaucratic processes outside the system, and there's 20   and incentive (1) not to cooperate and (2) just to 21   marshal all your arguments in the impartial hearing and 22   hopefullyl you're going to prevail and get the payment 23   for the private education; whereas, if you're in the 24 system -- to carry.

You read "who previously received special education services," and you say that includes who previously did not receive special education services.    There would be no reason for Congress to put that language in if the same right to reimbursement existed if the child had not previously received special education services.    Because your friend reads that the exact opposite way and says, since (C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public school, that that's a limitation on how you should read 29  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   (C)(ii).    In that case, isn't 4 5 6 7   "Reimbursement for Private School Placement"?  It 8 9 10 doesn't say reimbursement for private school placement when the child previously attended public school. it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says    That just means that (C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues    Where is that set 12 13   forth?    Well in my case they would note have received any benefits, under the terms of the statute.    What you're saying is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going to be a hurdle in some cases.    That's why your friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make clear that the public school is -- whether it is or is 8   situation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it 9   doesn't serve that purpose at least?

It's not a case about a monopoly, and 17   what's key about that is that Kentucky has not taken 18   over the national municipal bond market.  It hasn't 19   taken over the market.  It is trying to regulate the 20   market with this facially discriminatory tax.  It is 21   facially discriminatory because on its face the statute 22   says if you buy in Kentucky an in-State bond you have a 23   tax exemption.  If you're in Kentucky and you buy the 24   out-of-State bond, we tax you.  This is no different 25   from the Bacchus case or the Fulton case or Boston Stock 18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    So you want to suggest -- I'm sorry.    Are you suggesting that the result in United Haulers would have been different if there were a competing trash processing facility out-of-State?    Well, they are not  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   your characterization that this case should be treated 2   exactly as if the State were acting merely in a 3   regulatory capacity?    But the fact that bonds are bonds doesn't seem to me to be very    Your argument that you just presented in response to Justice Stevens' 34 - Subject to Final Review 1   discriminatory -- in essence, tariff. 2               If you live in Kentucky, we want to 3   discourage you from buying a Michigan bond.  And they do 4   it by saying we will tax the interest on the -- on the 5   out-of-State bond, and not tax the interest on the 6   in-State bond.  They are giving themselves a leg up. 7               And one of the pernicious aspects of this is 8   that it has the effect of pooling capital within the 9   national market.  It has the effect of creating this 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   they don't want to issue refunds.  You can understand 17   that.  A short-term gain for a long-term solution that discriminatory barrier.    Your clients are not out-of-State issuers. 16   commerce. 17    So your Kentucky taxpayers can argue about the discrimination against out-of-State bond issuers?    Well, that's not fair because Kentucky is going to use the proceeds of the bonds to build a hospital, a school that is going to serve Kentucky residents.    So there's -- it's not just emotional attachment to Kentucky that would promote the purchase of those bonds by Kentucky - Subject to Final Review 10   residents.  It's self-interest.  They want a public 11 12 13 14   every tax serves a public purpose.  Every tax is for the 15   State's purposes.  If this Court opens the door in this 16   case to say that this facially discriminatory tax regime 17   is okay, this Court will open the door to all of the 18   discriminatory taxes the Court has heretofore struck 19   down.  This case -- this Court's discriminatory tax 20   precedents --    You don't see a dormant Commerce Clause, though. (Laughter.)

I really get confused with you people who 17   work with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know 18   Section 3 of ERISA.  I use the code.  What -- what code 19   sections are you talking about?    But the plan itself is nowhere in the record, is that right?    Right, the summary. And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules about investment options, what you get to choose, how often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you have no choice about investment options, it's all going to be invested in T-bills or whatever.    Where in the record    No, that's in the opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in the record.    Oh, that's the summary of the plan.    But we don't know those details, correct?    Your position is anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under (a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?    It would also presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the plan, correct?    You told me earlier that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.

Thank you, Mr. Roberts. - Subject to Final Review But that is not a pleading question.  My position as to why you should reach (a)(3) is if we have a cognizable theory under (a)(2) and (a)(3), and we believe we do, we shouldn't be required to choose at this point in time if, as the litigation proceeds, it turns out that the relief we would be entitled to is coterminous, then we concede it would not be appropriate to proceed under (a)(3). 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   account.

I realize I'm talking about a suit 8 9 10 12   sparse record, it's hard to know that there could be an 13   action filed against whoever it was who is alleged to 14   have made the mistake.

But, of course, it's been 19   accepted throughout the case, and the court of appeals 20   explicitly said at page 5A, and it's been undisputed, 21   that Intel had the right to sell these items to these 22   Petitioners. 23               They had the right to sell.

That's why you would deal with this 3   as an implied licensing issue. 4               The assumption would be, in the absence of 5   clear evidence to the contrary, that if I'm selling you 6   something that only has a single use and that's in a 7   separate patent, that you in fact are being licensed to 8   go and use it that way.  But what's absolutely critical 9   in this case is that both the district court and the 10   court of appeals specifically rejected the notion that 11   there was any implied license.  And it's important to 12 13 14 15   side received its notice.  We sued only for the 16   activities post notice.  Why?  Because at that stage it 17   was absolutely clear that there was no implied license 18   any longer and there's no basis for expanding the 19   exhaustion doctrine to try to fill that void. 20               The exhaustion doctrine ought to be retained 21   as a very narrow first sale doctrine, because it doesn't 22   have any congressional support or approval at this 23   point.  It is a logical way of proceeding.  It protects 24   people against being surprised when they purchase a 25   particular product.  But to go beyond that and to say 28 realize this.

They may have stopped 14   him because they have reason to believe that that car 15   was involved in criminal activity.  They don't have to 16   disclose immediately what's involved. 17               So how can the passenger know why the 18   officer is stopping the person in the first place? 19   Hypothesize that he has been involved in criminal 20   activity.  He may think, well, they've caught me and 21   they're just going through this charade to try to get 22   information about it and make the people feel 23   comfortable, whatever.

Why isn't the -- why isn't the "seizure" and the "consensual" aspect also mutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each    No.  The converse situation is that so long as the interaction continues, it is a seizure, and the officer can take reasonable  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Drayton situation, Your Honor.

It's not simply a  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that these various Federal resolutions, including the 2   Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a 3   particular way that precluded the burdening of the 4   State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they 5   would have to find a basis under State law that was not 6   inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect 7 title. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    And if the Hawaiian Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the status of the land prior to admission, then it has to run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be consistent with the Federal provisions.

ALLISON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    So your idea is there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall out then there is no jurisdiction?    Okay, but that seems to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event -- let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't 10 11   dumping chemicals with it.  You don't then say "there is 12   no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once 13   the finding is made that the facts didn't support it, 14   then there was no jurisdiction."  You say, "there was 15   jurisdiction all the time and you lose."

On the one hand, 18   you're arguing that a request is necessary, and yet on 19   the other hand, I understood you to concede in answer to 20   a question from me that if he had stood in the courtroom 21   in Tennessee, having been told that counsel was 22   appointed for him and had said, yes, thank you, I accept 23   that lawyer, that that would have been sufficient to 24   satisfy Jackson, and that would have made the difference 25   in this case. 41 position was once there's a request, there's a request, and that's enough.    So I -- I suppose what the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any situation there's going to be factual issues about 42  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   what's a request or not.  I mean, he could say, the 2   court says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says, 3   "Johnson?  Is that the best you can do?"  And the 4   question is, is that accepting Johnson or not?  He says 5   is that the best you can do?  Maybe it is, maybe it's 6   not.  I mean, but the point is whether or not you 7   establish a rule that requires some request, and in the 8   odd case there will be a debate about what's a request 9   or not, but the issue is the general rule.

But 21   in our view, the exceptional case would be one in which 22   the ultimate determination was that the cost of the 23   remedy, the amount of the relevant harm, would be more 24   or less the same even if only one defendants's 25   contamination were at issue, that it -- 49  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    But is that right?

The example that the restatement 4 5 6 7 8 9 gives is two merging fires that destroyed a building. And so I think it is established in -- in the second restatement that the -- there is no apportionment if either of two causes would have brought about the -- the feared harm. With -- with respect to the third restatement, I would say that at least in the case of -- 10 11   you're -- you're right.  There is no exact counterpart 12   to comment (h) in the third restatement.

But this other guy thinks he's just honestly    So when the government -- when the phrase "by the government" was added -- was it in '86?    There were a lot of 46  ￼21   government. 22 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   on that subject.  But I have two answers for you, 8   Mr. Chief Justice.  First, if you look at the '82 9   version of the statute, there were six liability 10   provisions set out.  A seventh was added in '86, (a)(7). 11   But of the first six that were added in '82, when they 12   broke this long sentence down into parts, every one of 13   those provisions except for (a)(2} dealt with either "by 14   the government" or "defrauding the government."  (A)(7) 15   likewise has such similar language. 16               My first point to you is that I believe that 17   when Congress amended this statute in '86 it wanted all 18   provisions to be consistent with each other in that 19   sense that we're talking about fraud on the government, 20   not fraud against private parties, fraud on the statutes that said "with Federal funds," right?    So why did the Congress add the phrase "by the government" instead of "with Federal funds" if it meant the same thing?    Right.  So I guess I get back -- you read "by the government" as if it said "with Federal funds"? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   still win.  That was your point to Justice Scalia, I 17   guess.

And I think it's important to frame the 20   discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction 21   that's at issue in this case.  It's at Pet. App.  301a. 22               It says that a managerial agent is someone 23   who supervises other employees and has responsibility 24   for, and authority over, particular aspects of a 25   corporation's business. 37    So you regard the ship as a business unit? 10 11 12   ship as, and so that's what the record says.  And the 13   idea is that you had --    That was a question that I asked, not a statement. Well, how do you draw the line?  I mean, is the second in command on the boat a man responsible for  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the question is whether he's responsible for policy. 2   Again, it's whether he's the person in charge. 3               What Exxon during instruction to the 4   district court asked the jury to be required to find is 5   that there was a shore-based supervisory official of the 6   Exxon defendants who made the decision.  So Exxon itself 7 8 9 recognized that you have to draw the line somewhere. We think the best place to draw the line, and the conservative place to law, the line is the managerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement. 10 11 12   States that follow a different rule.  And it's important 13   to understand that that's not the case.  Even among the 14   States that follow the Lake Shore formulation in 15   general, you still have to have a way to implement it. 16   It's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be 17   complicit, you still have to tell the jury which human 18   beings they can look to for that complicity. 19               So at page 33 of our red brief --    What is your 52    In a case like this.    So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   that's the question I'm asking.  What if there is a 19   breach of the corporate policy?  I don't see what more a 20   corporation can do.  I mean, your --- other than -- 21   other than what?  I mean it has to say that the policy 22   is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're 23   liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case 24   shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the 25   individual is liable for punitive and other awards. 53 damages awards such as this?    Well, and assume it has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?    And you're saying --  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               But what more can the corporation do other 2   than say here is our policies?  And try to implement 3   them.    I suppose that would go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is 10 11   enforced.  If the president of the company isn't 12   following the policy it's not going to be taken very 13   seriously.  That's different than saying you have a 14   situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm 15   company policy is breached, the individual is breaching 16   the policy.    A while ago you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability    A little while ago, you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.    But I was -- I would have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   you look to Federal law.  And whether it's directly 2   applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act 3   reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting 4   liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was 5   intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy. 6   And why isn't that something we should look to, at least 7   under question three?    Right.    This is the same judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to Exxon, right?    So he was operating that under understanding of the law.

If the mandate said the sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it seems to me that leaves open the full range of legitimate sentencing.    Well, but the court 5  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14   -- 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 - Subject to Final Review of appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to file a notice of cross-appeal.

How are you ever supposed to get consensus moving in the opposite direction?  In other words, you look to the number of States under Roper and Atkins who impose it, and you say, well, most of them are abolishing it, so we think it's unconstitutional, combined with other  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 consensus, so it's unconstitutional.  And do 20 States have to get together and do it at the same time?  Or how are they supposed to move the inquiry under Atkins and Roper in the opposite direction?    If somebody in this case is tried and convicted under that law, you would say:  Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not a sufficient trend in favor of that. 14  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               And it just seems to me that that 2   understanding of Atkins and Roper prevents the 3   development of the law except in one direction.    But we're talking    -- if were talking about evolving trends, I think it's fair to say that society's recognition of the seriousness of the crime of rape has evolved even since, the period since Coker. Now isn't that something that we should take into consideration?    It certainly involved -- evolved since the time of Blackstone and even since -- as I say, even since Coker.  So while Coker may have thought rape of an adult wasn't serious enough to warrant the death penalty when the legislature had made a contrary determination, perhaps that would be addressed differently if -- differently today; and certainly rape of a child would be understood not to be not included in Coker's analysis.

07-474 +++$+++     We'll argument next in Case 07-474, Engquist v. Oregon Department of 1 2 3 4 5   Agriculture. and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held that no 10 11 12 13 14 15   fundamental right.  No matter how outrageous or evil and 16   no matter how unrelated to any legitimate government 17   interest, the clause provides zero protection.  This 18   theory is contrary to the Constitution's text.  It is 19   inconsistent with this Court's precedents.  It is 20   unworkable and is unnecessary. 21               The Ninth Circuit ignored the Equal 22   Protection Clause's guarantee to any person that the 23   State will not use its vast powers to discriminate 24   without a legitimate government purpose and particularly 25   not in ways that lead to inefficient government. 3 discrimination against a public employee is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause unless the targeted person is a member of the suspect class or exercises a  ￼9 10 11    So that what you do in this case -- I mean the person is fired and that's  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Circuit, of course, cuts off even that very deferential 2   inquiry altogether.  Now --    No, no.  The record shows she was -- a few times she punched in late.    But you're going to 9   thought he was entitled, that's now a Federal case.    But Title VII, there's no --you know, there is no, "because you don't like me," it's not because I'm a particular race or --    Can I ask you more -- perhaps a more abstract question about this 10 11 12   class-of-one? 13               Doesn't that have the effect of adding an 14   equal protection claim to every violation of law?  In 15   other words, you have a Fourth Amendment search and 16   seizure claim, and you're treated illegally; you say 17   well, everybody else was treated legally and I wasn't, 18   so it's an equal protection violation?  You get -- you 19   know, the zoning ordinance, it was improper under the 20   zoning law, and because everybody else was properly 21   treated, it's a violation of equal protection.    No, but, as your friend points out, the constitutional provision says 10 11 12 13 14 15   with Olech.  We -- text does us any affirmative good, but I don't think it goes as far as Petitioner would have it go.

Why did you, you know, whip that person?  They 20   will say:  Because they were going to kill me.  They are 21   not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased 22   against his race or religion.

Well, speaking of -- to get back to the language, what's wrong with saying, 40 - Subject to Final Review    So that must mean, I gather, or could mean that "assisted" does not have as broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the "otherwise participated" language would be unnecessary and redundant.    Right.    Well, I'm not sure that's right, because if "otherwise participated" covers -- "assisted" does not include "otherwise participated," and I understood your broad reading of "assisted" to cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say "assisted" needs to be interpreted with "ordered" and "incited," and if it is, then "otherwise participated" should be interpreted along the same lines.    Is he or is he not participating in the persecution?    So you think there was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?    What I may have  ￼22 23 24 25    But you would say the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their hair is cut, right?    You would view that 47  ￼23 24 25 said we were just following orders, and we did not want to grant those people asylum. Now in this post-World War II effort, we are 48 - Subject to Final Review 1   as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the 2   person is not going to be executed unless the woman does 3 her job?

Consistent with the last 8   two decades of this Court's instructional error 9   jurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of 10   error at issue is not structural and is subject to 11   harmless error review. 12               The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation 13   of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an 14   invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid 15   one somehow makes the error worse.

I believe that disposes of this case. 19               Second, counsel relies on a definition of 20   “representative payee” in the offset regulations.  That's 21   addressed at reply -- our reply, page 2, footnote 1.

GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Well, then why do you have --   Why do you have a policy, a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says anything about all-comers. You’ve got a written policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.

So why do you do have the second 19   paragraph? 20 21   guidance.  But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any 22   debate about what policy is at issue here.  The Ninth 23   Circuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long. 24   The first sentence describes the policy at issue in this 25   case.

There 5   is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's 6   policy.  The school's interest is not in allowing 7   students to disrupt the activities of students' 8 groups --   No, you’re talking about --   -- La Raza background. As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the organization.    Okay.

I’d like to go right to some 5   of the questions that this Court had about the language 6   that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler 7   decision.  Both -- all of this language comes up in 8   Butler.  Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of 9   the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to 10   counsel.  So the suspect said "I will talk to you," but 11   the North Carolina Supreme Court said:  Well, we don't 12   know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why 13   the court got into a question of implied waiver. 14               So the Court in its analysis in Butler first 15   reviewed this language that the Court has talked about 16   this morning from Miranda that says "A valid waiver will 17   not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused 18   or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact 19   eventually obtained." 20              And this is our understanding of that language: 21   First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda 22   rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver. 23              Now, Justice Scalia, I think you 24   alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth 25   Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or 20

And so in that 8   situation, what Congress did was it both created a cause 9   of action against state sponsors of terrorism and their 10   officials and waived immunity. 11               In the TVPA, all that Congress did was to 12   create a cause of action.

This 8   Court does not need to reach the question of whether or 9   not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act 10   or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because 11   maintenance and cure is different.  It precedes the 12   Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years, 13   and it deals with a distinctly different problem. 14               Maintenance and cure deals with a situation 15   as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back 16   to health and get him into the workforce?  And the law 17   has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in 18   the 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in 19   its capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman 20   with medical care and to provide that seaman with a 21   living allowance so that he can get better and get back 22   into the work force. 23               Now in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make 24   the United States merchant marine the world's greatest 25   merchant marine.

The court of appeals    Well, that's different than saying there always has to be available  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    I'm sorry --    I don't like it very But what is -- your argument is that the Constitution does not require that this person have, right now, an available avenue of relief, your position?    Well, so I think 36  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   would Congress intend to afford greater relief and 2   remedies to somebody who's outside -- was within the 3   military system and is now outside, than to an ordinary 4   civilian under Article III jurisdiction?    Within -- within the military system?    At any time somebody who is out of the military system, whose judgment is supposedly final under the provisions that Congress has established, he could come back and knock on the door 20 years later and say, I want to review my conviction.    And he would be within the military system.    Right.    And he's back in the military system, 20 years later.    For someone still within the military system?    So the answer --    -- to Justice Ginsburg is that we have never held that with respect to a situation like the facts here, where you're dealing 47    Under the specific    Under the specific provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by very strict finality provisions. There's no suggestion in his testimony that the availability of the relief that he's talking about continues after the individual is outside the military 10 11 12   system.  He's channeling -- he says these are channeled 13 14 15 16   Honor.  I read it as channeling apt post-final attacks 17   within the military -- within the courts in the military 18   justice system, even though the person is -- is -- a 19   final judgment typically happens before an individual is 20   no longer in the service.  A final judgment is final 21   because the discharge has been executed.  So what he's 22   referring to is, once you have a final judgment, you 23   then can seek collateral relief in the military the way 24   you used to be able to do it in the correction boards in 25   the military courts.  And he was saying, now that we're 51 through a specific provision applicable only within the military system.    I'm sorry.  I've had the chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and like Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in there that the relief he's talking about continues after someone is out of the service.    Well, a final judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts within -- in the military system, just like you have -- a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review in our system. 13 14 15 16 17 18   difference is that -- two things:  He's referring to 19   post-finality, which means that the discharge or the -- 20   you know, the sentence has been executed.  The person is 21   out.  They're a civilian at that point.  And coram    Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    But I guess, as I understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order is based on funding a particular plan and the State 16   budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can 17   afford to spend on this particular program.  Here's 18   another plan.  The funding levels are different.  You 19 20 21 22   that? 23 should look at it.    What's wrong with 25   court did look at it, and what the district court found 33    Well, I don't think the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   fundamentally different assertions being made by 2   Petitioners, if I understand it:  One is what 3   Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No 4   Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way 5   such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as 6   it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA. 7               Now, there's a distinct argument that's also 8   being made which is that conditions on the ground have 9   improved as a consequence of management improvements. 10   Regardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual 11   argument, that factually things have changed in a way 12   that ought to let us from underneath the district 13   court's supervision. 14               Now, the -- they are different points, and I 15   think the district court addressed both of them.  With 16   respect to the second one, where there is the facts on 17   the ground, what is critical is that, in order to 18   justify complete dissolution in a case like this, the 19   Petitioners would have to show, not only that conditions 20   have improved, but they have improved in a way that is 21   durable and sustainable over time.  And the district 22   court -- 23 24 25 36    Is there any --    Does -- then does  ￼17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 is bizarre. - Subject to Final Review 1   the State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I 2   don't believe the State to have done that so far.  But 3   the State would have to make the argument that funding 4   constraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow 5   us to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an 6   optimal program, and so here's the program that we want 7   to put in place in --    Which is?

I think when we -- when we decide there's no right to counsel, like on collateral review, we don't even look at what happened,  1   rights, the nature of the charges, the evidence, and the 2   affirmative defenses that may exist.  And that is a task 3   that is somewhat broader than the court has in 4   conducting a Rule 11 colloquy.  The court does not go 5   into strategic matters in a criminal case with the 6   defendant.

And --    Is that right? there a right to counsel when you are facing a deportation proceeding?    Okay.    Well, then, if there is no right to counsel, why do we get into whether there is an affirmative misrepresentation or not?    Just like in a collateral -- habeas context, we don't care whether there’s an affirmative misreputation –- misrepresentation, because there’s no right to counsel in the first place. 10 11 12 13 14   guilty belongs to the defendant personally.  It's not a 15   decision that can be exercised by proxy by the lawyer. 16   And the lawyer's duty to respect that, whatever advice 17   he gives, the defendant must be able to make his own     We assume, for  15   consequences.

The 22   counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons 23   to execute Mr. Spisak. 24               He then proceeded to tell the jury what was 25   not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors 20 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    He is on the stand with a Hitler moustache testifying about what a great job he did killing these people, and he says he is going 5 6 7 8 9   prison? particular people he wanted to kill?    And the jury is supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in    Now how is that clearly established law that your claim is -- is contrary to Mills?    That is on death or nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating circumstance exists.   Where does that say what your summary was earlier, that they -­    -- can't consider a mitigating circumstance unless they unanimously agree about it.    Well, doesn't every court tell them it's their duty to decide disputed questions of fact?    And you think that includes within it the idea that they -- they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they all 12 agree on it? 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   yes. 22 - Subject to Final Review   Okay, I just -­    It is that the sentence that says "it's your duty to did decide all disputed questions of fact is the same as saying they are instructed that they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they are unanimous? 23   counsel. 24 25
08-728 +++$+++     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    Well, that  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   So the only period of delay that you could say resulted 2   from the extension was from September 20 to October 4, 3 or 13 days. 4               Well, how can you possibly count the time as 5   a delay after he filed his extension up to the point 6   when things would have been due anyway?    Well, but how is that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed    What is the -- what is the proceeding from which you count in determining what should be excluded? 10 11 12 13 14 15   The person comes in and says:  I would like time.  The    Okay, that order -- that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day. 16 17 18 19 20 21   time, that proceeding was done.  But the order -- the 22   order granting additional time is a proceeding, and the 23   additional time that --    That proceeding takes a day.    It seems to me redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination and then also exclude mental incompetence.    Well, I guess it would be, take 15 days from what time you have calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is it above the wire?    In other words, I am contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much days you think can be excluded or not excluded.    Counsel, this may be the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to 6   September 13th, right?  On September 7th, Mr. Bloate 7   asks for additional time.  So the judge's, you know, 8   runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day. 9   One more day, so now it's due on September 14th. 10               You would say the delay resulting from that 11   extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he 12   filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.    So the delay -- so saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions results in a delay from a pretrial motion?

It has to do with trying to dry ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    I --    Not this statute.    I guess I am just trying to get at what your understanding of what the 41  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its 2   face, but will consider as-applied challenges?    I'm sorry; you agree you can prohibit it, or not?    You are unwilling -- you are unwilling to say that Congress can pass a law, even-handed, straightforward, you cannot have a human sacrifice channel.    Well, right, but, I mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it. It is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice taking place wherever in the world, so that that argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table. In that situation, you think it's unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there can be no human sacrifice channel.    No.  Go ahead. 54  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
08-810 +++$+++     No, but I think it's 16   you can possibly think of because then you’ll get 17   discretion as to each of them.  But if you only do 18   what’s efficient and say here's how I read it, then 19   you don't get any discretion at all on the other 20   provisions.    They're the 10   fact finder.  Here, the plan administrator is the  1             They exercised their discretion not to 2   defer.  The rule -- in order for Xerox to get reversal 3   on the first question, they have to convince this 4   Court that what the rule should be is that, not 5   that -- not -- we don't have to convince you that 6   there should be -- there shouldn't be deference in all 7   of these cases.  They have to convince you that a 8   lower court never has the option, unless there’s a 9   finding of bad faith, to say, yeah, I'm not going 10   to defer.  And that's not the law. 11             This very Court, in 1888, in the Colton 12   case, which the government cites in their brief, and 13   we -- and we cite, there -- the trustee said:  We're 14   not giving a benefit.  The Court said:  That's 15   arbitrary and capricious.  This Court ordered the 16   lower courts to set the benefit.  They never made a 17   finding of bad faith.    Well, since that’s a fairly stark disagreement among counsel on a factual matter, where in the record do you see 5 years?    It put in the words "phantom account"?    But defer doesn't mean uphold in every circumstance, does it?    Okay, well, then I 47  ￼ 1   don't think it's proper to say they can choose not to 2   defer.  They can defer and -- and choose to find it's 3   still an abuse of discretion.    Well, sure. (Laughter.)    They don't even need to accept a brief from the plan administrator --

Well, let's say --    Let's say that the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands 22 23 24 25   board.  This was what Mr. Carvin -- was the one thing them not to do that?    Why did -- just out of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's going to be entirely controlled by the SEC?    Are there any other -- are there any consequences from the company's refusal short of -- that would not require the board to get a subpoena?    Is it -- does it have a consequence as a practical matter for the company if it doesn't comply with a request from this board?    I'm sorry, I asked you whether there were any consequences from the failure of the company to turn over documents; and is your answer that there are no consequences whatever?    Yes, yes.    Right.  That's      All right.  So there 44  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 failure to follow the policies of the President.    So you need to rely on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can do with respect to the board constitutional.    And you need to rely on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what the President can tell the SEC constitutional. ￼10 11 12   is just a tool.  Removal is not the ultimate 13   constitutional question.  The ultimate constitutional 14   question is the level of presidential control, and the 15   presidential control here is exactly the same with 16   respect to the board's activities as it is with respect 17   to the SEC staff's activities.    Which one are we talking about, the first one or the second one?    Well, let's just   1 2 3 4 5 6   effectively can.  They would have to do it by -- I think 7   that the easiest, quickest, most legally secure way 8   would be to -- to do it by -- by promulgating a rule 9   that says you can't do this.  And then --    -- you are fired? Can they say, you are fired because we have control over what you do and we don't think you should do that?    Can the President pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?    The easiest way to do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a rule.    Right.     I'm not worried if 16 17 18 19 20 21   board.  So there you’ve got to rely on Perkins and 22 Morrison.    Right.  And then --    It goes further because you’ve got to rely on the SEC to get to the   1   whether it's the board members, who stand in essentially 2   the same relationship to the SEC commissioners as the 3   own SEC staff does.    What do they have to say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be removed by the President?    And you are not contesting it?    Thank you, General.

Counsel, could I ask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of the statute, does your theory give any independent substance to the word "right"? It seems, to me, your argument is that --    So the point -- I guess maybe this is -- maybe I asked you this before. The -- the right is not limited to specific legal obligations, but to a developing Federal common law of criminal liability?

I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be trusted without judicial review. (Laughter.) And I find that doubly curious when the Justice Department won on the opposite position below.

Counsel, one of the thing that concerns me about this type of institutional reform litigation -­   -- is that the State is responsible for a lot of different things.   And what happens when you have this case, another district court ordering the State to take action with respect to environmental damage, another court saying, well, you've got to spend this much more on education for disabled, another court saying you've got to spend this much more on something else? How does the State sort out its obligations? Does it say -­   -- well, I'll spend more money to build prisons, but I'll violate this other district court order saying I have to spend more money to build water treatment plants? 71  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   -- and you want the State to say this is where I'm going to put my money.   But the point is it's a budget prioritization that the State has to go through -­   -- every day, and now it's being transferred from the State legislature to Federal district courts throughout the State.   What I'm saying is that you have conflicting orders from different district courts telling them you've got to comply with the Constitution by spending 8 billion here; and another 72  ￼  1 court saying, I've got another constitutional problem of 2 my own, and you've got to spend 8 billion over there. 3 What is the State supposed to do in that situation?

Now, the ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   through today.  That's piecemeal litigation.

You have 15   equitable principles that say when you have two parties, 16   a party has a full and fair opportunity to praise a 17   claim or to litigate.  But the other party also has a 18   finality interest.  And once you take away your full and 19   fair opportunity by not using it, the other party's 20   interest in finality outweighs.  That's what Congress 21   envisioned in AEDPA.  That's what this Court envisioned 22   with the abuse of the write doctrine.

So it does get back 29  - Subject to Final Review 1   to the factual determination of deadlock, correct?    Right.  So the case comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine deadlock, right?    Okay.  What other explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too loud," other than that there was some degree of acrimony on the jury?    No, you don't dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we being too loud?    Well, what would that indicate other than that there was some degree of acrimony?    So there are a category of cases where a Federal court could look at it and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not entitled to relief under AEDPA?    How can you say 10   going to be a mistrial.  He exercised discretion.  He 11   looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are 12   you hopelessly deadlocked?  Are you going to be able to 13   reach a unanimous verdict? 14               And he was able to rely on the fact that 15   they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being 16   too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in 17   which there were 10 hours of testimony. 18               I mean, I understand your argument that he 19   abused his discretion, but I don't understand the 20   argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.

Well, I thought you told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't require people to reveal how they voted. 10 11 12 13 14   revealed.  We know that in some places, votes are done 15   in public.  We know that before the late 1800s, there 16   was no secret ballot.

What's day 2 in the course?    So if it is -- prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional rights by making improper statements in their closing 20 21 22 23   people.  You know that.  You know that that can happen, 24   just as you know there can be Brady violations.

Well, it might affect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional distress for a reason unconnected with the individual who is the subject of emotional distress.

No,    Thank you, counsel. Mr. MCGill. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. MCGILL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    Your case --    No, you can finish    Your case highlights -- I think is a very good example of why the lawyer ought to have qualified immunity.  I mean, this was a case where it looks like there's a lot of threatening and bullying going on.  I mean, the -- the lawyer says -- you know, we're going to figure out a way to name you, Mr. Filarsky.  You're issuing an illegal order.  If you want to take that chance go right ahead. 41  ￼ 1   You might want to think -- take a minute to think about 2   it. 3               I mean, it seems exactly the kind of 4   situation for which qualified immunity was -- was 5   developed.  We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what 6   he thinks is the right thing in this situation.  We 7   don't want him to be worried about the fact that he 8   might be sued.  And you have a lawyer here saying, well, 9   if you do that, I'm going to sue you.  So, Filarsky 10   naturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to 11   think, wow, do I really want to run that risk? Isn't that exactly why we have qualified    -- saying I'm going to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer.  And you're sitting in that situation.  Isn't that going to enter into your mind?  You say, well, sue all you want; I don't care; this is the right answer.    Right. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   know? 18     Well, how do you 20   forward with the -- what was deemed to be an 21   unconstitutional search.  So, the policy purposes of, 22   you know, wanting to prevent unwarranted timidity and 23   deterring talented candidates from working for the 24   government --    And then the chief later on says, well, he told me to issue the order.  I mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as they would if you had qualified immunity.    Well, particularly --    Well, even as -- the reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got this stuff at my house.  That's how his -- his defense is.  I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there. So, you think it's still clearly established that it violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay, well, show it to us if you want to use that as your    Are all of these -- are all of these objections applicable as well to the determination of whether there is state action from the attorney's conduct? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   action. 25               So, it -- it may be that there's a factual    Yes.

You didn't 2   consider that until the case came before this Court.    I'm sorry.  I don't see how that -- I don't see how that works. The notice is only required by the district court if the case is not moot.  If the case is moot by the notice you sent out, the district court doesn't have a case on the basis of which to order a different  ￼ 1   Whatever they won, they will have.  We believe we have 2   already given them everything they want.  If we have 3   not, the district court will do that. 4               But let me explain the second point, if I 5   may, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that there is no 6   legitimate issue here about whether the notice was 7   adequate.  Mr. Young stated quite incorrectly that the 8   notice we have provided is the same as the notice the 9   district court struck down.  That's absolutely 10   incorrect.  The district court said that the 2005 notice 11   issued before the dues increase obviously did not give 12   specific notice of the dues increase, although it stated 13   that dues could be increased. 14               The district court specifically held, at 15   Petition Appendix 73a, that the 2006 notice, which 16   described the so-called fund and the dues increase, and 17   the purposes of it, was completely adequate.  And the 18   notice the district court -- one also has to realize the 19   district court was requiring the union to refund only 20   the non-chargeable portion of activities attributed to 21   this increase. 22               A certain kind of notice would be needed for 23   that to justify how the union was computing what it was 24   saying with the chargeable portion to refund.  But what 25   the union has done here is provide greater relief than 31  ￼ 1   the district court ordered.  We have refunded every 2   penny that anyone who requests had paid during the 3 increase. 4               So, there's no serious question that the 5   notice that the union sent out, which explained what the 6   increase had been spent on, sufficiently informed 7   individuals as to whether they now want to get back 8   every penny, as we've offered them, of what they paid 9   under the increase.

I can see the Federal 2   question jurisdiction issue being straightforward. 3   Federal law creates this cause of action; therefore, you 4   can say that it is -- under 1331, there's jurisdiction, 5   but then you can't do anything once you're in Federal 6   court because the private right of action is limited to 7   State court.    Counsel, I -- we've 10 11 12 13   into our general jurisprudence in this area.  But I've 14   never seen a statute remotely like this before.  Is 15   there any one, where you have a Federal -- where you 16   have Congress creating a cause of action that can be 17   brought in State courts unless the State court says it 18   can't, saying nothing at all about whether there's a 19   Federal cause of action?

It's a --    My understanding is correct that it's the State's license plate they require you to have.  So, your trespass theory, it would seem, falls apart with respect to that particular scenario.    No.  It's the size 29   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of a credit card.  You slip it behind the license plate.    I thought it made a difference under your theory, which focused on the question of trespass, because it was attached to an effect owned by somebody else.  This is an effect not owned by the individual.     So, the trespass theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EMMETT D. QUEENER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    Well, we get a lot of Strickland cases, and the lower courts do, too.    Counsel --    I'll go this time. Counsel, on page 24 of your brief, you quote Alford for the proposition that a valid plea must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.    On the next page, you say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the trial court, he was completely unaware that counsel's ineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options. Now, I put the two of those together and find you saying that this was a valid plea.    The question of validity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you quote, among the alternative choices of action open to the defendant.  The next page you say these options have forever been foreclosed.  So, they weren't open to the  ￼ 1   which -- which caused him to be unaware that they had 2   been ever available to him, so that -- that how the plea 3   becomes involuntary is not that he's aware of what the 4   situation is at the time that he's entering the plea, 5   because there are many other circumstances that go into 6   his decision of whether or not to enter a plea.  Those 7   alternatives were only no longer available to him as a 8   result of counsel's failure to perform his duty 9   professionally and communicate the offer.

So, would there be -- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on the part of the executive that there would be adverse political reaction would have a greater degree of credibility?   And so, we're supposed to decide whether or not the executive is correct in saying that it's a significant problem. And he says, well, he says that, but we know foreign policy better; we don't think it's going to be a big deal.   When there's -- when it's an easy case. When you can't tell,  1 present a foreign policy issue. Congress recognized 2 that, with moving the embassy, there might be a foreign 3 policy issue. So, they said that the President can 4 waive that. 5 With regard to this provision, Congress has 6 said, no, there's not likely to be any foreign policy 7 harm. And all that the Court is being asked to do is 8 it's being asked to enforce the congressional 9 conclusion, which is, we submit, exactly what the third 10 level under Justice Jackson's test is: That if, in 11 fact, Congress decides that what the President has 12 concluded or the executive branch has concluded is 13 wrong, it may -- and it has the constitutional power to 14 say -- with regard to foreign policy, we can exercise 15 our determination.

The invasion of your right to 22   conflict-free service was itself a sufficiently concrete 23   and particularized injury-in-fact, not an abstract and 24   undifferentiated --    Well, that gets to a point that I'm having trouble getting my arms around. It seems to me what your position is, what you want us 8   presumes injury-in-fact.  Injury-in-fact is still 9   required, but that is presumed.  I read that to be 10   perhaps what the trust cases say.  Or, three, that 11   injury-in-fact is not required at all.  Now, which are 12   you arguing?  One, two or three?    Okay, statutory    Can I -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question.  ￼ 1   tell me all that you've got or all that you want to 2   plead is violation of the statute, that doesn't sound 3   like injury-in-fact.    Potential -- potential value. valuable --    Now, we said in the 33   ￼ 1   Whitmore case, and this is a quote:  "Allegations of 2   possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements 3   of Article III."  Potential value sounds to me like 4   possible future injury.    Okay.    So, if you tell me what this case is about is whether or not you've shown injury-in-fact, it's not a significant -- significant case, and your client has to prove that at trial.    Okay.  But then again, that's an argument about was there or was there not injury-in-fact.  1   maybe it's a unique circumstance in this case, but Ohio 2   says this is going to cost you the same no matter what 3 you do. 4    That sounds -- again, to use a word we've said is inadequate to support standing, that sounds conjectural.    So, you will agree, won't you, that the idea that it's certainly possible or whatever your formulation was, that the quality here wasn't good enough or that the entire quality across the board might be better, that's conjectural, right?    Now we're in point 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   this is very interesting and informative to me.  Go back 23   to the middle category.  As I'm now seeing it, you have 24   a version of the middle category that the Chief Justice 25   was asking.  And -- and call it Congress sometimes 36 that your argument, that Congress presumed injury?    Okay.    So, you would accept $1 in this case?    Well, no, that -- that gets -- I didn't mean to be facetious, but it gets to the question of whether or not you have to actually 2 3 4 5   show injury-in-fact.  Your allegation in this case is I thought --    You -- you don't want a conflict-free transaction because you don't want    -- because there can't be further economic harm if there isn't economic harm in the first place.    Further harm that happens to be economic, not further economic harm.    Okay.    Mr. Panner, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

So, the 19   brand was still kind of -- excuse me -- calling the 20   shots in that -- in that respect. 21               But the -- but the more important point is 22   that FDA doesn't have the resources or expertise or -- 23   and to engage in the substantive patent evaluations 24   that, that would be required under a theory where you 25   would go sue the FDA if you had a problem with this.

It's not listed simply because the number 11   is wrong? 12 13   it's not listed because it doesn't fit.  The most famous 14   example, the Buspar case, they claimed a metabolite 15   rather than the drug substance, and that wasn't a proper 16   listing for that reason. 17               The correction language, which does come out 18   of the other bill, the alternative bill, and we do think 19   is an artifact, is the language we've used, is there to 20   give flexibility to courts.  If you have a situation of 21   an improperly listed patent, then a court has more 22   flexibility than simply delisting.    So, why would we give a procedure to an adversary to fix the number when the brand manufacturer is going to fix it as soon as it's alerted to the problem?

In the Government's view, 5   the only issue properly presented in this case is 6   whether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field 7   pre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not 8   because they arise from injuries that occurred when the 9   locomotive was not in use. 10               Now, Respondent would have the Court expand 11   the field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any 12   claim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment, 13   regardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive 14   was in use at the time injury occurred. 15               But it doesn't make sense to --    Well, then -- well, then what's the answer to my question?

Does there have to be a loss for there to be a defalcation?    So taking the money out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity.    But there is still a loss.  I mean, when you're investing obviously the 40  ￼ 1 return is part of it, but also the question is what risk 2 you assume.

Well, but, if there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right?    Okay.    We are not -- you know, obviously, the dividing line between State authority and Federal authority is a more significant one than some of the other questions as to which agencies get deference, which is whether rates are reasonable or not reasonable.  And this provision is 42  ￼ 1   written in terms of a preservation of State authority. 2               And your view would give the Federal agency 3   deference under Chevron -- very considerable deference 4   in defining when there should be Federal authority and 5   when there should be State.  Is that, at all, a 6   pertinent consideration?    Who has to -- who has to be clear on their statement?  Which way?    That it intended to intrude upon State authority?    Yes.    But they have also said -- they have also said, in (7)(a), that those are the only limits, not add on to this any limits that unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will give them -- and the courts must give them vast deference in enforcing those limits. 10 11 12 13 14   bureaucrats. 15    I'm sorry.  Is it    Okay.    But, in rejecting 47  ￼ 1   that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of 2   that opinion in nowhere, in no place, applied Chevron 3   deference in answering that question. 4               It was entirely de novo, unlike in Section 5   3, when it was finally decided, okay, we've got the 6   answer here, and, now, we will defer to the agency on 7   the substance of the determination.    Does it cite --    -- in Part 2, which    Okay.  What is there  ￼ 1   that it's (7)(A) that creates uncertainty about whether 2   the FCC has the authority to implement the reasonable 3   time provision in (7)(B)(ii) -- and I think that points 4   up the problem of adding this additional step to the 5 analysis. 6               Once the Court has satisfied itself that the 7   agency has general rule-making authority, it's not going 8   to be hard to cobble together inferences to make 9   arguments on de novo review that the -- that the agency 10   lacked the authority to implement a particular provision 11   with the force of law. 12               And I think you're adding needless 13   complexity, and I do think -- the reason I suggested, 14   earlier, that I think this is a Pandora's Box is because 15   I do not think there's, at the end of the day, a 16   principled line that can be drawn between what my friend 17   describes as interpretive authority questions and the 18   kind of who, what, when, where substantive questions -- 19   substantive jurisdictional questions that Respondent 20   IMLA is focused on. 21               In each of those situations, the argument is 22   that the agency has acted in excess of its statutory 23   authority.  And, if that's sufficient to justify de novo 24   review in the first instance, it's sufficient to justify 25   de novo review in the second instance. 54  ￼ 1               And, if that's the case, then I would submit 2   that you have really unravelled Chevron.  The -- the 3   good work that that -- that that doctrine does to 4   stabilize the development of administrative law is gone. 5               There will be an argument in every case 6   that -- that de novo review is required, and, in every 7   case in which a court agrees that de novo review is 8   required, once the court has interpreted the statute as 9   a matter of de novo review, then you have ossification 10   of the administrative process because that 11   interpretation is locked in.    Yes, that's exactly 23   right.  That limits it.

No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?  I saw none of that in your brief.    Okay.  So this is not a case about ethnic profiling.    Right. 7   driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in 8   jail overnight, no matter what, okay?  What's wrong, 9   during that period, by having the Arizona arresting 10   officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and 11   find out if this person is here illegally because the 12   Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my 13 question.  For the notification, what could possibly be 6   wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 It seems an odd argument to say the Federal agency has to answer the state's question, but the state can't ask it.

So doesn't 42  ￼ 1   that defeat the facial challenge to the Act?    It is --    It is not an effort to enforce Federal law.  It is an effort to let you know about violations of Federal law.

Okay?  I stopped somebody else, is he legal or illegal, let me check --  ￼ 1   person is illegal or not and then leave it up to you. 2               It seems to me that the Federal government 3   just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not.    That's a pretty good 14 15 16   one. 17 18   statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or 19   restrict any government entity from making this inquiry 20   of the Federal government.

Is that a situation in which we're supposed to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence, 11   and see if a jury would have convicted?  Or can we with 12 13 14 15   me explain.  And again, I'm going to go back to Neder, 16   if I may, for a second.  In Neder, the jury never found 17   an element of the offense.  Never did.  There's no 18   question that the jury's verdict was affected by the 19   failure to instruct.  In fact, it was not just a failure 20   to instruct.  The district court told the jury this is 21   not for them to consider.  And -- 22 23 24 25    -- and not the particular jury.  ￼ 53    Briefly.

It just seems to me very different.    That's not a    It seems to me that the Stolen Valor Act is more narrow than that.

But it seems to me that your willingness to say that this statute is valid so long as there's some benefit to the person who lies, it's an awfully big concession.    So, if he -- so, if he makes this statement at a debate when he's running for office, then you can prosecute him because getting the office is presumably something of value.  It presumably has some pecuniary aspect to it.

He's going up to drop 24   off, you know, tickets to the Policeman's Ball, and he 25   smells marijuana.  What is that?  Is that a violation or 42    Yes, sure, if he's down on his knees; but, what if he goes up to the front door and sniffs?  I mean, he's --    -- he's got to breathe.  I mean, how do you tell whether it's  ￼1 not? 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So it depends on -- but if he's going up to sniff, it is a violation?    So this depends upon how strong the odor is.    If the -- let's say it's a townhouse that goes right up to the sidewalk.  If the police go by with their dog intending to sniff, and the dog alerts, on the sidewalk but two feet away is the front door, that's okay, right?    So it's okay?    Well, let me make sure I understand you.  The policeman is walking down the sidewalk with his dog, the dog stops and alerts. That doesn't constitute sufficient probable cause to get a search warrant to go into the townhouse.  There's been no entry onto the property, just a policeman walking with his dog.    Sure.    He's walking the dog.  He's not out searching.  He's walking the K-9 dog, and the dog alerts on a house without any trespass.  You think that's still bad?    What is the constitutionally protected area in this case?    Even though it's the sidewalk where people -- there's an implied license for people to walk up to --    But there is an implied license to walk up to the front door, right?

But your answer is that would be a taking?    Well, I thought --    Right.    Again, I think the Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary.    They said the Government knew that this water was going to go right here, right?    What if the Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the water has to percolate or whatever down in this area. So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5 million worth of his trees.  The same purpose, to assist in flood control.  No doubt that that's a taking, right?    Okay.    Sure, sure.  And so the Government then comes down and says, we're going to flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the factual findings -- we know that will result in your trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood control, that's just too bad.  Different case when they go in with a chain saw than when they go in with the 31  ￼17 18 19 20   sometimes.  They make electricity sometimes.  Different 21   animals come in.  1 water?    Right.    Well, just before you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at least for me, is the difference between what the Federal circuit decided and what you're arguing. You seem to be arguing that it doesn't make any difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or permanent, right?  The Federal circuit thought it was dispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not permanent.  So it seems to me that you're fighting, and you're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very exhaustive findings, to present a different argument.    It seems to me that if we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that it doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be something less, then maybe you've preserved all these other arguments or maybe not, but --    Or upstream, under your theory.

There have never been any time limits created 35  ￼  1 by Congress that have been abrogated by a 2 manifest-injustice exception.   How do you know which of these are meritorious and which aren't? Is this the meritorious -- I assume you think this is a meritorious one? (Laughter.)   And your friend says nobody can reasonably think this person is innocent. Maybe he has constitutional claims. But, if you look at the evidence, is this something, at the -- a preliminary stage, you look and say, oh, this guy's clearly innocent, and this goes forward? Or is it one that you can cast aside?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS   I'm a little confused about this business about pooling resources and whether it's prohibited or permitted. Tell me exactly what your position is on that.   Well, it seems to me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed by the other side. I mean, let's just say they have a 20  ￼  1 trade association or something. They -- they can all 2 get together and say we want to prepare an antitrust 3 expert report about what American Express is doing, and 4 they do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in 5 the arbitration. Any problem with that?   Okay. And you have no problem with that.   I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just a follow-up one, briefly.

MR. WAXMAN was what was requested, and -- but there was 4  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Oxford took the position based on an understanding of New Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't decided class action question, that the decision would be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as it was in Stolt-Nielsen. Yes, Justice Sotomayor. I apologize.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katz? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. KATZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   I think that's inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his 28  ￼  1 initial decision, which is that if you have something 2 that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of 3 class arbitration at all, that you can't have class 4 arbitration.   And this may not -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be. I thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these things quickly. This has been going on 11 years, right? (Laughter.)   It's not -- it's not question because I think one of the concerns arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the ￼  1 Does he have the obligation to say, I'm 2 going to decide the class action issue under this theory 3 that is decided here, and after I do that, since I have 4 a conflict, I'll bow out. I'll just say, there is a 5 class action, and then I will leave it for some other 6 arbitrator. Does he have that obligation? And if he 7 doesn't, should that bear on our decision here?   Well, but surely --   I'm sorry. Finish your answer.   But under -- under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another party. I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to partiality between parties, but a problem about the way the system would work, that would create an incentive for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a ruling that expands his authority.

12-142 +++$+++    We will hear argument next in Case 12-142, Mutual Pharmaceutical Company v. Bartlett. Mr. Lefkowitz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER   One of our cases --   Well, but it's a little different. Our cases are focused on the concern that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a different duty than the Federal government. That's not what's going on in a strict liability regime. They're saying, we're not saying you 18  ￼  1 should have a different structure, we're not saying 2 anything about warning, we're saying if you do this, 3 you're going to have to pay for the damage. It's not -- 4 it's not a different duty. And I think that's what's 5 underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop 6 selling because you don't have to adjust how you're 7 going to make the drug. You understand that it's going 8 to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is, 9 you pay for the damage.   Briefly.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lefkowitz, you have three minutes remaining.

COOPER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS    Mr. Cooper, we have  jurisdictional and merits issues here.  Maybe it'd be best if you could begin with the standing issue.    I'm sorry, maybe you can finish your answer to Justice Kagan.    Thank you,    Mr. Olson? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    Well, I think it's  ￼ 1 if -- if the State loses, the State can appeal. 2 So this is a one-way ratchet as it favors 3 the State and allows governors and other constitutional 4 officers in different States to thwart the initiative 5 process.    I suppose there might be people out there with their own personal standing, someone who performs marriages and would like that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to perform same-sex marriages, or other people.  We seem to 31  ￼ 1 be addressing the case as if the only options are the 2 proponents here or the State. I'm not sure there aren't 3 other people out there with individual personalized 4 injury that would satisfy Article III.    So it's just about -- it's just about the label in this case.    Same-sex couples have every other right, it's just about the label.    Sure.  If you tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, this is my friend, but it changes the definition of what it means to be a friend. And that's it seems to me what the -- what supporters of Proposition 8 are saying here.  You're -- all you're interested in is the label and you insist on changing the definition of the label.

It has to be filed in good 19   faith and with a reasonable basis." 20               15(e) itself and by its terms says nothing 21   about compliance with the statute of limitations.  The 22   filing provisions of Section 11, which are Section 23   11(a)(1) similarly say nothing about compliance with the 24   statute of limitations.

You can finish your   On the first one, is there any case where all the parties agreed with the decision below and we upheld appellate jurisdiction? Any case?    agreed with the decision below and appellate jurisdiction.   No, it wasn't raised -- it wasn't raised or addressed, and that had the distinct situation of an appeal, direct appeal from an Article I tribunal.   Okay. So putting Lovett aside, since none of this was discussed, is there any -- any case?   So this is totally unprecedented. You're asking us to do something we have never done before to reach the issue in this case.   No, it's not just -­ 19  ￼  1 it's not unusual. It's totally unprecedented.

Thank you, General Verrilli? ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ￼ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE   I suppose your -- you agree that Congress could go the other way, right? Congress could pass a new law today that says, we will give Federal benefits. When we say "marriage" in Federal law, we mean same -- committed same-sex couples as well, and that could apply across the board? Or do you think that they couldn't do that?   Well, no, my point is it wouldn't -- you don't think it would raise a federalism problem either, do you?   Okay.   So just to be clear, you don't think there is a federalism problem with what Congress has done in DOMA? 81  ￼    1 State choices and the system of -- that BLAG is 2 advocating here. 3 And what BLAG's got to do in order to 4 satisfy equal protection scrutiny is justify the choice 5 between one and the other.

HARRINGTON 10 11 12 13 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 14 I'd like to start, if I could, where 15 Kennedy began and ended, which is asking whether 16 would have been extortion if the jury had found here 17 that what -- that the property that was obtained was the 18 commissions at the end of the day after the investment. 19 My friend Mr. Clement says no, no, no, MCNally says no. 20 But what MCNally actually said was the case 21 would have come out differently if the property that had 22 been alleged to be deprived was either money or 23 property, but it also said it would have come out 24 differently if the Commonwealth had been deprived of 25 control over how its money was spent. And that's the 26 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    You -- you point out, of course, that it was based on the New York law, but what do you do with the point that they did not carry forward the separate crime of coercion, which was in the New York law but not in the Hobbs Act?     What do you do with the fact that the State authorities did charge it under 21 attempted coercion charge he ultimately ended up being 22 charged with in State law was a felony. So I think that 23 explains what was going on there. 24 And it's a good example -- it's a good 25 illustration of why it's hard to judge ex-post what 50  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 happened, you know, charging decisions.

That the idea -- a smaller 24 part of something that's bigger is obvious. Now, yes, 25 you can have a patent on the process of extracting that 26  ￼ 1 small part, but I don't understand how a small part of 2 something bigger isn't obvious. And if it is, I don't 3 understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at 4 that stage.    I'm -- I'm not sure that's responsive to my concern.  Your answer said well, 27  ￼ 1 here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent 2 protection. My question goes to whether we ought to 3 focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at 4 the obviousness stage.    Briefly, please.    Thank you, General. Mr. Castanias? ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS    Can I --    Can I get back to your baseball bat example?    My understanding -- my understanding is that here, what's involved, obviously through scientific processes, but we're not talking about process.  Here, what's involved is snipping.  You've got the thing there and you snip -- snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there you've got it. The baseball bat is quite different.  You don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a baseball bat.  You have to invent it, if you will.  You don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of the strand, you just have to cut it off.    Okay.  So that's a particular -- where you snip.

I think the words that    They say -- they say it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate the military forces.    Well, I'm trying to see why you're saying the enumerated power under the Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent action, but the enumerated power under the Military Clause does not. 10 11 12 13 14 15   sorry. 16    I would have thought that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   does turn on the nature of the power.  I mean, could you 24   use the military power to say you, Mr. Bank Fraud 25   Client, cannot contract with the government any more? But I don't see how it makes a difference which enumerated power you're talking about.

JOSEFFER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER    Why would they leave "or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)"? that --    I know your argument is, well, look, the Court's already said, well, that's -- that's included, but they've got two provisions fairly close to each other, and I don't know, if they're running through the usual list, why they wouldn't have just run through a list as it appeared in  ￼ 1 The word "retaliation" is nowhere in Title VII at all. 2 That's point number 1. Point number 2 is, 3 if -- Congress could have specifically put in there an 4 individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national 5 origin, and, clearly, that would have been anchored to 6 e-2(a) to e-2(d). 7 Instead, it created a different provision 8 altogether, e-2(m), and specifically said a complaining 9 party demonstrates, and it didn't say under this 10 section, and it defines any unlawful employment 11 practice. Any. 12 And then, if you look at e-3(a), it 13 specifically defines what we refer to as retaliation, 14 albeit Title VII doesn't use that word, as an unlawful 15 employment practice. 16 Now, I want to make this really clear 17 because the Government is not making this -- this 18 argument. If you reject our statutory argument -- if 19 you reject that argument and you find that e-2(m) does 20 not govern e-3(a), although we strongly urge the Court 21 to -- to embrace that argument, as the Solicitor General 22 has done as well, but, if you reject that argument, by 23 default, we're under Price Waterhouse -- juries have 24 been instructed since jury trials started in 1991, under 25 a Price Waterhouse framework in retaliation cases. 40  ￼ 1 And this argument about unwarranted 2 retaliation claims, this is the way we've been doing it 3 since 1991. This isn't something new. Juries have been 4 instructed this way since '91. So this idea about 5 creating new jurisprudence, this is a huge step 6 backwards from the framework we've been working under.    Ms. Sherry.
