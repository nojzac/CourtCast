Justice Kennedy asked you, "What about the wholesaler?  What about the retailer?"  What about alcoholic beverages other than wine? 1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005   Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.    But that's a decision for the state to make.  I mean, the -- what -­    Not for this Court.    In the context of alcoholic 10   that's an exception to the operation -- the normal 11 operation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause 12   has to be read in light of the Twenty-First Amendment, 13   just as the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read in light 14   of the Commerce Clause and other provisions of the 15   Constitution.

What we are suggesting is that relying on other 20   states to enforce law violations in New York State is not 21 a very feasible alternative. Additionally, there are 33 22   states that have agreed with New York, a number of whom 23 are states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted 24   shipping statutes, and said to this Court, "Please do not 25   prohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York 55  York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the 10 states from which this wine is coming? You say we must do 11 this to police for all kinds of things. But don't other states -- California, Virginia -- don't they have laws that their local wineries must meet?    And is New York just saying, "We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally unregulated, anyway"? 1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and Michigan."

Is that --   Well, to -- so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit -­ they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.

03-184 +++$+++     Mr. Hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the Government is defending this practice because the Government, after all, is on the other side of every case. And aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were?  I mean, I -- I -- the Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge -- special trial judge was? 28 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    Mr. Hungar, do you --    Do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers?  Judge Dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term.  The special trial judge is appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax Court's grace.  And if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, I think it's worlds different.    He has had a special -- a -- a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed. MR. special trial    Why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?    Do they -- do they ever?  I mean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled -- the -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the special trial judge.  Are there Tax Court cases where the Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, in whole or in part, the report of the special trial judge?    Do Tax Court opinions come 43 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 out that way?    Because if one were just to -- read this rule straight:  first, the report to the chief judge, and then it says that the judge may modify it, reject it in whole --    But then we still won't know what his report is.  Yes, he can say, I won't sign this. Tax Court says, fine.  This rule says I can reject your findings in whole or in part.  I don't need your name on this decision of the Tax Court.    I'm asking you just as the -- the judge who disagrees with the -- the full court can publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?    Has there ever been?  Has there ever been?

In the explanation of their consolidation of the two sections, to what extent did they discuss changes and the reasons for them?   But they did -- they did explain other things --   -- other changes, but this one -- there's silence --    -- as far as I understand.   And this is one I'm -- I'm surprised that you didn't cite, but it -- I don't think you did -- EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company, where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti- discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the inter-State sitting -- setting and not international.   That -- that was a decision by the Chief. So -- (Laughter.)    There is -- there's an overarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you right from the beginning.  When a legislature legislates, be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick. 28  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 strongest case on the statute, and my answer to the liberty of answering can ask it as well -- ￼1 When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United 2 States. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of 3 the time when it is, it says so. 4 And we have a number of cases, not just the 5 Arabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the 6 language of title VII was between a State and anyplace 7 outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that 8 very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to 9 you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our 10 country, and if it means to say something that will take 11 in other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we 12 don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to 13 have any 14 us that. 15 16 position 17 extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells That's my overall concern about the Government's in this case.    Ms. Millett.    Ms. Millett, there are many lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my generation -- some of them are of that elder age.  We learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the penal judgments of another.  This is a kind of enforcement of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something like it.  Another reason why I would expect a Congress, knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant foreign, foreign.  Unlike the context of the immigration, yes, there are some people who left and came back, but many -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases. Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, those go back to the '20's.

04-1131 +++$+++     So your difference -- what’s separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a question of timing.  The action that you’re describing that would come at the end, after he’s used the administrative process, is the same one that he is seeking to bring at the front end.  That is, it’s a 1331 action --    -- and -- and it’s based on the Government’s waiver of sovereign immunity for nonmonetary claims.    I thought your position on the statute was that it doesn’t afford a right of action, that it was just an instruction to the Secretary.  Maybe I misread your position on the statute.  We’re talking about 45-1048?    I thought that the Government’s position was there’s no right of action under that statute.    But that was on the view that it was an exclusive remedy.  The -- the statute is not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion requirement.  It says you’ve got a minor grievance -- issue.  You go through the grievance procedure.  There is no judicial review at the end of the line.  So you would be converting something that Congress wrote to be an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.    So you -- you have picked one way to do that.  You say go through the grievance procedure.  If there’s a constitutional question remaining, if you haven’t been satisfied, then you bring the action in court. Another way to say is, well, as long as we’re making this up, why not allow the -- the action to proceed at once in court, but then the court to say, I’m going to abstain while you go through the grievance procedure.    Yes, I --    But -- but here, that’s not this case because he said, and when I complained, they did it again.    Am I right that the statute as written says you don’t have any judicial review for these kinds of actions?  You go through the grievance procedure, win or lose.  That’s it.  There is no judicial review.    The statute does not provide for judicial review --    -- as it does in the case of major actions.

You've used this word severance now twice.  Severance is I excised a clause from the statute, but you're not asking for that.  It's not severance.  There is no provision to be severed here.

And how many has it -- in the District Courts, how many have been rejected when it's something like television or recreation?    Well, before you do --    -- as I understand it, and as the Solicitor General confirmed, you are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, where the substantive scope is the same.  So, what -- you are saying, in the prison context, this is undue, but you all -- you are already subject to it under one Act.  And how has that been working out?    It's interesting --    -- that you cite that case, in terms of Justice Scalia's remark, "Watch what we do, not what we say."  Cleburne was a remarkable case in that respect.  It purported to apply rational- basis review, but the plaintiffs won.    But if you think --    -- if you think of the -- any conceivable basis -- doesn't even have to be offered if the -- if it's, indeed, the rational-basis test.  It has been suggested that something more is going on in Cleburne, and, I think, in all candor, one 40  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 would have to say so. Because if you looked at the 2 rational-basis test that had gone before, this one 3 looked no 4 5 Solicitor 6 argument, 7 what it does say." And it said it was applying 8 rational-basis scrutiny in that case.
04-1244 +++$+++     But he -- but wasn't this tried to a jury?  That was a jury that made those findings.    And the jury is no longer sitting.    He knows that there were four acts.  He knows that he -- under his instructions, the jury could pick 12.  How could he know which four the jury homed in on?    But does it -- when what turns on that finding is injunctive relief, the judge might very well be influenced by what those particular 36  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 acts were. He might say one set of four was not adequate 2 to issue this injunction, but another set of four would 3 be. And we just don't know -- we don't know what those 4 acts were. The jury is not to be called back. The 5 Seventh Circuit said "no more evidence." So, if we get 6 down to those four acts, how can we say those are 7 sufficient to uphold an injunction, when we don't even 8 know what the acts were?    So, a private party could get only permanent, but preliminary --    -- injunction. 10 11 because of the traditional common-law rule that the 12 Government generally can't get such injunctions. 13 Our position is simple. We believe that the 14 Hobbs Act was changed precisely to deal with the 15 situations where there might be a radical animal-activist 16 group that might be blowing up restaurants that serve 17 meat, or clothing stores, or where there might be 18 situations where racists were blowing up businesses owned 19 by blacks or Jews. That's what the Hobbs Act does. And 20 the RICO statute provides, as Congress intended, a broad 21 remedial scheme.    They made the assumption that this Court has an obligation to reason why, and there was no reason why given as to those four counts.
04-1264 +++$+++     Mr. Bland.    Mr. Bland, some State may say fraud in the inducement is void.  These -- these are classifications that States make.  These are labels that the State puts on them.  And you are introducing vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is between void and voidable.  You are forced into that because the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable.  So you -- that you -- you are drawing a line between void and voidable which shifts from State to State.    But if you open the door open the door -- public policy has been unruly horse.  All you have to do is open the ￼1 to be able to argue that no contract came into 2 existence in the first place. 3 And the public policy typically -- and in 4 Florida particularly -- tends to be linked to statutes. 5 In most States, there is a rule that says of contract 6 law, that we will not void a contract because some 7 judge feels there’s a public policy, but it has to be 8 based on a statute. And we cited several cases, and 9 the law professors in Professor Alderman and Braucher’s 10 brief cited a variety of cases around the country in 11 which courts have only struck down contracts for public 12 policy where they violated a statute that forbid 13 equality.

The State 2 certainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules 3 apply, the State could have amended its answer and 4 done just what the magistrate judge did.    I --    Did it say "an ￼1 be found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition, 2 "A Federal Court that sits in collateral review has an 3 obligation to enforce the Federal statute of 4 limitations." And, in fact, they quote the Advisory 5 Committee notes to Rule 4, saying the court has the 6 duty to screen out. And they also expressly 7 distinguished their precedent in Esslinger versus 8 Davis, which relied on Granberry versus Greer, to say 9 it was a discretionary analysis. They said, "We're 10 not going to consider the discretionary issues raised 11 in Esslinger and Granberry whether this dismissal 12 would serve an important Federal interest. We're just 13 going to say there's an obligation to impose this, and 14 that the District" --   I thought that that duty 7 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 is in connection with Rule 4.    Well, we could --    -- we could -- we could agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on 11 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is, 2 you know, the -- it could be a "must," it can be "may 3 not," or it could be "may."    We're past Rule 4, 10 Rule 4 is 11 that way; 12 13 because an answer has been ordered.    Well, what would be the 10 prejudice 11 petitioner?    There wasn't --    Yes, but the civil rules amendment.    There's 8(c), and there's ￼1 served by having the State calculate and make the 2 motion, rather than putting the burden on the Federal 3 Court to do it. The Court, we submit, should make the 4 State -- they -- this Court, in Pliler, said the 5 State's in the best position to make the limitations 6 calculation. It's an error-prone fact-intensive, 7 burdensome calculation, and they shouldn't be allowed 8 to foist that burden on the Court. The Court should 9 make them do their job. 10 And so, our position is that that's the 11 reason that it should be done under Rule 15. It also 12 doesn't put the State in the position of being an 13 advocate -- excuse me -- it doesn't put the Court in 14 the position of being an advocate for the State and 15 having them say -- having the Court directly across 16 the bench from the Petitioner, not involving the 17 State, saying, "Here are -- I'm developing some 18 arguments on behalf of the State now why this is 19 untimely. What do you have to say about it?" That's 20 --    But here, nothing --    -- happened.  Nothing There was --    The answer was put in,    Would you say it's --    -- means it's "hardly mean, we do follow the principle of party 5 6 7 ever"? I 8 presentation.

So, would this be -- 11 if it's not "never," would it be at least "hardly 12 ever," that it's appropriate for a judge to interject 13 an affirmative defense on his own motion?    But why would --    -- why would you deal hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in 10 with that 11 all fairness, said, "We join the Second, Fourth, 12 Fifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though 13 the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, 14 the District Court may review the timeliness of the 15 2254."

You're looking at what Texas law forced him to do.    Where is that charge? 10 11 12 13   appendix.  Now counsel read that definition to the jury, 14   and the definition reads as follows:  "A manner of doing 15   an act characterized by or resulting from careful and 16   thorough consideration characterized by awareness of the 17   consequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as 18   though allowing time for a decision."  Now counsel read 19   that definition to the jury during his closing argument. 20   He argued that Brewer's crime reflected poor planning 21   and execution, that he was led into it by other actors, 22   by his girlfriend Christy Nystrom, and that his 23   commitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness, 24   depression in this case, were argued specifically as 25   cause for those faults.  And so counsel related the 27    Wasn't there something about moral culpability in what you read?

Oh the other hand, as I 17   say, we would have no objection to just allowing the 18   Second Circuit to sort it out based on Second Circuit 19   pleading law.  I think the important thing from our pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left alone to do what he or she will. But in complex cases like this, the district judge will often assert control from the beginning and not leave the parties to do what they want.

It's not a limit on the rights and remedies. 17   So the answer to primary jurisdiction is that it's 18   always worked this way, that the private plaintiff is 19   supposed to sue in court.  He's expressly empowered 20   under securities laws to sue in court, As he's expressly 21   empowered under the antitrust laws, and the courts have 22   always resolved the issue.

Correct me if I'm    In -- in this case, I thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, then the claim can be made and is not lost.    In any case, this has nothing to do with the, Fobian, so-called Fobian issue, whether the Ninth Circuit drew the bright line.    On both their statutory interpretation and the contract?    And can we be, take one step before that and tell us if you are conceding that the Fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   Circuit.  In other words, the Ninth Circuit did begin in 5   the wrong place, which was not to read the statute, that it's valid as far as it goes?    I understand that because they have the Fobian rule.

Tort claimants would love it, 9   trade creditors would love it, local tax collectors 10   would love it.  But Congress said only one category of 11   claimants get to claim their post-petition attorneys' 12   fees.

I'd like to turn to the question of 13   whether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant 14   an evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're 15   asking for. 16               Now, with respect to this question of 17   whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid 18   counsel for the State is just wrong about this.  It's 19   important to understand how this comes up.  We asserted 20   a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient 21   performance and prejudice.  The State asserted as a 22   defense to that claim:  No, no, he's waived. 23               And the trial judge, the State habeas judge 24   in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that 25   and said, well, yes, he's waived.

May I ask you another question about the clarity with which Congress spoke? This law was proposed and enacted some weeks after this Court granted cert in this very case.  It is an extraordinary act, I think, to withdraw jurisdiction from this Court in a pending case.  Congress didn't say, explicitly, it was doing that.  It hasn't done it, as far 64 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 as I know, since MCArdle. But there Congress said, "We 2 are withdrawing jurisdiction in this very case." They 3 didn't say that here. So, why should we assume that 4 Congress withdraw our jurisdiction to hear this case once 5 the case was already lodged here?

Now, at 2   some level, if the suspension is so long, 6 months, a 3   year, then effectively you could have a different type 4   of material adverse action, but where it's a 2-week 5   suspension to investigate, that would not be material 6   adverse action.  In fact, as -- as the AFL-CIO amicus 7   brief points out, I think, that's the favored practice 8   in the industry. 9             Now, we -- we do think that with respect to 10   the standard, that as this Court recognized in 11   Faragher, it makes good sense to harmonize 12   discrimination standards. And here, we think that 13   Congress intended the courts to harmonize the standard 14   for section 704, the anti-retaliation provision, with 15   the standard for section 03, the act's core 16   prohibitions. 17             Justice Scalia, it does -- the section 704 18   does omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment, 19   but as we've explained in our brief, we think it is 20   reasonable to read the discriminate against as a 21   shorthand for the unlawful employment practices 22   identified in section 703. 23             It's also important to keep in mind that 24   Congress knows how to write a broader anti-retaliation 25   statute when it wants to.  Look at the ADA, the Family 31 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼ 1   Medical Leave Act.  These are statutes which, by their 2   terms, prohibit employers from any attempt to 3   intimidate, coerce, threaten, or interfere with the 4   exercise of rights.  Look at the Family Medical Leave 5   Act --    You won on the basis of the standard that the Sixth Circuit used, which was not 43 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼ 1   the Sixth Circuit standard -- why should the Court deal 2   with the universe of cases when it has this case before 3   it, two actions, and a unanimous Sixth Circuit judgment 4   that says these two actions fall within 704?

The problem in Great-West was the money had already been dissipated.  It had been set aside.    Do you -- do you not think that Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no punitive damages?  Do you really think that Congress had in mind the distinction that you are now drawing in the ring case based on 15th and 16th century English precedent?    Yes, but Great-West also said money.  It said money, identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan.  And why doesn't it belong in good conscience to the plan when the beneficiary has promised that, if it gets a tort recovery, it will reimburse the plan?    What -- what is the double recovery that you're talking about?  The plan has paid out to the care providers the benefits in full.    And now it wants to get back its benefits in full.    But the plaintiff could so -- in the tort litigation, if that's what it is, the plaintiff could say, I don't want any medical damages. Give me everything for pain and suffering.    Well, but they look at the medical expenses were something like $75,000 and the settlement was -- what was it?  $750,000.    How does the -- how does the insurer show that if the parties could just say -- the plaintiff can say, I am the master of my complaint. I am not seeking damages for medical expenses.  I just want damages for lost earnings, pain and suffering.    Well -- well, why should you be if -- if an -- if this -- if you prevail in this case and then every other personal injury lawyer will make sure that that recovery goes into a trust for the care of the accident victims, never goes into their own investment account.

The 12   mother testified to her undying love for her son, 13   traditional evidence.  Friends testified to his good 14   characteristics.

If a court 10   sees that there are disputed issues of fact, the court 11   must schedule an evidentiary hearing.

If you 5   have a claim like this, you look at the statute, it 6   comes first.  It has the benefit of being first on the 7   page.    What is his remedy?    Is that what you argue in    So what did you argue is his remedy, in your brief?    What would that be?    He didn't know until he got the report.    Let's take, because this case was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are forms to fill out and says I want this set of 6   fiduciary.

06-923 +++$+++     But then you come to the end of the line.  You have to prove that the authority was misused.  And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's decision, what those judges were doing, they say we're going to look at this with some skepticism because of the conflict.  And let me give you a concrete example. This woman got Social Security disability benefits and she did it at the suggestion of MetLife is; that so?    But she got a lawyer that they recommended that she have.    But the point is they came to her and said:  Get Social Security disability benefits.  Now, to get those she would have to show that she is totally and permanently disabled.    So here is a company that says:  Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and permanently disabled, but -- and then we'll recoup all 11 - Subject to Final Review  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get 2   a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not 3   disabled.

And I also don't understand the suggestion 2   that she is totally disabled to the government and then 3   saying, well, she's really not, in this very close time 4   frame.  So it might be okay and it might not. 5               I am in equipoise about this case, not the 6   terms of the plan but the decision that was made to deny 7   her benefits.  So which way do I call it?  That's the 8   question that Justice Souter posed, and you seem not to 9   want to face up to it and answer it.    And what would -- how would you verbalize it?    Because everybody talks about yes, it's a factor, it's a relevant factor.

There are three circuits and the D.C. local 19   court which all have concluded that a waiver of Miranda 20   rights waives the right to prompt presentment.  So the 21   question of whether there was in fact unnecessary delay 22   that would constitute a violation of Rule 5 has not been 23   litigated in this case.    That's Rule 5.    And as you have said 20 21 22 23   all.  And I agree with that.  It says -- it's a straight 24   out command, no unnecessary delay.  And isn't the reason 25   for 5(a) exactly what happened here?

And I think Powerex said the same thing, 2   although it said it in more definite terms, it is far 3 from clear.    What the district court has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, "I don't have jurisdiction," because Congress has given supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court 28 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   didn't say that.  Maybe you can point me to the place 5   where it did.  But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong, 6   because there is -- that's what supplemental 7   jurisdiction is.  It's says you have jurisdiction, it's 8   a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you 9   are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to 10   exercise it or not.    Maybe the district judge  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   to remand on stated conditions. 2               But you -- you seem to conflate the absence 3   of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary 4   decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction 5   that the court undoubtedly has.    Yes, but not subject  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   It says court, you can exercise power.

The 8   issue was whether or not they had argued the precise 9   theory, and the factfinder certainly has the authority 10   to choose the theory that it thinks best approximates 11   what is a reasonable estimate. 12               And in fact, Your Honor, the theory that the 13   trial court seized upon was actually suggested by the 14   government's own expert on cross-examination in the 15   transcript at -- at 4077 to '78. 16               And in addition, Your Honor, when it was 17   time for closing argument, which was September 28th, 18   1999, at the very beginning of the transcript, page 4, 19   the trial court said to the government -- it said to the 20   parties at the beginning of the closing argument, here's 21   what I want to know about.

07-210 +++$+++     So we have to assume what  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the Court knows, was originally dismissed by Chief Judge 2   Holderman on that very basis. 3               If we have -- if we were to accept -- if the 4   Court were to accept our opponents' position, a 5   remarkable array of lawsuits could be brought as RICO 6   actions:  Competitor versus competitor for harm that 7   allegedly is caused by false statements to customers, 8   suppliers, distributors, marketing agencies, government 9   entities; consumer or end user versus manufacturer for 10   harm allegedly resulting from false statements to the 11   first buyer in a distribution chain. 12               And the circuit court cases in the Fifth -- 13   Fourth and Fifth and Sixth and Eighth and Eleventh 14   circuits have recognized this, and they require reliance 15   as a part of proximate causation, and we believe this 16   Court should do the same. 17               I also wanted to make the point that to 18   elaborate, in the Neder case, the Government -- and this 19   is a case where the Government ostensibly argues that it 20   wants us not to restrict civil RICO claims.  But in the 21   Neder case the Government made the very same argument in 22   trying to expand mail fraud claims under the criminal 23 statutes. 24               And I think that's -- that's a sub rosa 25   issue in this case.  The Court nine years ago 15  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   specifically said in a unanimous opinion, with Chief 2   Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court, that the Court 3   disagreed that mail fraud was moored to the common law 4   of fraud, and it is not unmoored in the Neder case. 5   They said it was moored, and even in a criminal 6   prosecution materiality is required.  And although 7   justifiable reliance and injury is not required in a 8   criminal prosecution, to unmoor the mail fraud statute 9   in a civil RICO context and to then make the argument 10   that all sorts of other claims can -- can also be 11   included such as tortious interference -- because at its 12   heart this is a tortious interference case.  We know 13   that because the Plaintiffs pled it in their complaint. 14   That's their pendant State court action.  And that's 15   where this case should be.  It should be a tortious 16   interference case. 17               If they can prove that case and if they have 18   pled it, then they have a remedy.  If they can't, they 19   don't.  But the problem is that to give the civil RICO 20   tool, to call "racketeers" -- to call your competitor a 21   "racketeer" and to seek treble damages and attorney's 22   fees in this kind of such an attenuated situation, 23   should not be something that the Court condones. 24               And it's different; if you Google my 25   clients, you'll come up -- they will come up as 16  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   racketeers now, and -- and that's the problem that we 2   have.  If there were a reliance requirement, you could 3   immediately tell if this was a situation where the 4   common law --
07-214 +++$+++     There has been a statement, in opposition to your position, that the way you read (a)(2) would render (a)(1) useless, That everything would fall within (a)(2). Is there a distinction between what comes under (a)(1) and (a)(2), in your view?    Thank you.
07-219 +++$+++     There's some confusion,  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   law rule, the proper Federal common law rule.  We have 5   to change it in the context of Title VII because of the 6   unusual situation in which employers can be held liable 7   based on the subjective knowledge of the wrongdoer; and 8   tort law is exactly the opposite.  It is an objective 9   test.  And so there's no worry in imposing punitive 10   damages here, that you're going to -- that you're going 11   to dissuade an employer from training its employees. 12               Now, on the facts, even if you were to agree 13   with me on that legal argument, you're exactly right on 14   the facts, Justice Ginsburg.  Exxon had a paper alcohol 15   policy that prohibited drinking aboard ship, just like 16   the Coast Guard has a policy to that effect.  But the 17   evidence in this case was that Exxon didn't enforce it.    There was a statute that  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why 2   there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was 3   one of the things the court of appeals said under the 4   head of waiver.

Is that why --    But I thought that --    -- that Justice Breyer's question, General Clement, was he asked you to assume that that was unconstitutional, and you were answering  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   based on the choice of the candidate to engage or not in 2   self-financing, and -- I mean, the restriction there is 3   much more substantial than the public financing scheme 4   approved by this Court in Buckley, because in the 5   general election if the candidate decides that it's 6   going to -- that a candidate is going to take the public 7   financing scheme then in the general presidential 8   election I can't give even a dollar to that candidate. 9               And it's also I think worth recognizing that 10   in Buckley this Court recognized that, for 11   constitutional and associational rights purposes, it's 12   really the ability to associate with the candidate by 13   giving any contribution, rather than the amount of the 14   contribution, that satisfies that limit. 15               In all events, this is not a challenge 16   that's being brought by contributors.  And I think it's 17   worth recognizing that Appellant, even though some of 18   its challenge, and I would say the gravamen of the 19   challenge, sounds -- his challenge sounds in equal 20   protection terms, he doesn't really want a leveling-up 21   where the opportunity would be for contributors to both 22   candidates to make triple the $2300 limits.  He really 23   wants to keep the yoke of relatively low contribution 24   limits on his opponents.  And that's why I think this is 25   such an odd First Amendment challenge. 49  ￼ - Subject to Final Review
07-330 +++$+++     Is that based on any -- any precedent of this Court's?    So just on the cross-appeal rule?    This would not be a mathematical error?    -- (f).  And the -- that has two subparts, and the first part just says the court of appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   violation of law, period. 2               And (2) has two subparts that refer to the 3   party appealing.  So why doesn't the first one cover 4   both sides when the second one is distinctly divided 5   into (a) and (b) parts?    What difference does it make?  Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rule because its no rule.  What difference does it make if it is labeled "jurisdictional," or if it is just regarded as a tight procedural requirement?
07-343 +++$+++     I'm questioning -- you're saying it's off the chart because the Court held that you cannot have a death penalty for rape.  And I suggested that that's not so clear.

There is in the -- in the Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the examples involve a representational relationship that existed at the time of the first litigation.  There's nothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion would be proper here.    Yes, but here --    Do you agree with me about the facts that we're dealing with here?

Okay.  And is there any evidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA request --    My question, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is:  Did Herrick ask Taylor to file that FOIA suit?  And I think your answer is no. There's no evidence of that.    Is there any evidence that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?    In any case, the decision that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.
07-411 +++$+++     It's being imposed.  But, say, at the gas station, they don't ask you when you drive up:  Now do you consent to the tax?    But that's different from consent.  You can say I don't consent as loudly as you like and as often as you like, and you still have to pay the tax. 19 20 21 22 23 24   business.    But it's not -- it's not uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as its -- as its own on a question of civil rights.  A State might stay, well, we choose to construe our human rights law in accord with the Federal -- Federal law?    But it is an organization of Indians?    Did they --    I thought that the bank -- I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff in the tribal court?    And as I understand it, the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals, contract claims?    But the Long Company did not make a tort claim?    So why isn't this judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as to the contract claim, which are not challenging and which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has nothing to do with the tort claim that you are 10 11 12 13 14 15   challenging?    So the consensual relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or other commercial.  So the consent is to the commercial 5 6 7 8   relationship.

We believe that when a government employer 10   comes in and asserts some sort of objective reality, you 11   know, so for here they said the wheat prices are 12   declining, the plaintiff should have a chance to negate 13   that and say, well, it turned out that actually the 14   wheat prices weren't declining, and so on. 15               If, however, the plaintiff -- the government 16   articulates the rationale that you had put forth before, 17   I don't like you, and somehow the supervisor says it's 18   interfering with my government efficiency and I can't do 19   the job, well, that's something that the employer will 20   never really be able to -- the employee will never be 21   able to negate.  And that is set forth in our reply 22   brief at page 16.    I thought you did not 19 20 21 22   Justice Scalia's question.  I thought he was saying does 23   the government -- can the government put forth a quite clear in saying no, that's not what rational basis means in this context.    Well, maybe because 1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could say 1983 -- we know the classification to which Justice Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting 10 11   out.    The Ninth Circuit decision would rule out the case where an employee says: I was the most qualified person for this position by far, but the supervisors took a bribe from a rich uncle to promote somebody else.    That would be out?    The scapegoat case, too, would be out?
07-499 +++$+++     Mr. Katsas --    What -- what about the position that the displaced person's act was special to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   engaged in an enterprise where other countries in the 2   world -- and should we look to see how they are 3   interpreting this notion of duress, coercion?  Are they 4   considering it irrelevant; would just look to see if the 5   person in fact was provided some material assistance to 6   persecution?
07-512 +++$+++     I don't understand what 6 7 8 9 10 11   being wrong and being incomplete.  The Ninth Circuit 12   decision responded to a very narrow question certified 13   by the district judge, which was whether or not price 14   squeeze taken as a generic violation was subsumed or not 15   subsumed by the Trinko decision.  It answered that 16   question correctly; but in doing that, it did not 17   consider whether or not price squeeze survived -- the 18   living margin part of price squeezing survived Brooke. 19               And to that extent, Judge Gould picked up 20   the -- the -- the argument and said, in effect, 21   especially in a regulated industry where the wholesale 22   price is -- is regulated, the offense of price squeeze 23   becomes predatory pricing, just as in a primary 24   Robinson-Patman case, the offense becomes predatory 25 pricing. 29 to accept Judge Gould's position.    How can we do that without saying that the majority was wrong?
07-513 +++$+++ 
07-526 +++$+++     As you read the statute, Ms. Maynard, the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" could be deleted and the statute would mean the same thing that you're urging. So what do the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" add?

07-689 +++$+++     But you stipulated.  You  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   stipulation that there was evidence sufficient to 2   support a finding and that we would stand by.  There was 3   evidence they had an expert who was willing to so 4   testify.  I was responding to Justice Souter's question 5   of was there was evidence in the record to support the 6   contention that there might not be bloc voting within 7   the alternative district, and that was -- that meant 8   that black candidates can receive in excess of 60 9   percent of the vote in the 35 percent district.
07-751 +++$+++     That's -- it's not just  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   operation in such a way that if the operative's 2   experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them 3   probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in 4   immediately. 5               And our principal contention is not that the 6   consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent 7   to the later entry of the police officers.  It was that 8   once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a 9   government agent into his home, his expectation of 10   privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers 11   works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy. 12               And I would like to return to the point that 13   Mr. Stirba was making.  It's true that the informant 14   here lacked the training and skills that -- and 15   integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a 16   police officer to have.  But he was for Fourth Amendment 17   purposes a government agent a State actor.  If his 18   handlers had instructed him to look for an opportunity 19   to rummage through the drawers --
07-772 +++$+++ 
07-773 +++$+++     But that's the question 6               It seems to me that your look-through 7   argument is look-through only halfway.  That is, if you 8   look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that 9   was brought in the State court, the controversy is here 10   we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. 11   So we have a suit on a debt.  Why isn't that the 12   controversy?  You have to make the counterclaim the 13   controversy, which comes up only defensively.  It wasn't 14   brought as a lawsuit.    But in the practical  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State 2   court; but what happens to that claim once you have this 3   arbitration?    I meant -- I didn't mean to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   to bring up this claim.  It wasn't as an original 18   matter.    Chose not to --    -- chose not to litigate the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going  ￼6 7 8 9    -- how do you -- it's all part of the same controversy, isn't it? - Subject to Final Review    Not state usury law.  So you could have this case going on in State court.    And the State court would be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.    There would be nothing inappropriate about a State court entertaining that excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to 13 14 15   it.  I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    That claim doesn't --    I just can't envision a 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   arbitration.  It just seems to me you have effected -- 21   accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the 22   -- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on 23   the basis of a counterclaim.    And you remove the State court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   action.  If the Court says, no, there is no violation of 5   the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not 6   made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim 7   on the debt and her obligation to pay it. 8               Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in 9   State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral 10   process, that's really up to her as far as how that 11   goes.  But the arbitration agreement could not be 12   plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for 13   purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit 14   perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a 15   specific claim here that arises exclusively under 16   Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our 17   arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right. 18               And that's, frankly, all we are trying to 19   accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg. 20               The second part of the statute which is 21   the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the 22   greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know, 23   "would have jurisdiction over the subject matter." 24   Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the 25   Court is going to face in this area, because here is one 43 happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the Federal question in this through the arbitral process. You still have the underlying collection  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   where there is no question --    But you could have asked for that in the State court as well, and --    Excuse me --    What do you do with the assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync with your view, because they would not give you -- you 54

08-1008 +++$+++     They didn't want to have class actions.    And how is it different 4   1   from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs? 2   Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive 3   purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative 4 actions.    It was that we want the courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so they won't be excessive.    But there wasn't a cap on 15   injuries.  Now, that -- that is not a cap in the sense 16   of $1 million, $5 million, $50,000.  But it's a cap in 17   the sense of providing the substantive standard by which 18   the court determines excessiveness. 19               And as for Rule 59, the reason the Court saw 20   no conflict there is Rule 59 simply provides the 21   procedural mechanism within which a defendant makes a 22   motion to seek a new trial on the grounds of 23   excessiveness of damages. 24               But it -- but excessiveness of damages is, 25   to go back to a point that was made in the previous 8   1   argument, like fairness.  Fairness in relation to what? ￼2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Excessiveness of damages has to be judged according to what the State law is on what damages one is entitled to recover.    So you are saying that even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer would be the same --    There is no New York Court of Appeals decision to that effect?    It depends upon the 14   1     persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.    But it could be -- it could be, as I -- the example of the statute of limitations.  We create a claim.  It has a certain life. It's dead after that time.  That's New York law. A sister State may say, we create the same claim, but we think it has a longer life.  New York would say, that's fine.  Bring that claim in your own State.  Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State claims when we would not hear the identical claim under our own law. There are policies that do operate as procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust.    New York might well say, look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we are not going to entertain the sister State claim for any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own.  We are not frustrating the sister State.  They could bring the class action there, but not in -- not in our courts.    There -- when you are dealing with a Federal statute, there’s a -- there’s a factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause. If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say 46   1     1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our 2     comparable claims, we don't allow class action could -- 3     could apply that --
08-103 +++$+++     What about the congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision? It provided that the -- there was to be no 10 11   jurisdictional bar in criminal matters.  Didn't -- it 12   didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it 13   didn't say anything about civil matters.  So isn't that 14   some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the 15   civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?

I mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a particular State?    But why would they move simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the Federal court in a particular State? 10 11 12 13 14   States are not good for corporations.  Whether that -- 15   that perception is a real perception or whether it's not 16   a real perception isn't before us today. 17               But if a corporation has all of its people 18   and all of its property and is doing all of its business 19   in one of those States, the corporation shouldn't be 20   allowed to game the system by simply moving its 21   headquarters, it's real headquarters out of that State.

That is one 3   of the panoply of arguments that is outside the plain 4   meaning that they go to to say well, this is 5   unprecedented; Congress couldn't have intended this. 6               There are reports that read the TILA bona 7   fide error to mean legal error at one point in time, so 8   it wasn't unprecedented to the extent of that, and what 9   did Congress do with respect to TILA?  In 1980, they 10   didn't like the interpretation that they were getting 11   with respect to legal error from the TILA error, which 12   is a totally different statute, and so they reacted by 13   amending TILA to say no legal error in TILA. 14               They did not correspondingly amend the 15   FDCPA, which shows Congress's intent to distinguish the 16   two statutes.

So the request was made of my client, give me the financials of your law firm, and for some reason, my client did, but this -- the statute was not meant to punish lay debt collectors, including lawyers.

I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the 2   Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership. 3   And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable 4   ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does 5   the government have to do the setoff?    And does that mean --    The award goes to the 12   prevailing party.  So, therefore, the attorney's fee is 13 14 15 16 17 18   complicated and, generally, yes.  The IRS is of the view 19   that attorney fee awards to prevailing parties, whether 20   it's EAJA or otherwise, are deemed to be taxable income 21   to the client. 22               Now, the clients, of course, will have an 23   offsetting deduction for expenses incurred by -- in -- 24   in the course of producing or collecting income, and 25   that was recognized by this Court's opinion in Banks. 20 income to the client --    -- is taxable income to the client?    I --    My understanding is that the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security benefits gained for the client is 25 percent of the recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer.    So that, just as a background in this case, did Ms. Ratliff get that 25 percent?    In exchange for getting 25 percent of the recovery?    And she could keep only one from the --    She could keep only the larger of the two.    One of the difficulties with your position is that Congress did exempt a number of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't exempt Equal Access to Justice fees.    In what percent of the Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is there an EAJA fee?    Because there was no offset in the picture because the government wasn't offsetting.

In other words, I -- I fully 13   understand your -- your textual argument.  I -- I can 14   see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us 15   and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely 16   possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems 17   to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get 18   into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you 19   can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of 20   condition.    Yes. - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   said the parents just went away.  The school at an 5   earlier point said this child was ineligible for special 6   education, isn't that so?  I think -- what the process is --    -- because Justice Scalia    When the school said not eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first before we ever get to the IEP?    Well, wouldn't the school say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until the question of eligibility is determined? 12 13 14 15 16 17   decision pending appeal to the district court.  But 18   that's not what happened here.  What happened here is 19   that the hearing officer decided on June -- January 26, 20   2004, that T.A. was eligible.  On February 19th, quicker 21   than the 30 days allowed, Forest Grove School District 22   proposed an IEP that could have started as soon as 23   possible thereafter, as the regulations require. 24               So you are talking about a very tight -- I 25   understand the situation that you are hypothesizing, 10    Isn't it also plausible that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial for this system, this is a child with severe learning 14    How have -- how have 10 11   hearing officers been proceeding?  I mean, here we had a 12   case that went to a hearing officer.  There is no IEP 13   when the hearing officer begins the process.  In the -- 14   on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give 15   deference to the school district and then -- so that's 16   eligibility.  At the IEP stage, do they give deference 17   to the student?    So you must find both, not just that the private school was a good place, but that the school district did not offer an adequate education for the child.    Where are you reading  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   giving hearing officers authority.  Congress got 2   specific in 1997.  There's a heading -- enacted a 3   provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private 4   School Placement.

Even if it were 11   interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress 12   enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing 13   officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give 14   tuition reimbursement.  So even if 1415 were interpreted 15   prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give 16   hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where 17   Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing 18   officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in 19   certain circumstances, that -- that prior 20   interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer 21 is valid --

And if the trustee had objected, she could 17   have said:  Well, if they think that this cooking 18   equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, 19   I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the 20   microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the 21   dollar -- dollars for it.    Then you're going through all the administrative expenses of having an auction where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be like amending your pleading.    The question is whether -- the question is whether the trustee had to make an objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it.    It was very clear that that's what the debtor wanted.    But it's not in kind in the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.    She is contending that she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an auction. 10 11 12 13   Ginsburg, that's not right.  Here the debtor was told at 14   the 341 meeting that the trustee intended to sell it.    What she could have done is trimmed some items from the list.    That's much less  1   "Unknown."  Some contingent term that places the trustee 2   on notice that says:  Hey, whatever the value of the ￼ 3 4 5 6   has one list that’s showing what she paid for it.  She 7   makes her best guess.  It's -- you're suggesting that 8   she would be entitled to the notice if she put down 9   "unknown," "value unknown" or "value 100 percent." 10               So your -- on your theory, in order to do 11   what she obviously wants to do, preserve her kitchen 12   equipment, she has to give no information or inaccurate 13   information. 14               If she said -- I think what you're saying is 15   if she said a 100 percent, instead of saying what she 16   thought was the -- the value, or if she said unknown, 17   she would be entitled to notice from -- to an objection 18   from the trustee.  But because she has tried her best to informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she   1   would write 100 percent -- in the third column, 2   rather than the fourth?    Do we know what -- what’s --    Here I thought that the trustee got the appraisal before the creditors’ meeting, because at the creditors’ meeting he said to her, you put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says $17,000.    But this debtor did know at the creditors’ meeting -- she certainly knew that the trustee was claiming the property was worth more than what she listed it as being worth. She could have, at that point -- so she had 22   necessary to bring me safely within the limit.  She 23   didn't do that.

The case comes    We have the factor that you would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly 10   said that here is the rule:  You can't execute the 11   mentally retarded.  However, we are going to leave it to 12   the State to shape the procedure, and what are the 13   elements of retardation?  You would take all that away 14   from Ohio because in a different context, the context of 15   weighing mitigators against aggravators, the Ohio 16   Supreme Court said there was retardation, it is 17   mitigating; however, it was overwhelmed by the 18   aggravators. 19               It's an entirely different operation than, 20   States, here's the rule; the procedure for doing it is 21   up to you.  Ohio didn't have a procedure for doing 22   Atkins.  It couldn't until Atkins was decided.  And now 23   you're saying, oh, Ohio, because you, in the context of 24   weighing mitigators against aggravators, found this 25   mitigator, you cannot shape the Atkins procedure as 34  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   every other State can.

09-367 +++$+++     And if he misses --    Mr. Heytens, one problem with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the 10   leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, 11   within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction 12   and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the 13   restitution. 14 15   must I appeal that first judgment?  Because if I don't, 16   I'll never be able to appeal it. 17               But on your reading, the defendant can't 18   wait.  When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant The defendant has to know at that point, 19 20 21 22   Justice Ginsburg.

And, in fact, this Court and many 7   others have sent very, very complicated issues to the 8   arbitrator to decide.  There is no reason to believe that 9   an arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State 10   law issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will 11   have the discretion and the ability to either strike the 12   entire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses 13   as he or she sees fit. 14               Furthermore, this type of speculation, this 15   fear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected 16   in this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where 17   the Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the 18   arbitrator may do something wrong, may do something 19   right, but at the tail end there will be an ability 20   under section 10 to address it.  There is no difference 21 there. 22               Additionally, this -- this analysis of 23   unconscionability -- I want to reiterate 24   unconscionability is based on a policy decision that -- 25   that attacks an agreement that unquestionably has 56 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   already been made.

09-587 +++$+++    But did -­   So we -- so there is that possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we should assume it was on the merits. What about -- I mean, you said this is three decades, but we are told that the California Supreme Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply "denied," that's most likely that they couldn't all agree on a reason.   But that's what they would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?   If, in fact, the court was divided, all agree that the petition should be denied, but there's no majority for any particular reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say 9  ￼  1 "petition denied," right?

Mr. Burke, before you respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that cost is no longer being incurred?   My question is automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect that that -- there's no longer any expense for ownership. ￼it isn't automatic that because there's one payment, then forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 $471. said.

The 5 you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the 6 court was thinking about the time of delay. 7 The second point is that delay in California 8 is only half the equation. In California, there is the 9 substantial delay and then there's also the 10 justification portion. So persons who operate under 11 substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify 12 that delay and gain the desired review.   And in California, if it just says "denied," then the presumption is it's denied on the merits; is that it?   And -- and if -- so if it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has to be something to indicate that it's for that reason? Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?   Was there reason for and then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely. Why didn't they add that to the original rule?   Well, why would it be different in the capital context? What was the reason for adding the 90 days there?

That's your view?    If -- if you are permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel limited to that point, or can the counsel representing the client bring up other things?    It's not a question of pay.  I think Justice Alito was asking, counsel says: I've got a duty to represent my client zealously.  So, I want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of counsel but these other matters. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   issues.    How much time -- in the procedure you described, appointed counsel does inform Martinez:  I'm not bringing up any -- any claims for you.

10-1016 +++$+++     Need go no further?  I'm sorry.  I -- I didn't --    Was that -- that wasn't part of the original Act, was it?    And so, it was -- that was -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.    In that part.    It wasn't part of the package that was the Family/Medical Leave Act.    But there's some focus in the legislative history particularly on the -- the family that has a single parent -- much more often a woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner getting sick.  So, that was certainly an -- a problem for families with -- with only one breadwinner.  And Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have job security for them.  That wasn't the only group of women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this Act as it came out, didn't it?    So, the leave is a remedy for the problem.  I think there's really not much disagreement about the problem, that there is gender discrimination in the job market.    And then the question is how do we remedy that?

Doesn't want to sell it in combination 5   with anything else.  Wants to sell the drug alone. 6               Can it do so without infringing the 7   method-of-use patent?

10-895 +++$+++     Then that would exclude this case, wouldn't it, because there is a constitutional issue?  It's a speedy trial issue.  But 11   ￼ 1   that issue was not reached below, because the case was 2   dismissed as untimely.  So, the only constitutional 3   issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be 4   adjudicated by the court of appeals.  Isn't that right? 5   Is there another constitutional issue other than the 6   speedy trial issue?    In this -- in this very case, that was so, right?  Because the -- the period for discretionary review expired in August.    And the mandate issued on September -- some date in September.    So, there could be no State habeas until the mandate issued.  So, the days in between would count against the defendant on the speedy trial clock, even though he would -- he could not have filed a State habeas; he could not have stopped the clock by filing a State habeas.
10-930 +++$+++     Well, why should the --    Why should the Court do  ￼ 1   dispose of this case, to conclude that all of these 2   claims were limited to the record, and that it was an 3   abuse of discretion to grant a stay in these cases. 4 Thank you.    The district judge in this case explained why he concluded that there was no issue that couldn't be fairly adjudicated on the basis of the record.  What was wrong with his -- his explanation?  He looked at the case carefully, and he said, there's nothing that can't fairly be adjudicated on the record.

But, if counsel who's appointed as collateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest that the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 33 1   expected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets 2   all this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a 3   sociologist, whoever is going to give us a profile on 4   this person?    Is it true that it's the county that reimburses the direct appeal counsel and the State reimburses the habeas counsel?    Has there ever been such a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has been held ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins 11 claim?
11-1025 +++$+++     Mr. Jaffer, could you be clear on the expanded authority under the FAA?  As I 32  ￼ 1   understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a 2   target was identified and FISA decided whether there 3   was -- the court decided whether there was probable 4   cause.  Under this new statute, the government doesn't 5   say who the particular person or the particular 6   location.  So, there isn't that check.  There isn't that 7 check.    What other measures besides having to travel to have conversations?    Well, the travel overseas I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount attached to it.    But these others -- these other precautions, being more circumspect in their 38   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 questions, talking in generalities --    Yes.

That's what I'm asking you. What possible reason is there to leave out libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights?   Your view is that the 11  ￼  1 limitation is scope of employment.
11-1059 +++$+++     Did that offer include admission of liability? Or was it just that it was going to pay the amount of damages requested?    But it was not possible for anything to be done about the certification because you moved immediately.  The complaint is filed, and then you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment that you did.    Why didn't -- why didn't you file the -- the motion for certification, along with the complaint?    But there is nothing litigated when you have --    And then there is another period of time, and there is no issue preclusion.
11-1085 +++$+++     Mr. Frederick, you say -- you say, you point out, quite rightly, that the 3 4 5   below. 6 7 8 9 efficiency of the market was conceded -- was conceded    It was not challenged. Except that now, in -- in Amgen's brief, there is a suggestion that the efficiency of the market is a more sophisticated question.  And it's not my note -- binary, I think is what they said -- it isn't that it's either efficient or it's not efficient; it depends on other 10 11 12 13   factors.
11-1118 +++$+++     Then what's the difference between, say, antitrust and patent?    Issue preclusion applies only to someone who was a party.    How?    But that, certainly, is not binding.  The -- whatever the State -- whatever the State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no binding effect on that question coming into Federal  ￼ 1     that would be in front of the PTO and is in front of the 2     PTO, as we speak.    But what was the substantial Federal matter in Grable? 14 15    Yes.  And that was going to control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS. 18 19 20    And your -- your distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction where the Federal law controls and patent is what? What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law --    -- copyright law.  Why don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same way in those fields?    So your case turns on the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7     means. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15     inventor. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Those -- I don't see an issue in this case comparable to those.    There's a difference between you and your colleague on what "substantial"    How likely is that, in practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that the State judges will go their own way?

Which is quite something This is taking it from the designated and giving it to somebody who isn't    In -- in your briefs in this case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as an afterthought.

It was denied, right? 23   ￼    We -- we have a brief in -- in the case telling us that the question Justice Breyer is posing, would they look at it; they would say it's irrelevant.    Because what her habitual residence was then doesn't matter one whit to us.  We want to know where she is residing now, and that's the reason why the Scottish court would say it's not relevant to the question before us.  Their question is not a treaty question.  Their question is custody of this child. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   correct. 17  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 (Laughter.)

11-139 +++$+++  
11-1425 +++$+++    But we do have -- we do have, I think, an indication that there are jurisdictions that do it inside of a half-hour.   Ms. Saharsky, what about saying at least they should try, since a number of jurisdictions can do this within a half hour, say, initiate the process while you are going to the hospital; when a half-hour is up you proceed; but at 17  ￼  1 least there has been an effort to get a warrant.
11-1447 +++$+++     Let's back up.  When he asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest of my property.

11-1518 +++$+++     And the Eleventh Circuit know, we're really sympathetic to that, but is that the bank would not let you sell the If you could sell the collateral, then you  ￼ 1 brought, Your Honor. And in that action, let's say it 2 were brought today, it could do nothing to relieve 3 Petitioner of the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and 4 the lower courts here that he has a debt that is -- a 5 substantial debt that is excepted from discharge. He 6 could continue litigating perhaps if he has the 7 resources in -- in Illinois for many more years perhaps, 8 but --    So there's nothing in the record that shows why the bank refused to release any of the collateral?
11-1545 +++$+++ 
11-159 +++$+++     But the words -- you say 18 19 20 21   about that.  And, first, to continue the question of 22   where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference 23   to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(B), the 24   companion to the intestacy provision upon which the 25   Government relies. wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married.    Yes, but if we are going to apply those equal protection decisions to this statute --    But how could it do that when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law of intestacy"?    Well, if we're going back to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that the marriage ends when a parent dies?    So, there wouldn't be -- a child that's born 18 months after the father died wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the marriage would have ended.

11-182 +++$+++  
11-184 +++$+++    Why don't we take this -- this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it as an affirmative defense.    And then that would take whole thing you discussed before about the defense and the Government.  It would be the choice, I want my Title VII case and that's 10 it. 11 12 affirmative 13 that the CSRA claim under Section 7703(c) would -- would 14 be abandoned. And that's -- 6 7 care of the 8 affirmative 9 plaintiff's  1 the CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to 2 hear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I 3 need?

11-199 +++$+++     But, Mr. Yang --    You would -- you would take into account that the prosecution apparently 10 11 12 13   part of the scheme.  We have no direct evidence, because 14   Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez.  He's at 15   the scene, we know that.  And an explanation, an 16   innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene. 17   And then the government comes back, after everything is 18   done, and says:  We want the jury -- we want these tapes back so these tapes can be introduced. That -- the -- we have the witness testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not 19 20 21 22   important?    What was --    What was the line that the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times while she was on the stand, the exact line?    Yes.    The government thought -- thought it was important for the jury to hear it, because they said it three times.    You do agree -- you do agree that the government has the burden of showing that the error is harmless?    It's the government's  54 ￼ 55 1   evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in 2 making --
11-204 +++$+++     But it also says -- it also says promotional work incidental to sales made by someone else.    -- is nonexempt.

But it's got to be non-    Did you claim -- did you claim exemption as administrative employee?    So, that would -- then that would be still open if you lose on the outside  42 ￼ 43 1     But you're just deferring the same inquiry, because the 2     Government's position once again is after 70 years of 3     having the industry proceed on the assumption that these 4     individuals were exempt, they now have changed their 5     mind.  And, again, their view has everything to do with 6     FDA regulation --    Did -- did the pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19     PSRs? 20 21 22 23 24 25    That was an opinion letter, they said.

11-262 +++$+++     Even though this -- I think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific  23 ￼5 6 7 8   prosecution context.

You have the same kind of complex causation problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint.

Mr. Garre, before your time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved, that the gain is just too small to warrant using a racial criteria.

The Court has said 5   in many contexts that officer purpose doesn't matter, 6   and it doesn't matter if the officer is looking for a 7   lost child or thinking that that --    I thought you were talking about a dog trained to detect contraband --    -- not just any old dog.

Is it all right?  Wasn't there also the question of allowing manufacturers to segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad, governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States governed by U.S. law?

So, it's -- it's 16   -- and under the summary judgment standard, they have to 17   find that the challenges that are being made are 18   substantial. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 50    They did write in a -- in their summary judgment opinion, they made it sound like it's very complicated.

But why -- why not? Because, generally -- and at least it's my impression -- that in class certifications, if the liability question can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages question may be adjudicated individually. Take a -- take a Title VII case. A liability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination, therefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an individual basis. So why isn't bifurcation possible here? 4  ￼

So on the face of it, it seems that this -- that that rule fits this case to a T; that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn, defendant objects, and the question is can the counterclaim remain pending for independent 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   adjudication.

It didn't say one word distinguishing what it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in arbitration. It was simply what it was going to cost.

The Supreme Court hadn't even decided that gender-based classifications get any kind of heightened scrutiny.    And the same-sex intimate conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971, so I don't think we can extract much from Baker against 12  ￼ 1 2 acknowledge 3 dismissal. 4 fast on the 5 Honor, I simply make the observation that it seems 6 implausible in the extreme, frankly, for nine justices 7 to have -- to have seen no substantial Federal question 8 if it is true, as the Respondents maintain, that the 9 traditional definition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar    I think it was MCLaughlin    It was cohabitation of people of different races.    And the Court took that case and waited to reach the marriage case.    I may -- my memory may be wrong, but I think the case was that people of different races were arrested and charged with the crime of interracial cohabitation.  And the Court said that that was invalid.

So when does the government decide, yes, we 4 agree with the -- the adjudication in the court of first 5 instance and 6 say, yes, we 7 participate? 8 9 are a number 10 it, Justice Ginsburg. You're right that either of those 11 scenarios is possible. The reason that the government 12 appealed in this case is because the President made the 13 determination that this statute would continue to be 14 enforced, and that was out of respect for the Congress 15 that enacted the law and the President who signed it, 16 and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in 17 saying what the law is. 18 The point of taking an appeal here is that 19 the government suffered an injury because a judgment was 20 entered against the government in the court of appeals. 21 That's a classic case for injury.

12-399 +++$+++     But he didn't.  I mean, he -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights to the mother, but not to a stranger.  And when the issue of adoption came up, he said, "Yes, I want to assert my parental rights."    Where does it -- where is there a reference in the definition of "parent" to a State law?  I see the -- which is the section that defines a parent?    Yes. 11  ￼10 whatsoever. 11     It says a parent means a biological parent of an Indian child and he fits that definition.  And then the next section -- the next sentence doesn't have any reference to State law.    But doesn't 1915 preclude the adoptive parents because they're not in the preferred category?  If 1915(a) precludes the adoption, then the adoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting to an award to the father.    What about now, when you said the best interest.  Now the child has been some 15 months with the father.  So if a best interest calculus is made now, you would have to take into account uprooting that relationship, would you not? 25  ￼ 1 2 3 4 rule.    But I think Justice Breyer is quite wrong because a standard that says results in serious emotional or physical damage to the child is far from a best interest standard.    I thought the definition of an Indian child is just straight out of the statute. 39  ￼ 1 An Indian child is someone who is either a member of a 2 tribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a 3 member of an Indian tribe.    Termination of parental rights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent, which is quite --    That, Ms. Blatt, is what provoked the Act that Indian children were being removed from their families, but the Act is written in much broader terms.

Or am I wrong about that?    Yes. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 retaliation. 17 So, in these statutes, I thought these two 18 traveled together, whatever the standard is for 19 discrimination is the same for retaliation.    But your argument is that, in Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination claim, you're going to have a different standard for  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 this provision treats them differently.
