Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which    Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their 5 6 7   spending? 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So these -- these are reliance damages in a sense.

We are here today because a majority of states 12 have chosen to regulate wine distinctively. And a handful 13   of them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to 14   do so in a discriminatory manner.  So long as states do 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard to other alcohol -- and they don't; there's a flat prohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and other types of spirits -- we will not be here, because there would be no discrimination; there would be a single rule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.

I'd like to get back just for a moment --    -- to the answer you gave about apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I understood the answer.  You said, well, apportionment is very difficult.  What are you supposed to do?  What are you -- what's the base?  Well, and you said, should we apportion against -- between in-state and out-of-state, and I would think the answer is yes.  That's the whole point.    And if we're talking about mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently susceptible of apportionment.  Now, it may be that administratively this is just too expensive.  That may be -- that may be a very valid argument. 29 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 But so far as saying that there's no basis for apportionment, I didn't understand your answer.    That -- that -- I agree that that is expensive.  However, it seems to me that it would be easier to do it with trucks which have miles than with --    -- than with, say, attorneys or accountants or whatever.

Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a 30  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 majority of the Court would find that some of these 2 provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that 3 tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute 4 where we have to save the statute. Do we have any 5 obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let 6 it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why 7 -- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any 8 authority that requires us or permits us to do that?

The -- the 6 court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings 7 that have 8 9 obviously 10 11 for that? 12 13 Honor, but I -- we were very concerned about that.

I'm, frankly, still somewhat surprised at your answer to Justice O'Connor, indicating that it happens all the time where there are two occupants, and one expressly says, "You can't come in," and they do anyway.

You think you can't take from A to give to B, that there is some substance and force to that proposition?    But without the addition, I'd please like an answer to your question.    There are statements in our cases that say you cannot take from A just to give to B.    Do you agree that there is substance to that proposition and that that proposition is correct?    But isn't that exactly what happened in Berman? 31 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    Really?

04-603 +++$+++    Well, my --   Please, please. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Did you finish your answer?   No, please. Well, my -- my initial view of this case was much like Justice Souter's and -- and I still think that that may be -- may be correct.  But I thought your answer to Justice Souter would be that there are many cases in which there is an antecedent Federal title which then goes down through successive purchasers, mining claims, for instance, and those are always under State law.  I -- I thought that would be your answer to Justice Souter and -- and also to Justice Ginsburg.   And you rely on Merrell Dow, which is fine. But I thought there was a separate line of cases that support you, as well as Merrell Dow.    I know you want to reserve your time.  Just one quick thing.

And it goes a little bit beyond the suit, but, 2 as I -- I read through the regulations, and it's the duty 3 of the occupant, or the recipient, of the mail to provide 4 a box or a letter slot or something. Would the failure to 5 do that, so that they just have to put it on the porch -- 6 is that a defense?    You -- because you quote -- you quote, on page 2, the footnote -- you quote the regulation.  But I read that, that it has to be reasonably safe for the mail, because it says, "Oh, you can leave it on a stairway or under a porch, just so long as it's safe for the mail."  That's the way I read that one.    Well, I guess my point --    -- my point is, if there's a duty, then it seems to me the Post Office is used to making these judgments.  And if it does not make the correct judgment, it can be sued. 35  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    I'm not saying --    -- that you're creating a cause of action.

And -- 16 are there other statutes or regulations in respect to the 17 Post Office that talk about "delivery"?

But let's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the argument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be treated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the bankruptcy court.  How is that issue preserved in the question you raise?  You say, maybe the Congress used Article 1 to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity.    It just seems to -- seem to me to be part of the question presented.    Well, you asked -- you framed the    Oh, no, you -- you're right. You're right.  You're exactly right.

04-928 +++$+++     Well, on that --    -- on that substantive does seem -- I assume a Governor could take account in clemency?    And I suppose the Governors 10 this into 11 12 13 can do more than juries can. But, still, it seems odd 14 to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close 15 case. It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of 16 course. It goes at least to whether or not the 17 defendant 18 "I didn't 19 20 responsibility may present different issues, but we 21 would submit that the fundamental problem with the 22 constitutional rule that the Oregon Supreme Court did 23 expressly adopt is that it would effectively allow 24 jurors, at their discretion, to apply what is a higher 25 standard of proof at capital sentencing than the 24 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- is obdurate in not accepting guilt.

05-1345 +++$+++     Well, I'm not so sure. 18 19 20 21   with Carbone.  All you've done is transfer the 22   ownership.  As you know, in Carbone that facility was 23 24 25 destined to be owned within less than 2 years from the time the Court issued its opinion.    But you don't make that, 21  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6   Honor. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21    But, but then, but then Justice Breyer is going to say well, you --    -- that you, that you can bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a little bit --    -- actually is greater than the sum of it.    At least that's not the way you answered Justice Breyer. 22   the rest of it.  And there are -- I mean, it -- 23   Justice Kennedy is totally right.  There are all kinds 24   of combinations and permutations.  There, there could be 25   distributors who are in fact regulated private companies 22  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I 2   guess there, there is one generator, at least, company 3   that's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA. 4   They, they make their own. 5               So there are all kinds of permutations and 6   combinations.  And I think we're getting at, when we 7   take that aspect of the permutation and combination and 8   say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government 9   says:  "Our way or the highway."  You know, that's what 10   they say.  "Buy from us."  Period. 11               And if you're in a certain region, I've 12   always thought they could do that.  And I have to admit 13 14 15 16   way.  It's my, my way of seeing this case law is that 17   there's -- that the rule is simple:  if you are doing 18   something to interfere with the free flow of interstate 19   commerce, you're subject to strict scrutiny.  And maybe 20   in that situation, maybe it survives strict scrutiny.  I 21   don't know that they would in this day and age, when 22   getting, getting gas or other kinds of power to a 23   commercial establishment, for example, is not very 24   difficult and would not necessarily tear up the 25   infrastructure, or whatever.  I think they might -- 23 I never really looked it up; I've just never came across a case that says to the contrary.    Can you give me one case of it being strict scrutiny?    I mean, I just didn't realize that that phrase entered into our Commerce  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Clause jurisprudence.  Correct me if I'm wrong.    But certainly on burden cases we don't require that. 10 11 12   talk about in the price context.  But in the earlier 13   cases they referred, cases like Minnesota versus Barber 14   and some of the other, earlier cases, refer to it as 15   being burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant 16   was there are certain kinds of regulations, and I think 17   it's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local 18   needs requirements, local processing requirements, 19   things likes that, which basically so obstruct 20   interstate commerce as to require the virtual per se 21   rule. 22 23 24 25 25    Well, it might be a good revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other than ours and we'll charge triple the price.    That's not a burden on interstate commerce?    Suppose the user fee were ten times what it is?    Why is that?    Well, I suppose any private entity can choose its market.    I suppose any private  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you 2   enforce use of that by the criminal law.  So you're 3   engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an 4   extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to 5   enforce its use.    But I thought that was just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your point two.    Who mandated this plan? The State of New York?    But the State of New York can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.    If you say the Congress of the United States has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that. That has happened.
05-1429 +++$+++     No, no.  But in my case, it's a post-petition action.    Are they --    Let me just ask you about the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question. 1 2 3 4   fees are allowable.  Can the bankruptcy court make the Let's assume that you're correct in that the 5 6 7 8 9 10 11   determination under State law.  Every State, Your Honor, determination of the reasonableness of the fees?    In this case.    So -- so if the bankruptcy 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   and all States do.  The bankruptcy court adopts the 22   State reasonableness standard for unsecured claims under 23   Section 502(b)(1).  Yes, Justice Breyer?    But the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.    No, no.  But -- but we are talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in the bankruptcy proceeding?    The cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et 20  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   even hire an attorney until after the bankruptcy case 2   was filed, the attorney performed services, filing a 3   proof of claim, protecting the equitable rights, and the 4   Second Circuit clearly held that those attorneys' fees 5   were properly part of the unsecured claim, but it 6   couldn't be any clearer.  And the Second Circuit -- 7 8 9    That doesn't -- and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this 13 14 15 16   security?  They'll not be just be claims for fees that 17   would stand together with the unsecured creditors, but 18   that the oversecured -- the security will cover the 19   interest, will cover the attorneys' fees, and that's the 20   function of 506 whatever --    Well, Timbers cited, as the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in 21 22 23 24   506(b) is.  But there are more indications.  It would be 25   odd for Congress, for example, to draft this provision is misleading on this point.

Of course it's a pre-petition 6   obligation.  Just like pre-petition interest -- excuse 7   me -- post-petition interest is a pre-petition 8   obligation we are arguing that the code cancels that 9   obligation because there are very important reasons, 10   such as equality among all unsecured creditors, the --

So these are two different schemes and here 3   you have to -- we are advised that even if there was a 4   levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you 5   paid the extra 900.

Is there some analog in ordinary criminal proceedings where you challenge, in advance, the validity of the charge?    What fundamentals, other than personal presence, are you concerned with in this case?    Or is that it?    I understand --    -- the nature -- the appointing authority and so forth.

The CSRT in no way suffices to do 4 that. It didn't ask those questions about, Are -- you 5 know, uniforms, and the like, to my knowledge. Of course, 6 the CSRT isn't in the record, so we don't really know. 7 The Government said, below, that it had, quote, "zero 8 effect on this case," and didn't introduce it. 9 But, be that as it may, suppose that the CSRT 10 did decide that Mr. Hamdan is an enemy combatant. Justice 11 Kennedy, most enemy combatants are prisoners of war. So, 12 if anything, all the CSRT did was affirm Mr. Hamdan's 13 separate claim, apart from Common Article 3, to the full 14 protection of the Geneva Conventions. 15 If I --    But I have --    -- I have -- I have trouble with the argument that -- insofar as he says there is a structural invalidity to the military commission, that he 42 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 brings that before the commission.

Let's assume that there's a valid reason for redoing section 23.  That means you need another district to avoid retrogression. What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on that assumption, based on that assumption?    Well, can the -- can the State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's entitled and I -- defense? to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant I think insulting way and -- and then have a    And that's a --    Well, if you say that mid- districting is suspect or subject to some 15 decennial 16 special rules, then it seems to me that you're -- 17 you're taking away a very important deterrent that 18 works on legislatures when they do decennial 19 districting. If you know as a legislature, when you do 20 a decennial districting, that your program is going to 21 be presumptively valid or not subject to partisan 22 gerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're 23 liable to overreach.

I would think you'd say no injunction because, at the end of the day, it amounts to nothing.    Can you cite us to something for the -- can you cite something to that effect?    For your answer.    Would California allow you to intervene when it has a no-subrogation rule?    Well, then how are you going to prevent the funds from being commingled or being assigned immediately to a trust?

And the Court --    What happens if the 10 11 12 13   court?  I take it one of the concerns we have here is 14   that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the 15   certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court. 16   Suppose that there is a denial of certification.  Then Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State under (d)(3) --    -- the employee can ask  ￼ 1   jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps 2   you or helps the Petitioner.    But my point is I suppose the Government can just say, we're not going to make the certification and we're not going to remove.    I'm not sure if that helps. It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench trials in almost every case.    So then the State court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of 16   court.  And one reason that that is so essential under 17   the Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity -- 18   if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of 19   the employee, that has many, many consequences, 20   including that the United States is the proper 21   defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal 22   court, the case must be dismissed until an 23   administrative claim is filed and that avenue is 24   exhausted. 25               All of these procedural and substantive 42  ￼ 1   defenses come into play depending on how the scope of 2   employment issue is resolved.

May I ask you this  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   offenses as felony offenses, particularly in situations 2   in which they result in serious bodily harm or death to 3   another, as Your Honor previously noted. 4               The issue in this case comes down to the 5   interpretation of the statute that Congress wrote, not a 6   hypothetical statute that Congress could have written. 7   And that statute identifies one criterion for 8   determining whether or not a felony offense qualifies as 9   a violent felony under the ACCA, and that is its 10   potential for harming other human beings. 11               Drunk driving is commonly understood to 12   present a serious potential risks of injury.  The 13   potential risks of injury are the only reason why it's a 14   crime under the laws of 50 States.  And the risks 15   associated with drunk driving are comparable in both 16   kind and degree to the risks associated with arson and 17   explosives use, two crimes that Congress specifically 18   identified in the statute as satisfying its definition. 19               For that reason, we think that the court of 20   appeals correctly determined that Mr. Begay was 21   sentenced properly under the Armed Career Criminal Act 22   and would urge the Court to affirm its determination. 23 24   you.

And supposedly, it was burden of the drug company to show --    You agree with -- you agree with Mr. Waxman that the FDA specifically addressed the risks and benefits of IV push as opposed to the risks of arterial exposures?    I don't understand what  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Riegle, where the preemption turns on that device, in 2   that case, and the labeling that was presented.  Here 3   the preemption turns on the labeling and the drug that 4   was presented.  And FDA regulations prohibit the change 5   unless there is new information. 6               If I could make one other point about 7   Riegle.  Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed 8   preemption provision.  But the reason why this Court 9   found preemption in Riegle under that provision is very 10   instructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the 11   premarket approval process in the two situations are 12   essentially the same. 13               And what you had on the one hand was Federal 14   action having the force of law like under the file rate 15   doctrine or some administrative determination having the 16   force of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a 17   legal prohibition against changing that without new 18   information.  And on the state side, you have a rule of 19   law under the common law of torts imposing a different 20   obligation.  Those are squarely termed --    If we conclude that new information is the criterion for deciding this case, if we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if there's new information, then the label has to be changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this verdict be sustained?    And the Vermont court's 44  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Vermont Supreme Court's opinion totally, because it does 2   go into the area that you're talking about, Justice 3   Kennedy, but if I could refer the Court to trial record 4   testimony, which is set out in the joint appendix and 5   more elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes 6   clear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these 7   comparative risks.  It should have had a basis for 8   changing its label or proposing to FDA a different 9   label, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the 10   Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care. 11   And we think the judgment on that basis could be 12   sustained. 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   application when they were reformatting.

And the 19   government -- which as well is an impairment, which I 20   think is quite wrong because that's not what section (c} 21   intended for.  But that's almost an admission on the 22   government's part that it can't find any words in 23   section (b) either.    So then Congress did nothing by the amendment to help your case.

Did the trial judge in this case cite the findings and the observations he made during the competency hearing in open court as -- for the support of the ruling?    What about the competency hearing that was held in open court with the defendant?    Well, now you're falling back on the very psychiatric evaluation in the first part of the trial that you disparage in the second.    I still don't know your "yes" or "no" answer.

And in this case -- in this Court's 21   own Kolstad case, if you look at it again, it says 22   Amiable Nancy, Lake Shore and the way you implement 23 that -- was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.    But they have not conceded 43  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that's because he was not entitled to set aside the 2   policy on intoxication.    So the corporation's responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply not relevant under your theory of the case, even though that's what you talk about in your brief.    Well, but that -- that goes to measures, not to liability.    That was the first phase. And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you have to explain.    Correct me if I'm wrong. You've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says that the appellate court has to examine de novo to determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award to deter.    Well, then, a fortiori, it gives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting as a common-law-type court.    But isn't the measure what 10 11 12   is necessary to deter?  Isn't that what we've asked 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   applicable limits.  And that's -- I think one reason 21   why, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence.  And so, I think 22   let's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that 23   discussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said 24   that deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to 25   punishment. 70 first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?

I suggest that Miller may be 62  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   emphasis of Miller is not useful as a limiting principle 2   to the type of arms that may be -- that may be 3   permitted.  Because, on the one hand, there's a great 4   deal of weaponry that might be wonderful for military 5   duty but is not appropriate for common civilian use, 6   which would not be protected even under the Miller 7   test's first prong. 8               And, on the other hand, everything that 9   civilians today might wish to have in ordinary common 10   use -- handguns, rifles, and shotguns -- are militarily 11   useful weapons. 12               So we de-emphasize the military aspects of 13   Miller as being ultimately not very useful guidance for 14   courts.  And the better guidance would be to emphasize 15   the commonsense rule that I think judges would have 16   really no trouble applying, and we do this all the time 17   in constitutional law:  To simply make a decision as to 18   whether or not whichever arm comes up at issue is an arm 19   of the kind that you could really reasonably expect 20   civilians to have.

Then you have to comply with the 13   vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher 14 sentence?    What do you think is the rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I think I'm going to increase the sentence?    But what's sua sponte --    It's a resentence. 8   There's a new judgment, a new conviction.  What happens 9 then?    Well, actually rule 35 was changed because it used to be based on the mandate.  But now rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after the verdict or finding of guilty.  So that would indicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.    Within the scope of the 20 - Subject to Final Review  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   appeal, which brings us right back to this case. 2 3 mandate. 4 5   mandate rule as being consistent with your general 6   theory of the case.  Because if the court of appeals 7   cannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that 8   the court of appeals' mandate would authorize the 9 relief? 10               It would seem to me that you've either got 11   to take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a 12   kind of neutral order.  The district courts may or may 13   not have authority to do something after the mandate 14   comes down.  But I don't see how you can take the 15   position that the mandate, itself, by the court of 16   appeals will, itself, determine what the district court 17 can do.    I don't know about your initial premise.  I -- I take it the policy here is that the defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake in the appeal.  He shouldn't be surprised.    If he cross-appeals, fine; if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes 10 11 are.

You say he hasn't been charged, but 25   we're going to hold you in jail.  That's very strange. 28 question is, suppose this were weeks, would counsel be required to be appointed?    If we said that when a defendant is ordered held in custody, that there is then a right of counsel, would we be contradicting any of our precedents as opposed, say, to extending them?

Somebody -- they give -- and 21   let's say a person had lower performance ratings than 22   another person who was retained or given promotion. 23   Your position is the employee can always contest that 24   and say that's not the real reason; that's not factually 25   supported; is that correct? 13    I don't find anything in Olech that says that every action that does not have a reason is constitutionally infirm.    Do you think Olech was correctly decided?    And public employment is different just because it's going to be a big problem? What --    And that's because of existence of other avenues of redress. 17 18 19   a factor.  It's because of, again, this Court's 20   recognition in other contexts that public employees 21   simply are not on the same footing as private citizens 22   generally with regard to their employers, and that 23   Federal court is simply not the appropriate forum in 24   which to review the day-to-day decisionmaking of public 25   employers; and because of recognition of the inherently 37    I understood that the argument -- statement that this really has not generated an awful    But what authority do you have for us to parse different governmental actions and say some are subject to the Equal Protection Clause and some are not?

It's a litigable issue whether there would 11   be the potential for a plaintiff to show, as the 12   defendant in this case did not try to show, that there 13   was a degree of deliberate indifference to a need to 14   have a reliable recordkeeping system such that some 15   official would be personally liable for the failure to 16 have that.    And there are three 20 21 22 23   reasons.

But 6   you don't seem to make any of those arguments.  You just 7   want to keep coming back to officer safety and on that 8   point I think your case is very weak.    Fine, if you want to go 19 20 21 22   the field can guide their conduct.  There's going to be 23   instances in which the risk is going to be higher, and 24   there's going to be instances where the risk is lower. 25   And, admittedly, we are on the end of the continuum, but 23 but if that's your argument I'll take it from there.    The only reason to search that I can find from you so far is officer safety.    Diminished expectations of privacy are not a reason to search.    It actually works the other way, because it means there is more reason to 10   there.

And you 17 say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the 18 categories that have been used in the obscenity area and 19 that -- that there's an obvious parallel there. 20 The problem is, is that for generations 21 there has been a societal consensus about sexual 22 material. Sex and violence have both been around a long 23 time, but there's a societal consensus about what's 24 offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial 25 discussions on it. Now, those judicial discussions are 14 ￼  1 not precise. You could have had the same questions 2 today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we 3 have -- we have said that with reference to obscenity, 4 there are certain -- that there are certain materials 5 that are not protected. Those rules are not precise at 6 the margins, and some would say not precise in a more 7 significant degree as well. 8 But you're asking us to go into an entirely 9 new area where there are no consensus, no judicial 10 opinions. And this is -- and this indicates to me the 11 statute might be vague, and 12 know that -- that reaction. 13 (Laughter.)   I can see your white light's on. But even if we get past what I think are difficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret this law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative with the -- a V-chip?   Yes.   So V-chips don't work.
08-1457 +++$+++     But that is like the de Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine would leave in place everything that has been done. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   point.  What I'm saying and what these cases say is 39    But it seems to me that's quite a different -- different point.
08-146 +++$+++     Well, in a way that was where one of the parties, without the other party's 7   objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement 8   to come into play.  That's their theory.
08-1470 +++$+++     So there’s a difference 22   1   between waiving at the time of the interrogation and 2   then waiving it at the time of trial?  I don't 3   understand that.   But I just want to make sure where we are.   You’re not -- you’re conceding, it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?    I don't know why you  1   admitted at trial.    But there also assumes there has to be a waiver.

08-1555 +++$+++     Counsel, I -- I want to just say that I have one problem with the case at the outset. And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your 18 19 20 21   Let's assume -- I know this is not your position.  Let's 22   assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grants a question that goes to the other counsel, too. I'm having difficulty seeing how the issues as presented in the brief really resolve very much. 23   immunity to the state for this conduct and for a 24   then-serving official who is its agent and for a former 25   agent.  Let's assume there is -- there is immunity.  Why 3  5 6 7 8 9 at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your -- your good introduction. isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the later enactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   thing.  Also, the government previously argued that the 21   TVPA has to be interpreted consistent with preexisting 22   immunity principles.  When Congress wants to waive  1 2 3 4   way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it.  But I say that I just don't see the issue structured that    What case authority do you have for that proposition?    It's like a -- it's like a clear statement rule?    Of course, that -- again,   1   the Torture Victim Protection Act says “an individual 2   who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color 3   of law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to 4 torture.” 5               Why isn't that a clear statement?  And then 6   I’ll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to 7   talking about the FSIA.    I had thought when I read the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked about the statute, that they took your position, this first position, that the Act just won't work unless 25     And your red light has 45  4 5 6 7 8 9 office at the time, what the policies were. But it's just not clear to me what body of principles the State Department looks to, to make this determination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is immune and Jones isn't. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   trying to wrap themselves in.  So the FSIA is not the 17   source.  1   same question.  I would agree that the State Department 2   might have some expertise in telling us what the facts 3   were:  Who was the government, who was -- who was in
08-1569 +++$+++     That’s -- yes, that’s Harris.   What's the -- I don't want to interrupt your nice organization here. But what is the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to support the distinction between 30 being necessarily an element and 7 a sentencing factor? What's the general rule here? just --   -- other than how awful this is.   Please. 32  ￼ Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general 10   principle.  The general principle is this, at least in     Is that just based on empirical studies or is there guideline support for that?    I understand.  I understand

(Laughter.) - Subject to Final Review    But it -- can you tell me,  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   anything in the U.S. Attorney's Manual that specifically 2   addresses this statute, but of course the Court 3   recognized in Batchelder that prosecutors legitimately 4   have discretion when there are different criminal 5   statutes that cover the conduct, and --
08-205 +++$+++     And I -- and I think Buckley says no.    But, as a practical matter, is that always true? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   that was kind of somehow suspect?  That is not a basis 17   for prohibiting speech by a whole class of individual --
08-214 +++$+++     For you to tell me oh, this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way the world works.    If I thought that the lack of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal point or a relevant point for our decision, other than the representations of counsel, where would I look to verify that?    The -- the -- that there is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take maintenance and cure cases. 10 11 12 13   empirical evidence out there.  Nobody has done studies. 14   I'm not aware of any.  But do we really want to wait for 15   the situation where we have hundreds and hundreds of

08-267 +++$+++     You might say that there 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   concern. 17 is a lurking constitutional question and that we ought to interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional    In the civilian courts or the military courts?    Well, let's assume it 38  ￼9 10 11 perfectly good answer.    -- and I would be interested in the answer.    In coram nobis cases in 44  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   had to invent a procedural device:  There's going to be the civil system, do courts appoint special masters when they're an appellate court and they have to find out if coram nobis was --    Or do they use district courts as special masters?    In this case, the court 10   a new court-martial, which is a little odd because it's 11   a new court-martial sitting in judgment on somebody who 12   isn't even in the military any more.

It's as a consequence 15   of that clause that this issue even arises.  And I think 16   the Attorney General --    But -- yes, but that seems to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the answer you gave Justice Scalia.

And what's the practical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I want to know the practical rationale for that, the practical reasons why that should make sense.    I'd like to go back to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   just a totally -- a category that is much -- many 2   magnitudes greater than the number of criminal, civil, 3   and administrative hearings.  You are going to have 4   millions of documents all over this country in file 5   cabinets that are generated by local and State 6   governments that there is no possibility the vast 7   majority of those would ever come across the attention 8   of the Federal Government.  And so you want concerned 9   citizens to be looking through, monitoring their local 10   governments, digging up these reports and bringing 11   lawsuits based on those.  The Federal Government's 12 13 14 15   right?  I mean, do you think that finding the way the 16   government wants us to find will produce a revision of 17   this really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do 18   you think that finding for the other side, giving the 19   government some incentive to get this fixed, would 20   likely produce a proper amendment?  What do you think? 21   I think the latter, to tell you the truth.
08-305 +++$+++     Well, but it's not that 18   adequate IEP.  So there are two conditions.

08-472 +++$+++ 
08-479 +++$+++ 
08-495 +++$+++     I suppose your answer, it's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense.    Your position is that in ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?    That's my point.    I take it that that's your whole argument.
08-538 +++$+++     Well, they don't always liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they don't have to sell it.    What -- what -- what you 13     And -- and if you take that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each   1   listen, I really want to keep the equipment itself, I 2   don't think there's any value here for the estate, there 3   is a statutory mechanism to address that.  Section 4   554(b) says quite clearly that if -- if a party in 5   interest believes that there is an asset as to which 6   there is inconsequential value, they can seek an order 7   compelling the bankruptcy -- compelling the trustee to 8   abandon that asset to the debtor. 9               So there is -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg's 10   question -- there is a mechanism for addressing the 11   concern that Your Honor has with a debtor who wants a 12   determination that they keep a particular asset, but --    He has to.  Otherwise, he is at risk that it might be worth $400,000 or whatever.    Or “100 percent of    I mean, I understand your position, but you can't say there’s nothing else she  1   full.  The district court looked at this, the court of 2   appeals looked at this, all to the same conclusion. 3               Now, I think it's important to underscore 4   the purpose of the statute and the rules.  They address 5   a very practical problem.  We need to know, right away, 6   at the beginning of the case, is this property the 7   debtor gets to keep, or is this property of the estate, 8   which the trustee can sell? 9               We need to know this because, under section 10   363(b), a trustee cannot sell property if it is not 11   property of the estate.  And if the property is claimed 12   as exempt and nobody files an objection, it is exempt 13   under 522(l).  The trustee cannot sell it.  Now --  ￼14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   she puts a value of $100,000?  Is that --    But that -- but the very fact that it’s -- that there's going to be a sale may indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.    You mean if the trustee thinks there's a problem?
08-586 +++$+++     Do you think Congress used  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   just find that quite a puzzling use of the word 2   "fiduciary." 3 4 5 6 7   use of the term "fiduciary."  I don't know why Congress 8   didn't use some other word. Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or in some special sense, fine.    But it seems to me an odd    Well, I would be very 20 21 22 23   figure.  It could mean a range.

I think the convention -- the explanatory 23   report makes clear that the convention is designed to 24   protect all of the ways in which joint custody can 25   arise and be awarded under domestic law.

And --    In -- in calling the rate 16  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 that was agreed upon a presumption of a reasonable rate?    So you don't quarrel with    -- or would you quarrel with that characterization?    But the rationale is the 37  1   an entity that was not a party to the contract.  That's 2   the question.  And what's your answer to that? ￼ 3 4 5 6 7 8   about contracts.  And --    Does anything in your argument turn on the fact that the Respondents were parties to the settlement process?
08-678 +++$+++  
08-680 +++$+++     You join counsel for the State in just not wanting to argue for a time rule, which seems to me the only thing that would work.    That's become apparent, and I'm indicating that I think the time rule might have some benefits. 10 11 12 13   it rejects our primary submission.  In United States v. 14   Green, the government argued for a raw passage of time 15   approach, and we think, ultimately, this is the Court's 16   rule, it's a second order prophylaxis rule that is    But the Speedy Trial Act, with many exceptions, requires that you go to trial 28  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   within 70 days.  Would that be a benchmark?
08-681 +++$+++ 
08-724 +++$+++     Well, if -- if the strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to some extent, Justice Scalia have outlined is a correct strategy, would you go on to say that the implementation of that strategy was substandard? It's rambling, you have to -- in order to 27    What -- what is the case that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme courts, where it is said that the implementation of the strategy was just inept -- totally inept. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   this case doesn't present those nuances.  This case 25   presents the case where the lawyer stands up at closing 28 I mean, is that what your argument is here?    Again, that depends on, oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom. This -- this is very hard for us -- you know, he was trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously. These are things that are very difficult for us to assess.
08-728 +++$+++     I see.
08-769 +++$+++     So your answer to my hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute?    Suppose an argument -- Suppose an argument had been made to the 44 - Subject to Final Review 1   there has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as 2   a result of this statute?    But that's the argument you are making. - Subject to Final Review    On this economic causation, I think we have to defer to Congress largely.    Well, it seems to me that we ought -- if there is a significant chance that Congress can affect an illegal market, an illegal activity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to  ￼19 20 21 22   they want to express.  That's okay? 23 24 25    What was your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?
08-810 +++$+++     They have not had --

All right.  What is -- what is the authority for us to find that there is an implication in the statute to remove just for cause? There’s -- wouldn't that be unique in our precedents?    I mean, if there is a removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all  invalid?  1   understanding about the SEC commissioners is that the 2   SEC commissioners were, essentially, the same as the FTC 3   commissioners, which, under -- which, under Humphrey's, 4   were removable only for cause, and as I believe --
08-876 +++$+++     Well, it's a little -- it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an argument that shows a way the statute can be saved cannot be -- cannot be presented. 10 11 12 13 14   this construction.  And if you do, his -- his conviction 15   must be set aside.    I mean, he's saying the statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this --    The employer finds out about it, he fires -- so it's material because you would be fired for it. 10 11 12   element.  It's not a divided loyalties issue.    He drives to the ball game in the government -- in the company car.
08-905 +++$+++     But, again, I'm not sure we would parse that out up here.    Oh, well, you mean we have to look to see how the analysts react?
08-911 +++$+++     All right.  So absent a regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under that provision, right?    Why? 15  ￼            Now, if you had no regulation upon it, wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of the Attorney General?    No.  No, that's not my 10 11 12 13   the statute.  The statute says there -- subchapter 2, hypothetical.    Just so we can talk about  10   specifically noted in the text of the statute.    Again, that seems odd, that the thing Congress cares about so much that it makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial review.    Can you give me an idea of how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for review each year?    So we are talking about 2 or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?    Well -- but that would be a question of law which is accepted.    Have any of those courts said that they don't have a workload problem? 29  ￼  1               (Laughter.)    Do you think absent the special provisions of the -- of the immigration act that 44   1   we are considering, if it were just under the APA, that 2   a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency 3   discretion under 702?  Because it seems to me that, you 4   know, there are sources we could look to, to see whether 5   or not it's rationally exercised.    -- you don't take that --    Now, what -- on what page? Look at page 6 --
08-964 +++$+++     And so in the insurance case, it takes a person to go over to the Bureau of Statistics and compile statistics on -- on life -- on life expectancy.    But it would be different, it seems to me, than what you are -- let's assume you 10   you can take an alphabet to make beautiful words, and -- 11   and so forth.  You -- you want to say that these -- 12   these electronic signals can be used in a way just like 13   the alphabet can be used. 14               And many of the scientific briefs say that 15   their process is different, that they are taking 16   electronic signals and turning them into some other sort 17   of signal.  But that's not what you are doing.    That's what I thought. And is it -- is it machine or transformation, in your view?    That's -- that's a problem    You thought we -- you thought we’d mess it up.
08-969 +++$+++     Could you satisfy Justice Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by saying that if there were a corporation that went around to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and that would be closer to your case?    Well -- well, you're certainly consistent and persistent on that point. - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   for the seller and a savings for the buyer.  That is 8   what we allege and, given the opportunity, we can prove 9   that.

It 15   is -- we lost an opportunity.  Look -- proximate cause because this was the business model? How do I explain that in terms of proximate cause? There's not specific intent.    Okay, and in terms of proximate -- the universe of the law that we call 44  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   proximate cause, how do you explain that?  It's not 2   specific intent.
08-970 +++$+++     For extraordinary  ￼            The situation you posit would be addressed by a downward adjustment of the number of hours 10 11   reasonably spent working on the case.

And that's -- that's how that situation would be 15 16 17 18   he wins and they are beating his door down?

09-11311 +++$+++    I'm sure you'll do so in the course of your argument, but at some point give us some examples of violations of -- of this -- this statute which from a commonsense standpoint don't involve a serious risk.

A State can surrender its -- its -- a State can confer more authority on the Federal Government than the Constitution does?
09-1233 +++$+++    Overcrowding is the overcrowding is the principal cause, as testified, and it's now time for a remedy. The court can't -- has to at some point remedy, and that's what it did, and that, me, was a perfectly reasonable decision.   Yes, but the State -- the not claim that either order in either case has in achieving a remedy. You've never claimed   And -- and just if I could   1 Now, I recognize, of course, that Congress 2 has -- had imposed a special duty on us. But I think it 3 means that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that 4 is the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible 5 period of time. And it seems to me there is massive 6 expert testimony to support that proposition on the part 7 of -- of the prisoners.   Well, but the experts testified to that effect.   And the strike force and the governor's -- governor's commission reached the same conclusion.   The strike team, I think they called them.   I have this question, and this goes just to remedy.   I recognize the district court has to be given considerable discretion. It shows the 137.5 figure because it's halfway between 145 and 130.   I think that certainly the Prison Litigation Reform Act means that you have to, if you -- if there's going to be a release order, it must be releasing the minimum amount -­   -- that will effect the purposes of the remedy order. There was substantial expert opinion that 145 -- 145 percent would be sufficient. Isn't -- doesn't the evidence indicate to you that at least 145 ought to be the beginning point, not 137.5?   That there was no -- and I 59  ￼  1 understand -­   MR. SPECTER 6  The experts that -- who 7 were testifying were quite aware of the fact that 8 overcrowding related to the constitutional violations. 9 That was their whole theory.   If you take the State's concession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the Federal court order is 2 years, we're talking about 3 years. Is there any indication of how fast the State's remedy would click in? Are we talking maybe about a 5 percent differential for the last 3 years, or -­   No, no. I'm saying,

09-1273 +++$+++    Before the statute was amended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there was a breach of the agreement, did the government assess penalties?

What was the contract remedy that it had at the time this case arose, which was before the -- these mechanisms.

09-1343 +++$+++    Would you say the same thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a hypothetical, the distributor were in France -- machine manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and the distributor then selects the United States and then the same facts, New Jersey? United States would be an appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but not New Jersey?   Assuming the statute that Justice Scalia hypothesizes.   It's a little odd that the States, which have residual sovereignty, which are not 15 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 16 1 limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the 2 United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than 3 in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here, 4 does have jurisdiction.

What would be the rationale for admitting this statement, then? Is it more reliable? Because if we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which says reliability is not the key. What is the reason for that? Is it because the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -­ the statements and to ask loaded questions? That in itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the rationale for the distinction?
09-152 +++$+++    But -- but you assume that there is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who defend these suits to assess settlement offers. This is a -- this is a tremendous expense.   It -- it may well be that the manufacturer has to settle a meritorious case; we all know that.

If you sue the municipality, if they deny a marriage license, do you have to sue under 1983, or you can just sue alleging a Federal cause of action under -- because of a denial of a constitutional right?   It would be like a Bivens action, I guess.   The only way to sue a municipality for a constitutional violation is under 1983?   But could you sue outside of 1983?   Just to get -- the marriage license example -- just to get an order demanding issuance of the license.   And that has to be a statute -- it has to be 1983?   And have -- have we said that in a case?   Because it seems to me it would help you in this case, because you would say, well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured party can sue for an injunction. Perhaps the State was against the party first, and he can -- he can raise a constitutional defense or he can bring an action for an injunction, and it doesn't have to be under 1983. And it would seem to me that that would resolve it. And you then wouldn't have to pay attorneys' fees because there's no provision in the statute for it.

09-400 +++$+++    Well, that's a sweeping rule. I was going to ask a related hypothetical. Suppose the -- the officer who's in charge, charged with the decision to terminate or not to terminate, says: I'm going to have a hearing. You can both have counsel. And you have -- who is it -- suppose Buck -- suppose the two employees that were allegedly anti-military here testified, and they said there was no anti-military bias, and the person is then terminated. Later the employee has evidence that those two were lying. Could he bring an action then?   That's sweeping. That's almost an insurer's liability insofar as the director of employment is concerned.   He has to ensure -- he -­ that he has done everything he can. He has a hearing, and he has almost absolute liability.

What's your -- no, it's a hypothetical case.    What would your position be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?
09-520 +++$+++    But in light of our AFC case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that 3 - Subject to Final Review ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the 2 statute gives more protection in the case of 3 non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -­ 4 an odd reading of the statute, which is directed 5 primarily to the -- to the property tax.   But in this case -­ correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural users, and construction and timber companies -­   -- have the same -- have the same tax structure as the railroads.   So there is an objective reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the category of road -- road users. Now, if -- unless you are arguing the discrimination has to have -- has to have a purposive component. That might give you a different case. I'm not sure you prevail on that, either.   -- in case -- in case welcome back. That's going to be your

Can't we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a false statement, is a given in the case? Now, maybe you'll be able to prove otherwise. You say that they're not liable anyway.   And it seems to me that's what the argument here is mostly about.   Well, let's say that JCM's principal officers and managers wrote the statement. You still say there's no liability?   Yes. It's attributable, at least publicly, to JCM.   Just -- just to clarify Justice Breyer's hypothetical. In your -- in the 24  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 hypothetical you gave where the president gives an innocent board of directors false information and the prospectus goes out, is the company liable because their agent -- is the company liable under 10b-5?   Yes.   So what you're saying is that the -- the agency relation that the president of the company holds is different that than the agency relation that JCM holds?   Why is that?   Well, but -­   But that's the allegation. MR. PERRY they did do those things. Suppose it were they did 100 percent of the prospectus work.   1 that, Justice Kennedy, since it's so far beyond what 2 they could possibly prove here. What happened here -­
09-529 +++$+++    I've been looking for it. - Subject to Final Review   Going back to your exchange with Justice Breyer, I assume that you could stand by your answer and say the attorney general could sue the governor, because he's not suing the governor in his official capacity. He has a Federal right under Ex parte Young to sue the governor as an individual. It's a fiction; we all know that. But that's the way it works, and this is a Federal right.   I think that's your position.   Of course -- of course, Verizon was a private party.
09-530 +++$+++     Well, I -- I have to agree with the implication of Justice Ginsburg's remark, at least what I imply from it. Look at the private employment sphere.  It seems to me that for a sensitive position, a bank who has people taking care of -- its employees taking care of other people's money, or the medical profession, that the employer could be sued and would be remiss if it did not ask this question.

Are 15   you saying that private employers cannot ask that 16   question?    But that was enjoined by the court below; was it not? - Subject to Final Review 1   not a private employer can ask third persons the 2   question that's at Form 42 question 7.  I thought your representation to me was that private employers cannot ask that question. 3 4 5 6   Honor, I misspoke.  The question goes --    All right.    You said there are 22 people at JPL that are involved in the employment?
09-559 +++$+++     Was that pursuant to the Public Records Act that we’re talking about --    -- or was that part of the initiative and referendum structure before the Public Records Act was passed?

This case will likely be controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because that's the most fully developed. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   Record.  But did you look at the history of the Petition 19 Clause?    But, of course, that can cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a 15 16 17 18   Justices asked:  Well, what can we tell from what, you 19   know, someone who signed?  Do we know how they’re going 20 to vote. 21               I -- I agree that many people signing a 22   petition are going to vote in favor of -- in the case of 23   an initiative, in favor of the law the initiative would 24   put on the ballot.

The -- the point of concern here is that we're going to have to go through a list, case by case, of everything there has to be training on. 10 11 12 13   some important distinctions here.  And, first of all, 14   when you're talking about search and seizure, when 15   you're talking about Miranda, you're talking about those 16   things, the actor that is committing the constitutional 17   tort there is not the district attorney.

I don't see why you don't lose anyway, because the allegation here, the complaint, the argument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion, and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal ground to set aside the -- the sentence.   Well, it's a motion made reviewable by the appellate courts of the

09-958 +++$+++    But that's an abuse of not an absence of power. You're arguing an   Under a pre-emption -- a pre-emption argument?   Do you --   Do you agree with the the Petitioner that if the State chose to  counsel for allow its courts to issue an injunction on Supremacy Clause grounds in the State courts, that that would be impermissible?   What do I -- other than Ex parte Young, what do I cite for that?   I know, but see -- 46     -- as Justice Scalia was the whole driving force of -- of Ex ￼  1 what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my 2 office and I look at the statute books and they are just 3 filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I had all 4 the State statute books, it would be 15 offices or 20 or 5 100. And I know perfectly well that a lot of those 6 statutes in the Federal books have to do with agencies, 7 and they give jobs to agencies, and it's perfectly 8 apparent that the ones who run those statutes in many 9 instances are the agencies, and really judges are out of 10 it. 11 Now, if I adopt your line, it seems to me I 12 am saying that any time that a person has an individual 13 of saying that a State law is contrary to one of those 14 statutes, he can run right into court. And I can see 15 we've done that where he has some kind of right that 16 he's protecting that's threatened in some way or that he 17 wants to assert. I can see that we could do that in the 18 foreign policy case like Burma; I can see that we could 19 do that where Federal voting rights are at stake, which 20 are very important. 21 But a principle that says you can do that 22 any time you want seems to me a little -- it's -- it 23 seems to me the real fear of far-reaching in this extent 24 that it just stops the agency from doing their business 25 at the behest of anyone who would like to assert a State 48 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 law, or States -- it's a mess, in other words.   The Supremacy Clause says that judges in every State shall be bound thereby, but if you want to amend it so that judges in every State and all administrators should be bound thereby, then you have a Supremacy Clause action against every Federal agency. That doesn't make sense.   Number one, it doesn't say that. There's no -- it doesn't say "all circumstances." It doesn't say that.   I'm -- well, no. Justice 56  ￼  1 Scalia's question was related to a Federal agency. The 2 Federal agency does something that's inconsistent with 3 the statute, arguably, and you say there's a Supremacy 4 Clause violation? That's novel.

Was it 3   argued that there was no state action here?  Or is there 4   -- and in your view, is that a very simple question to 5   answer? 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
10-1024 +++$+++     But -- but we --    Courts don't -- courts don't allow recovery for conjectural or speculative 20 21 22 23 24   damages?  That's not the way juries are instructed.    -- routinely tell juries, now you can come in with conjectural or speculative  ￼ 1   common law presume damages from the nature of the 2   violation.  That is what was carved out, the ability to 3   presume it, rather than present evidence and subject it 4 to proof.
10-1042 +++$+++     Have we said in some of our cases, oh, don't worry, this is within the 20   ￼ 1   discretion of the prosecutor, close enough for 2   government work?    Well, I'm not sure.  It seems to me that even under the Respondent's view of the statute, you have to inquire into reasonableness to see if the fee was earned.

10-1121 +++$+++     Let me ask you this --    -- by way of background In collective bargaining negotiations, do the unions consider the -- as one factor the importance of ensuring that the governmental employer has fiscal stability?    Well, isn't that ultimately a political judgment, so that even collective bargaining involves a core political judgment?
10-114 +++$+++    Did we take the case on the assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may disagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption that this was a frivolous cause of action?
10-1150 +++$+++     Why couldn't someone come  ￼ 44 1   up with the idea that at a level which is in the range 2   that's within your patent, if at a certain level for a 3   certain -- a person of a certain age, you administer a 4   new drug, you have a new result?

10-1211 +++$+++  
10-1219 +++$+++  
10-1259 +++$+++     Well, no.  We're assuming that there's no initial trespass, which is a problem in 34  6 7 that? 8 9   cost-free?  Suppose the police department says:  We've 10   got two things; we can put 30 deputies on this route and 11   watch this person, or we can have a device with a 12   warrant.  What difference does it make?    Why does it have to be  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   methods.    You're saying it's -- it's the quantity and -- of the information seized and the time over which it's seized.  And that's the proposition we're testing.  And it seems to me what you're saying is that the police have to use the most inefficient  ￼ 1   is prepared to view as objectively reasonable.  The 2   government --    You think it would be?    You have -- you have a targeted invasion.  It's over a period of time.

And, of course, you ask your 15-year-old, or your 10-year-old, how to turn off 18 19 20 21   Of course, the V-chip is not new.  It's been around for 22   more than a decade, and the -- the broadcasters have 23   tried to encourage uptake.  The government has tried to 24   encourage uptake.  It hasn't taken.    -- is there a functional, a pragmatic, a practical difference between the two?    But isn't the --    -- inevitable consequence, or this precise consequence that you're arguing for on this fleeting expletive portion of this case, that every intervene -- (Laughter.)  34    But, I mean, isn't it inevitable that this will happen?    By "sanctioned," you mean punished as -- as opposed to "blessed" sanctioned?    Well, we -- well, we have to anticipate what the natural results or consequences of our decision will be.    As I understand it, the same rules that we apply to obscenity for printed material, under your view, would apply to television.    Well, I thought that was the whole gravamen of your argument.

10-699 +++$+++    Well, under your -- under your theory -- and this is just following on Justice Ginsburg's question, I think. Under your theory, what foreign relations determinations are for the President alone to make?   Are there any foreign relations determinations that are for the President alone to make under your theory of the case?   In other words, who gets the telegram or something?   But that wasn't a case -­ that wasn't a case in which the Congress had said you may not seize mills. And that's what your case is. So, there's a difference.   It -- it is if you assume that the statute is valid.   If the statute is -- if is invalid, we're in category one.   Or two.
10-704 +++$+++     So -- so, the test is whether or not he is likely to commit another crime? that --    I mean, that's -- I thought the Petitioner said -- I didn't have the time to interrupt -- that under California law, they can search  ￼10 11 12 13   sentence.
10-708 +++$+++     I was going to ask you, along that line, are there antitrust cases that -- that Respondents or the Government could cite in which a party can go into court alleging that the market has been distorted, even though that person has no damage? Anything like that in the antitrust -- what would be their closest case?    Yes.    Right.    There's not automatic disgorgement in those --    Well, that -- that leads me to this -- I thought -- I never thought of title 14     Now, she didn't allege 22 23 24 25   the violation.  It could.

A common?   -- have to keep the person say, for 24 or 48 hours until the medical 28  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   You're telling every county jail in -- in the United States personnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to do search? us that has medical a--a 
10-948 +++$+++ 
11-10189 +++$+++     This is -- this is very amusing in a capital case. Let me ask you this question:  Is there anything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps Page 43 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 44 1   had promulgated at the time of the direct appeal 2   proceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was 3   the 1989 American Bar Association guideline, 11.9.2, 4   which specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this 5   case to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless 6   of any State procedures to the contrary. 7               And, if he had raised a substantial Wiggins 8   claim or if he had even tried his best to raise a 9   Wiggins claim that could be -- could be amplified and 10   further developed on State habeas, we wouldn't be 11   standing here today because it would have been properly 12   exhausted and adjudicated on the merits in State court. 13               So I don't think that the Bar association 14   really has anything one way to say or the other, which 15   is maybe why it filed on behalf of neither party. 16               But to return to Justice Breyer's question, 17   I don't think that what -- what we're talking about is 18   to come up with anything new.  I think what we're 19   talking about in this outside-of-Martinez world is 20   actually very old.  We are just talking about the 21   Carrier rule, the normal rule that applies to cause and 22   prejudice for all defaults in States across the country. 23               And I think that the best way to understand 24   it is to imagine, in the very hypothetical that you 25   offered, where there is just one person who could get ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 45 1   through, that person would have a constitutional claim 2   in the State of -- I'm sorry, the other 900 or however 3   many there were, those people would have constitutional 4   claims in the State of Texas for the deprivation of a 5   meaningful opportunity to press their claims on direct 6 appeal. 7 8 9 And as from the Federal -- and that would serve as cause, if the State courts denied it, that would serve as cause to overcome a default in Federal court and to get an adjudication of that claim. 10 11 12   that Martinez was really an equitable rule.  It was an 13   equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to 14   raise a trial ineffectiveness claim. 15               And if it's true that, although Texas has a 16   technical possibility of doing that outside of 17   collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are 18   told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use 19   that route, that, if they do use that route, the 20   likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using 21   that route, the question is why that -- the formal 22   availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that 23   everybody is told not to use should matter with respect 24   to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?
11-1025 +++$+++ 
11-10362 +++$+++    As a general matter, first
11-1059 +++$+++     Well, let me ask you    It may -- it may be that it's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court, the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to enter judgment.    As a matter of housekeeping, you could --
11-1085 +++$+++     Well, you have the -- you have the burden of justifying class certification --    -- is that not correct?    All right.  Now, suppose there is some real question of whether or not the causal chain hasn't been broken, the causal chain between the misstatement and the movement in price.  Don't you have to prove the integrity of the causal chain?    At the certification 11   when efficiency is contested at the class certification 12   stage, what comes in are proofs of does information end 13   up having an effect?  And economists do event studies that 14   try to show the general level at which information will 15   be absorbed into the market price.  That's where that 16   issue gets contested.  It does not get contested on the 17   question of materiality because materiality looks at the 18   total mix of information that would be relevant to an 19   investor, not --
11-1118 +++$+++ 
11-1160 +++$+++  
11-1175 +++$+++  
11-1221 +++$+++     In other words, they're preempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can be thwarted.    But -- but quite apart from -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your proposal the Congress would actually have accepted a situation where one spouse sues a former spouse.  In other words, you have a -- that's the whole design of this statute.  Would the insurance company -- if you were representing the insurance company, would you tell the insurance company that they were completely safe in paying the benefits to the first spouse even if there's going to be a suit afterwards? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 statute.    Or would the insurance company itself be under some liability?    But I'm just wondering  ￼ 1 making the payment or to put it in escrow or to 2 interplead.    In the -- in the Wissner was a community property State.  Do you the statute we're dealing with here, is  ￼ 1 provision on that point in Wissner, and I -- or the 2 Court so read it. And I take it the same provision 3 applies -- exists in this statute?
11-1231 +++$+++ 
11-1274 +++$+++    In a civil -- in a civil action brought by an injured investor or private party, can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an earlier government determination that there had been a violation and so that that's presumptive showing of liability?   In other words, the SEC makes an investigation, finds a violation; can a private investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of liability?   No, not the allegation. It's an ultimate finding.   But then under your rule. The plaintiff would be deprived of that.
11-1285 +++$+++ 
11-1327 +++$+++ 
11-1347 +++$+++     Well, except he might have assumed that the issue of fees would still be alive if the Eleventh Circuit ruled on the merits.    And he -- he was just trying to have a single appeal.    Well, appellate courts all the time have issues where they apply different standards to multiple issues in the case. 33   ￼    But I am -- I am quite surprised that you would say that prior residence can never bear on present residence.  In custody disputes, this happens all the time.  The child spent 5 years in this country, 4 years in that country; now, for the last 2 years, the child has been in this country -- the previous experience of the child has a tremendous bearing on custody. To say that it's only now, prospective only, after the child has been removed, I just think is wrong, as a matter of custody law.
11-1351 +++$+++     Well, you did -- you did say, in the reply brief, that the point of the Gonzalez Act, it says, "would enable plaintiffs to pursue those claims against the United States."    I know you would have been disappointed if we didn't ask you about this.    And I -- but it -- and Justice Kagan indicated, this wasn't just an aside. 46  ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   interpretation.
11-139 +++$+++     And I --  ￼
11-1425 +++$+++    I thought -- I thought that we often said that you look at whether or not you can get a warrant before you can break in so that the drugs aren't flushed down the toilet and so forth. We make that judgment all the time.   And if that showing is not made, you must get a warrant.   So I think it's quite incorrect to say that we -- we don't look at the time factor. general time. --   We look at it all the    I agree that there is a uniform standard. But -- and I don't know if you ever did finish the answer to Justice Ginsburg, but she -- she had suggested that we have a uniform rule of exigent circumstances. That -- her suggestion complies with your objection.
11-1447 +++$+++     So, in my hypothetical, you would -- would there be a violation in my hypothetical, as you understood it?    Suppose -- suppose the agency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let you develop your land, if you contribute a million dollars to our new football stadium?    Well, let's -- let's put -- let's put it this way:  I take it, it's -- it's a given that the government cannot take an easement on your property.  It cannot use your property for its own purposes.  It cannot park its trucks there.  It cannot cut the grass. Why is it that, if it can't do those, it can still force you, as a condition to using your property to its highest and best use, to pay them money?    Why isn't that an equal burden -- why isn't that an equal use of the property by the government?
11-1450 +++$+++     -- is to aggregate the claims of the individual class members.
11-1518 +++$+++     I -- I assume the other children did not have an interest in the business, but just the trustee and the mother did.  Or is that clear from the record.    Was there a finding of recklessness in the State court?    And the problem is, as friend on the other side points out, that problems with this.  Number one, it's not  ￼ 1 the first enacted statute. Section 14(e) was 2 subsequently enacted. 3 Both statutes prohibited a manipulative type 4 of transaction with regard to securities. Section 14(e) 5 also prohibited a fraudulent act with regard to 6 securities. This Court stated in that case -- while it 7 wasn't central to its holding -- the Court did state 8 that the inclusion of the term "fraudulent" in Section 9 14(e) could not modify the understanding of the term 10 "manipulative." 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 And the same logic applies here.  The subsequent inclusion of the terms "fraudulent" and "embezzlement" and "larceny" cannot modify the known meaning, even if that known meaning has been lost, the meaning of the word "defalcation."
11-1545 +++$+++     As -- as to that specific 18   last term in Astrue, in the unanimous opinion for the 19   Court in Mayo the term before, was is the authority -- 20   is -- is the agency vested with authority, generally, to 21   make rules with the force of law.    But the -- the agencies have no historic responsibility or tradition, quite unlike Article III courts, of safeguarding the Federal    Unelected Federal (Laughter.)  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 de novo review.
11-159 +++$+++ 
11-161 +++$+++    Can you tell me -- I'm curious to know, if other States have provisions like the Barrett Law and they're concerned about this, can they provide in the initial documents a -- a promise that there will be no forgiveness, so that there would be a contract clause sort of argument against what happened here? In other words -- and if we could explore that for just a minute, I'm going to ask what it is that you thought constituted a promise in this case.   And maybe not a promise in the contract sense.   Give you a warning?
11-166 +++$+++  
11-182 +++$+++     Suppose -- suppose -- well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two hypothetical instances. First, the Federal government has said, we simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce our immigration laws the way we wish.  We wish we could do so, but we don't have the money or the resources. That's the first -- just hypothetical.    Also -- also hypothetical is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, 61  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 residents leaving the state because of flood of immigrants.  Let's just assume those two things. Does that give the state of Arizona any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state wouldn't have?    And can they go to their legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem?
11-184 +++$+++    I've probably led a charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until this matter came before us. And I was -- I suppose you have to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say "cases," "cases of discrimination," which is what this is. We don't usually think of cases that we call a discrimination case based on whether or not it contains other issues. It's a case.   I mean, I think that helps you. 
11-192 +++$+++  
11-199 +++$+++     Suppose -- suppose the judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on this evidence that that's all they would have looked at, but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible evidence, they would still have found guilt. an example. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   going to be -- right there.  You know?  A jury -- a 20   juror could say:  Let's go home, we have a confession. 21   It's out of his own mouth.  There's very little else to 22   debate. 23               But when the evidence is beyond that 24   confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would 25   have gotten to a different result, and you could say  Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --    -- a proper application of the -- of the framework?
11-204 +++$+++     Would it be lawful to make it -- put it in writing?    Would it be lawful to put it in writing?    That sounds to me it's not a commitment, unless the doctor says:  Well, I'll look at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your material, I'll think about it. Is that -- is that a --
11-210 +++$+++    Well, it's a matter -­ it's a matter of common sense that it, it seems to me -­ that it demeans the medal. Let me ask you this    Well, I'm not so sure. You know, the Tinker case with the arm band; it's purely expressive speech, it seems to me.  I think if you prevail here that the wearing prohibition must also be in serious doubt. 32   ￼    That's just the basic definition of fraud in the criminal law. 
11-262 +++$+++     You might apply the same immunity for selective enforcement based on race?    Yes.
11-345 +++$+++     So what you're saying is that what counts is race above all?    Well, that's the necessary -- that's the necessary response to Justice Alito's question.    You want underprivileged of a certain race and privileged of a certain race.  So that's race.    But the -- but the reason you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of that race who are privileged can be representative, and that's race.  I just --    If I could, before we get to that.    Suppose we -- that you, in your experience identify a numerical category a numerical standard, a numerical designation for critical mass:  It's X percent.  During the course of the admissions process, can the admissions officers check to see how close they are coming to this numerical --    You -- you cannot do that?    But isn't that what happened in Grutter; it allowed that.    So are you saying that Grutter is incorrect?    I'm -- I'm asking whether 53   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   right? 9  or not you could do that.  And if --
11-393 +++$+++     But there's no Article III jurisdictional problem in Justice Alito's hypothetical, that this is a remedial exercise of the Court's power to explain the consequences of its judgment in this case.    I just don't accept the 36  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    But I still don't understand where you are with the answer to Justice Alito's question. Assume that there is a -- a substantial probability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals 7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate is stricken.  Assume there is a significant possibility of that.  Is it within the proper exercise of this 43   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Court's function to impose that kind of risk?  Can we say that the Congress would have intended that there be that kind of risk?    But isn't that -- isn't that the point, then, why we should just assume that it is not severable?    If we -- if we lack the competence to even assess whether there is a risk, then isn't this an awesome exercise of judicial power?    To say we're doing something and we're not telling you what the consequences might be?    I just don't understand your position.
11-460 +++$+++     But you still have to show that there is a contributor.  And I've been through these sections, and it seems to me that a reasonable interpretation of this section is that there is a violation if a particular permittee violates. And what I'm taking away from your argument is that, once there is a violation, all the permittees are liable, and that just can't be.    So is your theory that, if the district is permitted to -- on a scale of 1 to 10, to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable for the increase, even though other dischargees might have made this?    I don't get that from what you have read.  I've looked at --   -- the text you've read and it looks to me like it's permittee by permittee.    So if each permittee is allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8; then both permittees are liable?    No, no, we now know the facts because it's the hypothetical.
11-465 +++$+++     Of course, again this is fact-specific to the case.  It doesn't address the rule that we want to address and was the reason for us taking the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment. It seems to me that the Federal constitutional claim was intertwined with and -- and controlling of the procedural matters that the court discussed.  I just don't see the case is here even on your theory.
11-551 +++$+++    All within the -- all 5  1 that. The allegation is, I think, at page 9 to 10 of 2 Respondents' brief. Those allegations are, as a factual 3 matter, false. For example, they've given a couple of 4 examples where 0 percent contract support costs were 5 paid. One of those examples is a contract where it had 6 been entered into in that particular year. New 7 contracts are paid under a different appropriation. 8 Another example is they give a case of a tribe that was 9 paid 352 percent of its contract support costs. 10 And let me explain, I think it's 11 important to understand how -- ￼described as arbitrary one that was applicable to the years in 16 was not the 17 question. 18 19 time of the 20 1994 to about 2006, the Secretary followed a uniform pro 21 rata distribution methodology according to the needs of   But -- but I thought that was what Judge Dyk said --   -- was the critical -- the difference between this and even the Cherokee case.   And so my question is -- is the same as Justice Ginsburg's. Isn't a principal part of your argument that this contract said not to exceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but let's say $95 million? Your Honor.    When the Congressional Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out whether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do they look at "not to exceed," and do they take that amount seriously? Or --   But the -- but the 21 ￼question earlier, it is absolutely clear  1 position of 2 difference. 3 4 5 at all. 6 7 8 the Respondents is that it makes no    So Congress is saying nothing
11-556 +++$+++ 
11-564 +++$+++     Again, I don't think the cases go that far because those were cases in which the contraband -- Jacobsen -- was in plain view.  Everybody knows that it falls out of the package.  At that point, you don't have any -- What you're saying is, oh, well, if there is contraband in the house, then you have no legitimate expectation of privacy.  That, for me, does not work.    That's fine.  We can talk about reasonable suspicion.  That's all okay. 25   ￼    That's your first reason 31 1   seconds; he finds the strongest source of the odor and 2   he sits down at that place.    It does hinge on what is a reasonable expectation of privacy.    And that's what we're trying to find out.
11-597 +++$+++     And the only difference in that formulation and this case is that it was for seven years and not permanent?  Is that your --    Well, the hypothetical is, 42   ￼ 1   suppose it doesn't.  Suppose that there's some land 2   that's up -- that's fairly far upstream from the main 3   reservoir, but it's flooded once every other year.
11-626 +++$+++     I mean, I would be willing  ￼ 1   to stipulate they are better at this than we are, but 2   let's -- let's assume.
11-697 +++$+++     We need to know about those hypotheticals in order to decide this case.    You're aware of the fact that if we write an opinion with the -- with the rule that you propose, that we should, as a matter of common 30  ￼ 1   sense, ask about the consequences of that rule.  And 2   that's what we are asking.
11-702 +++$+++ 
11-713 +++$+++     Right. 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   point? 22 23 24 25    As a starting point?    And then we could -- then there would be no problem with using Texas as a benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting  ￼ 1   what this Court typically has said the district court 2   should do is to start with a plan that's already in 3   effect and then modify it according to neutral 4   districting principles to remove the malapportionment 5   issue.  And that's --    Isn't it odd that this is a section 2 suit, and yet section 5 seems to be driving 37  ￼ 1   that -- driving it.  That's the problem with this 2   litigation, it seems to me.    Well, it's not giving effect to the uncleared plan.  It's giving effect to a legislative judgment as to what is workable for all the factors and criteria that Justice Alito referred to, county lines, et cetera. 10 11 12 13 14 15   questions.    But could it -- could it look at the district and say, well, it respects county lines; it follows a river; it's got urban and rural. Could it look at it for that reason?    And rely on the legislative judgment as making a sound judgment that the river runs through here, and the county line is there and so forth?  That's -- that's what seems to me the difficulty with saying, oh, you can't look at the plan.    A minority coalition    All right.  So, you would defend the plan on the ground that this is a sound    Is there anything in the opinion from the three-judge court in the District of Columbia that indicates that there are some likely potential violations that are section 2 violations as well as section 5 violations?    And -- and I can amend that to -- and in the submission of the parties?    Yes.
11-770 +++$+++     Justice Kagan had the hypothetical of the person leaving to go to work, the 9:00 to 5:00 person.  Suppose the warrant's going to be 49   ￼10   proposing. 11 that case --    I don't know -- I don't know why not, under the rule that's proposed.
11-796 +++$+++ 
11-798 +++$+++  
11-817 +++$+++     Excuse me.  Did you say it can or it can't?
11-820 +++$+++     Well, as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the principal sources the Court cited in Padilla was common sense.    Does common sense change?    I mean, Tom Paine wrote about it, so, you know, since its original.    But the second part of my question that you were about to answer was whether or not it's dictated by precedent, and in this case, it was not dictated by precedent because it applied to collateral consequences; or, what's the because?
11-864 +++$+++    One of my -- one of my questions in the case is this 25  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 And if the judge admits the evidence and if it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of reliability, then he can exclude it. I don't -- I don't see why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm going to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether this is reliable. This is just a magic words approach, it seems to me.   Well, I -- I take it there is no argument over whether or not the expert is qualified.   The question is just whether his -- his theory makes any sense. 26  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   And the -- and the Petitioner says it doesn't.   Well, Mr. Barnett, I can think of -- my initial reaction -- it has been an awful long time since I have been in the courtroom -- is -- is that that's whether or not this man is -- is qualified to give an opinion.   Step one. The next thing is does this opinion make any sense?   And that includes some 43  1 cases where there's a jury? Is that --   Well, of course, there matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits stage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702, the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation. I can see a judge saying, well, now, this theory that you're using, this theory works, I think it's accepted 48 ￼Well -- and also, it's because   1 in academia. Then he hears all the testimony, and he 2 says, It just doesn't work here.
11-889 +++$+++ 
11-982 +++$+++     Could we say there is just a presumption, that, if you're in the business, that you probably are interested in future design, period?    Wouldn't establish a --    So then -- so then the covenant not to sue gives Nike an advantage that no other manufacturer has.     Do you mean any manufacturer without -- without any litigation can ask Already, well, tell us your plans, what shoes are you thinking about?    But why should Already have to do that to anybody?    So Nike has an advantage over Already that no other manufacturers had.  It can demand what its future plans are.    Let me just ask one 27   ￼ 1   question on that, and it's a little bit off of what 2   we've been talking about.  You say, in your brief, well, 3   now, don't worry, what you can do is you can go to the 4   trademark -- the PTO board, and they'll -- they'll 5   adjudicate this mark.  And so -- you know, you can 6   really go out of the courts and go to the 7   administrators. 8               Suppose Already goes to the administrative 9   agency and loses.  Can it have judicial review?  And is 10   there -- is standing easier to show, once there has been 11   an adverse action in the administrative office?  Or are 12   we right back where we started?  So once you go to the 13   agency and you try to appeal, the Court says, well, this 14   is an Article III court, we need a case of controversy, 15   and you're right back where we are now?    I'm talking about going to 20   that lost, if it isn't injured in fact by the TTAB's 21   decision itself, that it would not have the necessary 22   Article III injury to seek judicial review.  That 23   hasn't -- to our knowledge, that has not occurred, but 24   it is possible that that could happen because 15 U.S.C. 25   1064 makes the TTAB standing requirements broader than 29    But you have two categories.  You have current and previous, as to which the covenant runs to everything.  Then you have what you say is future, and that has to be a colorable imitation.    So it -- so it -- so it does cover some future designs.  And they're correct about that, and you're incorrect.    They are on the top ten list of infringers. (Laughter.) 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   position. 17               I did, however -- when they made this 18   argument in the reply brief -- tried to figure out if 19   that is true.  Is it actually the case that a person who 20   is sued once has a legitimate worry that they will    You -- you referred, just in a fleeting way, to the fact that they can go to the PTO and to the board?    What about my question, and I wasn't -- it was probably my fault --    -- I didn't quite understand the government's petition.  Is the standing burden any less after there is a -- an administrative adjudication and you go to court for judicial review?
12-123 +++$+++     I -- I thought that what we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional, ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 43 1   the claim, so they didn't analyze it in that way. 2               They understood the claim to be that the 3   taking of producers' raisins is a taking, and we 4   lawfully resisted it because it was an unconstitutional 5   taking.  The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that 6 7 8 9 because there was nothing unconstitutional about it because it was not without just compensation. The Tucker Act is the just compensation. This Court has held -- 10 11 12   fact that raisin prices go up.  So the poor children 13   with their noses pressed to the glass because they can't 14   pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are 15   paying the compensation.  And certainly not the 16   taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other 17   producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I 18   don't know.  But I can't believe that Congress wanted    Suppose they do have ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼6 7 8 9    -- that this is an unconstitutional taking? Page 53    Let's assume they have    No, no.  In the administrative proceeding where they are charged with -- where a penalty is being assessed against them.
12-126 +++$+++    But are -- are you saying that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition? Because this isn't a successive petition.   Well, you're saying that Congress knows how to write --   -- an exception if -- if they want it. But this (b) does apply to successive petitions and this is really before that.   Are bribed jurors not a of justice?   A juror who's bribed, is no miscarriage of justice there?
12-133 +++$+++    Well, do we have a factual record? Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade association prepare a report, and we could do one 54  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 arbitration and then see if it applies to others. Suppose I think that. Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question? And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support my assumptions.
12-135 +++$+++    But -- but how could -- how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says, as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case. I decide that there is a class action, all these people are in the class.
12-142 +++$+++ 
12-144 +++$+++     That's really -- that's a 42  ￼ 1 California, which has been more generous, more open to 2 protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the 3 Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being 4 penalized for not going far enough. 5 That's a very odd rationale on which to 6 sustain this opinion.    So -- so that's not    And you might address why you think we should take and decide this case.
12-167 +++$+++     I -- I don't want to interrupt your opening because I think -- I just didn't hear your first -- "by foregoing"?    By foregoing.
12-207 +++$+++ 
12-236 +++$+++     Or there can be equitable tolling in some cases.    You were going to address the shadow trial?    Procedural grounds because the affidavits aren't sufficient or --    Are there regulations or rules establishing hourly rates?
12-246 +++$+++     Because he said, "Well"?    Is -- I don't want -- are you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required, you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment?    I mean -- that's -- that's how I understood that.    I know you're not arguing that, but that's why I'm --    Well, but it can be invoked, and that might make a big difference.  In your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right.    And so if there's -- if questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply.   You're -- you're giving us 13 Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area. 14 That -- that's what you're arguing. You want a gray 15 area opinion to be written?    Well, but, in Berghuis, we found no implication.    So -- so Justice Kagan's question stands.    Well, a few, as I recall.
12-307 +++$+++ 
12-357 +++$+++     Just to add to Justice Breyer's question, it's -- suppose the secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with typing the letter "I do not recommend" and they bribe 29   ￼ 1 her and she says "I recommend." She has an interest in 2 her integrity to give an honest transcription. Under 3 your view, and this is what Justice Breyer is getting 4 at, I think, that -- that secretary has property that 5 you are taking. That's very far-reaching.
12-398 +++$+++     Under our -- our law, is a patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but 9  ￼ 1 invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the 2 part? 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    But if you haven't challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect to the tagging?  I don't quite understand.  Because the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would fail under your argument.    But I -- I just don't think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't worry about investment, it'll come.  I -- I just don't think we can do that.  It may be that the law allows you 15     Well, I'm not sure the Court can decide the case on -- on that basis.  I'm sure that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief that this investment is necessary and that -- and that makes sense.  To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer. As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are process patents that they can have, that this is  ￼ 1 to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature 2 and there's nothing new here, but that's quite 3 different.    So it seemed to me your -- was not quite accurate when you said, well, used in the body to detect breast cancer. the isolate without some additions.    And -- and that avoids giving special industries special subsidies, which is very important it seems to me. Let me ask you this, and it's consistent with my -- my preface.  If we were to accept the government's position that the DNA is not patentable but the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient protection for innovation and research?  And if not, why 10 11 not?
12-399 +++$+++     In -- in your view, at what point, at what date did the Indian father lose the right to ask for custody?  Because he changed his mind in -- in January, there was about a 5-day period there.    The adoption proceedings had not concluded.    And at this point he said, in effect, I've changed my mind.    So the State law determines when his rights under the Federal Act end?    And do you -- you want us to write the case as if this is just a standard best interest determination and -- and this federal statute is irrelevant?  I don't understand your argument.    But is -- is that true  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    But -- but -- did you -- at your -- when you began, do you use "paternity" in the biological sense?    As -- as you -- as you interpret the statute, "paternity is the biological sense," not -- not an --    -- not an existing parental relationship.
12-416 +++$+++     Because I had thought, as Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the 180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors, to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et cetera, and that that's a big advantage.    And now, you're -- now, you're indicating that it isn't.    Well, but so then the question still holds.  If you -- if you key your payment to what the brand company will make, it's just a much higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable 10 11 12 13   restraint.    I think it's correct that to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers. And you then need marketers because the cost of these drugs can be hundreds of millions.  Is there anything in the record that shows the development cost of this drug?    It can be a billion.    Anything in this case?    Anything in the record?
12-418 +++$+++  
12-484 +++$+++     Do -- do you agree with the government's position that the limited affirmative defense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say, limited damages when there's multiple or mixed motives, would also apply to retaliation cases?
12-547 +++$+++     If you -- if you prevail here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme courts.  State supreme courts, much like us, they wait until courts of appeals have issued their opinions. 39   ￼ 1 They wait to see how the practical application of those 2 works, insofar as of the fairness of the trial. They 3 wait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then 4 they -- and then they take the case. 5 If you prevail, State supreme courts 6 are -- are going to say -- you know, if we don't take 7 this case, even though it's -- does not present the 8 issue as clearly as some late case might, we don't rush 9 in, then we're going to be foreclosed. I think you're 10 proposing a dynamic which makes the Federal courts 11 intrude on the way in which State courts choose to 12 develop their law.
