But -- but 3 here you're creating a situation where the agency has to 4 contract and yet has no control over having enough money 5 to -- to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me 6   a -- a strange way to run a railroad.    I mean, you can't get blood out 17 18   of a turnip.  I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Right.    Well, that's all very good,    -- then the last paragraph 17  1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision 2   of this subchapter.  So this --   Wait.   21 of --    -- you -- you paint it as though the -- you know, who cares about the bureaucrats. 21  1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼ 1   The -- the Government just wasn't interested in the 2   bureaucrats.  That may well be, but there -- there are 3   bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.   Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to a private contractor. I mean, what -- what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these -- these tribes more governmental power, more self- determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.   That's -- that's what makes it different from private contracts --   -- even -- even with 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   Halliburton. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody. MR. MILLER considered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be 27  1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that was the language of the -- of the Senate report. They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   percent.  So my question to you is the same.  I asked,   I don't see that. Where?   Not less. Right?   You -- you can't limit it to inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision --   -- if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.   It's strange to talk of 12 13 14 15   new program.  I mean, for a new program, there isn't any 16   funding.  How can you reduce the funding for a new reducing -- is -- is not required to reduce funding for a 17   program? 18 19 20   That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs. 21 22 23 24 baseline.

You -- you would have 18 to think twice before you fire me because I would have a 19 retaliation claim.    That could be because --    -- the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach.  Of course, they're going to rehire.

Well, he was told what -- what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.    Right.    These are all disparate impact Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's -- far-reaching.    Whenever a State has -- has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor?  That -- that seems to be an extraordinary proposition.  The State isn't picking on the poor.  It's just saying that -- that the -- 9 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this -- in this one instance of guilty pleas.  And -- and you say that -- that is intentional discrimination against the poor?    So any cutback on benefits that is given -- on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.    Just this one because that's your case.   So you're -- you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as -- as directed against the poor.   Or not?   But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.    But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're -- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal.  Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal.  If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.    That's an equal protection    But you've -- you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim. If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.    It's their argument anyway. Let them --    Oh, but -- but that happens all the time.  I mean, the waiver -- waiver of appeal in -- in guilty -- in guilty pleas.  That's -- that's not permissible either?    Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.    That's a strange terminology. It doesn't provide a right to appeal.  It -- it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal.  A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.    So you have an absolute right to ask for an MR. appeal.    But that's not a right to appeal.  It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.    Okay.    Well, it's done more than change the method.  It's changed the entitlement.  The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal. It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.    Didn't -- didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case -- was that the name of it?    Federal courts do?    They assume that all factual arguments have been decided against the -- the 9 District of Michigan all saying that when an order is 10 denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the 11 AEDPA standard of review applies. 12 And so the State obtains tremendous benefits 13 from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas 14 corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent 15 were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from 16 beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so 17 the State very happily argues for all of those purposes 18 that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come 19 before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a 20 decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite 21 what it says because they are hoping that this Court will 22 conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. 23 In fact, the State --    I -- I -- you -- you have the 17 appeal. What's the effect of that?

03-1160 +++$+++     Maybe the EEOC regulation was not so much an interpretation of the statute as an interpretation of Griggs.    I mean, maybe this provision represents the judgment of the agency that Griggs applies to this other statute, and -- and I'm not sure that we owe Chevron deference to that determination.    Yes, well.   It would be good if you had a 18 comma after employees. I -- I might go along with you if 19 there was a comma after -- to limit, segregate, or 20 classify his employees, comma, in any way which would 21 deprive or tend to deprive any individual of opportunities 22 or otherwise affect his status as an employee, comma, 23 because of such individual's age -- go way back to before 24 the comma. I can see that, but without the comma, that's 25 -- that's an awful travel back to limit, segregate, or 45  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 classify.    Right.    Exactly.   It is.    Indeed, and I guess what supports that reading is that intent -- intent to discriminate in hiring -- the intentional discrimination because of age in hiring is covered by (2) rather than (1) isn't it?    You think -- I mean, if -- if you have a rule -- if you have a rule that you won't hire any employee -- I mean, we -- we were talking earlier about the -- the reason -- (2) reads employees in the plural, and (1) reads refuse to hire or discharge any individual.  So if you have any intentional discrimination that is against a class, it comes under (2) rather than (1).    Is that wrong?  Well, I thought -- I thought that's what -- what counsel for the petitioner was telling us.
03-1230 +++$+++     Well, it seems to me you should have introduced some evidence on that point.  I mean, it -- it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument that purely intrastate carriers do significantly more intrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to do some interstate business.  Now, does that strike you as self-evident?  It does not need any --    -- demonstration?    No, I don't think he -- I didn't --    I don't understand your answer. If you were finished, I don't understand.    But that -- that assumes it's an SSRS charge, and the State denies that it -- it has anything to do with SSRS.  Don't you have to establish that it's part of the SSRS program?    You're trying to make the Federal statute work sensibly, but --    -- I hate to tell you, but not all statutes work sensibly.    It sure does make sense to me, though.  Surely it's the case that a company that does nothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company which does interstate business but part of its business is intrastate Michigan business.  I -- I just -- it seems to 24 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 me obvious that --    You -- you defend that that -- that it doesn't violate the Commerce long as it's a fee not a tax?    Whenever it's a fee, not a tax, you immediately go to Pike Church.    I know.  I know that's what they said.    I found it very strange.    Well, I suppose that's the same thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is there.  That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't it?  And it has to be apportioned among the States.  And you don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the year.    Right, right.  But I'm saying the same problem arises when you do any apportioning.    It's like a 3-day fishing  me -- I wanted to ask this vehicle-specific.  Suppose Michigan-plated, so I have Is that right?  Let me -- let question to see whether it's I have nine trucks.  They're to pay $100 for each of the nine.    Now, suppose I -- suppose I only pay the fee for eight of them.  What happens?    No.  I've paid for eight, but I haven't paid for the ninth.  As I read the Michigan law, it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over the highways of this State while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid.  Now, if -- if I can't operate the other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that 41 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.    I mean -- I mean the opposite. It's -- it's not vehicle-specific.    I've paid for the eight, and I can't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.    It seems to me how it reads. Am I reading the law wrong?  It says, shall not operate any motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid.    At all.  So it's not really vehicle-specific.   So it's carrier-based. 42 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-

So, 16 you know, let's forget about Skidmore.   -- what do you do about the agency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of the case, and which says that the mere fact that donning and doffing may require compensation does not necessarily mean that travel between the clothes changing place and the actual place of performance would be excluded?

Isn't that the answer?    They can, but do -- do you know that there's -- there's one out there?  I don't know --    You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (Laughter.)    Was that -- was that an IRA that she had?  It was an IRA?    Plus 10 percent you say.    So it's just -- just like an IRA.    Let me just get -- get straight what -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have in front of us here.

Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.    None of them is like that.    These -- these other plans that to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any what happens if you withdraw for any reason?    What is the sanction against -- ￼1 Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds 2 in the -- she could no longer reach the corpus of the 3 account. The -- the lump sum of money was there for her 4 retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the 5 money is not protected at any time. There's no 6 prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds 7 from the account other than the payment of the penalty. 8 But whether an account or plan qualifies under 9 the statute, it -- it -- you look at the language of the 10 plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument 11 renders the terms of the statute superfluous because, 12 first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans, 13 and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the 14 money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is 15 not based upon any factor other than the -- the account 16 holder wanting to withdraw the funds.

Do you mean objectively, or do you mean on 2   the basis of the facts known to the arresting officer?  I 3   mean, let's -- let's assume an officer stops a car for a 4   broken taillight, and it turns out the car doesn't have a 5   broken taillight.  All right?  So that basis is wrong. 6 However, the car also has an expired inspection sticker, 7 which the officer didn't know about. Was there a probable 8   cause for arrest, as you're using the term here?    Oh, so it has to be known.    So in my example, the arrest 14 15   arrest. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 would be invalid because at the time of the arrest, he didn't know about the sticker.

But -- but that's not the ground on which the Ninth Circuit decided it.  The Ninth Circuit never had to reach the question of whether there was probable cause on these other grounds -­   -- because it found, even if there was these other grounds, they're not closely related to the illegal taping. So I suppose you're telling us that if we find that we do not like the closely related rule, that it's not part of -- of United States constitutional law, what we should do is remand to the Ninth Circuit so that they could determine whether there was probable cause on the other grounds.    That's not my reason.  I don't ￼ 1   pretty closely because they grew out of the same central 2   group of facts?    Exactly, exactly.

We didn't have smugglers before 31 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    So you have two statutes.  One of them seems to be quite ambiguous.  The other one is categorical, you get restitution in all cases.  Now, how do I wiggle out of it?    Obviously, I wiggle out of it with the ambiguous statute.    But you haven't told me -- you haven't told me how you get out of the restitution statute.

I think if there was a problem that -- that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil or not wearing a veil or something else.  If -- if it's either of those two problems that they meant to leave overlooked, I would say it's the latter.

You -- you just haven't reached that point.  Right?    I don't want to set you two to fighting with each other.    What we're talking about here is -- is at -- at most, whether this is a water of the United States.  The condition for requiring permits is that it -- it be a water of the United States. Isn't that right?    And it either is or it isn't, not -- not that it will be.  It either is or it isn't.  If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it isn't, you don't need a permit.    So it -- it becomes waters of the United States because there are puddles on it, and you assert because those puddles have some hydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water of the United States, those puddles have some hydrological connections with the navigable waters.    And -- and the -- the statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material, which is what is going on here, into the navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites. I'm sorry.

That's your answer to 10 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 Justice Souter.    Isn't that approaching -- Isn't that in effect changing the test from public use to efficient public use?  I mean, what's -- you know, if I condemn land for a public utility and the public utility turns out to be very inefficient, has the condemnation been invalid?    Do you want us to sit here and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation one by one?    No.  I just want to take property from people who are paying less taxes and give it to people who are paying more taxes.  That would be a public use, wouldn't it?    Let me qualify it.  You can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes?    I'll accept that.  You can take from A and give to B if B pays significantly more taxes.    You accept that as a proposition?    Is that a factual finding?  You consider that a factual finding?    You didn't misspeak.  But you know, in any case --    What this lady wants is not more money.  No amount of money is going to satisfy her.  She is living in this house, you know, her whole life and she does not want to move.  She said I'll move if it's being taken for a public use, but by God, you're just giving it to some other private individual because that individual is going to pay more taxes.  I -- it seems to me that's, that's an objection in principle, and an objection in principle that the public use requirement of the Constitution seems to be addressed to. 51 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 public use 3 which they 4 Holmes' decisions from 1905 and 1906.    Mr. Horton, I'm not proposing that the state has to use the property itself.  I'm simply proposing that its use not be a private use which has incidental benefits to the state.  That is not enough to justify use of the condemnation power.    You can give it to a private entity, you can give it to a railroad, to some public utility.  But the use that it's put to by that railroad and public utility is a public use. That's why it's a public utility. It's quite different to say you can give it to a private individual simply because that 53 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 private individual is going to hire more people and 2 pay more taxes.

04-1131 +++$+++     Mr. Stewart, you know, you have here a statute in which Congress, with malice aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review of any major personnel actions and does not provide for judicial review of what it had regarded as insignificant personnel actions.  I can understand the position, although I don’t agree with it, that the constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant constitutional claims.  But when Congress has gone to 33 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the trouble of providing for judicial review of any claims that are significant and just saying any other insignificant action, even though a constitutional violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact it does not harm you that much, we’re not going to allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with that?  It seems to me that’s what Congress has said and -- and you’re creating a scheme that simply contradicts what Congress plainly said.   Did any of them involve a 34 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- situation in which Congress took the pain to separate significant actions from insignificant actions?    I mean, some of them involve deportation and, you know, major -- major actions. This is a case where Congress has -- has carefully tried to say these are major actions for which you should be able to get into the courts.  And these other things -- you -- you have these administrative remedies, but that’s the end of it.    What’s the second statute? There’s no second statute here.  There -- there is your concession of the fact that there has to be judicial review.  That’s what’s driving all of this.  And -- and generally speaking, when we find something to be unconstitutional, we don’t rewrite a statute so that it will be constitutional.  We just say, you know, there 46 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 has to be judicial review.    Mr. Stewart, if -- if we’re going to tweak the statute, isn’t the least possible tweak -- and perhaps not a tweak at all -- simply to consider this a personnel action?    If -- if a decision to order psychiatric testing can be one, why can’t a decision to require drug testing be one?    I’m not sure it’s a tweak at all.  It -- it just depends on -- on what you consider to be working conditions.  And in -- in many contexts, we’ve given the broadest possible interpretation to working conditions.    Well, I --

And this is liability for -- for --
04-1144 +++$+++  
04-1152 +++$+++     No, but it seems me you've got us off galloping in the wrong direction.  The statute doesn't require simply giving the same access that you give to other employers.  It requires much more than that.  It requires that they -- it prohibits, or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military department from gaining access to campuses for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer. So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than simply you give the same access as all other employers. If you allow any other employer, you have to give it to the military in the same manner.    You're not going to be an Army recruiter, are you? [Laughter.]    They're worried about having students driven off.  And if you have jeering and picketing, do you really think that that fulfills the purposes of this amendment? 26  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

And -- and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect equipoise, who loses?    No.  The State loses.  It's the State that has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they are --    How do you expect the lower State court to come out on that?    That's a little different from an adequate and independent State ground argument. You're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.

04-1203 +++$+++     Do those violations that you allude to -- is there an extensive record of violations 15  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 by the State of Georgia?    Well, you're --    But the money --    -- is not coming from the Nation, it's coming from the State of Georgia.  Was the State of Georgia guilty of constitutional violations?    No, no, my --    -- I mean a record -- a record that would have justified applying, against the State of Georgia, prophylactic measures.   Even against people who 16  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 played no part in that nationwide record.    Was that before or after the enactment MR. Your Honor. But of this statute?    Constitutional violations. Not just prophylaxis --    -- but actual violations by the prisons under 1983 --    -- that don't relate to the handicapped and, thus, are this legislation?  You can't get damages constitutional happen to not covered by there.    Mr. Schaerr, who's going to be representing some States as amici, will presumably 35  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 have better information on that subject.    Against the State?    We're talking about damages against the State.    Under --    -- 1983 --    -- absolutely.    Even if they're bad, why ￼1 States to liability. So, I don't think it's enough 2 just to say, "Maybe there -- maybe there is an Eighth 3 Amendment claim here that's legitimate, and maybe, 4 therefore, in this case, the State's sovereign immunity 5 can be abrogated." It has to be done pursuant to a 6 legitimate exercise of Congress's power. 7 Reason number two, Justice Kennedy, is that, 8 as in Boerne and Garrett, even where constitutional 9 issues are implicated, Title II effectively imposes 10 heightened scrutiny on many decisions that are subject 11 to rational-basis review under the Constitution -- for 12 example, access to the law library, religious services, 13 associational rights, those sorts of things. And that, 14 I think, is the key distinction between this case and 15 Lane and Hibbs. And so, as the Court put it in 16 Garrett, even with the undue-burden exception, the 17 statute makes unlawful a range of alternative responses 18 that would be reasonable under the Constitution, but 19 would fall short of imposing an undue burden on the 20 employer. 21 22 prohibits 23 impact on 24 wouldn't be enough to establish a constitutional 25 violation if the disabled were a suspect class. And, 57  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 Number three, as in Garrett, Title II standards and criteria that have a disparate the disabled, even though that obviously ￼1 again, the Court need only look at the Justice 2 Department's regulations to see how they impose a 3 disparate-impact requirement. 4 And, fourth, again, as in Kimel and Garrett, 5 Title II reverses the burden of proof. As the Court 6 held in Garrett, under the Constitution, 7 classifications based on disability are prima facie --

I --    -- they ignore it if they -- if they think that we didn't know what we were doing.    -- because our judgment was "reverse."    That's up to the judge.    So, I mean, the principle that 22 23 you interpret a verdict in the manner most favorable to 24 its conclusion has no application here at all.    "Plan to do anything in violation of this section," which is not just obstructing commerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.

You're saying we -- you can use it to aggravate the punishment for some other offense, but this does -- this does something quite beyond that.  It says it is a separate offense.    I see.

If you want to read it the way you’re reading it, you say a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce. You say that has to be a -- a contract that is a valid contract.

Would it -- would it be 3 adequate notice in the -- in the ordinary case to send 4 notice by 5 6 like this 7 mail would not be sufficient to comply with due 8 process, and the reason why is this. A reasonable 9 person who actually desires to give notice will use regular mail?    Yes, but that, you have to use registered mail?    I didn't think we did.  And 16 that says 17 18 19 it would seem to me that especially when you have the 20 taxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it 21 would be a denial of due process to send notice by 22 regular mail to that address. And if -- if that 23 satisfies due process, the State would never have known 24 that it did not reach the individual.    Would this case come out differently?  You know, your client had an obligation to keep the State informed of -- of his -- his address so that they could send the tax bills to him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply 18 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer 2 does not keep the State advised of his current address, 3 any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will 4 suffice for all purposes.

And that is, it assures that it doesn't get lost.  I think they track it closer.  They can tell you where the letter is.  I think each post office has to record that they've received it and so forth.    Whereas if you just sent it regular mail, it may have been lost.    This -- this assures that it reaches the destination.    Your -- your friend said that the $80,000 comes from the fact that it -- at the -- at the auction, it -- the opening bid is one-quarter of the fair market value.  He said something like that.

I don't think if -- you know, if you see 7 a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the 8 rapids of the Colorado "discharge" into the Colorado. 9 You're usually talking about a different body of water. 10 You could say the Green River discharges into the 11 Colorado. Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you 12 know, "The waterfall on this river discharges into the 13 river." It's part of the river. But if it were a 14 waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you 15 would then say that, you know, "the waterfall 16 discharges into the Colorado," or whatever river it 17 enters at that point. It seems to me very strange to 18 talk about a river discharging into itself.    But the --    -- the issue is not whether there is a discharge, as I see it. The issue is 36 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 whether there's a "discharge into the river." And one 2 does not usually speak of the "river discharging into 3 itself." That -- it's the "into" that's the crucial 4 part. How do you distinguish this case from 5 Miccosukee, if I'm saying it right? -- yes, Miccosukee 6 -- 7 8 9 pumping of 10 and it was 11 discharge? 12 13 that was a 14    -- where we had, you know, a water from one polluted body into another, held -- we held that that was not a    That's right.

Is -- is that part of the background of this?    Okay.    I thought it was part of your complaint that -- that the business here was going after your client in particular.    And other competitors might have been hurt, but -- but the whole purpose of it was 37 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- to get your client.  That is to say, your client was in some special way a target.  Wasn't that part of your complaint?    Are you abandoning it?    I mean, if -- if you're abandoning it --    -- with -- with all --    -- you know, all the competitors are going to be covered.  But if you're not abandoning it, then -- then -- you know, then maybe we can talk further.    Right.    Or, in -- in other words, your -- your targeted argument doesn't really make sense unless there is a family vendetta.  I mean, I -- I want to make money.  I don't care --    -- which of my competitors I'm -- I'm hurting unless I have some special reason to get one -- to get one -- one.  Now, I thought that was 39 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- your case.    But maybe it's not.    Okay.  That is the only basis on which they're targeted.  So if there had been 18 competitors in -- in the Bronx and Queens, then there would have been 18 targets.  Right?    Okay.

There's no way to get any protection against that, no matter how promptly you respond.    Why --
04-593 +++$+++     Excuse me.    Brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari.  You -- you did not raise 27 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 this.    Which you didn't allege and didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.    His contract with -- with the corporation?    No.    That's exactly the issue. And --    -- and that's how I understood this came -- case came up here.  The contract you're relying on is the contract between the corporation -- between the corporation and Domino's. 35 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 And can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for the violation of that contract?  There was no mention of any other contract.  I don't know why we should send it back down so you can mention a contract that you haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief in opposition. So that's the issue, whether the violation of the contract between MCDonald -- between Domino's and your client's corporation will allow your client to get -- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target. That's how I understood the lawsuit.    Now, could you tell me when -- the -- the claim was settled when your client's corporation was in bankruptcy.  Right?    And I assume your client had no -- nothing to say about -- about whether the settlement would be -- would be accepted by the trustee or not.    Well, it was his -- it was his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery by -- by John MCDonald.  What -- what created your problem is the fact that -- that the corporation went bankrupt.    But, you know, that's -- that's one of the -- one of the consequences of taking advantage of the corporate form.    But it doesn't -- it doesn't talk about personal injury that -- that broadly.  It talks about the right to make and enforce contracts. That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon. It doesn't talk about -- not a --    -- personal injury.

But they're really different things to be reviewed at those two times.  I mean, at the end of all the evidence, there may be some matter that the defendant inadvertently puts in that makes up the 18  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 deficiency in the plaintiff's case. So, it's really a 2 different motion, isn't it?    Yes, well, I don't know that read it that way.  I mean, you can say that the -- when the rule says that it -- that it ￼1 judgment as a matter of law post-verdict to the situation 2 where the court is ruling on a renewed motion. The rule 3 doesn't contemplate a situation in which the motion is not 4 renewed and yet the District Court purports to rule on the 5 50(a) motion that was left hanging by the submission of 6 the case to the jury.
04-603 +++$+++     But doesn't Congress have to create causes of action for constitutional violations as well, or at least for most of them?    Wait.    I'm -- I'm not sure that I -- that I'm satisfied with the answer.  You're -- you're trying to give us one rule for constitutional claims and another rule for statutory claims?    On -- on what basis?  I don't understand it.  Certainly in the text of the 10 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 jurisdictional statute, there's no such distinction. What 2 -- what is the basis for it?    Why was that a middle case?    Congress would not have necessarily anticipated that the States would glom onto a Federal criterion for purposes of their State -- of their State tort law --    -- whereas here, Congress must have anticipated that quiet title actions of this sort would be brought.    What if it doesn't require construction, but -- but what if there is a factual controversy?  Suppose there is a factual controversy as to whether notice was given and notice is required under the Federal statute.  Does -- does that factual controversy with regard to an essential element of -- of Federal law make it a Federal case?    Well, it doesn't present any question of law, just a question of fact.  Let's say both parties agree about the law, but the fact that is 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 determinative of nothing, except the operation of Federal 2 law, is at issue. Now, that -- that would normally -- 3 under 1331, you'd be able to come into Federal court I 4 suppose just where your only dispute is a factual dispute, 5 but it is a factual dispute regarding the operation of 6 Federal law. What -- what if this were just a factual 7 dispute about the operation of Federal law? What would we 8 do with it? Does the fact that it's a factual dispute 9 make it not substantial, not a substantial Federal 10 question?    I suppose that happens pretty often in removal -- in -- in removed cases.  You really don't know what the defense is going to be.  If it's removed on the basis of the well-pleaded complaint, when the defense gets there, it -- it may often be a State -- a State defense.

It's whether -- not whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they say "on the merits," but whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they don't say anything at all.    I would think it's an a fortiori case, in other words.    Under our current law, it wouldn't make any difference, would it?  Because even if they sent the "on the merits" postcard, Carey versus Saffold says --    -- it doesn't matter.    Well, in this --    -- in this case, in order to determine it was untimely, they would have presumably had to have gone into the factual analysis of whether 16  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 the prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a 2 year after getting the materials, and all of that 3 stuff. So, it's a lot easier for them, when the merits 4 of it seem to them absolutely clear, to simply deny it 5 on the merits and not reach the "timely" question.    Is "reasonable time" the issue, or is it what California would consider a "reasonable time"?  I mean, that's the problem.    We're not --    -- making up, for ourselves, what's a reasonable time. If California says a year is 28  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 a reasonable time, that would be the reasonable time at 2 issue, wouldn't it?

So, 106(b) and 106(c) were 16 designed for the contract claims that Justice Scalia referred to 17 earlier in the Petitioner's argument. 18 And then we looked to the Federal -- this Court's 19 jurisprudence with respect to what constitutes a waiver of 20 sovereign immunity. And we would most naturally look at the 21 Lapides case, in which -- in which a State came into this -- 22 removed a case from State to Federal court, and the court said 23 it didn't matter the type of claim that was being asserted, or 24 that there was affirmative recovery that was being asserted, 25 but, in fact, they constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity. 28  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005    And, again, I still don't see how 30  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 Your Honor. where is the waiver of ￼1 you distinguish (b) when you say "(b) doesn't apply here, it may 2 apply in other cases."

Is that -- is that what Hood said?    Yes.    But if you're making a separate waiver argument, apart from the abrogation argument, I don't see why you would not make that waiver argument as broadly as possible.

If you look at the history 10   of those provisions they are talking about state causes 11   of action and there's no reference to antitrust as such 12 in them. 13               That's quite different from Trinko where 14   there was an antitrust savings clause that went on in 15   detail about saving the antitrust cause of action. 16               The danger of conflict that the SEC is 17   talking about here is an acute danger to its ability to 18 --    Did we mention them in those cases?    Well, maybe we just forgot. (Laughter.)    I suppose if primary jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace the antitrust laws.    Extends a lot further, I would think. 10 11 12   under the standard the SG is using today.  But we think 13   we win under the inextricably intertwined standard, 14   because all of this conduct is closely connected to what 15   is permissible.  There's a very fine line between what 16   is forbidden and what is permitted.  They can ask about 17   future market prices.  They can give the IPOs to their    So we could decide that  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   these standards.  But what we advocate is dismissal with 2   prejudice, which is the relief the Court gave in the 3   NASD case, and not a shapeless remand of the case for 4   further pleading.  And the reason for that is that the 5   interference would overhang the market.  The 6   interference would affect the SEC's ability to lay down 7   the standards and encourage conduct going up to the line 8   of prohibition. 9               And the remedy that the Court approved in 10   NASD is exactly appropriate here, dismissal with 11   prejudice.  These plaintiffs did not even seek to amend 12   their complaints in the lower courts.  Under Second 13   Circuit law, they've waived their right to seek an 14   amendment.  So we, in sum, urge the Court to stick with 15   its own standards in NASD and Gordon.  The standards are 16   not broken.  They don't need to be fixed.  Nobody has 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 pointed to any changed circumstances that would warrant a change in this Court's decisions, and those decisions require dismissal with prejudice. If there are no further questions, we'd reserve the balance of our time.    I wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end. 10 11 12 13 14 15   against that threat.  We are certainly sensitive to the 16   threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine 17   line between two closely related areas of conduct.    Right, right.    They have chosen not to.    No, but --    But you -- you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a 10 11   stock when the -- in the case of a single offering.  You 12   could -- you could look upon that as, as an attempt to 13   raise the price.  That's what it is, isn't it?  An 14   attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough 15   price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out 16 there?    Yeah.  And you're saying they did this just -- not in the context of just single IPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would all do this.    Why?    Uh-huh.  The customer being the issuer?    They'd have to pay the 40  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   unlawful charges under securities laws, no matter where 2   they went.  And in terms of the inextricably 3   intertwined, it is the qualitative difference that stops 4   that. 5 6 7 8   they operate together.  That's not true.  There's never 9   been a case precisely like this; and the underwriters as I think behind the Solicitor General and the SEC's proposal is a fear that the syndicates, the underwriters are vulnerable to an antitrust case because 10   brokers, as market makers, they operate together and 11   cooperatively all the time.  Five years goes by.  Seven 12   years goes by.  There's no antitrust case --    -- discovery?  Right?    I don't think you've answered his question.

It says, "who at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, not, not some subsequent accessory. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   needs to be charged.  We're talking about what was 21   charged.  And it seems to me there's no question what 22   was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully 23   drive or take a vehicle.  There is no way you can 24   consider that an accessory.    It is not a question of Cal -- it is a question of English.    We're not saying about what  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   California law you need to charge generally under the 2   statute, and the statute says drive or take.  That's how 3   he was charged.  Moreover, though, under California law, 4   the charging document does not necessarily control the 5   conviction.    Partying maybe I would  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               The same is true -- and that's on the same 2   page the government cites.  The same is true with 3   respect to Maryland, where the same footnote that the 4   government cites rejects the natural and probable 5   consequences doctrine in favor of a narrower theory. 6   It's also true in Idaho, Louisiana, Georgia and Texas, 7   also do not apply the natural and probable consequences 8 doctrine. 9 So what, the government here is seeking to hold someone guilty of a theft offense as an aggravated felony without the requisite mens rea, and something that's a minority view of the states. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   limited to theft offenses, correct?  That would cut 21   across all of these areas in which the federal law 22   refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply? Just to put this into context, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, it's as if California passed a statute saying that in some cases someone can be guilty of burglary without the mens rea of burglary, or saying that one can be guilty of theft without the mens rea of theft.    Wait a minute.  That's a 6 7 8 11   abet robbery, natural probable consequence, sex 12   offenses, that's the People v. Nguyen case.  Another real case?    It sounds like the doctrine of unnatural improbable consequences. (Laughter.)

If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at 17   that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would 18   have slowed down.

He reasonably -- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking 13 14 15   the driver's life?  Is that why it's like the Third 16 17 18 19 20   case you just described didn't talk about intent.  It Circuit case?

Was it made by the conference committee? the House    It was made in the Senate.  So presumably never saw the prior --    -- language.    And the President, who signed this bill, never saw the prior language.    So, why should we attribute to both the House and to the President a knowledge of the prior version of the legislation?    In the Senate.    I thought --   I thought we -- I thought we established, earlier -- somebody told me -- that, in the normal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is not properly constituted, that claim is not adjudicated immediately, it's adjudicated at the conclusion of the proceeding. And --   We --   We don't -- we don't intervene on habeas corpus when somebody says that the panel is improperly constituted.  We wait until the proceeding's terminated, normally.    To a forum that is prima facie properly constituted.  I mean, it -- this is not a -- you know, a necktie party.  Where it parades as a court, and it's been constituted as a court, we normally wait until the proceeding's completed.    They could surely --    -- set forth a procedure which amounts to a suspension of the writ.  And if that procedure is done in a state of insurrection or invasion, 59 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 that would constitute a suspension of the writ, even 2 though they don't say, "We are suspending the writ of 3 habeas corpus."    I don't think Congress chose to do that.  One house of Congress chose to do it.  We don't know what the other house thought, and we don't know what the President thought.    I'll be interested in your answer, if you can get it out. [Laughter.]
05-200 +++$+++     Yes.    No, I'm not talking about the -- I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier.  And -- and it is asserted that this claim should have been made sooner. It has been waived by not having been brought forward sooner.  Okay?  That's -- that's the hypothetical.

Which -- but it's a constitutional basis to alter the map because 15    Wow.  That's a surprise. (Laughter.)    Don't you?    I see.    Even -- even when the map is so distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came out, after this -- this realignment of districts, had less of a divergence between the voting strength of the Republican Party and the number of Republican seats than had existed under the previous allocation by the Democrats.    I'm assuming --    -- they're removing them because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.    Well, that's my point too. (Laughter.)    But, of course, you want them to use race to manipulate outcomes.  It's just sometimes.

05-260 +++$+++     Mr. Stris, I'd -- I'd like to know what -- what you make of our opinion in Barnes v. Alexander.  It's an old case but it involved a situation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee arrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all the money, without giving the lawyer his contingent fee.  We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded constituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is one of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to convey a specific object, even before it is acquired, will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets title to the thing.  Why doesn't that absolutely resolve the present case?    But we -- but, you know, our opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable relief, only restitutionary equitable relief.  We've simply said whether equitable relief would normally be available.  And now you're -- you're trying to rewrite our cases to say that only certain types of equitable relief are -- are available.    And -- and if, indeed, it does -- it does occupy a lot of the field, so be it. That's the way Congress wrote the statute. 9 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    What -- I don't understand what difference that makes.  I mean, in both cases there was a commitment to pay the contingent fee.  It was a promise. And when the money was collected, the court said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien upon your recovery in order to comply with the promise.    Take it.  Take it.  It's a good one.  Right.    Why -- why isn't that what occurred here?  What -- what's the essential difference?    Well, but I mean, once you get out of the contract terms and are trying to make your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to show that -- that part of the recovery was -- was for the -- for the medical expenses.  And has that been shown?    You -- you have piqued my curiosity and -- and didn't satisfy it.  You say there are variations on make-whole.  What -- you were about to describe the variations.  What are the variations?    The fact that your equitable claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly doesn't -- doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable claim.  I mean, the classic equitable claim is somebody declaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he 36 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- declares a trust.  Equity will enforce that trust, but the trust is based on a contractual commitment.  Right?    I should think your response is that Congress provided for only equitable relief.    And -- and that that's the -- that's the answer.    Congress said that.   Or you might try to get 41 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ERISA amended.

I mean, the right -- a lot of rights 4 that are later reviewed for harmless error or for -- to 5 see whether there was prejudice were violated at the 6 time, and not -- not just on the basis of whether there 7 was prejudice or not.    Unless you compel him to seek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional claim, your -- every incentive is to go right ahead with the trial.

Not appropriate.  Necessary.    I hope so.  I mean -- people --    Except I -- I don't think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment.

05-547 +++$+++     We have a case involving standing which says that -- you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the 10 11 12 13   conceivable.  And this seems to me an exercise in the 14   conceivable.  Nobody thinks your client is really, you 15   know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's 16   on supervised release in the United States, or is going -- 17   is going to apply -- having been deported from the country 18   for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in 19   the -- these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable. 20   This is just not the real world.    Do you think there's a realistic possibility that this person is going to be  ￼5 6 7 8 9    Has he applied for such a visa? Has he expressed any intention to apply?    Well --    -- then it's an exercise in the conceivable, it seems to me.    Yes.    -- incorporated.  So, you want us to interpret 924(c) one way for criminal convictions -- a criminal sentence -- that is, you don't need a conviction in order to get the enhancement -- but another way for --    I thought the Government has taken the position -- and as far as I know, all the Courts of Appeals have bought the Government's argument -- that there -- you do not need a conviction --    -- that so --    So, it's sort of a double  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7   conviction.  What -- 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24    That's for purposes of the immigration law.    Okay.  Now, do you do the same for purposes of the felony enhancement provision?    You --    Well, that seems to me --    -- very strange.  You would look to the -- you would look to the State law for Government, you also follow the State.    Is that right?    So, you look to the State of purposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of 25   924(c), what would you look to?  Either one.  Either one. 47  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Whichever --    -- whichever -- for 924 -- whichever one would make it a felony.    You lose.    Yes.    Right.    All right.    If it's a felony under either 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   felony or a Federal felony, you lose.  I mean, the 21 22 23 24 25 defendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?    No?    If the act is either a State  ￼1   Federal offense.  But, because -- not because of the 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 you're saying is, if it is either a felony under Federal law or a felony under State law, you get the enhanced sentence under 924(c), isn't that right?    I thought that's --    -- what the whole argument is about, whether it has to be a felony under Federal law. You're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under Federal law, that you don't get --    Well --  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   simple one.  If it's -- it seems to me, if it's -- what    Listen.    Listen.  My question is a  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 now. 7     You've thoroughly confused me 10              Okay, now we go to two, what's a "drug- 11   trafficking crime"?  It means any felony punishable under 12   the -- under the Controlled Substances Act.  Now, in your 13   definition, we first look to see whether simple possession 14   is punishable under the -- in Controlled Substances Act. 15   It sure is.  It sure is.  It's punishable as a 16   misdemeanor.  So, it meets that.  Under your definition, 17   is it a felony?  Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota. 18   Okay.  So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court 19   in South Dakota.  And, on your reading of the statute, 20   that guy should get a bump-up of 5 years.    -- that right?
05-593 +++$+++     What does that mean?  Does that mean that if the district court finds that in fact the defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, the United States is eliminated as the defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?    Maybe the United States should remain the party defendant and the United States should pay which would be the, you know, the price of  1   That's what happened.  But, and in that --    Right, right.    Wouldn't somebody always be able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case -- 44  1   without jury and that's because under the statute the 2   Attorney General's certification has the legal effect of 3   making the United States the defendant.  The United 4   States -- the action shall be deemed an action against 5   the United States and the United States shall be 6   substituted, and that is true unless and until the 7   certification is overturned.  And there is of course no 8   Seventh Amendment right to jury trial against the United 9   States.    But the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is 45  1 2 3 4   ping-pong?    And wouldn't that destroy the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this  ￼ 1   nonetheless governed by 1447(d).  There are a lot of 2   erroneous remands and this would just be, just be 3   another one.
05-595 +++$+++     I mean, it is conceivable that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway.    Is that the case in Federal courts, too?
05-608 +++$+++     Contractually?  They say that that's their contractual right?    But --    -- so long as they're still paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract 16   theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long 17   as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete 18 injury? 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    I --    I find it --    -- patentee --    That's fine.    What is the --    Go back -- what is the hypothetical --    Continue on.
05-669 +++$+++     So, the question is, How -- you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to 10 11 12   administrative proceedings in this case?  And I find it 13   pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it 14   way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations 15   whatever for the Government in these cases.    Wait.    Excuse me.  And this was the Congress that enacted what?    Oh.    Which is not what we're talking about here.    As late as 1978, the Justice Department didn't think that way, did it?    The opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner here would urge.    Do we have --    -- that opinion, by the way? 12   Both sides cited it.  The -- is it -- it was unpublished.    Does anybody give it to us?    Yes, I know they did offer, but nobody did it.    Good.  I would like that.    Right.    Do we have an example of issue  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   order? it's not in the issue --    I think --    How do you defend against a    I -- I'm really very reluctant to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the statute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years later, and say, "Oh, by the way, you owe all this money."    The company says "Gee, I -- you know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago." 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19   1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no 20   limitations period ever applies against the Government. 21   And that's the reason for the strict construction canon, 22   that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies, 23   and thereby bars the Government from forcing the law in 24   the public interest.    He didn't apply against the Government either.    Yes.    Yes.    I think you have to say no --    Even if you have an administrative proceeding which is called a "complaint"? You know, I mean -- and some are, I think.    And let's assume all those  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to come in or out, right?    Yes.
05-705 +++$+++     I don't think he's saying that. I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under  ￼ 1 2 3 4   fine.  But to say that it would be unjust for them not to 5   do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any 6   violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.    Such communications service.    And I would think that would mean such communications service that was furnished.    Well, except that it is none of unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action.  1 2 3 4   helpful, but it is surely not particularly harmful.  And    We --    Well, you should be arguing, then, that we should give Chevron deference to the 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   between 201(a) and 201(b).  But there's another angle of 23   approach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana 24   Service -- Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this 25   Court was asked to draw the inference, just as it has do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.    I thought you should be.
05-746 +++$+++     Can you have more than one proximate cause?    Of course.  So then how can "in whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause requirement, because it could be in part and still be a 10 11 12   proximate cause.  How can that language possibly be 13   interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?    So the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part.    I find it hard to see any reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation. 51  1   language, but another reason is that it does affect the 2   causation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in 3   Section 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51.  And 4   when it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of 5   the risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not 6   equate proximate cause and "resulting in whole or in 7   part" necessarily as the same thing because one version 8   had proximate cause and it was not adopted.

05-848 +++$+++     Well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same.    Entirely meaningless.    Mr. Hungar, I'm curious. What happens if you have a new company that wasn't around 16   statute?    Who was saying that?    That's the NSPS section.    I don't understand that. It seems to me each part has had different definitions and this definition only applies to part 52 which applies when there is no SIP.    I don't know how you can say it automatically applies when there is a SIP.    Part 51, in other words.    You're quoting page 9?    Oh, in their reply brief? 37  1 2 3 4 5 6 7   distinction between the two.  And the truth is if EPA 8   wanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving, that 9   is to eliminate the concept of modification, what it 10   should have done is two things. 11               It should have -- it should have deleted 12   52.01.  And it should have adopted the proposed 13   regulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs. 14   This is on page 9 of their brief.  This statement is 15   astonishing to me.  "The term major modification serves situations than you would for SIP situations?    That occurred to me when--    It's definitely no. (Laughter.)    Well, I think what's wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program 10 11   has to mean the same as modification in the other.  If 12   you didn't say that, that would be the result.  You give 13   modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable 14   here.  You give it whatever reading you think is 15   reasonable in the other place.  But when you say the two 16   have to be the same, it seems to me you have something 17   else in mind.    It's not just a matter of using the same word.    It's a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning.

And the mere fact that the 10   objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is 11   perfectly all right, although certainly not the only 12   objective in the world.

It may be the most 8   flagrant violation of departmental regulations in the 9   world, and in that case the department that has those 10   regulations can take action, just as here Virginia says 11   if you violate the arrestable offense rule under 12   Virginia law, the consequence is not to exclude 13   evidence.  Virginia will not exclude evidence under its 14   own State law for a violation of this provision. 15               But it does say under State law that a 16   person can resist an unlawful arrest, The officer can be 17   sued for engaging in an unlawful arrest under State law, 18   and that the officer can be fired or disciplined.  And 19   those are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do. 20               Now, what the Virginia Supreme Court has 21   done is come along and say, even though you do not 22   intend this rule to trigger the exclusionary rule under 23   Virginia law, you have no choice.  As a matter of 24   Federal constitutional law, if Virginia decides to 25   exceed the constitutional minimum as this Court 19  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   announced in Atwater and place additional restrictions 2   on the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional 3   price of having the evidence excluded if that rule is 4 violated. 5               At the outset, it's clear that imposing such 6   a Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than 7   discourage the States from providing additional 8   restrictions as a matter of their own State's law that 9   may serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the 10   floor that this Court has identified as required by the 11   Fourth Amendment.    But you think they would accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?    It seems to me we've crossed that bridge with Atwater.    What about Cooper -- Cooper v California?

You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge has been filed. That doesn't make sense.  I mean, it's just like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days. And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?

Doesn't that eliminate the whole purpose of the -- of the preliminary document, to weed out those charges that relate to employment in    It will -- it will be a charge even if it's in France?    I think that's right.  I think what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we 19  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 decide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we don't decide to give notice.    Which is very nice for the EEOC, but not --    Intake questionnaire.    -- on the other side.    Well, what is your test? When is it a charge?    And don't tell me when notice is given.    My goodness.  It's like saying there's no complaint until an answer is filed.    It's just not true.    You're only going to give her equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a fall back on the manifest destiny rule or -- (Laughter.) 5 6 7 8   delineate that it's a charge.  And I think the EEOC 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 could do that if they knew they had to live by that, and then we're perfectly happy with the EEOC defining "charge" as long as they consistently define it and give us notice. Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time if there are no more questions.    Is this after the real charge was filed or what everybody concedes --    The charge form. 30  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    But suit was pending at (Laughter.)    That's pretty risky.

I'm astounded if that's the only number of mistakes they made, from 19 --    Oh, with respect to FedEx.    Oh.    Now, if the EEOC chooses to give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   filed a charge before.  And just let me complete it if I 5   may.    I really think the problem here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else.    It does, indeed, have this form which says -- which says that its purpose -- information provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of the facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah. All of that, however, is contained as part of the Privacy Act statement.    And if the filer is not interested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't 40    Well, what kind of an agency is this? (Laughter.)

If you look at 1626.3 on page 351, it says: 24   'Charge' shall mean a statement filed with the 25   Commission by, or on behalf of, an aggrieved person 44    All right.  Let's try something else.

Thank you, Your Honor. 17               By this Court, and in that context it is 18   still good law.  What it did was to clarify the issue of 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 post-formation contracts.    I think that they would be    What change did the 1991 amendment make then? 16 17 18 19   change the outcome of Patterson.  In what respect?  You    You say it was intended to say not in the respect of whether retaliation is included but in what respect then? 20 21 22 23   post-formation.  Patterson was dealing with those 24   aspects of just the initial making and enforcing of a 25   contract, not once you've got the contract established 6    It didn't specify them.  I think your point is probably that it includes the same post-formation conduct that is prohibited at formation, which is to say discrimination on the basis of race, which is not retaliation; right?    Why did they -- why did    Surely it's your position that even when you have a discrimination claim, you  ￼23 24 25 that's -- 1981 does apply in a large number of employment discrimination cases.

And that's just a wholly different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand for them to apply the proper test.    Well, I'm not -- we are not talking about distribution.    We are talking about the intent that it be a return of capital or not.    Either one. 28 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   capital or dividends?  Does that make the difference as intent requirement?

You really think 21   there's a difference?    In both cases money is being used for a purpose that is contrary to the establishment clause, according to the taxpayer.    I don't care whether it's 16   religion clause violation in one case and not in the 17   other, but as far as the establishment clause violation, 18   I find it difficult to understand the difference between 19 the two.    But not -- but not if the President just gives the money out of a general appropriation, authorizing him to give money to people who are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based Initiative was -- was designed to help?    He's getting the money from Congress under a general, under a general appropriation. If he takes this money and he says here, use it for a religious purpose, that's okay?    Why, why not necessarily? I thought that was your -- you proposition, that it has to be a congressional violation not an executive.    As far as standing is concerned, he can't be sued?

And every constitutional right could 20   be sort of transmogrified into a claim that oh, that's 21   an as-applied appropriations challenge, because the    Well, I don't understand. The money -- say it again?    You mean Congress has to, has to say that --    Well, what about Bowen? The money wasn't central to the violation there.    It was, you know, a pregnancy program and the executive added to it certain, certain restrictions that were challenged as being religiously based. - Subject to Final Review 10 11 12 13 14   challenge to the specific grants.  But there were 15   specific grants identified and there was an as-applied 16   challenge.  But the argument was --    And we allowed an as-applied challenge.    It wasn't in Bowen either.    I really don't think -- there's an identified sum of money that goes to pay the costs of Air Force One, too, to buy the gas and 13 14 15   everything else.  There's an identified sum of money 16   that goes into the pockets of the security guards who 17   protect the President.  I mean, it really doesn't make 18   any sense. 19 20   think, as I say, there are two tests.  One is whether 21   there's an identifiable sum.  We were talking about with 22   respect to grants are the easiest case.  There's another 23   case as when there's a challenge to an entire program 24   that the Government has identified as a particular 25   program.  And then the question, the second question 35    This is money that is expended in order to enable the President to do 37  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   religious trip.    It wasn't, it wasn't the 10   programs for -- to combat pregnancy.  And some of the 11   organizations that were getting the money were placing 12   conditions on it.  It wasn't central to the program.  It 13   was something added that the challenger said shouldn't 14   have been added.    And that makes a lot of 10   nothing to do with the rationale of Flast or the 11   underlying threepence here of James Madison, that 12   does -- that is a particular amount of money that the 13   Government is spending and it's identifiable just 14   because of religion.  We think that that's --    But in response to Justice Ginsburg's point, you could have said the same 41  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   --    It happened to have been spent badly, but it would have been spent anyway.

Which is the clearest 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11   Romano, and thus the Darden rule that if a prosecutor's 12   comments, the totality --    Did they refuse to accept argument on those points?    You don't know for sure  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    Even -- even the Supreme Court cases going to the other points, they didn't -- 10   did any of them involve a separate penalty phase?  They 11 12 13 14 15 16   the jury to find a person guilty.  He was not just 17   urging them what penalty is better or worse.  He was 18   saying for these reasons you should find the individual 19   guilty. 20               That's quite different it seems to me from 21   the situation in which guilt has already been 22   established.  The trial's done.  This person is guilty, 23   and the only thing they're arguing about is what the 24   penalty ought to be.  I'm not sure that you can 25   analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other 40 were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital case, weren't they?    So that, so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in determining what kind of argument is proper.  Because 2   in the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor 3   says this is not just about this defendant, it's about 4   the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the 5   person guilty.  I mean -- and that's crazy.  You don't 6   find the person guilty in order to stop drug 7   trafficking. 8               But you do impose a heavier penalty in order 9   to do that.  So I just don't, don't see the analogy from 10   the Supreme Court cases you have.    Well, serve him right?  I mean, is that --    And was that this habeas? Then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?

So the -- in other words, that first 5   period from the time the underpayment is made until the 6   IRS notifies the taxpayer, that, that interest is not 7   subject to abatement.  That automatically accrues and 8   there is no remedy.  Congress has created no remedy for 9 10 11 13   for the interest that accrues until you're notified of 14 what the --    Excuse me.

They don't give you a figure.    The next thing you know, they will enact a progressive income tax. (Laughter.) 10 11   nothing to do with the progressive income tax.  What I 12   have not seen anywhere is the use of wealth, totally 13   different from the dollar value of a claim, to shut the 14   courthouse door.  I'm just saying, is there such a case 15   anywhere, and if there is no such case, then I'd say I 16   wonder about this assumption.  The assumption that the 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Is there a you cannot enter - Subject to Final Review 1   apply to -- 2 3   you give to poor people more than to rich people.  That 4   makes sense.  That has nothing to do with having a    So one has a cause of action and the other doesn't have a cause of action. And the difference you're making between the two is you're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest    But he doesn't have --    Wait a minute.  They are 14   it?

And the -- assuming 16   he incorporated that as the basis for his ruling.  What 17   prosecutor said was that -- he had two rulings.  First, 18   he said I think he's overcome his problem with the 19   explanation about reasonable doubt.  And so that's not 20   an issue in this case.  And he said, and I don't think 21   he has said anything that overcame this idea that, of he 22   must kill again before he imposed the death penalty or 23   be in a position to kill again. 24               That, it's our position is incorrect, 25   under -- an incorrect summation of what happened in the 36 think maybe, maybe the judge was right.

Not if there's no opposing  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   didn't.  So I think the assumption was, he was granting 2   the objection on the basis provided by Mr. Matthews, 3   which was incorrect both under Washington law and under 4   the facts developed in the voir dire.    Of what law?    Well, he said that, but elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider it unless it were a situation in which this person would be able to commit the crime again. - Subject to Final Review 1   later case that suggests a change in that respect?    They did indicate that unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider 17 18 19 20   wouldn't prevent him under Washington law.

Many systems 20   would have to be completely reengineered to take in new 21   data about age and addressee.  There would have to be a 22   new system for the alert.  There would have to be a new 23   system for reading the alert.  That takes one 24   and-a-half years, 18 months, for that modification to 25   occur.  That's an enormous effect. 27    Why wouldn't there would be be a problem with uniformity from State to State.    I didn't think so.    Do you think if Maine did  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   commodities. 2               And also, if you look at the 1555-D, the 3   prohibition on unlicensed tobacco retailers sending to a 4   consume and the imputed knowledge, the law that has 5   strict liability on the carrier, if there is a box that 6   has a shipper's name from the attorney general's list, 7   that imputed knowledge would require that every one of 8   the 65,000 or 16 million packages going to Maine every 9   year be examined for the shipper identification. 10               And in the record, there is -- the State has 11   admitted at J-96 that that kind of research to look 12   into -- in this case it was looking at the sender, but 13   it would be the same for the shipper -- I mean, it was 14   looking for the addressee; this would be for the shipper 15   -- is two dollars per package.    But there's no text, 10   a very -- for example, in the UPS assurance of 11   discontinuance, there's a three-tier disciplinary scheme 12   against shippers that are found to violate that. 13               And the carriers entered into these 14   agreements under threat of criminal sanctions.  The New 15   York statute made one offense a misdemeanor and a second 16   offense a felony.  And the carriers, who had been trying 17   to abide by those laws, were faced with subpoenas and 18   the threat of prosecution.  And so their solution was a 19 20 21 22   interested in two things.  Number one, I want to make 23   sure you completed the quantification point that you 24   made, and you pointed us to someplace in the record, 25   because the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a 30 uniform nationwide policy, no cigarettes to consumers. But of course --    I'm not sure that if this -- if this Federal act means what it says, that that kind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did not want to happen.    Voluntary under threat of criminal penalty.    Well, that's -- that's 17 18 19 20   challenge that -- that New York settlement.  I'm 21   surprised you accepted it as, well, you know, so long as 22   the carrier coughs it up, it's okay.    Before you get into that, do we have to hold -- assuming we agree with you -- do we have to hold that the knowing requirement of the first sentence is okay?    -- even though the other provisions are not okay?    trouble with the knowing requirement.

Well, but Congress just established an entry qualification for getting into  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   have to be proved at the end of the case.  Indeed even 2   if you prove the contrary, the case is still validly 3   there.  Congress can establish entry requirements even 4   when they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with 5   the merits that the jury is supposed to decide.    Right.  And then on appeal, we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes, it is a strong inference. I mean, I hope we're going to establish some standards for how you go about determining whether there's a strong inference or not.    I think it's 66 and 43  ￼think -- (Laughter.) - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   Justice.  I don't think you can ascribe a percentage to 8   it.

You haven't violated any Federal law.    That may be, but that's not 24    I know you aren't.  Why    Yes or no?  I think you can answer yes or no.    Okay.

Well, that's only because, I guess the other side didn't take the action that they could have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply the screen.    Did they conduct the demonstration with a screen or without a screen?    Did they conduct the demonstration with or without a screen?    And since they didn't use the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting them; is that correct?    So they did not get what 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   with that.  In the past the State had let them do that, 18   as long as they had the screen.

It was 11   intended to be used by the other side.  Wouldn't that 12 13 14 15   great violence to what Congress intended.

Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?    Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.
06-618 +++$+++     The other side's contention is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so when you challenge the firing you are challenging the 32  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Justice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong.  The reason is 2   that this Court has said that conduct that is related to 3   the legislative process, that may in fact be important 4   to the legislative process, is not itself a part of the 5   legislative process.  That is the fundamental holding of 6   Brewster.  And this Court has found that some actions 7   that affect an employee, for example in the Bogan case, 8   where a decision that resulted in the termination of a 9   person was clearly legislative in nature because it was 10   made in a legislative proceeding, it was voted upon by 11   the legislators, and it was based upon either budgetary 12   or policy determinations. 13               That is a legislative act.  But this Court 14   in Bogan specifically distinguished that circumstance 15   from a classic personnel action firing such as happened 16   to Mr. Hanson here.  There was no legislative act 17   involved in Mr. Hanson's firing.  He was just fired. 18   The reason for the firing is at issue in this case.  A 19   jury can sort out issues like whether or not Senator 20   Dayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or 21   not Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent 22   services was bad or good, as we contend. 23               But none of that involves legislative 24   activity as this Court has described it under the speech 25   or debate act.  So our contention is that the only issue 33  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in this case is absolute immunity and there is no 2   absolute immunity in this case.  This case does not 3   involve a legislative act, as Judge Randolph below and 4   all of the judges below recognized.

Yes, but that is -- but the parent would not have to show that the parent would have used that available public remedy --    --  if it were there?    Of course, to be fair, this provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a 10 11 12   private school.  It also applies to somebody who is 13   already in public school, and the program offered by the 14   -- by the city is patently inadequate.  You are 15   compelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a 16   program that anybody would see will -- will not meet the 17 needs.    The parent would presumably cover themselves, look it, he's getting X,Y -- X, Y, and Z in the private school and you're going to give him Z; would be upon you to say, oh, we think Z is enough.    What did it do, then?  What meaning do you give to it?    I don't understand that. It makes it very clear it is, it is (ii) which authorizes the enrollment in a private school and  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               I mean if you say that our prior cases 2   overrode that limitation, then what purpose does the 3   limitation serve?    Where else does it say that the city will pay for the cost of a private education 12   except there?  That's the only place it says it.  And 13 14 15 16   intend that exclusive language.  If it had, it would 17   have used the "only if" language. part of the requirements for getting it is that the child was receiving service at a public institution.    You don't have to read it that way, anyway. - Subject to Final Review    Once you're in the private school reimbursement you're in the private school reimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later. Anyway, that issue is not -- not before us today. I don't understand you assertion that 22   exercise of its equitable powers.  "Shall grant such 23   relief as the court determines is appropriate" -- if a 24   court had granted some equitable relief in one case, and 25   then there is a statute that's passed which renders that 37  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   equitable relief no longer appropriate, I wouldn't say 2   that that -- that that amounts to a repeal by 3   implication.  It's just that what is appropriate depends 4   upon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at 5   the time that the relief is sought.    Bingo. You got me on that.

If and when that situation  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the State can choose to have primaries or conventions. 2               Where the State has chosen to have 3   conventions, party rights attach to that.  And the one 4   thing that the lower court did that we urge the Court to 5   consider to be quite inappropriate was to apply strict 6   scrutiny to what is routine core party associational 7   activity.  Leaders developing candidacies, recommending 8   candidates, endorsing candidates, and fielding delegates 9   who they think are loyal to the interests of the party, 10   that doesn't deserve strict scrutiny.  At worst, we 11   think there's no burden here to the rank-and-file voters 12   to force them to participate in the party's own 13   convention.  But even if there were some burden, at 14   worst, we think that there are countervailing rights 15   here.  And where there are countervailing rights the 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Court should prefer to the legislative expertise here, and the expertise -- thank you, Your Honor.

Because the plan owes him  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   think there are two reasons why that's incorrect.  And 2   the first reason is 502 (a)(2), unlike 502(a)(3), is not 3   a catchall provision, so if he has a remedy under 4   502(a)(2) -- 5 6   (a)(1)(B).    I'm talking about  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   exhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a 2   judicial gloss on the statute.  I find it hard to 3   believe that the express terms of (a)(2), which the 4   plain language authorizes restoration to the plan of any 5   losses to the plan for any breach of duty --    Let me come back to your earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) -- it's actually a requirement of 1109 --   -- is not met.  And that is -- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to 17   the plan resulting from each such breach.  In these 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't the plan have to provide those benefits?    And that would be a loss to    Right.    Right.    It does if you sue the plan and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's failure to do what he was supposed to.    Right.    I have an entitlement to certain -- certain welfare payments.    And if there's no money in his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to clarify that even if there is no money in his account the plan owes him future benefits in that amount. 10 11 12 13   that point would happen, Justice Scalia.  Either he    Right.    By picking, as you put it, by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?    What's the answer to it?    Where?    Mr. Roberts, Section (a), (a)(1)(B) --    Unlike Section (a)(2), which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued. just says a civil action may be brought to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to clarify his right under the terms of the plan. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   under (a)(1)(B).  Against the plan or against the    I think the implication there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.    It may well.  But I'm just talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me that the logical reading of that is that the suit is against the plan.    Of the United States Code.    It's useful to have a code. It really is.    Prior to that it's just a 19   understand how your system works.  You're telling me it 20   depends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind 21   of a breach it was.  How can we write an opinion like 22   that? 23 24 25 (Laughter.)    What's done meanwhile?

06-923 +++$+++     What do you mean by -- let's get straight by what we mean by "in actuality conflicted."  Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial interest in actuality conflicted?    No.  That's, that's a conflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its judgment.  But the conflict exists whether you, whether you give it effect or not.    So let's call that a conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties, whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his 10 11 12   judgment.    It does make a decision then.  What was a reasoned decision for someone who doesn't have a conflict becomes an unreasoned decision simply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict?

Now, let's take a perfectly reasonable decision.  It is not arbitrary.  Does giving weight to the existence of the conflict which the settlor of the plan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean that what was reasonable becomes unreasonable?

Whether they wanted the Senator 8   defeated or they wanted to put enough pressure on the 9   Senator that he would change his vote with regard to the 10   filibuster.

Wait a minute.  In order to get it to the Security Council, you have to take some  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   or a commission I don't think is the point, Justice 2   Scalia.

And we do take the 12   position that if the President had done nothing, and 13   certainly if the President had said we're not going to 14   comply, we're going to respond to this ICJ judgment the 15   way we did with the Nicaragua judgment, we don't think 16   that this judgment would be enforceable as of its own 17   terms.

It said this warning is 12   consistent with our opinion today.  And -- and that 13   warning said --    -- what you have here.    Yes.  1   such that they stopped talking, or did not talk, or 2   never spoke about a right to have a counsel with you 3   during -- during -- “during” just dropped out.

They must 5   have agreed to permit it. 6               Where did the arbitrators say they agreed -- 7   they agreed to permit it?  Not simply, they did not 8   agree to prohibit it.

We know that because, if 3 4 5 6   “a foreign state” means, it could have said:  “A foreign 7   state” means its political subdivisions, agencies, or you look at 1603(b), the very next subsection, Congress said what “an agency or instrumentality” means.

People had to be able to predict whether 2   they can take natural gas out of the ground, how much 3   they can make on it, and once they enter into an 4   arm's-length contract, they should be able to rely on 5 it. 6               That was the whole purpose.  And, now, you 7   want to us say, well, sometimes it will work, and 8   sometimes it won't.  And we're not going to say when; 9   we're going to leave it to the D.C. Circuit to invent 10   some “sometimes.” 11               That doesn't make any sense, does it?    Okay.    Can a noncontracting party go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra?  Or is FERC suddenly unchained when a third party brings a proceeding before FERC?  It's a strange situation.    Who does it apply to?  I mean, it's just -- just the two parties?   1    may apply that just and reasonable standard. 2                Now, the public interest standard looks for 3    serious harm to the public.

The issue is whether those people who filed 5 15 years later and knew that it was very late, whether 16 they're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether 17 the -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years 18 earlier to have it heard. How does that do any 19 injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you 20 know, you're likely to be denied?   But that's not a question of adequacy, is it? It's a question of notice.

And the deal was you're -- you're going to work for us and nobody else. You have no other clients.    Yes, I understand that. How do you look at them?    Does that come out -- case come out the same way or not?    Everybody takes a position to make money for profit.

He's just a lawyer who's been hired for 364 days to work for nobody but the -- but the government.  And you still say that he has no -- no immunity in what he does.    To investigate for the 35    Two years, though?  Three years?  I'm a lawyer who --    -- enters a contract for life with this -- with this government to investigate. At that point, does he get the immunity?    Still not?    You should say section 1983 didn't exist.  That's your answer --    -- to that one, right?    I don't really know that, but you don't know the opposite, either, do you?    And -- and the rule about malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that applied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but to government lawyers as well, didn't it?    So, if we're going to be historically faithful, we should deny any qualified immunity to government lawyers or expand the government immunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do anything so long as it's not malicious?    Right.    So, the devil with history,     Do you think the rest of them don't -- don't have any protection?    Wow.  That's going to be disappointing news for all those attorneys at Justice -- (Laughter.)    What if I told you that all the lawyers at the Department of Justice are regarded as being employed at will and that all of them can be  ￼ 1   about the Petitioner's test a little bit, too, because 2   the Court had some concerns about it.  And I share those 3   same concerns, and that's that the test requires a 4   factual analysis, you know, being temporarily retained 5   in close coordination and supervision.  Those are highly 6   factual questions that aren't going to bode well for 7   early resolution of a case. 8               And a -- the lawyer is going to be able to 9   plead around that test very easily and take the case 10   into -- into full-blown litigation and discovery and so 11   forth.  So, that -- that test is problematic. 12               In addition, as I understand it, the test is 13   going to be extended well beyond attorneys.  The test 14   results in anybody working for the government under, you 15   know, close coordination or supervision, whatever that 16   means, is going to get immunity.  So, that is well 17   beyond attorneys, to anybody.  Anybody who contracts 18   with the government and meets that factual test is now 19   going to have immunity. 20               And that's something -- that's a huge step 21   that this Court, you know, should not take, especially 22   when there is no historical basis for it and the policy 23   concerns are not present. 24               But even if you apply that test to 25   Mr. Filarsky, under these facts, Mr. Filarsky would not 56  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 have immunity.  He wasn't temporarily retained.  He worked for the City of Rialto for 14 years as -- as a business, for profit.  He had many clients, and the City of Rialto was one of them.  It wasn't that he was temporarily retained.  So, he doesn't even meet that element of the Petitioner's test. Mr. Filarsky was not performing a -- a factual -- 
10-1024 +++$+++     Of course, you're talking about statutes that require that the material have been made public, not that, say, establish a violation if one 10   agency provides the information to another agency?  I 11   mean, as the Government points out, this -- this statute 12   goes far beyond any -- any State statutory or common law 13   protections of privacy.  It's really very picky, picky. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   there's an intentional and willful violation.  So, they 21   knew the law prevented them from doing what they did.    That -- that's a different  ￼ 1   requires is that the waiver be expressed in text, and 2   the court can't read it in.  It can't add words to the 3   text.  If you -- if your intent is to separate out 4   presumed liquidated, punitive, other forms of damages 5   that do not -- are not tethered to proof of harm, 6   "actual damages" is a phrase that does that precisely 7   because that's what "actual" means; it means real. 8               There's no ordinary definition of "actual" 9   where it means pecuniary only, that is -- you get when 10   you use it in certain contexts.  So, this Court doesn't 11   need to add, expand, or read anything into these words, 12   "actual damages."  It simply needs to give them the 13   meaning that they have in ordinary English definitions, 14   in Black's Law definition.  This definition this Court 15   gave to actual damages in the Birdsall case over a 16   hundred years ago is the same thing:  presumed -- proven 17   damages, not presumed.  So, the waiver of sovereign 18   immunity is here expressed; it doesn't arise by 19   implication. 20               But the one -- but there's another side to 21   the sovereign immunity point that the Government never 22   mentions.  The court's obligation is dual here.  When 23   there has been a waiver, the court can't expand that 24   waiver, but neither can it contract it.  You have here 25   the Government spinning out theoretical -- theoretical  40 ￼ 1   possibilities that actual damages was -- was used in 2   this more peculiar sense; what it really meant was 3   special damages -- to produce a deconstruction of the 4   statute that eviscerates it, leaves most of the people 5   who suffer intentional, willful violations without any 6   remedy at all.  And those who happen to have an economic 7   loss do not get compensation for the primary form of 8   harm from a privacy violation.    You would say that actual emotional damages are not -- are not general damages?    Okay.

Now, if she didn't want the points, she should have -- when it came to the closing, say what are these points for?  The 8 percent is what you agreed to.  And they would have said, well, that 8 percent is the -- is the rate we give when we charge 2 10 11 12 13 14 15   points.

The referral -- the referral is certainly a service performed to the lender.  There's -- there's nothing -- what should I say -- unethical about getting a fee for a referral.  It's -- it's called a finder's fee. So, you know, under (a) a finder's fee is -- is made unlawful, right?    And under (b), something quite different, and that is giving money to somebody who performs no service at all is made unlawful.  And for that, you don't need an agreement, right?    But you concede that if we give it Chevron deference, you lose?    No, on -- the case.  If we give either the policy statement or the rule Chevron deference, you lose.  Is that right? 10 11 12 13 14 15   correct.    We don't give deference to interpretations that are beyond the limits of what the language will bear, do we?    Does it have to be specifically conferred?     Is it at all increased when it's specifically conferred?    They'd be liable under State law, I assume --    -- for fraud, wouldn't 55   ￼1   they.

I'm not going to bet my house on that.    That's very nice, when you've received something called a compliance order, which says you'll -- you're subject to penalties of 32.5 for every day of violation.    But it shows the high-handedness of the agency, it seems to me, putting in there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA. 35   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Suppose the Corps of Engineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis for refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a permit; you don't need a permit.    Is that binding on --    -- the Environmental Protection Agency?    So, they could just -- just dispense with this compliance order and tell the Sacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe you're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you know, pine trees on the lot.  It could do that?    And there would be no review of that.

I mean, it's so weird.  I can't understand that.    Yes, but the difference is that the 1983 cases don't deal with what this deals with, which is displacement of the jurisdiction of 10   but in all cases. 11               And I had thought that the general rule that 12   you have to be clear when you take cases out of the 13   Federal courts -- I thought that that applies not just 14   where you're dealing with a constitutional jurisdiction 15   but also where you're dealing with already-conferred 16   statutory jurisdiction.

I think he's persuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking about, subsection (c), the only meaning left for "award" is an award by the agency, because --    But -- but you have to show me one other provision at least where the only meaning you can give "award" is entitlement to money.    (h)(1)?    "Upward adjustments to" -- 33   ￼    What -- what does "awarded compensation at less than the maximum rate" mean?  I'm not sure what that refers to.    Right.    I got you.    Yes.    You're right.  It doesn't make sense.  It --    Yes, yes.
10-1472 +++$+++     No, it doesn't.  It reflects that judgment only if you're right that "interpreter" means "translator."    I mean, you're begging the question.  You could say that the one should embrace the other.  But whether Congress thought that or not is mostly dependent on the language Congress used, isn't  ￼ 1 I possibly can. I'm obviously not standing here saying 2 we lose under the language, but it would be a good idea 3 for the statute to cover written translation. That's 4 not a legitimate enterprise for a court interpreting a 5 statute. 6 What I'm saying is that the text of the 7 statute bears two -- permissibly bears two possible 8 meanings. That being the case, it is a legitimate 9 enterprise for the Court to say which makes sense, which 10 is it most likely that Congress would have intended in 11 this particular context?    Since it is a law dictionary, presumably it ought to have taken into 30   ￼ 1   account the cases you're referring to, many of which use 2   the word in -- in this sense, right?    So, if there is no legislative history, there's no legislative history on the other side either, right?  Saying that we -- we mean this to include translation.    So, absent legislative history, I guess we have to rely on the words of the statute, right? (Laughter.)
10-1491 +++$+++     This is more specific than 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   important to this case as well.  It said that while the 19   Alien Tort Statute identifies who the plaintiff must 20   be -- the plaintiff must be an alien -- it does not 21   identify who the defendant may be, and that if there are 22   limitations on who the defendant may be from other 23   sources of law, and foreign sovereign immunity would be 24   one of them, then the suit could not go forward against 25   the foreign sovereign. that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if indeed this statute provided for it.    Yes.    But it -- I didn't 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   foreign sovereign.  To the contrary --    Why doesn't the corporate thing go precisely to the same question?

10-174 +++$+++    Mr. Keisler, what -- what good does it do you to have this Court say that there is no Article III standing? The suit will just be brought in State court -­   -- under State common law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not ours.   They only need one.   We're not sure about that, are we?

Of course 24  - Subject to Final Review 1 reduction in the transportation sector was sufficient. 2 If I could take the Mr. -- the Chief 3 Justice's invitation to address displacement at this 4 time. We believe that we meet the State's own test for 5 displacement, which is found at page 46 of their brief, 6 which is: "A Federal common law nuisance claim is 7 displaced when a Federal statute or regulatory action 8 addresses the nuisance." And here you have not just the 9 Clean Air Act, you have the Clean Air Act plus, a 10 cascade of a number of different actions taken after, 11 Justice Scalia, the opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA.

Okay.    The question is, has it 14   circumstances adjudicating title.  I think the Court has 15   to think about what the world would look like if the 16   Court adopted PPL and the United States' views.    And you say while all this was going on, well, of course, everybody knew that  41 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Montana owned this land. And now they come back, what, a hundred years later, and they not only want to get the land back, they want to tax them for their use of it over -- over all these hundred years.    That's extraordinary.    Well, there you are.  And you think the United States is going to keep off these 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   land patent, or the like.  And there are -- certainly 24   are plenty of those.  But I think what's clear is --    But you think they're wrong, right?    Right.    Well, then your argument doesn't carry much weight.    Well, you have sovereignty over the land owned, owned by other private persons.

I mean, do we have to go through --    -- each little provision of the statute and say this is in, this is out, this is in, this is out?    Can't we just either affirm or reverse the particular preliminary injunction that was -- that was issued here?
10-235 +++$+++    Your client is entitled to have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right? That's what you're arguing?   Juries disregard instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause.

And that's one of the things that causes us to be suspicious of whether there's a constitutional violation --    -- because there really isn't any perfect remedy.

And it's a considerable question whether the 2 vote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the 3 first -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting 4 speech or something else, whether it's speech.

I mean, if -- if the Speaker of the House counts the votes wrong and he says the ayes have it when it's obvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that?

I mean, in one  ￼ 1   case, it's the loss to the victim or victims.  Why -- 2   why did it use parallel language?  Why -- or why did it 3   say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the 4   loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i) 5   involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section 6   7201 of Title 26?  I mean, if -- if you read it, it 7   seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with 8   revenue loss to the government. 9               And I find it hard to regard the government 10   as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the 11 truth.

10-708 +++$+++     Well, but --    -- let's assume that a trustee acts on its own interest and sells property, but let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property, so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of 10 11 12 13   that belonged to the beneficiary.  In the cases 14   that are -- in the ordinary case, then, the beneficiary 15   has the option to say I'd like to unwind that or get the 16   benefit that the trustee got, if there was self-dealing. 17   But in a circumstance where a trustee sells, for    Could Congress decree that the agent in this case shall be an agent of the purchaser rather than an agent of the title insurance 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17   there was some way in which that violation caused an 18   injury-in-fact.  So, for example -- first of all, to the trust relationship between the purchaser here and the person selecting the title insurance company?    And if it did, would the violation of that trust relationship constitute injury for -- for Article III purposes?    We don't require injury-in-fact for most breaches of trust, do we?    Somehow the situation 19   even -- I don't see any of the common law cases 20   involving trusts, trustees, as involving recoveries or 21   suits in the absence of what this Court would certainly 22   consider to be an injury-in-fact, that is to say some 23   harm to a concrete interest that exists apart from the 24   statutory duty or the common law duty.    We have a different -- we have a different case then.    But they didn't do that, did they?    And it's not an agency relation here, either.    It's a customer going to somebody who is an independent contractor. 10 11 12   across the board, and that is:  Don't take kickbacks    More than agents and 19   relationship nor a trust relationship, and yet this kind 20   of a right to sue without showing damage exists?  What's 21   the -- what's your best shot?    And you don't want to have to prove that, because if you proved any damage, there goes your class action -- 10 11 12 13   commonality.    -- because you don't have 17   kickback that interferes with your obtaining the best 18   deal possible, that itself was actionable without 19   proving any further --    It seems to me purely -- I don't know -- philosophical.    The -- the vague notion of -- of buying it from -- from -- I don't know, a white    Not yours and his? (Laughter.)
10-779 +++$+++    So what the Chief Justice suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them from using it in order to market their drugs?   That's right.   Well, that's right, but that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the marketing of drugs. You're -- you're placing that impediment on it. Isn't that the obvious purpose of it? I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but let's not quibble over what the purpose is.   That's the purpose. That's the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this information to market their drugs.   So the only thing it physician, the physician who prescribes, is ￼15 people have, approach him in order to market their 16 drugs? That's basically all it assures the prescribing 17 physician, right?   The information necessary for effective speech is what you're saying, right?   It only restricts the information necessary for really effective speech?   But it doesn't protect his privacy. I mean, the -- his name and -- and the extent of his prescriptions can be given away for a lot of uses. It doesn't protect his privacy.   It protect -- it enables him to protect himself against drug companies that want to talk to him.   All right, so long as I know that's what you're talking about. When you say "privacy," you don't mean the prescriber's concern that people will know that he prescribed certain drugs. He doesn't care about that, right.   It's not protected by this   -- if the drug company approaches him without having this information.   All right.   Can the State enact a law that, say, petition signers cannot approach somebody unless he has given his prior consent?
10-788 +++$+++     I don't understand.    Yes.

10-895 +++$+++     How do you decide whether it's a jurisdictional bar?  You acknowledge that the issuance by a judge of a certificate of appealability is a jurisdictional step; right?    That is jurisdictional.  If he doesn't do that, there's no jurisdiction.    Okay.  So -- so, the issue is whether (c)(3), which says the certificate of appealability "shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required," whether that provision is a requirement for the validity of the certificate of appealability.  If it is, then there's no jurisdiction, because the certificate of appealability 5   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 is invalid.     Isn't that right?    Well, let's take the Fourth Amendment, I mean, which says, "no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause."  Okay?  So -- but then it goes on, "supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized."  Is the warrant valid if indeed it does not meet those requirements of being supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the --    It won't be valid.  It will just be invalid.    Ms. Millett --    -- it seems to me you beg the question when you say that the issue is whether the appeal will go forward.  That's precisely what -- what the issue is here, whether it is that the appeal will go forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will go forward.  That's exactly what we're talking about.    And it seems that the structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward 10   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 on a particular issue, and not in -- not in general on -- on who knows how many issues.    It says it doesn't come forward -- doesn't come forward unless there is a certificate of appealability.    And then it says the certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.    I mean, I read that as saying you -- we're going to have an appeal but just an appeal on the issue that's identified.    Well, but --    You've done everything humanly possible, and just because of the mistake of a -- of a district judge, it can't go forward.  But that 10               What if the district judge does -- makes a 11   mistake and -- and he thinks that there has not been a 12   substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 13   right?  He makes a mistake about that.  What happens?    So, I think you're -- you're exaggerating the consequence of what the State is urging us to hold here.    Right.  The State wouldn't go into that.  They're -- 10 11 12 13 14   merits. 15    To the petition for cert?    Why isn't it in your brief?  ￼ 1                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT    Mr. Mitchell, do you think the court of appeals could do it nunc pro tunc without -- without first making the determination that the trial judge was supposed to have made?    But he would have to make the determination required by (c)(1), no?    Yes.  And --    And that wouldn't necessarily point him just to the Speedy Trial Act. He'd have to see what other constitutional claims are in the case, right?

"Could provide" means might 20  1   the state court record, then there is no role for the 2   prisoner to play. 3               And it would be an abuse of discretion for 4   the district court to stay the proceedings in an effort 5   to bring him back.    Excuse me.  If the client is incompetent, you -- you bring both claims, right? You -- you both -- you both challenge the guilt, and you challenge the sentence.    So why -- why -- why is it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so that the client can tell you not to bring one of those things?  I don't know why that's unfair.

I -- I didn't deny that it's the judgment. What reason could there be for that judgment?   I give you a reason.   The reason -- the reason they left it out is that they don't think those torts would be committed in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.   Mr. Yang, the United States didn't take this position below, right?   This is a change of heart. How long ago was it that the United States took the opposite position, the position argued by amicus here?   You -- you support the government's position on who's an officer, right? So it wouldn't include EPA. Is that --   Is thatayesorano? MR. PAOLELLA Justice Scalia, let me return to your earlier point about inferring congressional intent from, 56   1 for example, from the list of enumerated torts. And I 2 think it's important to keep in mind that the best 3 evidence of Congress's intent is the text of the 4 statute. And the fundamental problem with amicus's 5 position is that he very ably uses tools for construing 6 ambiguous statutes to construe a statute that at its 7 core is not ambiguous, it's precise and it's definite. 8 Now, the coverage that is created by the 9 literal words of the statute may be debatable as a 10 policy matter. Maybe it makes sense to include 11 correctional officers, maybe it doesn't. But it's not 12 absurd. And this Court's rule is when you were 13 construing a non-ambiguous statute, Congress gets to 14 draw that policy line, not the Court, as long as the 15 result is not absurd. 16 And we would argue that Congress drew that 17 policy line here. It very specifically provided that 18 any claim based on enumerated tort by a federal law 19 enforcement officer acting within the scope of his or 20 her employment, is where it drew that line, that's what 21 the statute literally says. There is no argument about 22 that. And I think that all of the results, the parade 23 of horribles that amicus has raised, again, may be 24 debatable as a policy matter, but not one of them is an 25 absurd exercise of Congress's responsibility. And as a 57 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 result, we would urge the Court to reverse.

There's -- there's automatically a settlement. Now, one way of -- of certifying the class is to show, well, you know, it's an efficient market, and you can presume that everybody in the class relied on the market.  But that's only true if -- if the -- the statement was material to the market.  If it was immaterial to the market, that isn't true.  And you should not proceed any further, and you should not begin this -- this class action which, in -- in most cases, is simply the preliminary to a settlement.  There is a good reason for deciding it sooner.

Is it the case that there is 25 10 11 12 13     law. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6     rule? 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Is that -- is that the    I mean, any -- any Federal statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not come within this "arising under" rule?    Do you have a case for that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal question as to which this Court would be the -- you know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come within "arising under" jurisdiction? Have you got a case for that.    They knew -- they knew these were controverted issues.  You say that they -- they are controverted issues.  So they would have been alerted to a problem anyway.  And they certainly would not accept a State court determination as authoritative resolution of that problem.    The patent attorneys.  I mean, you --    So you are talking about a case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court?    Well, then I repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do and which of those don't?     Well, my -- my experience is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast as they can.
11-1160 +++$+++    Do you have --   Do you have any cases in we slice it that fine --   -- that for some anticompetitive  1 because it -- because the State -- the power to price 2 services subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor 11 State actor 12 for others? 13 14 Justice Scalia. I think -- I think the best -- the best 15 example comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. So, 16 in that case, the -- the issue was a challenge to a   I assume -- I assume that the normal corporate charter contains such a provision, the authority to acquire property, right?   And we don't -- that -- that charter is issued by the State, right?   And we don't -- we don't think that that enables all corporations to ignore the Sherman Act, do we?
11-1175 +++$+++   17  1 just saying "and costs" here, just to make clear that 2 not only fees would be available, but also costs. And I 3 think that's an implausible hypothesis of what Congress 4 was trying do for the following reason: A 5 congressperson who is concerned that a reference to fees 6 alone in the second sentence of Section 1692k(a)(3) 7 would preclude application of the default rule in -- in 8 Rule 54(d), couldn't possibly have thought that the way 9 to make clear that Rule 54(d) applies in full was to add 10 the words "and costs" in a sentence that's expressly --   Suppose -- suppose the words "and costs" were left out in the second sentence? Would not the argument be made that you cannot award costs even in an action brought in bad faith? Wouldn't -- that this sum argument you're making --   But you're saying "negative implication." If it -- if it says only "attorney's fees in reasonable relation to the work expended," the implication would be you --   -- you cannot -- you cannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award costs. Wouldn't that be the reading of it?   Yes, but I'm suggesting if that argument is rejected, so should yours be. 51  ￼ 
11-1221 +++$+++     Why did it make an exception then only for divorce decrees?  it please the Court: Congress intentionally designed FEGLIA so 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 divorce. 21 that the Federal interest ends once the insurance proceeds are paid out.  FEGLIA was established to enable Federal employees to carry out their responsibilities to their families. And Congress knew that some of its employees would get divorced, and it was depending upon State laws to help make sure that these family duties and obligations were carried out because Congress doesn't want to get into the -- the business of regulating the    I mean, there is an express exception in the statute that the beneficiary can be 3  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 changed by a decree of divorce.    Now, why would Congress say that while at the same time believing that the beneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree of divorce?    In your experience, a man usually has more children or children in his second marriage than he did in his first?    I keep -- I keep coming back to the explicit divorce provision, which says when 18   ￼ 1 there's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it, 2 without a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new 3 wife, okay. And you're telling us that even without a 4 divorce decree, the new wife will effectively get the 5 money so long as there is a State law 6 all proceeds from insurance companies 7 entered into before the -- before the 8 was divorced will go to the new wife. 9 It seems to me that is such a -- such a 10 blatant frustration of the -- not just the purpose of -- 11 of the very text of the divorce provision in the law, 12 which says only if there is a decree properly filed will 13 it go to the new wife. And you're saying, well, it 14 doesn't really matter so long as there's a State law 15 which says it will go to the new wife without a -- you 16 know.

11-1274 +++$+++    Sure. But that 5 years doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff discovers the fraud, right?   No?
11-1285 +++$+++     Equitable powers to enforce the agreement?    Well, I think you can say that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them up.  I mean, that means the rule doesn't exist because it's sometimes used in a confusing way?    What's the rule?  What's the rule?  Do you acknowledge that that is the rule?    Well, but we have an agreement here, so how does -- how does that line of authority apply?    We have an agreement, which says that the insurance company gets all the money.  So you either say that that agreement can be overcome by equity, or else, you -- you say the agreement prevails. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   agreement.    But it only has the powers to enforce the agreement.    There are various equitable powers, and it can use various of them to enforce the  ￼ 1   rewriting the agreement, which is what you are using it 2 for here.    We never doubted that before.  Was it thought before that all the equitable powers did not exist under ERISA?    It seems to be self-evident that the court had all equitable powers.  That's not a 33  ￼1 obvious. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 
11-1327 +++$+++     So if -- if the judge did this on her own, that would have been okay?  And there would be Double Jeopardy attaching?    So we have to decide in each case whether the defendant was the initiating source of the error?
11-1347 +++$+++     Well, you should put it that way, then.  It doesn't -- you don't know that it makes a difference, but you don't have to know, right? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   determined. 22               The whole point of bringing a Hague 23   Convention case is to get the child in the place of 24   habitual residence, so that those courts, under their 25   own law, can decide custody. 20    Well, that's lovely, but there wasn't a stay here.  So what do you do when that procedure hasn't been followed?  That's the issue that we're presented with.    And do we even know that a stay would have been appropriate here?    So presumably, a stay would not have been appropriate.    I thought he had said the same thing, that the reason --    Well, good. 37 
11-1351 +++$+++     You're -- you're lucky they even remember the earlier statutes. (Laughter.)    It was a -- it was a different Congress.  They don't always use the same  ￼ 1   Gonzalez Act, including its nullification of the 2   intentional tort?    I mean, that's sort of rudimentary and fundamental to it.  It doesn't seem to me they would say it's patterned after it.  But -- you know, I -- I don't care. (Laughter.)    I don't think those are the key words.  I think the key words are "shall not apply." "Shall not apply."    It isn't shall be deemed 40  ￼1   inapplicable.  2 3 4 5 6 etc.    It is not a hypothetical. It says, "They shall not apply to any cause of action,"  ￼ 1   previously, he could have at least sued in State court.    It was obviously there to  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 times in its opinion.    I don't find that inconsistent with the position argued.  There -- you are talking about the statement that the sole purpose was -- was to --    I don't think it is the sole purpose, even if you -- you accept your friend's 47  ￼ 1   is to assure immunity to these doctors.  Now, in 2   assuring immunity to these doctors, we -- we are not 3   going to leave these people without any remedy, and so 4   we allowed them a remedy against the United States. 5               That's subsidiary to the sole purpose of the 6   Act.  Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to 7   help these doctors.  But, in order to do it and be fair 8   at the same time, you have to allow suit against the 9   United States.  I think you could still say the sole 10   purpose was to help the doctors.
11-139 +++$+++     No, and if it is -- according to Brand X, if it specifically addressed the question and said that there was no ambiguity.  But according to Brand X, if there's ambiguity, despite a holding of this Court, the agency can effectively overrule a holding by a regulation, right?  Isn't that what Brand X says?    It depends on what the meaning of "ambiguous" is, right?    No, I --    So, say it's unfair, but I'm not sure that the rule against -- presumption against retroactivity technically applies.
11-1425 +++$+++    But if that's the case, then why shouldn't that determination be made case by case?   Case by case, whether in fact it would have taken that long to get a warrant? And if it -- if it would have taken too long, then it's okay without a warrant. If it wouldn't have taken that long, it's bad.   Totality of the circumstances test, right?   That doesn't mean that it either, right?
11-1447 +++$+++     I think the other side says  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 that you may have such a cause of action here.    Wouldn't -- wouldn't the other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here?    But they are just saying you don't have a cause of action for a taking.     Yes, that's fine.  That -- that would enable you to challenge the denial of the permit, saying it's based upon an unconstitutional condition.  But how does it -- how does it enable you to say there's been a taking?  What has been taken?    It hasn't -- it hasn't been taken.  I mean, he turned it down.    The -- the permit was granted in Nollan and Dolan.  And -- and the condition attached to the permit, therefore, took effect; namely, that you had to dedicate this easement over your -- over your beach, whereas, as my colleague pointed out, anybody could walk back and forth, barefooted. (Laughter.)    Sliced bread's supposed to    Well, it doesn't raise Penn Central.  You keep on running away from it by saying Penn Central or Lucas.    It does not deprive the land of all value.  The land still has some value.  Penn Central is totally out of the case.    Right.    The stopping point is don't take my cash.    Your -- your answer to my question is, that's okay, it's not a taking, right?    I may have some other cause of action, but not a -- not a taking?  The government's come in and taken my money.    I'm not talking Nollan and Dolan.  I'm talking about your position that the taking of cash cannot be a taking.    Oh, I see, I see.    If they -- if they say, you have to turn over to us whatever money you have in your house, or you have to turn over to us whatever's in your bank account, that's not a taking.    What if they do it to five or six other landowners, okay?    Really?  Gee, that doesn't strike me as -- as entirely true.    You mean a tax that is imposed only on landowners, and it's -- you know, it's a tax -- $5,000 per landowner, if that were replaced by a provision that said, every -- every landowner shall contribute to the State a portion of his property worth $5,000, that --    The latter is bad, and the former's okay? 39  ￼    That surprises me. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   test. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Justification is the 41  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 protection of wetlands.  That's a justification, the protection of wetlands. There's no necessary comparison, as Nollan and Dolan requires, between the harm that would be occasioned if the permit were granted and what the State is exacting in order to mitigate. That -- that doesn't exist anywhere in -- in the analysis that you are talking about.    Now, that is a problem. (Laughter.)
11-1450 +++$+++  
11-1518 +++$+++     I don't understand.  Where does this reckless act come from?  Where do you get reckless act out of either fraud or defalcation?    Perhaps so.  Where did they get it from? (Laughter.)    That's not consistent with the original meaning of defalcation to which you were appealing.  It's pretty clear to me that the original meaning of -- is a cutting off, a failure to turn over money that was due.  So you -- are you appealing the original meaning or not? 37   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    You're saying defalcation just means breach of trust.  That's it.    And that's what made it a defalcation, no?    Well, so then you say there has to be a cutting off.  There has to be a loss, for defalcation.  Not just for -- for a debt, but also for the defalcation.    Why are you fighting that? You're going to have to prove the loss anyway.  You say there is a loss.
11-1545 +++$+++     Justice Breyer would replace that with a rule, where they like the agency to have authority, it has it, and, where they don't like it to have authority, it doesn't.  I'm not sure that's any better than --    -- a description of the Chevron --    I don't understand the question, to tell you the truth.  This matter is not left with the States.  It's going to be decided by a 44  ￼ 1   Federal instrumentality, right?  Either by the agency, 2   which says, 30 days is the rule, or by Federal courts, 3   which perhaps could issue opinions that say, 30 days is 4 the rule. 5               I mean, this -- you know, it's an 6   interesting separation of powers question within the 7   Federal government, but I don't see how it's a question 8   of whether it's the States or the Federal government 9   that's -- that's going to call the tune here.  It's 10   going to be the Federal government, isn't it?    Don't -- don't you think that the --    Don't you -- don't you think that the issue of whether unelected Federal bureaucrats should decide it or unelected Federal judges should decide it is an issue of separation of powers, rather than an issue of -- of Federal/State relations?    That's -- that's a 24   is, of course, whether that's enforced in court -- 25   enforced in court or before the agency; right? 57
11-159 +++$+++     You want us to probe their mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children  ￼ 28 1   were children of married people, that's what they must 2   have meant by "child."  I just don't think that follows 3   at all.  "Child" means child.    What's issue here -- what's at issue here is not whether children that have been 14   born through artificial insemination get benefits.  It's 15   whether children who are born after the father's death 16   get -- get benefits.    Bottom of what?  Page what?    Mr. --    -- that is connected with this other issue.
11-161 +++$+++    I think -- I think that Justice Breyer is suggesting that if you treat unconstitutionally a whole lot of people, you can get away with it. (Laughter.)   Have we ever decided an  1 he can go and he could -- he could have done two things 2 here. They could have -- and I'm using "the mayor" 3 loosely; it's actually the board of public works and the 8 equal protection case on the basis that the -- the State 9 who had violated the -- the Constitution can't afford to 10 pay for it? 11 12 13 14 15 deny equal protection?   It's just too expensive? MR. STANCIL   You don't believe in the administrative nightmare exception to the Equal Protection Clause? (Laughter.)
11-166 +++$+++    Yes.   Indubitable is indubitable. MR. NEFF 54   1 as long as --
11-182 +++$+++     Sounds like racial profiling to me.    What does this have to do with Federal immigration law?  I mean, it may have to do with -- with racial harassment, but I thought you weren't relying on that.    Are you objecting to harassing the -- the people who have no business being here?  Is that -- surely, you're -- you're not concerned about harassing them.  They have been stopped anyway, and all you're doing is calling up to see if they are illegal immigrants or not. So you must be talking about other people who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration laws.  Okay?  Citizens and -- and other people, right?    But that has nothing to do with the immigration law --    -- which is -- which is what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.    Anyway, what -- what's wrong about the states enforcing Federal law?  There is a Federal law against robbing Federal banks.  Can it be made a state crime to rob those banks?  I think it is.    But does the Attorney General come in and say, you know, we might really only want to go after the professional bank robbers?  If it's just an amateur bank robber, you know, we're -- we're going to let it go.  And the state's interfering with 51  ￼ 1   our -- with our whole scheme here because it's 2   prosecuting all these bank robbers.    I think that's an extraordinary basis for saying that the state is    -- a state law, which criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does. What they are doing here is using 1306(a) to 22   get at the status of unlawful presence.  The only people 23   who can be prosecuted under Section 3 are people who are  ￼ 1   category of people, to, essentially, use their state 2   criminal law to perform an immigration function. 3               And the immigration function is to try to -- 4   to prosecute these people.  And, by the way, you can 5   prosecute somebody, they can be put in jail for 30 days 6   here.  But, under Federal law, a violation of 1306(a) is 7   a continuing offense. 8               So the day they get out of jail for that 30 9   days, they can be arrested again.  And this can happen 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 10   over and over again.  And the point of this provision is 11   to drive unlawfully present people out of the state of 12   Arizona. 13    You said that in your brief, didn't you?    And send them back to the countries that are -- that are objecting.    So we -- we have to -- we have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico?  Is that what you're saying?    It sounded like what you were saying.
11-184 +++$+++    -- you started to say that the Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental 7   1 change?   -- in the Civil Service correct?   Why isn't that a what would otherwise be the law under all rights statutes? Why isn't that a repealer 10 by statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by 11 regulation. You think that that's -- that's an 12 effective repealer of the right to go to district court?   He (Laughter.)   Checking them off.
11-192 +++$+++     Well, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't need the Tucker Act now, would you?    Just sue under the statute.    Do you know any other statutes offhand -- I can't think of any, but maybe you know some -- in which you can get money out of the United States but don't have to go through the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit?  What other statutes are there?  And if there are none, the reason I ask the question, it becomes less and less plausible that FCRA was meant to allow suit against the Federal Government.    For money damages.    For the same reason that you have the principle of sovereign immunity.  They're -- they are perfectly willing to subject corporations to immense liability, but they are not willing to subject the Federal Government to immense liability.  That's what the doctrine of sovereign immunity is all about, isn't it?    -- shows that they had liability by the Government in mind?    I mean, why anybody -- notwithstanding any other provision, the remedies and sanctions set forth in this section shall be the only judicial remedies and sanctions for violation of this 10 11   section. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Why -- why does that bear upon whether the United States is liable or not?    I see.    They say -- they say just the opposite.  And so what I find peculiar is that there should be two causes of action for the same thing.  You can proceed either under FCRA or under the Tucker Act or both.  I mean, that's very strange to me.  It seems to me, one or the other, and it would normally be the specific governing the general. So if you say there is one under FCRA, why do we need the Tucker Act?
11-199 +++$+++     Mr. Yang, why does any of 10   this have to do with her credibility?  Did the dissent  44 ￼ 45 1               It's not contested.  And, in fact, nothing 2   that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's 3   theory would be different.  The only difference would be 4 5 6 7   been different.  When you read the short passage in the 8   context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not 9   fully transcribed.  Petitioner asked for the entire a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't take these statements for the truth of the matter. So, nothing that the jury heard would have 10   tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial, 11   which -- which was -- based on the government's showing 12   that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene, 13   he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and 14   Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there 15   when the call was made to the informant that said they 16   had the money. 17               Now, there's some dispute over whether he 18   said that, but certainly he was there when that call was 19   made because that's what triggered the raid.  All of 20   that was basically undisputed.  You've got all these 21 22 23 24   the evidence.  And I may simply be asking the same 25   question Justice Kennedy asked earlier.  But let's say calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez, 27 calls --

Now, do they look to 3   individual classroom diversity or not?  And if so, how 4   do they decide when classes are diverse?    What kind of a study?  What kind of a study?    Yes.  It doesn't explain to me how they go about, classroom by classroom, deciding how many minorities there are.    Some of the stuff that Grutter says -- some of the stuff that Grutter says you agree with, some of the stuff that it says you don't agree with.    But she -- she had to pay an admissions fee for a process in which she was not treated fairly.    Why shouldn't she get her money back?    Well, that's part of the injury she suffered.  It's -- it's not the only injury  ￼ 1   public, and I didn't want them to do it because they are 2   an amici of yours.  And you are both here, both sides, 3   so if you can agree on -- simply, roughly -- what that 4   number is, I would like to know it; otherwise, I will -- 5   I can use pre-Grutter numbers which are public and 6 available.

11-393 +++$+++     Mr. Kneedler --    -- don't you think it's unrealistic to say leave it to Congress, as though 34   ￼ 1   you're sending it back to Congress for Congress to 2   consider it dispassionately, on balance, should we have 3   this provision or should we not have provision?  That's 4   not what it's going to be.  It's going to be these 5   provisions are in effect, even though you -- a lot of 6   you never wanted them to be in effect and you only voted 7   for them because you wanted to get the heart of the -- 8   of the Act, which has now been cut out.  But, 9   nonetheless, these provisions are the law, and you have 10   to get the votes to overturn them. 11               That's an enormously different question from 12   whether you get the votes initially to put them into the 13 law. 14               What -- there is no way that this Court's 15   decision is not going to distort the congressional 16   process.  Whether we strike it all down or leave some of 17   it in place, the congressional process will never be the 18   same.  One way or another, Congress is going to have to 19   reconsider this.  And why isn't it better to have them 20   reconsider it -- what should I say -- in toto, rather 21   than having some things already in the law which you 22   have to eliminate before you can move on to consider 23   everything on balance?    Is this not totally unrealistic, that we're going to go through this enormous bill item by item and decide each one?    Mr. Kneedler, could I -- 44   ￼ 1   can you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this 2   one in which we are asked to strike down what the other 3   side says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in -- 4   as you request, leave in effect the rest of it?  Have we 5   ever -- most of our severability cases, you know, 6   involve one little aspect of the Act, and the question 7   is whether the rest.  When have we ever really struck 8   down what was the main purpose of the Act and left the 9   rest in effect?  Do you have a case for that?    There is no example.  This is really --     Is this really a case of first impression?    I don't know another case where we have been confronted with this -- with this 10 decision. 11               Can you take out the heart of the Act and 12   leave everything else in place?
11-460 +++$+++     So -- so -- so what follows from that; that the district is liable because it's a lousy permit?    I do not see how this 28   ￼ 1     court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to 2     be able to do anything different, other than say there's 3     no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another 4     fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is 5     something I worry about.    They have -- they have not    So you're going to impose a 11     shared thing?  I see no way for the court of appeals to 12     do this in -- in a fashion that will not bring the case 13     right back here, and you'll be asking us to send it back 14     to the same panel.    But that is not our ordinary practice, when -- when nothing can happen on remand, except -- except to give judgment for the Petitioners here.    What's the third section, Mr. Colangelo?  I'm waiting breathlessly for your third section.  You said there were three. (Laughter.)    I've got 195.  I've got 98. 40   ￼ 1     Where is the third one?    109. 2 3     109. 4 5 6 7 8 9    I don't have your supplemental brief in front of me.    Well -- but -- but that -- that's just to say you can rely on -- on the extant 10 11 12     monitors.    You -- you told this to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit said no?    Finish that.  So what's the consequence of that?    Therefore, each one of them is liable for all of it?    But they haven't done so. So what?    What if this panel found – found for you on the ground that they used, they will surely find for you on this other ground, which -- (Laughter.)    -- which has at least an inkling of plausibility.

That's a clear 4 line.

I think you cannot enter the protected portion of a home, which is called the curtilage, with the intention of conducting a search, that that is not permitted.  I think our cases establish that.    And it's fine to say -- I don't think it's true that the intent of the officer is never relevant.  It is relevant in that context. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   search.

So you could say, just -- just as here, that there's only been a temporary taking of some of the land behind the reservoir. Now, doesn't the -- doesn't the Government condemn all the land --    -- even that which would be only temporarily flooded?    Of course, that can't overrule the Takings Clause, can it?    I mean, that's nice that Congress doesn't want to be liable. (Laughter.)    I mean, the issue is who is going to pay for that wonderful benefit to these farmers.  Should it be everybody, so that the Government pays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it be this -- this particular sorry landowner who happens to lose all his trees?    That doesn't seem to me particularly fair.    I don't think -- one of those risks has to be the Government's going to make you pay for protecting somebody else. Is that one of the risks?    I doubt that.    Yes, but he loses because the Corps comes in and says, yes, indeed, we did flood 2, but, in order to save, you know, 1 and 3 through 10. Right?  And -- and he'd lose.    Okay.  It's not arbitrary.

11-713 +++$+++     What would happen?  You can't use the old plan.  You have this absolute rule against using the new plan.  What happens?  You disenfranchise every voter in Texas --    -- because there may be some voters in Texas, may be, some who will be prejudiced by using the current plan?  I suggest in that situation there's nothing to do but use the Texas plan.    All right.    One of -- one of the basic rules that -- that was followed in drawing up the court plan was not to divide any voting districts, right?    Why?  Why did the -- that certainly is not a principle that the Texas legislature agrees with. One is --    Go back from June 26th. Where does -- where does that leave us?    June, May, April.  It's the end of March.  Right?    And when do you expect the D.C. court to finish?
11-770 +++$+++     I assume they always do. It seems to me there's no special threat from the person who -- who left the house.  There's always a threat of somebody else coming into the house.    As soon as reasonably practicable.  You consider that an absolute test?  I thought that the test we invented here was meant to help 38  ￼ 1   officers, to say this is the rule and you can do it. 2   And you want to do anything else, use Terry or use -- 3   use normal probable cause principles, but this is an 4   absolute rule governing the -- the search of a home.    So what?  What's he going to -- he's going to phone them and say, hey, you know, you're going to be searched.  The cops are crawling all around the house already. So the only realistic additional threat is that he is going to voluntarily go back to where the police are in the house?  I mean, you know --    -- this is so implausible. What -- what harm --    -- what threat to the policemen can possibly exist?
11-796 +++$+++     Sure, sure, I understand.
11-798 +++$+++     What exception are you appealing to from the -- from the preemption provision?

That's why it's a hypothetical. 19 20 21 22   and let me give you the difference, Justice Scalia.  And 23   that is in this particular case we are dealing with a 24   business, a commercial enterprise.

Counsel can bring that up.  Counsel can bring that up at the hearing before the judge.  But -- but I understood this to be a -- a requirement.  You never even get to that hearing, because there's no evidence that this dog was ever trained with this policeman.    Yes, and therefore end of case, right?    Well --    What -- what -- what are the -- what are the incentives here?  Why would a police department want to use an incompetent dog?  Is that any more likely than that a medical school would want to certify an incompetent doctor?  What -- what incentive is there for a police department?    And that's a good thing?    I mean, you acquire probable cause, you go in and there's nothing there. You've wasted the time of your police officers, you've wasted a lot of time.    Oh, I assure you that if we agree with you there will be a whole body of experts that will spring into being about dog training.  I assure you that that will be the case.    But at least we don't have to worry about mothballs in this case; is that right? There are no mothballs? (Laughter.)
11-820 +++$+++     What's -- what's the sense of that?  Why -- why -- let's assume, you know, at the time the guilty plea or whatever occurred, it was not the professional norm, and then later the professional norms change and he makes the argument that -- that he's entitled to relief, and you say yes, because --    Is that what your opponent contends as well?

It's -- it is unreliable because it is inadequately probative.

And as it turns out, only one of those was found to -- to be in the game.   That was the basis for the   It was not the basis? His was based only on the one that the court accepted? Where -- where in the record is -- is that?   You can't be agnostic about what the anticompetitive conduct is, if you are going to do -- if you're going to do an analysis of what are the consequences of the -- of the anticompetitive conduct, you have to know the anticompetitive conduct you are talking about.   So the trial judge could have a Daubert motion, but -- but I'm going 19 see whether 20 21 what you're 22 do. Everybody knows that district judges have broad 23 discretion in a lot of different things that they do. 24 You just made it this much bigger as a result of saying, 25 we're not even going to bother with the Daubert thing, this evidence is reliable.

12-123 +++$+++     I'm really -- I'm really 9 10   confused.  You are saying there ought to be a remand 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 here because the question is not jurisdictional, which is just what your friend says, right?    So the two of you are in agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong, we can review that.    That may well be, but --    -- you don't have to pay the penalty if you give us the raisins.    You mean they -- Is that right, they have to give the raisins?    And you -- you think that's 18   unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the 19   government takes the raisins and every year, the grower 20   goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for 21   the raisins.  Is that the program that Congress 22   anticipated? 23 24 25    I don't think it's close at ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 40 1 all. That's a crazy statute. Every year we're going to 2   take raisins and every year we're going to pay you in 3   the Court of Claims.  What's the purpose of that?    That's -- that's a merits Page 47 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 48 1 that point they could have sought compensation for the 2   past 6 years of raisins that they had provided.  They 3   didn't do it. 4               I don't understand why they didn't do it. 5   They left that claim on the table.  And to the extent 6   they wanted to claim going forward, they could have 7   continued to use compliant handlers and sued every month 8   for compensation in the Court of Claims.    Yes, I suppose a bailee could, a bailee of the car.

12-133 +++$+++    I guess you could have said the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 existed, right?   Before there was such as thing as class actions.   The same thing would have been true. If, indeed, your claim was so small that you can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical matter, don't bring the suit.   I suppose that American Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at all, right? They could have just said -- you know, you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court, right? They could say that, legally, couldn't they?   And until Rule 23 was adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small claim, tough luck, right? De minimis non curate lex. If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to bring a Federal claim. And that would not violate the Sherman Act, would it?   I'd like to hear the answer, if nobody -- (Laughter.)
12-135 +++$+++    You're -- you're saying that this is off the wall. That's your -- to put it in -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?   So you're saying -- you're saying that the -- that the deference which we give to arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact, right?   Do you have other examples from other -- other review that we've given to   I mean, I -- I don't want to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but if -- if you're telling me this is just a general principle, that at some point if it's too much off the 9  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can reverse it. What -- what other examples do -- do we have?   No, I want a case.   I want a case where we have, or where Federal courts have with our approval, disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator because the factual finding was too much off the wall. That there was simply not enough basis to support it.   I don't understand. There is a distinction between all disputes and all actions relating to the dispute?   The top of page 6?   But that's not enough. As stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a plausible construction. It's not enough that he said, I'm construing the contract. I have looked at the terms of the contract and what the parties' said, and my construction of the contract is X. That's not enough. It has to be plausible.   Now, why is this plausible? MR. KATZ Justice Scalia, I don't think plausibility comes into play.   What's a magic 8-ball?

Has it always been unconstitutional?    That -- that's not when it became unconstitutional.  That's when they acted in an unconstitutional matter -- in an unconstitutional manner.  When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit gays from marrying?    I'm not talking about the California Supreme Court.  I'm talking about your argument.  You say it is now unconstitutional.    It's an easy question, I think, for that one.  At -- at the time that the -- the Equal Protection Clause was adopted.  That's absolutely  ￼    Well, how am I supposed to decide a case, then --   -- if you can't give me a before Court  ￼ 1 case -- your case would be different if Proposition 8 2 was enacted into law prior to the California Supreme 3 Court decision?    Okay.  So I want to know has been unconstitutional in those --    It's too late for that, too late for that now, isn't it?  I mean, we granted cert. I mean, that's essentially asking -- you know, why did we grant cert.  We should let it percolate for another -- you know, we -- we have crossed that river, I  ￼ 1 least eight States. 2 It's impossible to limit these -- these 3 propositions to any particular jurisdiction, so this 4 Court would be making a very real decision with respect 5 to same-sex marriage if it should simply decide to 6 dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, 7 Justice Kennedy. 8 And let's -- let's just step back and just 9 consider for a moment the Solicitor General's argument. 10 He is basically submitting to the Court that essentially 11 the one compromise that is not available to the States 12 is the one that the State of California has undertaken. 13 That is, to go as far as the people possibly can in -- 14 in honoring and recognizing the families and the 15 relationships of same-sex couples, while still 16 preserving the existence of traditional marriage as an 17 institution. That's the one thing that's off the table.

What's the closest that comes to this abstract, "the doing of my job is property"?    What -- what's the closest New York case? 33  ￼    You are -- you are contradicting what you yourself said a little bit before, which is that property means the same thing for both provisions --    But it doesn't mean the same thing for the harming because there is some property that can't be harmed.    That's all very true and an 44  ￼ 1 honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove 2 that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give 3 the right advice rather than the wrong advice.    Is what --    Was that one of the choices the jury had?    But not the obtaining of 13 14 property. 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    That's true.  Not the obtaining the property, right?    Well, for example -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 money. 24 (Laughter.)    Why -- why isn't that property?  Why?  You know, my -- my choice of marrying whom I want, why isn't that as much property as -- as my ability to -- to perform my job the way I want?    A lot of people marry for  ￼ 1 that one. 2 I think -- so let's take the Scheidler case 3 for an example. There were different types of property 4 that were initially alleged in that case. One of them 5 was the right of women to access the services of the 6 clinics. 7 This Court -- this Court distinguished that 8 from the other alleged property interests, which were 9 the running of the business that was the clinic. And 10 the Court said that the right of women to access the 11 services of the clinics was really more of a liberty 12 interest and the running of a business was really more 13 of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't 14 have to decide that, but it said that's really more in 15 the nature of property. That was the property 16 right alleged.

They had a very broad phrase, "to prevent the break up of an Indian family."  And this guy is -- is the father of the child --    -- and they're taking the child away from him even though he wants it.    And that -- that is not the breakup of -- of an Indian family?

You're going to hang a lot of -- a lot of other 9   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ornaments on that phrase?    I mean, it seems to me he's the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the -- that's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and the kid.    He's the father.  He's the 10 11 father. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25     This isn't State law.  This is a Federal statute which uses an expansive phrase, "the breakup of the Indian family."

And isn't one of the conditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not of voluntary membership?    I'm quite sure that's right.  So I think the hypothetical is -- is a null set. I don't think it ever exists.    Well, that -- that was after she had rejected his offer to marry her, no?    It says that, doesn't it? 52   ￼1 A parent is 2 3 4 -- is the -- the biological parent.    That's what it says.    Wait.  I didn't understand. Citizenship, who has acknowledged citizenship?    It didn't say that.  It -- its definition of --

If they knew that, why did they have a separate section on  ￼    No, I really don't understand -- I didn't understand the law to be that. 31  ￼were saying.  I question asked. MR. that -- and you thought that's what Justice Alito's  1 You mean if -- if an employee files a discrimination 2 claim, and then is fired -- let's assume there is no 3 other reason, except retaliation; he's fired for filing 4 that claim -- he has to prove not only that he was fired 5 in retaliation for filing, but also that his claim was 6 valid? 7 8 9 Is that what you are saying the law is?    I thought that's what you    Sir, the statute says what it says.  It doesn't matter when Congress put it in there.  The statute has to be read as a whole.  And, if you read it as a whole, this provision clearly separates out retaliation from race discrimination.    Period.  I mean, it doesn't -- I don't have to psychoanalyze Congress and say did they really mean it, blah, blah, blah.  It's there in the statute.  They didn't take it out.  The 38  ￼ 1 statute still makes a clear distinction between the two.    I mean, the issue is whether this statute does it or not.  The fact that nobody has ever done it before, what difference does that make?

Or -- is that correct? wouldn't the supreme court have done that if thought that at least -- at least it was    -- what you say it was.    And it -- there was an  1 the two in Michigan. Had diminished capacity not been a 2 recognized defense, the court's order, I respectfully 3 submit, would have been worded just with respect to 4 insanity. There would have been no legal basis for 5 arguing -- or, excuse me, for including the -- the 6 reference to diminished capacity.    And, once the court of appeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with that error, could -- could the defendant be retried?    Because he's -- he's convicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's --    That's right.  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Could he be retried?    Well, then -- then you would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor.    But he could get an -- an interlocutory appeal on that?    Okay.    Was that -- how often was it mentioned in intermediate court opinions? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 case.     Four mentions in the supreme court that say what?  That are inconclusive --    Yeah.    It doesn't mean it's right.    You have to show it's 10 right. 11    That it's the law.
