What does a holistic reading mean?  Can you stay within the --    -- text and still be holistic?    So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?    Well, let -- let me ask --    -- ask you this.  The -- the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.    Right, and that's not --    I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first.  How -- how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language?  If the -- if your clients can take the money -- just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?    So you say that payment doesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.    Well, I -- I think the logical reading is that it -- it modifies payment.    Yes, but -- but there still is a right to take payments at any time.    So -- so then you're -- you're --    Under that, you're giving the -- the language that follows it no meaning.    But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.

03-1488 +++$+++     Well -- well, your -- your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.

The 3 question is, is there anything he can get from the courts 4 other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.    Well, it -- it seems to me really avoids the problem -- the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. true that there is no -- there is no legal ￼1 there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue 2 a damage judgment. There are many instances in which 3 damage judgments can't be collected. 4   Well -- well, there really -- there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we 10  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this 2 argument. We have other questions to discuss.    -- that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?    Add to Justice Stevens' -- add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.    You're saying -- you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.    So I'm -- my question is, is constitutional to prohibit this conduct?   That's --   -- that's not the question. JUSTICE STEVENS proposition?

It's an opportunity to elaborate reasons.  It's a safeguard.  It's not a deterrent.  And you're saying it has to be a deterrent. And as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that there's -- there's another voice in that -- in that administrative hearing room.  They're terrified of damages.    And it's going to skew the decisions.

03-1693 +++$+++    Are you saying that the neutral or that the purpose doesn't 1 made a mistake. But what they have now is the 2 foundation is display and as the District Court 3 recognized, it is fundamentally different than any 4 previous display. 5 Like this Court's decision in the Sunday 6 law cases, even though it may have started off for a 7 religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to 8 be retained for secular reasons. 11 purpose is 12 matter? 13 14 case, the purpose is about the display of law.

I don't have it right at my fingerprints -- fingertips -- only about 200,000 processing incidents a year, 200,000 people a year to be processed.  I take it that includes some people that are being transferred?    Suppose you have a population in which 50 percent of all the members of a particular race are a member of a -- of a gang, a gang such as we've read about in -- in the record, Bloods, Crips, et cetera. 50 percent are members of the gang.  Would that allow you to segregate?    Is -- is that because you don't equate race gangs with race animosity?    And -- because it does seem to me that part of your submission, or at least an inference that I drew, was that race-based gangs do not constitute race-based threats.  Am I right in saying that that's your submission?   You mean the inference that 12  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 the -- which inference? That they are or are not a 2 threat?    So -- so as to one-half of the that -- in that instance, you don't know what inmate's record is.

Well, they -- of course, they say that this covers it, and it seems to me that really the -- that turns on the definition of "property" --    -- which is an arguable point.

Well, he -- he did or he didn't, but there was no money there.  There was nothing there.   Well, but doesn't -- doesn't that indicate --    -- something basically flawed about your whole theory?   This is not income in any -- in any real sense.    I'm asking you about the tax consequences.    Well, but I -- I thought under your view the moment the client gets the check for the full amount, one-third of it is taxable to the attorney. And I have some problems, incidentally, with respect to tax years if it -- if you -- if the client receives the check December 30 and is on vacation and doesn't get around to remitting to the attorney until January 5th, I'm -- I'm not quite sure how your theory works, but --    But on the absconding theory, how -- how is it handled from a tax standpoint?   Your client, in effect, earned the money by having this -- undergo this -- this discrimination. That -- that's --    This is not the plumber hypothetical, which is I think quite misleading.  No.  No, I don't think that even the Government will defend that.
03-923 +++$+++     You -- you answered one of the earlier questions about the possible intrusiveness of dogs everywhere by saying, well, you don't have a privacy interest in contraband, but that's never true.  You don't have a privacy interest in the murder victim's body, but you still have to have a warrant to go in and get it.  So that -- that just doesn't work unless I missed something.    Yes, but you have a privacy interest in your person and in your place, and that's what we're talking about.  So that seems to me that that just doesn't help us.    But that's because of the the place being searched not because of the what you're searching for.    So it just can't be that -- so    -- how his Kyllo case might have been written?

I -- I thought this -- this was something you'd say, well, of course.
03-932 +++$+++    Well, I mean, I -- I assume you say that the trial judge and -- and defense counsel and -- and the trial court would have had real problems with this opinion. What -- what were those problems --    -- insofar as the measure of loss is concerned?    Well, I -- I thought that Judge Sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before any loss was incurred, even if there's been a misrepresentation, recovery should be denied.

We're -- if you want us just to say, well, this case is too much, but then the Corps of Engineers should use its expertise to come up with a new regulation, that's rather an odd opinion for us to write.    And it seems to me that that's what you're asking us to do here.

Is 4 any weight at all, there a middle Washington, DC 20005 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- ￼1 ground that there -- which I think would allow you to 2 prevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is 3 a compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule 4 1? It's a rebuttable presumption, but it's a presumption 5 that, when it's in Schedule 1, it's a compelling interest.   I want you --
04-1131 +++$+++     Was it raised?  Was that objection, the jurisdictional question, raised in the briefs and --    But the grievance procedure covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that when you go to the grievance procedure, you’re not necessarily entitled to findings and -- and written 21 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 conclusions, et cetera.  But there’s a reason for that. The reason for that is that these things can be very, very minor.  So now you’re saying that just because of -- the grievance procedure doesn’t entitle you necessarily to findings, et cetera, that you can go into court.  But the only reason you don’t get those findings is because we know, going in, that they’re so minor.  So now the most minor things go to court.  That seems very anomalous.

And so for members --    -- for medical schools, we can't get medical schools for our Armed Forces -- chaplains, the same way, because it -- schoolteachers who teach on military bases -- in order to make the point.    And that's --    -- that's all for an expressive reason.    What's happening here is the perspective employers, the recruiters, are proposing a commercial transaction.  And it seems to me quite a simple matter for the law schools to have a disclaimer on all of their e-mails and advertisements that say, "The law school does not approve -- and, in fact, disapproves -- of the policies of some of the employers who you will meet."    That's the end of it.    Do law schools have an interest in the Constitution that other people don't?    All right.  Well, I --    -- I suppose, under your view, law schools really shouldn't permit firms -- law firms on campus if those firms, say, oppose -- take litigation positions opposing gay marriage.    That's --    That's your position.  Your position is, the schools could, and probably should, do that to make their message known.

Arizona, and this Court 6 rejected that very argument in that case. As you may 7 recall, the Arizona law was that there was a 8 responsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that 9 mitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to 10 call for leniency. The Arizona Supreme Court had 11 decided that that meant that the mitigating factors 12 must outweigh the aggravating factors. 13 And this Court accepted that case because of 14 a conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the 15 Kansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that 16 that was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth 17 amendment. 18 This Court resolved that conflict, and in 19 fact, States relied on that resolution, as did the 20 Kansas 21 except 22 State. 23 24 burden 25 legislature, in articulating the very standard Kansas goes further and keeps the burden on the

It looks like Dystar was decided by the Federal Circuit after it decided this case, didn't it?    I mean, you have to be defending what the Federal Circuit did in this case. And the fact that they say well now, what this means is really in some other case, that seems to me that's really irrelevant. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   that you have to distinguish two things rightly.  The 18   first is the state of the law as it exists now, and 19   that's what we ask you to affirm.

How can they do that with party?  I mean, the -- and the reason -- the 7 question. 8 Suppose there's a settlement and you don't 9 get, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical 10 specialists, plus general damages, and you're -- you're 11 unsatisfied. Don't you still have the right under 12 Arkansas law -- or do you -- to pursue the tortfeasor 13 for the balance that's owed to you?    Let me this question so far as the rights the assignor.  Suppose it's a very litigant says I want to settle for -- let me ask you of the assignee and weak case and the 20 cents on the dollar.  Are you saying that there's some kind of duty to notify the State and -- and to consult with the State before this is done?    Okay.  Suppose the -- the State says, well, we -- we don't -- we don't agree with you.  Then -- then what happens?  Then they're at loggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position I suppose.

Do you still think you have the right to receive 100 percent of your payment from the proceeds in the case that I put?    Assume that it's a very weak case.  They settle for 20 cents on the dollar.  Do you have the right, as you understand the law, to insist that you receive 100 percent of your payments from the gross settlement?    The answer is yes, I take    The answer is yes, I take it.

And -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of 9 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 that, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion 2 that we can reach. And you tend to fight this in your 3 brief to say that this doesn't happen. I tend to doubt 4 that. I tend to think money does buy access. What -- 5 if -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would 6 follow?    Well, suppose three legislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal corruption, actually taking no wink-wink, nod-nod, a specific agreement to vote for money.  So what?  Does that change your case?    Suppose -- suppose that had been demonstrated in -- in a particular State.  Does that mean, in your view, that a State can have strict contribution limits and support?   No. It's true. It's -- 17 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 it's done. There have been criminal convictions.    Well -- well, if -- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to from the proposition that the case I put 10 -- if you 11 back away 12 would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for 13 legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the 14 State has the power to prevent this from happening to 15 begin with.

Well, but --   -- the initial question Justice O'Connor asked is, Do we consider these other factors?  And then -- but you're talking now about curing.   Well, but it --   -- it has to be --   -- voluntary at some -- if you 9 10 held the man's hand to a burning iron, we would -- we'd say 11 that's not voluntary.    Well, but I -- you can't initiate something involuntarily and have that count, can you?  You say --    -- let's say involuntarily, in the lay sense of the word, in the common sense of the word, where it was actually physically coerced.  That wouldn't count.   All right.   No, no, it's the --   How --   The first part of the analysis is whether or not he initiates.    And you're trying to tell us that the initiation can be involuntarily?  I just don't -- I just don't agree with that.   I mean, you have to concede --   -- I think that's a given.

In fact, there was a finding that Johns' testimony was credible.   Of course, that factor --   -- can work the other way. You would be up here, saying, "Oh, he had 24 hours.  He thought he was going to get the death penalty.  He knew the other man was turning on him to implicate him in the murder.  His agony was increasing."  I mean, I -- it seems to me the question is whether or not the curative measures were adequate. 31 CHIEF JUSTICE   But --   -- that's a --   -- far stretch. It's --   The right direction would be to don't talk to us."    And the -- and the Court of Appeals of Maryland said, "We're going to look at this in the legal sense, not the dictionary sense."    And that's what we're reviewing 47  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 here.   But there is no finding to support the suggestion that it was just the death penalty that concerned him. He was also concerned, I thought, about the fact that his accomplice, Tolbert, had implicated him, and --   -- presumably implicated him -- MR. RAVENELL   -- too far. So is --   There's just no finding that it was simply the death penalty that --   And --   -- his concern with Tolbert was a wholly legitimate reason for him to want to talk to the police and -- 50  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   -- get things straightened away right away.   Well --   -- absent of good-cop/bad-cop finding, and I -- and I repeat that they've credited Johns' testimony here -- this seems to me a very odd sort of interrogation, to say, "No, no, you -- we can't talk to him now."  That's an interrogation?  That's a stretch.

04-473 +++$+++     And the same -- and the same with Connick.  So, I'm -- if you're saying that this is what the circuits have understood, fine, but that's not this -- that's why we took this case.

Are there -- are there some matters as 6 to which the employer can protect its own interests and 7 stifle the employee's speech?    But --    -- any comment that an employee makes regarding how the office is working is a matter of public concern.  I would concede that.  I mean --    -- that has to be.    And the consequence of your view is to have the first amendment being used for courts to monitor the discussions that take place in every public agency -- local, State, and Federal -- in the United States.  It's -- you are advocating a sweeping rule.

So, the Federal --    -- Federal courts supervise the constant dialogue that is the everyday routine practice in every governmental agency, local and Federal, in the United States.

The first amendment isn't 7 about policing the workplace.    So, we do this --    -- so we do this as a -- so we do this as a matter of what is sound management principles for a Government agency?  How does that relate to the first amendment?

Why doesn't have an incidence of not having any tax at all,    Well, why isn't that sovereign interest in not taxing?
04-637 +++$+++     Well, it isn't that -- isn't one of the answers to Justice Breyer's questions that you -- you never know exactly what a fact finder would do. What you have to deal with are reasonable likelihoods and reasonable possibilities.    And when -- and when you have someone who shoots the first person and is obviously attempting to kill him, and then there's an apparent discussion -- not -- not 100 percent clear that those were the two voices.  It's pretty clear because there were only two other people there.  So we talk about reasonable likelihoods, don't we?
04-698 +++$+++    In all events -- 13  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 is what ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   -- in all events, it seems to me that it's still cut against you. This is a statutory scheme where, you point out, the parents have access to some initial consultation. In most instances -- or in many instances, people who are suing an institution don't have that initial access. Here, the parents get much more initial information than most -- than most petitioners do --   -- than most -- than most complainants, than most aggrieved persons do.   Then let --   -- let me point -- let me point out something else.  Let's assume a state of affairs -- just assume that school districts -- many of them -- independently and, I think, collectively, because school districts talk to each other -- have a growing body of data and expertise about IEP.  And this is the basis on which you say that they should come forward.  It seems to me that, too, though, cuts against you, because when a 14  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 school district has expertise, I think it's entitled to a 2 presumption of governmental deregularity. And you have 3 to challenge it.   -- there hasn't been finding of any violation by the school district. The school district -- --   But I -- but I'm interested in    -- I'm interested in Justice Ginsburg's question.  Let's assume you show a violation.

Because I think that would help you.   Well, if --    Well --   -- can you give me a reason for the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10- year bar, other than for stale claims or --    I understand that, but I'm just -- I'm just saying, if you could give me an explanation, a characterization, a description, a statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale claims, I think you'd have a stronger case.  But it seems to me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back and look for other limitations period, and I find it in 1091(a).    Of course, part of the problem is that 1091(a)(2), the "notwithstanding" clause, talks also specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I take it.    I mean, if it had said "no" --    -- "no limitations period," then I might -- this specifically talks about an offset.

Did the Oregon courts take the position that, in the sentencing phase, the "deliberately" requirement must be judged just by what was in -- introduced in the guilt phase?    But I thought that --    -- you told us additional evidence on deliberation can be put in the -- in the sentencing phase.  But then you're saying that you're not going to do that.
04-944 +++$+++     I was going to ask what -- how does the waiver work?  Suppose the judge pre- verdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are less than 15 employees.  Can the plaintiff say, oh, well, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that?  They waived that.  They didn't raise it.  I mean, how does that work?    Under your theory of the case?

Here's the position that they took 20   in their brief before the court of appeals.  Three 21   decades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively 22   recognized software to be a physical and structural 23   component of patented machines.  The problem, Justice 24   Stevens -- 25    So that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the compilation is put on a disk?    That seems odd.  I mean, Microsoft doesn't say please buy our disk because it's the prettiest disk in the business.    It says buy our program because the program means something. 12  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Right.    But suppose, suppose you had a machine that makes another machine, and if you ship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for 21 22 23 24   machine tool.  The thing that was violated, the machine 25   readable object code, is precisely what is installed on it starts making another machine, the statute is not violated; and isn't that just what's happening here?    Well, is it an answer to Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no conceptual problem saying there would be liability if this happened within the territorial limits of the United States?    And so there shouldn't be a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying 44  ￼a bigger -- - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   States.

And the -- the concern that I'm worried 12   about is in the future it might be outside your field, 13   it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the 14   transmission purely of information is the transmission 15   of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see 16   in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction 17   and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create 18   other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri 19   dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that 20   detailed information abroad.  Then suddenly it's our 21   patent law and not the foreign patent law that would 22   govern.  That's why I asked for precedent.

But it is only in the context of the 13   selection of the annuity that the plan sponsor, the plan 14   administrator, must purchase after the plan sponsor has 15   made that threshold decision to terminate the plan. 16   There is that threshold decision.  And likewise, merger 17   is a threshold decision that goes to the --    So we will have to assume for that -- if you can't do it by merger, then the whole the statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a fiduciary response, correct? 10 11 12 13 14 15   fiduciary response.

At that point, 19   choices are made as to how to terminate it.  And it's 20   difficult for me to see why the interests of the 21   employees are not uppermost in -- in your duties, i.e. a 22   fiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to 23   terminate it.    Why can't you say it's a 8 9 10 12   execution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere 13   execution when it's a merger, once the determination 14   decision has been made.

An 3   evidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that 4   would never have been presented.  Given this factual 5   finding, the State court is in effect saying no matter 6   what counsel might or might not have developed, it would 7   not have been presented at sentencing because this 8   defendant specifically instructed his attorney not to 9   present any mitigating evidence.    That's the only time the district court can hold a hearing?    Yes, but it seems that if    But doesn't that assume - Subject to Final Review 1   colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what 2   consequences of foregoing counsel are.  So the judge 3   discusses with him and, you know, points out what a -- 4   what a significant decision that is.  But it doesn't 5   take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the 6   question, you know, "do you agree that your counsel 7   should not introduce any mitigating evidence?"  I mean, 12   that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is?  I 13   mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, "I 14   thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what 15   the, these two relatives were going to testify to. 16   There was really much more, if my counsel had 17   investigated."  And that's not a knowing waiver.
05-1589 +++$+++     Are we free to disregard  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   Federal statute and this is a State statute.  If the 5   State court says, we're interested in purposes, we 6   decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret 7   the statute according to the purpose as we found it, 8   aren't we bound by that?    But that's a Federal, a  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that this Court did not find it was bound by the 2   California Supreme Court's finding that the bar 3   association is a government agency, nor did it find in 4   Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it was bound by the Wisconsin 5   Supreme Court in regards to its assessment of practical 6   effects of the Wisconsin statute at issue there.    Isn't it your position that this statute is constitutional either way you interpret it?    Do you agree with the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that 2   since under your decisions the State can prohibit a 3   union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it 4   is reasonable for the State to impose a condition on 5   that collection which falls, falls far short of actually 6   prohibiting it.  We further point out that in the Hudson 7   case the Illinois statute at issue was effectively an 8   opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was 9   not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the 10   more generous Washington State statute which allows the 11   union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount 12   equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which 13   had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or 14   reduced just to reflect 760 expenses. 15               It seems to us that it is within the power 16   of the State to establish such a condition in the 17   interest of an election's integrity by means of 18   protecting the First Amendment interests of the 19   non-members, and we think the statute does that very 20   well without imposing in fact a substantial 21   administrative burden on the union in this case or 22   unions in general.  For example, the, the way that the 23   WEA or any union can comply with Section 760 would be to 24   simply place an additional form in the Hudson packet 25   they send out.  Now, recognizing that the Hudson packet 13  ￼20 simple. 21 - Subject to Final Review 1   is about this thick, that it is received by the teachers 2   in September, the busiest month of the year for 3   teachers, and that there is no form currently provided 4   in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out, 5   but rather a statement that you must send a letter to 6   the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy.  And we 7   look to the WEA PAC for instruction on what they could 8   do.  But now.  Because the WEA has chosen to form a PAC 9   and is required to solicit members and non-members if 10   they choose in order to contribute to that PAC, they do 11   a very good job of soliciting members.  They include a 12   very convenient form encouraging people to check off and 13   send their dues in to the PAC to support candidate 14   elections.  They provide no such form for the opt-out 15   process, but it would be easy for them to do so. 16               The burden imposed on them is not great 17   administratively, as they suggest, any more than the 18   burden on the other teachers unions in Abood or in 19   Hudson because it can easily be met through these 22 23 24 25 If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

One, the statute before the Court is a campaign 9   finance law that was enacted for the purpose of 10   protecting the public's interest in the integrity of the 11   electoral process.  Two, it is a content-based 12   restriction on speech, which cannot be justified by the 13   State's authority to limit agency fees in the first 14   place.  Three, the statute does not serve a compelling ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. WEST, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT    Well, I take it States have considerable discretion in determining how to protect Federal constitutional rights.    And absent some direction that we have to consider this as only being for a, for purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First Amendment constitutional rights.

And then what happened was that 20   Mr. Harris took evasive action to a avoid collision when 21   Mr. Harris -- excuse me when Officer Scott -- put 22   himself right in Mr. Harris' way.

05-416 +++$+++    Well, not 30 1 appropriate analogy here. There are a number of reasons 2 why habeas provides a much closer source of meaning for 3 the word and concept of "exhaustion" here, both because of 4 the similarity of the language in the exhaustion provision 5 here, and the habeas exhaustion provision, because of the 6 fact that both are prisoner litigation. There is an 7 overlap between habeas cases and section 1983 cases in 8 this context. And -- 9 10 to me, as 11 surprised 12 too, thought this was an administrative law case. And 13 it's an administrative law case, because we want the input 14 of the administrative -- of the administrative body. In 15 the habeas cases, we're simply giving deference as a 16 matter of comity and courtesy to the State Courts. Is it 17 --    Well, I'm not sure.

I -- difficult    That's a --    -- that's a -- that's a argument for us --    -- to accept.    And is that true even if the State does not have a procedure for reopening for late claims?

The entry was never in question in Mincey.    What was in question was the search after the premises had been secured.

Is that a violation of the statute?    Well, you see the problem we have is we're not sure that it is within the statute.

06-1037 +++$+++     This has been very helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question 6   discriminate on the basis of age.  It does.  Age is the 7   explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer 8   Justice Breyer's question.  And the Act does not 9   prohibit the use of age in all circumstances to which it 10   applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the 11   use of age in some of the circumstances.  And one of 12   those circumstances is the hypothetical of the 13   55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's 14   statement and example. 15               So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for 16   you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis 17   of age.  Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing 18   that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does 19   make an explicit determination based on age as to some 20   people.

06-11206 +++$+++     Yes.    Do we look to the crime to see generally whether or not it involves violence and serious risk of harm?

No.  My hypothetical is, under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of them are for breakouts involving weapons.    But that's what we looked to in Begay.

The term "clear statement" and "clear and definition statement" that is used in the historical context -- 3 4 5 6   like that, my goodness?

If you apply clear statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.
06-11543 +++$+++     You would still say that that statute does not qualify? 3 4 5 6   of -- if there is an actual intent to cause harm.  If    But that -- that is because everybody knows there are -- there are two 10   conditions:  One in which he just is reckless and he 11   doesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other 12   one, he's so drunk he can't form the intent.  Both of 13   them are covered, and the latter is simply because we 14   don't want an excuse to exonerate the more culpable of 15 the two. 16 17   is a strict liability.  There is no intent.  There is 18   not even negligence.  It's merely being in control of a 19   vehicle.    Well, there is a whole 11   category of those.  So -- 21 22 23 24 25

Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this, just about Guam, not about the other territories. Is there anything in the Organic Act that would prevent Guam from changing the assessed percentage from 35 percent to 100 or 150?    So there's no, no limit in the Organic Act of any real meaning?

The government's theory has 21   changed during the pendency of the litigation.  And 22   below they argued that this was a common expense for 23   individuals; yet they introduced no evidence of that. 24   And under the United States v.

Is that permitted?    So that if had the Platonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could use it only if it ended up with the right ratio?    But in the end it has to have the right ratio.    Well, Congress uses the word "true market value" and under this hypothetical I come very close to true market value, and you say it doesn't work.    I thought your -- I thought your submission was that even if is true market value for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in line if the methodology is different.    Why would your position be 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   false "fair market value"?  I never heard of such a 23   thing.    Or any weaker?

Well, that's a benefit, privilege, and term of the contract --    -- to me fairly obvious to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   case is a fortiori from the Jackson case in a couple of 2   respects.  First and foremost, we think that a 1982 3   precedent, if it governs Title IX, ought to a fortiorari 4   govern 1981. 5               But the second way we think this case is a 6   fortiori from Jackson is that the same textual obstacles 7   are not present here that the Jackson -- that the 8   Jackson dissenters identified.  You know, the Jackson 9   dissenters didn't say that retaliation isn't a form of 10   discrimination.  They said it's not discrimination on 11   the basis of sex.  And if you look at the text of 12   1981(a), (b), and (c), you find that it's actually more 13   capacious language, and you don't have the same problem. 14   It doesn't say "discrimination on the basis of race." 15               Now, to be sure, we're not saying that 1981 16   isn't a race statute; of course it is.  But those exact 17   words don't appear and don't provide a stumbling block. 18   And if you look at the form that 1981 takes, it doesn't 19   take the form of an express prohibition of 20   discrimination on the basis of race; it actually 21   textually takes the form of a guarantee of equal 22   treatment.  And it seems to me that a guarantee of equal 23   treatment quite naturally is violated not just by the 24   basic discrimination but is also violated by retaliating 25 -- 49  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   retaliation?

We 18   think in our view, in addition, the plaintiff has to 19   make the full Wards Cove showing that would be 20   sufficient in Title VII to establish liability 21   conclusively.

06-593 +++$+++     I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just  ￼23 24 25 than that to coverage as well. So I think in all those senses, Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3 7 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   because there is not an exemption beyond that.  And 5   that's one of the interesting things about 552.3.  In 6   addition to generally dealing with this question of what 7   kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going 8   well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion 9   of the exemption for companionship services, because 10   jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not 11   subject to the exemption.  So it really looking at what 12   552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that -- at 13   the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of 14   what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes 15   domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption 16   but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as 17 well. 18               And the Department has taken that position. 19   It says this is, in fact, the only definition of 20   domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it 21   is not just intended to be limited to the particular 22   situation of the exemption.  It applies more broadly expertise, Justice Scalia. The -- of course that doesn't address anything beyond companionship services, of course,  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   deals with a number of other subjects. 2               Now, one other thing on the statutory 3   interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that 4   Respondent offers also leads to the problem that 5   essentially sets up a tension with another one of the 6   regulations which is 552.101(a).  552.101(a) which I'm 7   sorry -- I don't have the right page number here -- it 8   is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition -- has, 9   carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home 10   of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to.  But 11   then it also says that this includes people who are 12   commonly referred to as private household workers. 13               And the one thing we know from the 14   Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and 15   also from what the Department has said before this Court 16   is that that term at the time was defined by the 17   Department and known by Congress to constitute more than 18   just employees employed by the homeowner.  There was a 19   special second category for people who worked in the 20   home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but 21   were employed by a third party agency. 22               Now somewhere underlying all of this 23   question, I think, is statutory interpretation and 24   indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference 25   to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which 8  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if 2   it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to 3   employees who work for third parties. 4               And I would just like to suggest that there 5   really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have 6   wanted that. 7               First of all, third participate employers 8   such as private agencies provide services for the 9   particular group of people which Congress was trying to 10   assist with this exemption.  People who by reason of age 11   or disability are unable to care for themselves. 12   Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the 13   hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the 14   background screening for employees.  They can provide 15   necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents 16   and things like that. 17               So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort 18   of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit 19   unusual. 20 21 22 23 24 25

In Eichman, I was able to get out the district court and the last part of the district court, the last line of the district court, it says the law under which these three -- let me begin again -- the law under which these three defendants have been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about what happened in the district court.

Suppose the court acts beyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction? 12 13 14 15   beyond its jurisdiction.  Indeed, the President has 16   determined otherwise.    So then the President's --   -- determination is not    And I -- I think that that's not -- not consistent with your earlier position.    And can the President displace our authority to do that?

At some point I think in the course of your argument, we may get back to whether the Vienna Convention itself is or is not  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 with it. 2               I'm not sure that it is self-executing in 3   that the State has to accept whatever procedural 4   framework the foreign national demands.    And the United States apparently accepts the verdict of those --    You see where I'm going?    Suppose you have a judge who has control over a defendant who's being held in custody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to    If I thought he did, would I still have to rule against you? 19 20 21 22 23 24   identical outcome.

There is nothing in the Federal    Well -- but you're arguing to Justice Scalia that Section 9 works because you could interpret the "if" clause that way.    Now you're telling Justice 18 19 20 21 22   doesn't prevent us from being able to do this.  Section 23   10 is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we are the action here anyway.

If we were to say that 5   Twombly is to be confined to the antitrust and 6   commercial context, would -- would that destroy your 7   case?

07-10441 +++$+++     Well, it would be consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say that there's a six-hour safe harbor, whatever term you want to call it, and beyond six hours the Court is free to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   of the statute is "time limitation."  That's strong 19   language for Congress to use and it indicates that 20   Congress intended to limit the taking of confessions to 21   those first six hours.  There is no limitation without 22   MCNabb-Mallory in effect.    Well, is it your position that the MCNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than to ensure the voluntariness of the statement? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   --    And that's what you're trying to reach here?    -- something other than voluntariness and suppressing the confession?    What do those rights have to do with a confession that is conceded, for our analytic purposes, to be voluntary?    But all you are doing is trying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the wholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if 10 11   it's voluntary.  If it's not voluntary, of course, it's 12   related. 13 14 15 16   determination.

Mimms established that a 15   traffic stop satisfies Terry's first prong as to 16   suspicion of criminal activity, and it also established 17   that a pat down of a driver is justified if the officer 18   has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is armed and 19   dangerous. 20               Fourth Amendment searches must be 21   reasonable, and the pat down in this case was 22   reasonable.  And it is common -- it's a commonsense principles established in Pennsylvania v.

Did you say that Mimms established 2   that it's likely that he's armed and dangerous?  I 3   missed that.    I guess what you're saying 10  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 is that if there is a stop of the passenger and an interrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say, incidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a pat down?    And it seems to me there is some indication that that's what happened here if you credit the police officer's testimony. - Subject to Final Review    In other words, you can have consent within the context of a stop that has not yet ceased.    The white light is on.  I don't want to -- but your opening argument that you presented indicated that a seizure is not necessary. You -- you wanted a further rule. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   can pat down.  That's -- that's the rule that you 17   proposed, I thought.

07-1209 +++$+++     And as between the two courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron sense, but some deference because of their expertise in dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we owe more deference to the court of appeals or the Veterans Court?    I mean it's an issue of law, so I take it it's de novo.    But in the exercise of that review, don't we have to give some weight to the determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans 7   Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due 8   effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial 9   error.  And I think you could get from that that they 10   have a certain amount of latitude in determining what 11   the best rule is.  But you're not going to -- you don't 12   tell us that?    Well, the -- the statute says, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line of questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Why can't I get that 2   out of this statute?    Well, it just tells that the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.    That's fairly 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   straightforward. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    But what about the notice, 14   the original notice?  They don't have a lawyer at that  ￼1 lawyer? 2 3 4

What is it, the "all or" -- not "all or 14 15 16 17 18 19   Profitt.

And perhaps it's announced in Profitt, 23   but it surely has not been clearly established by this 24   Court in any decision, and that pre-AEDPA Profitt 25   decision from the Fifth Circuit certainly did not compel 14 nothing" --    "Nothing to lose."

But the Second -- the Second Amendment doesn't repeal that.  You don't take the position that Congress no longer has the power to organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you?    So it was supplementing it.  And my question is, the question before us, is how and to what extent did it supplement it.  And in my view it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either 13  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   with the arming of the militia by the States.  And the 2   word that caused the most focus was to "arm" and that is 3 to disarm. 4               Now, what I think is happening is that two 5   different rights are being put together.  One was a 6   textual right to protect the militia.  I think the 7   better argument for the -- for the other side, for 8   Mr. Heller, is that the amendment's purpose is militia 9   protective, but it was overinclusive in the way that 10   several of you have suggested, and that is that, as the 11   court below said, preserving the individual right, 12   presumably to have guns for personal use, was the best 13   way to ensure that the militia could serve when called. 14               But that right, this right of personal 15   liberty, the Blackstonian right, is an unregulated right 16   to whatever arm, wherever kept, however you want to 17   store it, and for the purposes an individual decides, 18   that is a libertarian ideal.  It's not the text of the 19   Second Amendment, which is expressly about the security 20   of the State; it's about well-regulated militias, not 21   unregulated individual license, as is --    I think that would be more 16  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    The purposes of what?

There is then a suit to rescind the transaction on the ground of fraud or mistake.  Do you get your money back from the stamp tax?    I can understand -- just taking a quick look at 365(g), why it serves a different purpose and a different function.

It seems to me that that's a particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if there is a formulation that's more precise than the general attack that you made -- that you make.    Does anything in Colorado indicate that there can be a differential between the party support given to one candidate and the party support given to the other?

You're charged 10   with that, but we are not going to hold you, so, you 11   know, come back in a month.    Other members of the Court can advise me about that.

The 2   purpose for the Indian Allotment Act was to take a -- 3   land out of reservations and out of the possession of 4   Indian tribes and distribute that to -- to Indians in 5   fee simple so that they could sell it to someone else. 6   Congress decided, the United States decided, in the '30s 7   that that policy had been -- ill-served the Indians and 8   ill-served the United States.  So the Indian 9   Reorganization Act was intended to address and remediate 10   that. 11               At the same time the United States was 12   concerned and the Congress was concerned that there had 13   to be some limit.  If there were Indians that had not 14   been adversely affected by the Allotment Act, they were 15   not intended to be, generally speaking, covered by the 16   Indian Reorganization Act. 17               So what I mean -- I was saying in response 18   to Justice Alito's question -- it's not just the text of 19   the statute.  It's the purpose for the statute, which 20   was to provide some benefits and some limitations on the 21   damage done by the allotment policy.  So it was natural, 22   when it was necessary to come up with some restriction 23   on who would be the potential beneficiaries of the 24   statute, to look at the tribes that were under Federal 25   jurisdiction in 1934 who had been harmed in some 10  ￼1 fashion. 2 - Subject to Final Review    They wouldn't qualify for two reasons -- A, they weren't recognized; and B, they 20 - Subject to Final Review 1   wasn't recognized until 1976.

Now, you know, it could -- it 21   could well be that it has always been considered 22   reasonable to search the person and to search the 23   conveyance from which the person has been taken. 24               If that's the case, I could say, gee, it's 25   always been considered reasonable, end of case.

And I understand that you 20   say in effect they were.

As a 2   procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment 3   Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint.  Are 4   you taking the position it's now waived or something?    It was under the State?    If you prevail, the action should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?    All right.    Then getting back to the Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you say it's Government speech that in later cases, including the case of the existing monument, you're going to say it's Government speech and you have an  ￼1 2 3 4   problem. 5 - Subject to Final Review the other, but it certainly raises --    -- an Establishment Clause 7   Orden forecloses it.

And the same question Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question 8   ownership only if we agree with the message.  That just 9   puts his question.

We would have 6   to say on the merits this is a case where there are no 7   exigent circumstances.  Can we say that?  I -- would not 8   want to "never are there."    Which is what they would do under Saucier.    Which is what they do in 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19   develop.

The hypothetical 22   is that they have to send people in to assist him.  But  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   circumstances, they cannot rely on it.  I seriously 7   question that proposition.    It seems to me that dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on your proposition that if the police create the exigent 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   the time to get a warrant.  And I find that a dangerous 20   rule. 21 22 23 24 25    No, no.  I want to talk about the general rule.    You want us to write an opinion saying that any time police create the exigent circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing 2   probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is 3   also the knowledge of all police officers, at least 4   within a department or working on a particular problem. 5   So that if in a case in which there is a search without 6   a warrant, if you add up everything that individual 7   officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then 8   the search is good. 9               Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule 10   in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which 11   is a police officer who was admitted by consent and 12   there are other police officers outside.  At the point 13   at which the police officer who has been admitted has 14   the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that 15   knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver 16   of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort 17   of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with 18   respect to the police in general, just as we regard 19   police knowledge as being imputed to all police 20   officers? 21               That way you don't have the problem that, 22   for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the 23   case of exigent circumstances.

Proper --    All right.  So I don't think they could have -- and of course, you don't think 19 20 21 22   process issue and I don't think so.  No, I do not think but you don't think it's void.    All right.  So you have to  8 9 10 11 12 13 creditor is not discharged.    I'm -- if you're having problems with this --    Let me just ask this and ￼14   creditors whether or not they are listed.  But generally 15   speaking that is correct.    And is -- is the rationale that that -- that that discharge would be void as to them, or that they are just not covered? Suppose the bankruptcy judge makes a mistake 41  1   and lists a creditor by name as being discharged, but 2   that creditor never received notice.  Is it void?    Well, is this -- is this case all that different, then?    I mean, that -- that -- that assumes that he got notice of something that was legally improper.    I'm -- I’m not sure that there was a proper notice.    Well, of course that's the   1   that the Ninth Circuit adopted, it's going to be 2   extremely burdensome and costly on -- on municipalities, 3   on -- on those who give student loans, et cetera.  And 4   that -- and that you are just creating a tremendous 5   burden on an already overburdened system.    Well, what does the notice of -- the time for a notice of appeal run from?    What does the time for the notice of appeal run from -- the discharge order?
08-1151 +++$+++     But it would be subject to the easement that the State acknowledges you have, which is the easement of access?    Well, but the -- the --    No, no.  As I understand the supreme court's opinions, you have several special and exclusive -- or exclusive -- or exclusive, common  sell that. line.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   owner, has these rights.  The Chief Justice asked you, 10   could this property be sold?  I think the answer would 11   be yes, but it would be subject to the continuance of 12   that easement in the dominant estate.  That has to be 13   the answer under the supreme court's opinion.  Now, you 14   may not agree with that.    No, no.    The -- the hypothetical is the State says that the property owner, the upland ￼  1   to characterize it as a taking when the State has said 2   that it is not?  Would we just find all sorts of 3   adjectives -- it’s sudden, unexpected, unfounded -- we 4   just have a string of adjectives, sort of like an 5   adequate independent State ground rule or something?    The State can do an    -- but not an avulsion?    But -- but did they call it an avulsion?    That -- that -- so that doesn't answer my question.
08-1175 +++$+++ 
08-1191 +++$+++ 
08-1198 +++$+++     And you would -- would you describe -- would you describe the authority of a court any differently than you've just described the authority of an arbitrator?  1   apply rules of construction that go to the parties' 2   intent, that go to whether there is -- possible to discern 3   a meeting of the minds.  They don't have --
08-1200 +++$+++     Well, what about attorneys' fees?
08-1214 +++$+++     Well, but I mean -- if you’re coming up and saying, well, we have a principal-agent here, I could understand that, but that's I didn't think the question we are here to decide.    Is it your briefs?  Is it part of the question?    Well, but the -- the basic ￼ 1   to you.  And another says:  You don't have to do that 2   under your contract.  And there are 19 unions and they 3 4 5 6   stop that.  The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner 7   Act was to stop that.  They didn't want Federal courts 8   any more than State courts interfering in that kind of 9   thing.  So why should we read an exception into this? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   said:  Here's how we’ll deal with that.  We’ll deal 19   with that by giving the employer and the union a right 20   to go into court and enforce the contract or get 21   damages for its violation.  That we figure furthers 22   labor relations. 23             But it's pretty hard for me to see how it 24   could further labor relations by letting any third 25   party under the sun come in and say everything that 8    It -- it would seem to me that one of your strongest points is that this is pre­ 11  ￼12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   party.  It seems to me it's quite -- quite different Allis-Chalmers.    All right.  So then you are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional interference with contractual relations? ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   301.  State torts for interference with contract would 19   have been pre-empted prior, under Garmon or Machinists 20   pre-emption, because of those two doctrines, that it 21   would interfere with conduct that is arguably    But if it's outside 301, where does pre-emption come from, Garmon?     If I could interrupt just  1   entrusted with making exactly these decisions.  What 2   economic weapons can an international union, can a 3   parent employer use in a labor dispute? 4             For the courts to be getting involved in 5   that would be directly contrary to what Congress has 6   been doing since 1935, of saying those decisions of 7   economic weapons are not to be decided by courts 8   applying common law tort principles.  We tried that, 9   and we didn't like it.
08-1224 +++$+++     Why would a State want to incur that extra expense if --    -- if the Federal Government is going to do it for them?     No, no, no.  That makes your -- my hypo too easy for you. (Laughter.)    So that must be because there is a lack of Federal power.    Well, when I was thinking 21  1   about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a 2   pretty easy commerce power argument.  I -- I notice 3   that in -- in the government's position, you don't 4   argue the Commerce Clause very much, and I -- we’ve 5   got Morrison v. Brzonkala looking at you and Printz 6   and so forth. 7             But it -- suppose Congress said there is a 8   class of committable, dangerous sex offenders that are 9   crossing State lines and using interstate facilities, 10   and made those findings.  Would that be sufficient to 11   establish a Federal commitment law?
08-1301 +++$+++     And do -- do they generally require registration even if the offense was committed before the registration act was passed in the State? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   helpful.  At the time this was passed, would you say 19   almost all States had some kind of registration act?    So what you’re saying is that, even under your interpretation, there is going to be registration in at least one State?
08-1314 +++$+++  
08-1322 +++$+++ 
08-1332 +++$+++     So you have two arguments One, that it's -- there’s no reasonable expectation of privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable search.    Well, I'm serious.  In other words, there is, under your view --    -- legitimate grounds to look at the messages, and then once they see it, they don't have to ignore it. 10 11 12 13 14 15   sorry.  I still don't understand.  It redacted them,    I certainly -- criminal defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want 25   exonerating evidence has to be submitted.  It would seem 39  - Subject to Final Review 1   to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens' 2   question indicates, that there is going to -- that these 3   are going to be discoverable.
08-1341 +++$+++     Under three.    You answered Justice Alito by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more   1 2 3 4 5 6 7   rights.  So --    Yes.    Do you agree that this is ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process violation?    Well, you -- you agree that there is a violation?
08-1371 +++$+++     I had thought that an important part of the case, of your case, is that belief is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must    But that's different from 24   Cantwell.  Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness  - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5   people would disagree.  But that's precisely why 6   Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is 7   inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is.  And 8   if -- will you just address that, please?
08-1394 +++$+++ 
08-1402 +++$+++     But -- but I suppose the thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you have a very small population that we are concerned with, then the disparity can be very substantial, especially if you use the comparative disparity.    And I think -- at least, I was interested in that aspect of his question.    Are you -- are you saying that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good faith, no intent to discriminate --    Well --    And I’ll -- I’ll allow you to answer, of course, but --    If not, how do we show 20 21 22 23   in a different way than men.  Women had an automatic 24   exemption.  This Court didn't delineate in Duren that 25   if you had just a disparate impact based on a neutral 16 intent to discriminate.    Well, yes -- no, that's -- it's a hypothetical.    Routinely results in significant underrepresentation, then that is automatically systematic exclusion?    I mean, isn't the -- I'm trying to think about the third prong of -- of --
08-1423 +++$+++    And it makes the exemption work, then, too.
08-1438 +++$+++    And I'm -- this one question may be covered, but can you give me any examples where States have turned down money under the Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions are too great? Does this happen all the time, or ever?   Where States tell the Federal Government   I mean other States -­ they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we don't want it?
08-1448 +++$+++ 
08-1457 +++$+++     Well, just on this same 18 19 20 21   point.  The statute does use the word "quorum" twice 22   and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that 23   two members -- in its last phrase it uses the word point before Justice Breyer I think moves to another 24   "quorum" twice:  "Except that two members shall 25   constitute a quorum."  It doesn't say two members may 9  act. - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   differently.  Quorum -- I think we agree within NLRB 9   that a quorum is the minimum number of members of a body 10   necessary to transact business.  We have two different 11   bodies defined in this statute.  We have the board as 12   one body and we have the group as a different body.  And 13   so when the -- when the exception appears in the 14   statute, we agree again with the D.C. Circuit's 15   interpretation of that as simply defining two different 16   numbers of people necessary to fill out a quorum of 17   these two different bodies that are defined within the 18 statute.    It says shall constitute a ￼quorum."    If the quorum of three that authorized two to act disappears and that means the principal is no longer there, so the agent can't exercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five become four?
08-146 +++$+++     Well, of course, one of --    One of the things you're going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, this conflates the merits with the jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 the case?
08-1470 +++$+++     And does that show that – that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there were a waiver it would be --    You’re saying there’s a difference between a waiver and a failure to assert?    What's your best authority for that proposition? 31  1   of rights and a waiver before you question.  And I just 2   want to direct the Court to page 475 of Miranda: 3   Requirement of warnings and waiver is a fundamental 4   aspect of the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a 5   preliminary ritual to existing interrogation methods.    Well, he -- he didn't say 17   suggested in his hypothetical:  I'll listen to you guys 18   for a while.    I thought, in order to test his knowledge of English, they asked him to read one or two paragraphs.    I -- I have to say that -- page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in 13   terms of a -- of a waiver.  Did -- are there -- did the 14 15 16 17 18 19   contemplates pre-waiver interrogation.  If you look at 20   page 14 of the -- of the reply brief, the yellow brief, 21   and the quote from Miranda talking about the processes is, 22   on page 14, "Once warnings have been given, the 23   subsequent procedure is clear.  If" -- it’s on page --
08-1521 +++$+++     And it was also the Harlan view, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case and in Poe v. Ullman. Do you think that it best describes the approach that the Court has used over the years?    I was going to ask   1   reason why.  In 1833, this Court has held in Barron v. 2   Baltimore, in a -- in a ruling that Chief Justice 3   Marshall said was not a difficult one, although 4   important, that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the 5 States. 6               As far as I know, no justice has ever 7   disagreed with that -- with that ruling or suggested he 8   was wrong in so ruling.  From -- it was -- the only 9   reason -- and when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed 10   and ratified in the late 1860s, again, the -- the 11   framers did not directly apply the Bill of Rights to the 12   States.  They gave us some generalities. ￼13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 And the Court has always understood that when it's applying the Due Process Clause, what it asks is not just is something in the Constitution, but is this something that’s so fundamental it's a necessary condition --    What is the due process liberty --    But would self-defense be part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of the Due Process Clause?    And you’ve given -- you   1   self-defense, has the State prohibited you from 2   reasonable means of exercising that right?  But that --    And grand jury.  What    Well, I'm -- we’re using 18   up your time.  But -- 19 20 21 22   and jury case -- that's it.  There's no other -- what are 23 24 25 these other unenumerated rights?    -- do you want me to leave the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial  1   protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Either --  ￼2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
08-1529 +++$+++     Okay.    Yes.
08-1553 +++$+++     I have one question.  I  7 8 9 correct that.
08-1555 +++$+++     But that just goes back to the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail from the State Department to tell us what to do.    I thought that was the whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. 22 23 24 25 Can you tell the Court, is this defendant amenable to suit or is there an immunity that would cover him?
08-1569 +++$+++     Can you give us the page?
08-192 +++$+++     It seems to me that she may then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me that her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if you're talking about your -- the polity of your statute, than the man who uses the drugs.    Well, suppose you had the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Justice Kennedy.  And to the extent she fits within the 2   terms of the statute, it would be because she doesn't 3   benefit from the buyer-seller rule.  The buyer-seller 4   rule establishes that buyers of drugs aren't aiders or 5   abettors of the distribution of drugs, and equivalently 6   they wouldn't be treated as facilitators of the 7   distribution of drugs.  Now -- 8 9 10 11 13   school exam type question, but in the real world who is 14   covered?    Maybe Justice Ginsburg would like some further illustration, but I thought that that was one illustration in answer to her question.    Well, but that was the    Other than -- - Subject to Final Review    No background principles either way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion in charging --    -- as it applies to statutory interpretation?
08-205 +++$+++     But if you -- if you insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   against.    So you are asking us to have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied challenges which are based on, as I indicated before, speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in WRTL to find that BCRA, which is of course the only 2   statute directly involved in this case, did not have 3   that substantial overdraft.    But suppose we were to say    When other corporations, via -- because of the very fact you just point out, have already been used and are being used by the government to express its views; and you say another corporation can't object to that.    In the course of this argument, have you covered point two? (Laughter.)    And I would like to know 60  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   what it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.    And to undercut Buckley in    You say it's been on -- 5   it's been on the books forever.

And the -- the history you 11   applied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of 12   expenditures.
08-214 +++$+++     But do you read Vaughan v. Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would 6    But that -- but that was a common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?    It was not admiralty maintenance and cure.    And what about English admiralty, under the English precedents?    But I just -- and you can 21   awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply 22   part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, 23   but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some 24   American courts, American judges, including noted 25   admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages 16  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne 2   and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about. 3   Is that incorrect?
08-240 +++$+++     Is -- is leaving the premises the sine quo non of a termination?    But aren't there -- aren't there some operators that own their own premises?    So only one of the three would suffice in your view?    Just --    No, no.  In my first, he ceases to operate and he moves out of the premises.    In other words, there is a small universe of cases in which there is a constructive termination without leaving the premises, without severing the fuel, et cetera.    I just don't know what they're going to -- how you would respond to that?    But then you'd just have a magic words test.    I'm quite frankly amazed that you say you don't have a test.    You’re coming up here and telling us that there’s such a thing as a constructive termination, I mean -- but then you don't have a test for it?    Well, just getting back to the constructive eviction, I took a quick look at the Marini and Ireland case that you cite, and I think  23 24   very much. 25 If there are no further questions, thank you    -- that says the dog doesn't ￼  1 2 3 4 5 6 7   to about three issues:  The first is what is the 8   relevant background principle we think Congress was 9   looking to when it used the words “terminate,” 10   “non-renew,” and “cancel” in the statute.

It seems to me, Mr. Starr, based on this last argument, that it actually is in your favor if the order of the court as to one district automatically requires additional expenditure for every other district, that is simply one more measure that the Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.

You want us to decide the case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for the student?    In the hypothetical wasn't there a probable cause? 10 11 12 13   can do that.  But that's not what happened here.  What 14   this school official did was act on nothing more than a 15   hunch, if that, that Savana was currently concealing 16   Ibuprofen pills underneath her underpants for other's 17   oral consumption.

It can be reopened for two 12   reasons, one relating to the definition of "mental 13   retardation" post-Atkins and the other relating to the 14   different issues. 15               First, with respect to the definition, the 16   Ohio Supreme Court has made clear in Lott that IQ is not 17   enough to determine mental retardation.  In fact, the -- 18   the clinicians and the American Association of Mental 19   Retardation say that IQ is not enough, particularly in a 20   borderline case where IQ is close to the line.  And 21   there you need to look very carefully at adaptive 22   skills.  Moreover --    Or must that be reopened?    It can -- can be reopened?

It seems to me that what you are saying is that, in some countries, there -- there is a presumption that there is always custody in 8  1 2 3 4   actually particularly common, Justice Breyer.  But 5   certainly in many countries, there’s now a presumption 6   of joint custody. 7             And so, in all of those cases, under the 8   convention, the left-behind parent would be entitled 9   to the child's return.  And the convention, again, 10   doesn't look to the purpose.  It doesn't look to -- 11   there's nothing in the convention, certainly, that 12   requires that there be one category of parents who 13   have rights of custody and are entitled to the return 14   and another category of parents who are not entitled 15   to the return remedy.  There's a -- there's a system have researched, and we don't believe that that’s  the party -- in both parties.    Well, you’re saying -- I know the white light's on -- but you are saying that every case that involves the Chilean government, the convention here is applicable, requiring return?    Well, you could say that the limitation on the custodial right is the right of the husband to visit once a month or 3 -- 3 weeks a 30  1   month.  I -- I think that's slightly an artificial approach.    I had one question for  favor of establishing ne exeat orders, and --    Well, but the ne exeat order --    I was going to say the ne exeat order, under your view, is the one order that can't be enforced anyplace.    But that -- but that's a defense to a removal order.
08-651 +++$+++     The -- the judge would not be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal consequences of -- I mean, in the criminal system itself?    But it seems to me a careful district judge would have to do this if you prevail.    Well, everyone at the counsel table I assume agrees that the plea has to be   1   would be in -- in -- completely --
08-660 +++$+++  
08-661 +++$+++     Well, how -- you know the  1 2 3 4   hypothetical:  Two or three teams which aren't 5   particularly popular in the league are hurt by the 6   rule change.  And -- 7 8 9    And notice, there’s -- that the owners sit around the room, they are liable 10   for a conspiracy.  I mean, this is serious stuff. 11   Triple damages. 12             I don't -- and my question, really, was the 13   same as Justice Ginsburg’s.  Can you give us a zone 14   where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be -- 15   would be inappropriate?  We can take care of it on 16   summary judgment.  Because if you don't have some sort 17 18 19 20   answer your question in two parts.  First of all, to 21   the extent that the Court is looking for a zone, the 22   concerted conduct doctrine is the wrong place to do 23   it, because remember, if something is deemed not to be 24   concerted conduct, it is a per -- then it's per se, 25   not subject to section 1 and per se legal.  And I 7  market power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be one who can --    And so -- and the earlier 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   these agreements constitute concerted activity.  They 24   plainly do, because they are agreements between 25   separately owned and controlled competing businesses. 21    And -- and it's a difficult area, but I’d like -- and -- but I’d like some guidance.    Well, do we have to ask what was the intent at the beginning, as kind of an 9 10 11 13   will sell hats, and -- I don't understand the base 14   point from which I find that this is a single entity.

I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of 6 7 8 9 the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of the government?    Well, is it true that there are more petitions filed in the courts with the more generous standards?    My -- my concern is that I sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   government's position, I don't know what you could do if 2   there were a -- a submission and understanding that 3   stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.    About your position, is it your contention that if we grant -- if we determine clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are not relevant to that calculus?
08-724 +++$+++ 
08-728 +++$+++     And that's -- that's part of -- that there in the local rule of court?    Yes.    But I'm -- I'm not sure that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both  ￼9 10 11 to take longer. Let's assume that it takes two weeks on - Subject to Final Review 1   short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then 2   maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.    Right.

08-861 +++$+++     The -- the burden of time of compliance?    The burden is because it's difficult and expensive to comply?    But -- but the question is -- I assume it’s the follow-up question that Justice Ginsburg is interested in -- under your view of the case, why is that lawful?    Well, they -- they -- this board has authority to -- to tax those people it regulates, to issue subpoenas, and so forth.    Call them on a routine basis, to supervise what they are doing?    I -- I --    I -- I understand that.

Under the test that you 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   officials.  It's hard to do that under the statute.    But that would fit your test, though.

08-911 +++$+++     So -- so it -- so absent the regulation, you would interpret the statute as saying there is no discretion?    No, that wasn't my  19 20 21 22   this way:  If the statute is silent as to matters of 23 24 25 discretion, the Court can look to -- the Court could look to other sources to determine --    Well, then there must be a discretionary component implicit.

In other words, it's much more complicated. 6 7 8 9 Is there some point at which that is patentable, even though this pre-empts a -- a whole range of different choices?    And it's hard for you to answer -- you know, there's a million hypotheticals. But I'm just trying to --    -- the right way to do it.    I thought your answer to Justice Scalia would be -- and please correct me -- the difference is, is that what the Respondent is claiming is a -- a patent on the measurement of the result.    But you're giving a different answer.    I mean, that's how I would  10 ￼1 2 3 4   this Court.  Congress has never disagreed with that. 5   Pieces of nature can't be monopolized.

10-1399 +++$+++  
10-1472 +++$+++     That wasn't quite my    My point was that I think we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we've said in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral  ￼            And Kan Pacific's discussion of the dictionaries is limited to a single dictionary,  1   testimony in court, we tend to use "translator" or 2   "translate" and "interpreter" or "interpret" somewhat 3   interchangeably.  Is that correct?    Well, what's -- what's your position?  I -- I take a deposition at -- in my law office and I have to have an interpreter there.  Is that recoverable or not?    Well, how do you think it affects the way you read the statute?  What do you think should be the result?    Well, isn't that an abuse of discretion?    Well, I mean, in other words, if the court sees that the cost of preparing documents into an English-language is quite substantial in light of what's involved in the case, and it's just not fair to -- to award them, can't that court in its discretion deny that, or is that not the way it works?
10-1491 +++$+++     But, counsel, for me, the case turns in large part on this:  Page 17 of the red brief says, "International law does not recognize corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here"; and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron saying "No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged   3 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection." And in reading through the briefs, I was trying to find the best authority you have to refute that proposition, or are you going to say that that proposition is irrelevant?    And it's -- it involves your whole argument, of course. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   human rights norms are defined by actions.  They're not 19   defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a 20   corporation or another kind of entity. 21               And so, I think that the -- the Respondents 22   are wrong when they say that international law does not 23   extend to -- to those kinds of acts.  They do -- it 24   does.  And the United States agrees with that position. 25               What they have tried to -- to conflate is    But I agree that we can assume that Filartiga is a binding and important  ￼ 1   of New York, and the victim saw him walking down the 2   streets of New York and brought the suit. 3               In this case, the corporations have 4   residences and presence in many other countries where 5   they have much more -- many more contacts than here.    Well --    -- I wonder if you don't concede away too much when you say, well, there's a difference in substance and -- and remedy and questions 22 23 24 25   foreign -- foreign territories.

And the other one, quite distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would not be some floodgate of -- of imputed residence cases.    Right.

10-209 +++$+++     Well, but that's the question -- that's the question we're confronting.  So, I think --    -- your answer was a little too facile on that point.  10 11 12 13 14 15 16   guilty.    We have to assume there's ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client can make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 adjudication of guilt.    That gets back to my question:  Is it a violation in the abstract then, of damnum absque injuria?    Damage without injury.    What -- what is the judge supposed to do?  Let's say the remedy is it goes back 29   ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   proceedings.    Well, I'm asking what -- I'm a conscientious decisionmaker, and I'm asking for your advice on what I should do.    I know the details of this crime, which were more horrific than I would have expected, because I've heard them at the trial.  Do I just somehow forget about that, prescind that?    I think you can --    -- answer the Chief Justice's question.  The Chief Justice said how are you going to know -- you have to show prejudice.    How are you going to know that he would have?  Of course, he's always going to say 49   ￼ 1   he that would have, but how is the trial judge going to 2   make a credibility determination on that -- on that 3   issue?  I guess it's just a credibility determination. 4   I don't know how he's going to do it.  I think you can 5   answer the Chief Justice's question yes or no.    You're saying it was unfair to have a fair trial?    You're saying it's unfair to have a fair trial; isn't that correct? 10 11 12 13   position. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    That has to be your

10-382 +++$+++  
10-444 +++$+++     It's -- it's very odd for you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical 14   ￼ 1   stage.  If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and 2   the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover 3   a defense, it can be set aside then.  So, it's -- so, 4   you're saying it's not a critical stage depending on 5   what the end result is.  That's very difficult. 6               I thought we were going to tell attorneys, 7   you have an obligation during the plea bargain process 8   to use professional competence.  And you say, well, you 9   do or you don't.  That doesn't make much sense.
10-507 +++$+++     Yes, I agree.  I thought you had a backup argument -- reply brief.     -- in your -- in your 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   wherever they go.  It's the Jones Act, and it 21   specifically is written in status terms.  And that was a 22   model that Congress had before it, but it specifically 23   rejected the admiralty model for dealing with these 24   structures and adopted the model that has them treated 25 as -- 10    But since Congress didn't  ￼ 1   hear your argument on that point.

But it does -- it does seem to me that your position would be much stronger if you said there is jurisdiction, and the President wins.   Because if this -- if this rationale remains the law and is the law, then you have the specter of constant legislative determinations that are not clearly -- not clearly invalid. And it seems to me that's, again with all due respect, not in the best interest of the ultimate argument you're making.

They cannot take the gun, the second gun? 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    On what basis do you say they can take the second gun?

10-779 +++$+++    What was your page again? MR. GOLDSTEIN 7 8 from the PhRMA brief, the other red brief at page 42, at 9 the top of the page. 10 So, to whomever they choose, so long as that 11 person does not use the information for detailing. The 12 Second Circuit said: Okay, you're the State; here's how 13 we understand the statute. The statute only imposed -­ 14 quoting again, this is from 22A, it's the language that 15 Justice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes 16 "restrictions on the sale or use of such data for 17 marketing or promoting a prescription drug." So that's 18 what they understood the statute to do. 19 Now, then the question becomes why did they 20 do it? This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really 21 hard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge 22 what the point is here. And the State tries to deny 23 that the purpose here is to limit the information 24 getting into the hands of the doctor. We don't have to 25 rely on the State's lawyers. The State legislature was 35 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 very helpful here. 2 So if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief 3 now, page 1a, okay. Right at the top, the State says 4 their goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom 5 of it -- containing health care costs. 6 Then in finding number 2 they explain why 7 they did it: "There is a strong link between 8 pharmaceutical marketing activities, health care 9 spending and the health of Vermonters." 10 Then finding number 3: "The goals of 11 marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals 12 of the State." 13 And my favorite, obviously, is number 4: 14 "The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State 15 determined, was operating in conflict with the goals of 16 the State." They didn't like the marketplace of ideas. 17 Now, it is true, we acknowledge, that 18 another thing the State wanted to do was to give the 19 doctors some more control. It's in -- it's in -- there 20 is an opt-out option. 21 But can I just take you to how the State 22 explained what it was doing? That's just going to be on 23 page 7. Now, the State's lawyer and the Solicitor 24 General have explained to you that they believe that 25 doctors were concerned only with marketing and only with 36 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 marketing to them. That's not true. Finding 29. We 2 have to go all the way to number 29 to get to this goal 3 of the State: "Health care professionals in Vermont" -­ 4 I'm on page 7: "Health care professionals in Vermont 5 who write prescriptions for their patients have a 6 reasonable expectation that the information in that 7 prescription, including their own identity and that of 8 the patient, will not be used for purposes other than 9 the filling and processing of the payment for that 10 prescription." 11 It's not just about pharmaceutical 12 marketing. The doctors say -- we all love this; there's 13 stuff about us in our daily lives that we wish was 14 entirely private. The doctors here said: Hey, it would 15 be great for us if this information, we had complete 16 control over it. Doctors also would love if medical 17 malpractice judgments weren't broadly known. There are 18 all kinds of government records they would prefer not to 19 be out into the public sphere. 20 But then we ask ourselves, all right -- and 21 that's why I asked you to have this brief available -­ 22 what did the State do? Did the State in fact enact a 23 general privacy provision? Is it like HIPAA or instead 24 is all that the State did here target the use for 25 marketing, while it allows the use of the same data for 37 ￼ 17 care costs, 18 interests. 19 20 and that is the physician's privacy   Suppose you had a statute in which the pharmacy cannot give the information or sell the information to anybody; it must remain with the pharmacy.   A copy of the prescription must be given to the State of Vermont. The State of Vermont then has the same restrictions that this statute has. That would be LAPD.

10-879 +++$+++     It's not -- it's not    It's not clear to me why a railroad executive couldn't say, now I need to use 10 locomotives in this division because I will be using two of them every week in the repair shop to repair them, right?  I don't know why that isn't use, but you don't -- you don't seem to agree with that.    Now, I know it's use on the line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an obvious extension of the line.  Everybody knows that it's going to have to spend, I don't know, 1 day a month in the repair shop, and that's just part of -- of the  ￼ 1   railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents 2   to be given to the workers which explain the risks and 3   how they can overcome them. 4               Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump 5   under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does 6   the Act pre-empt those?  It doesn't affect design of the 7   railroad, nor does it affect the use.  Neither.    Suppose --    Suppose the allegation is there's a failure to warn workers to use a special kind of mask that's very important if you're working near asbestos.  That's the claim they want.  Now, are you saying that the manufacturer cannot be required to give that warning?    Are you also saying the railroad cannot be forced to give that warning in its repair shop?    No, no.  That was my -- can the railroad be held liable for failing to tell the 35  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7   to -- 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    But you could -- could State law say you need a special kind of mask?

It's just --    What I -- yes.  What I mean is the argument over "arising under" over jurisdiction.
11-1160 +++$+++  
11-1175 +++$+++  
11-1221 +++$+++     Well, it seems to me that's grasping at straws.
11-1231 +++$+++     And -- but --    But you would say no equitable tolling in that case?    I mean, that would be good 40  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 cause.  It seems to me that would be good cause under the -- under the Secretary's rules.    Well, I don't know -- I don't know why it wouldn't.    You mean to say that if that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3    Yes.    Yes.    It is limited to  ￼ 1   is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct.  So just 2   failure to use the best available data, not deliberate 3   concealment, wouldn't make it.
11-1274 +++$+++ 
11-1285 +++$+++     Well, I mean, you -- you want us to decide a case without looking at the plan? I have before me the same language that I believe Justice Ginsburg is looking at, and I think she's quite correct, that the word "abrogation," of course, is not used, but neither is the concept.    Well, "simply because the plan language."  I mean, obviously, we have to look at the plan language to see what the -- you're -- you're relying on the plan language.  And you cite the summary, but you don't cite the main plan. But, second, if you're concerned --    Justice Kagan's question had two parts.  She said, tell me about the two boxes, subrogation and reimbursement. I think there is quite a bit to your argument that this is not subrogation.  The plan is rather confusingly drafted.  The plan calls it 22  ￼ 1   subrogation.  I don't think it really means subrogation. 2               If it's not subrogation, Justice Kagan's 3   question was, what then?  The -- the common fund rule 4   still does not apply?  Because?
11-1327 +++$+++     What -- could a state provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours, and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals to get a mandate?    Because of?
11-1347 +++$+++     So it would be your position that the Alabama courts still have jurisdiction over the child and the mother?
11-1351 +++$+++     In law review commentaries 14  ￼ 1   and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it 2   fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize 3   the battery-negligence distinction as being productive 4   of litigation and not really making a lot of sense?
11-139 +++$+++     And what was -- and what was the date of that, Bakersfield?    Oh, okay. 15  ￼
11-1425 +++$+++    Would you agree that that's an exigent circumstance which would allow a warrantless blood sample?   Well, we -- we know the ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 somewhat less than violation of the integrity of your body.

11-1545 +++$+++     And could you add that, in those three cases -- or at least Meade, some respect was given to the agency's due?    It was just not the sort of deference that's so wooden under Chevron.    And you might also have said, it seems to me, that that assumes the issue -- assumes the premise.    The question is, is there jurisdiction or not?    If you say, when there is no jurisdiction, why do you give deference, that -- that assumes the very step -- the very question we are trying to resolve.    Let me -- let me ask you this:  Suppose there is a provision of this statute which is very difficult to understand.    Does that bear on the Chevron Step Zero analysis on the question of what you call jurisdiction?    All right.  It seems, to me, that Justice Ginsburg identifies a real point.  I was looking at this statute, and I say -- you know, how do I know when this agency has failed to act?  I don't -- that's a very obscure data point.    Was that at 209?    Chevron is at an end. It's unravelled.
11-159 +++$+++     Would you tell me if -- if the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the 22 23 24   dependency or the deemed dependency requirements?  Or is 25   that a back-up argument that you have?  Or --  12 ￼ 13    You don't have a position
11-161 +++$+++    That's a -- that's a big In one case, there's an expectation; in the there isn't.

11-182 +++$+++     Suppose it takes two weeks to make that determination, can the alien be held by the state for that whole period of time --    -- just under Section 6?    And that is by reason of his alien --  1   borders, a person who is illegally present under Federal 2   law?
11-184 +++$+++ 
11-192 +++$+++  
11-199 +++$+++     Yes.    But -- but in the context of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very end of its discussion -- what happened in this 13   particular case.  And it concludes, from this evidence 14   we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved 15   the jury to convict."    Is your argument something  24 ￼ 1   could convict as an independent basis on 10.  And the 2   government would have to --
11-204 +++$+++     And these are all -- these are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act?    Are there any occupations or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are 10 11   out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth.  In other 12   words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent, 13   would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas 14   that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they 15   wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other 16   classifications to fit them in?    But the district court here made a finding -- this is at 42a of the appendix   64 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 for the Petitioners:  "Sales volume is directly and exclusively driven by the number of prescriptions written by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to encourage such prescriptions."
11-210 +++$+++     But that's -- that's for submitting résumés.  That's -- when -- that's fraud.    My -- my only -- one of my questions is the slippery slope problem, college degrees and so forth. Could you address that?     College degrees.
11-262 +++$+++     There's just a little bit of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement.    Yes.  Yes.  The issue before the Court today is whether Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable 10 11 12 13 14   cause to make an arrest.  Respondent in this case seeks  3 ￼8   Thus, this Court is called upon to answer the question  1 2 3 4   Vice President Cheney.  There are three reasons why 5   these agents should not be held personally liable. 6               First, the absence of probable cause should 7   be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim.
11-345 +++$+++     And this was -- and this was before the adoption of the plan.    Then -- let's assume --    -- that it resulted in the    I see an inconsistency    Is it -- are you saying that you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury, generally, for so little benefit; is -- is that the 22   alternative? 23 24 25 That's a question that was asked in Grutter. They were supposed to analyze that.  They didn't look at it.  But it -- 23  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    I just don't understand this argument.  I thought that the whole point is that sometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are saying that it isn't.  Well, then, we should just go away.  Then -- then we should just say you can't use race, don't worry about it.
11-393 +++$+++     And which one -- and what test do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify our jurisprudence?    And that objective test is 18  ￼ 1   what?    Is that the real Congress or a hypothetical Congress? (Laughter.)
11-460 +++$+++     Suppose that the district has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into this river, and then you have this high pollution index. Does that make it an easier case for the challengers? Or is that just irrelevant?     I have one different question.  This is hypothetical.  It's not in the case. It's just for me to understand that. Suppose you have the river, and part of it is a concrete bank, and then there's a more natural bedding and then another concrete bank.    Would there be any -- I could --  And when the -- in the dry season, they fix the concrete bank, but they use bad concrete.  And a lot of pollutants are coming out of the concrete, but it is in the river.  Is that a discharge under this statute? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   source. 23 24 25    Well, that's not in this    And that's -- that's a separate provision of the statute, nonpoint source    Circuit's error -- was the  ￼ 1   that water was in the river, and now, it's moving 2   through our concrete channels and it's, again, 3   discharged into the river.  Its distinction that it 4   draws is that there is something different because the 5   MS4 is an intrastate manmade construction, as opposed to 6   a naturally occurring river, which talks about the 7   distinction being made in that regard. 8               And finally, the record is just abundantly 9   clear on where these monitoring stations are.  The 10   opinion itself at cert appendix, page 18, footnote 4, 11   cites our website as the location of the monitoring -- 12   for the location of the monitoring stations.  And that 13   website clearly says they are within the Los Angeles and 14   San Gabriel Rivers.  And, in fact, appellant's brief -- 15   the Respondents' brief in the lower court, specifically 16   said the same thing. 17 And the --
11-465 +++$+++     Well, suppose that the --
11-551 +++$+++    So you think now -- you say you don't want us to mention "not to exceed" in our opinion --   -- other than to say that it's irrelevant?   Does the Redbook talk about "not to exceed" as being any different from general appropriations?   Does the Redbook refer to "not to exceed" -- the "not to exceed" language?   Does the Redbook have -- refer to the "not to exceed" language?   Suppose you did know. tribe knew that the 95 million -- let's that's the not to exceed amount -- had 44  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and make the government -- a contract with the government, and would the government have to make that contract, in your view?   Is it your argument that the answer to that is yes?   Isn't this more specific language than the general language? Doesn't this specific language, "not to exceed," supersede the general obligation to make the contract? Otherwise, it's meaningless. The "not to exceed language" is meaningless.   You say it's meaningless. MR. PHILLIPS you what the meaning of the "not to exceed" language is. 45  ￼ 1 The "not to exceed" language ensures that we 2 cannot turn to the BIA or anyone else at the Interior 3 and say, give us money from another source in order to 4 pay for our contract. And we can't use the injunctive 5 relief that's otherwise available to us for that 6 purpose. 7 So that language has very significant 8 importance in limiting what our options are --   You just go to the Judgment Fund --
11-556 +++$+++     Well, if you adopted that 53   ￼ 1   rule I suppose you could couple it with an increased 2   duty of care on the part of the employer to take 3   necessary steps to prevent forbidden harassment.  In 4   other words, you up the duty of care on the part of the 5   employer generally.
11-564 +++$+++     I mean, that just can't be a proposition that we can accept across the board. Nobody under that view has an interest in contraband in their home.  The question is, can you find out the contraband?  It's just a circular argument. And if -- and in the -- was it the Caballes case that talked about that, if I have the right name? 3   ￼ 1   That was where the contraband was visible; it was almost 2   like the smoking gun falls out.  Well, of course, 3   there's no interest in the smoking gun when it falls out 4   in front of you.  So I just don't think that works.
11-597 +++$+++     But my question is how do you define the baseline that gives a legitimate expectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen in this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the finding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher priority for other lands, and it changes its policy?  It cannot do that?    Well, what you're saying is that it can't make that change without paying, right?    Now suppose, at the very outset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've got to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on the left bank, not the right bank.  That's not a taking as of that time --    -- if the land was always flooded anyway on the right?    But what I want is the definition of the operable baseline that we can use in order to define whether or not there has been a taking.
11-626 +++$+++     But suppose --    -- you know the law school game, suppose it was moved every month.    That would be indefinitely moored, in your view?
11-697 +++$+++ 
11-702 +++$+++     It's -- it's a massive amount of conduct that -- that the statute contemplates? The statutory scheme -- I just didn't hear.  I just didn't hear.    Again, I didn't hear.    They want to do it in every --    At the -- at the beginning of the State prosecution?    All right.
11-713 +++$+++     Thank you. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So, you would fault his solution for giving insufficient deference to the State of Texas 2011 plan?
11-770 +++$+++     If -- if you think that leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence, at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop?  And he's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises, at the end of the driveway or something?    What would you think generally in my hypothetical?  There'd be hundreds of other facts, but --    Just -- just before the search, yes.    Right.
11-796 +++$+++     I have only one question so far, it's a farming question.  With some crops if you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in longer.  In -- what about soybeans?  If the farmer has the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds.  Does he leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?    You would not?  Okay.    But that's -- if you're going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour, do you leave them in the ground any longer?    Okay.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   contract. 9               Actually, it seems to me that that answer is 10   peculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because 11   all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web 12   of these contracts, and that seed because it can 13   self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes 14   all the contracts worthless.  So again, we are back to 15   the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no 16   incentive to create a product like this one.    Please correct me if I am wrong.  I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here. He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds, and -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix, but he used them.    So he did exactly what you said is uneconomical.
11-798 +++$+++  
11-817 +++$+++ 
11-820 +++$+++     So that there are then, in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, some cases in which there could be a new rule of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland?    Well, I don't understand how that works with my hypothetical. 9  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Well, it just seems to me that the predicate question that we decided in Padilla was that Strickland applies to matters not within the control of the trial judge.  That it seems to me was a holding the Court had not addressed before and that other courts had not addressed before.    Do you want us to write this opinion in support of your position, and to begin by saying, prevailing professional norms do not change?    It seems to me that you're -- that the defense bar generally would want to say that prevailing professional norms change, but that -- that hurts you in this case.    I notice -- I'm not sure it was cited in the brief, but the ABA comment in 1999 said, now the ABA standard applies to professional 19   ￼1   standards, and that goes beyond the constitutional 2   minimum.  So that doesn't seem to me to help you, 3 either. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    It said, it should be stated that these standards do more than enforce the constitutional minimum.    Well, I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the ABA here, if you want to give some other authority; but, I say that, it seems to me, does not help you.    Well, except -- except that -- and I'm interrupting, in a sense, but it's on the same track -- except that it seems to me that Teague does serve the interest of repose, quite apart from 26  ￼ 1   interference with a federal proceeding, and that 2   interest is surely sacrificed by the holding you wish us 3   to make here.
11-864 +++$+++ 
11-889 +++$+++     But you say entirely within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the bank?    Or because of there's also some intervening property between Texas and the bank that Oklahoma owns?    Do -- do the current laws prohibit that --    At any point?    Just to be clear, in your view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property, take water from the main stem in Basin 5?    But my question was, can they take it from the main stem -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 to --    Is that the part that, under their allegation at least, is saline?    All right.  Is that the part that --  -- they are referring -- when they say it's too They think all the water  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that their residents drink is salty, but they still are drinking it.
11-982 +++$+++     If -- if I were to write an -- an opinion indicating that there's a chill here because distributors and retailers will see that there's been this suit against the -- your client and they will be reluctant to distribute, would there -- would I just make that up?  Or is there something I can read to find out -- to find that out, or --    Well, the -- the evidence here was that they did need investors, and investors were reluctant.    It wasn't specific evidence, but then I -- anything besides that?
12-123 +++$+++     But you -- you began by saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's before us.    Well, to get you back to the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty.  And let's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it doesn't. It waits until the penalty's assessed and then when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a taking.  That -- is that the case that you want to discuss with us today?

12-142 +++$+++    Do you want me to write down in this case, from my understanding, that under New Hampshire law, strict liability is determined quite without reference to the adequacy of warning?   Now wait. What's --  ￼what's a factor? The warning is or is not a factor?   Well, but that's -- that's not the thrust of your argument. And I think it was a factor here for some of the reasons Justice Kagan has suggested.
12-144 +++$+++ 
12-167 +++$+++     That's -- what happens under -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the defendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do that, the defendant has to be present.  But can the -- can the judge just have the attorneys before him and say, now, I want you to be very, very clear that this is a mandatory minimum, that we should all possible. try to avoid if at Honor, I think that's -- Can he do that?
12-207 +++$+++     He was held -- he was held with probable cause --    -- and his -- and his custody was restrained.  He was in a police station.    Were handcuffs put on him during the transport process?  Do you know?    But they -- they could -- they could have been?    So his liberties were constrained in all of those respects.  He would have to take off most of his clothes, subject to a patdown 25 search?     They could look -- they could look in his -- in his briefcase?    I think -- I think there is some merit to your argument in that regard.  In Samson, he was a parolee, and he actually, as I recall, signed a -- a consent form as part of the probation.    A person -- a person has been arrested for a felony and is in custody, do the police -- does the justice system have an interest in knowing whether that person committed other crimes?    My question is whether or not the police, who have John Doe in custody for a felony, have an interest in knowing, at the outset or within a few weeks' time, whether or not that person has committed other crimes?    But they also have a reason for keeping him in custody.    And my -- my question is, do they have an interest -- a legitimate interest in knowing if that person has committed other crimes?    Does a felon who's been arrested have a reduced expectation of privacy at the time of arrest?    Does a felon -- does a person who has been arrested for a felony have a reduced expectation of privacy at the time of his arrest?

12-246 +++$+++     Then there's no -- and there's no Miranda warning and no custody.
12-307 +++$+++    That -- that would give you intellectual whiplash.  I'm going to have to think about that. (Laughter.)    But I – I see an illogic 7 in your argument. I -- I hadn't thought of the 8 relation between Section 2 and Section 3 in the way you 9 just said. You said, now Section 2 was in order to help 10 the States. Congress wanted to help the States. But 11 then Section 3, that Congress doesn't help the States, 12 which have come to the conclusion that gay marriage is 13 lawful. So 14 15 which is to 16 helping the 17 make this decision for themselves.
12-357 +++$+++     If the jury had -- had 3  Hobbs Act, and ￼ 1 returned the verdict, which is at JA142, and it had 2 marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the 3 commitment, you might still maybe have some causation 4 arguments, but I assume the property argument you're 5 about to make is just irrelevant.    I see.  I see.    Well, I took you away from your argument about intangible property.    Well, but -- but that's a argument, not whether or not you received    But so far as the property 21 is simply  1 within the State government or the role within the State 2 government's internal deliberative process, that really 3 belongs to the general counsel, and he can't --    And so then we just have a causation argument, not a property argument.
