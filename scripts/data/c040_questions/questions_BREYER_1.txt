And I take it here you're saying it's not based on what they advance as reasonable factors.   Is that right?    But still, I'd like a commune. All right?  That's how I want to do it.  Now, that's not totally idiotic.  It's plausible.  So I just win.  Right?    Ah, I lose a treatment case. No, no.  I'm not -- I'm just -- it's I'm not paying the younger workers more.  I'm paying the newer workers more. All right?  They happen to be much the same category, but I -- I don't want it.  It's not age.  Or, you know, I pay the lower paid workers more.  How's that?  Do I win?    Yes.  I paid the lower paid workers more?  I want to bring them up to the executives. I -- I like it.  It's more democratic and it makes a happier group.

03-1230 +++$+++ 
03-1237 +++$+++    What are the first few words of the sentence there that you quoted?   Exactly. And so, they are saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking that the language and context don't embrace it. Since they used the wrong standard, they never got to the question of whether the evidence warranted a directed verdict. So I don't see how we avoid looking at all of what you'd call the atmospherics.    Because they interpreted the statute in a particular way.  Isn't that right?  I'm asking.  I'm not --    No?    Yes.    That is a correct statement of So then, I take it, the other thinks that it    Yes, but the reason you brought it up is because the particular certificate that is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab that used this stuff.  That's why you brought it up, I think.    And I understand that.  And 42 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 you'd have to conclude, for them to win -- but suppose I 2 did conclude -- suppose, for hypothetical -- the sake of 3 -- for -- as a hypothetical, suppose I thought, yes, this 4 does include the safety part, looking at how effective 5 drugs are, too. Suppose I concluded that the statute 6 meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary 7 laboratory that didn't have the special certificate? 8 Suppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in 9 advance of the clinical test period to get the information 10 for the IND? And suppose I concluded that sometimes, 11 where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look 12 at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do. 13 If I concluded that -- and I'm not saying I would -- then 14 would you concede that a directed verdict would have been 15 appropriate against you?
03-1238 +++$+++ 
03-1293 +++$+++  
03-1388 +++$+++     All right.  If -- if that's so and if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could get out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries to do what it really would have thought Congress would have intended in the circumstances.  And if that's so, why wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?    Does -- does Britain -- or does Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid you to charge this double price?    Does European law -- I'd be surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?
03-1395 +++$+++    What is a PL --   What is a PL-110 settlee?   Okay. So you would say this -- MR. BURMAN your answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume for purposes of this case -- we're not admitting whether it's true spies -- not spies or not, but we're going to assume we're not   -- because we win even if we're because we are essential persons?   Perry v. Sindermann. Is that 38  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 -- that's the nontenured teacher?    You're probably right if they see what you're saying.
03-1407 +++$+++     What percent?    But as purely English -- as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right.  What is that right?  The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age.  That's the -- a plan.  That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age.  So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.    It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty.  And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered?  And the language doesn't answer it. So --
03-1423 +++$+++    The jury said it was. Who am I wasn't --    Well, a lot of it may depend on    -- on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.    But would you be happy then 24 with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm 25 Summers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or 14  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different 2 conclusion in an unusual case. 3 And the only verdict part that I think we're 4 concerned with here -- it was not about four people. It 5 was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, 6 the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her 7 Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have 8 found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You 9 said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, 10 I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or 11 more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond 12 the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, 13 both after the time they had secured the place and also 14 after the 15 basis for 16 17 basis for 18 issue of whether or not they were detained --    Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue.  That's a possibility.  I see that.   Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications --    -- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --    -- not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.

03-1488 +++$+++     All right.  Now, if that's so --
03-1500 +++$+++  
03-1566 +++$+++    So that -- so your view -- I mean, what -- what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States. That means join them in an ongoing suit. And it makes sense because what the United States wants is anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court of Claims. But of course, where you have an ongoing suit between two other people, we'll make an exception because there it's already in another district and we'll let you bring the United States in as a necessary party. The other exception is when you don't sue for money damages.

Now, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with the language. Is that your view or do you have a different view?
03-1601 +++$+++    It's strongly supported in the It may lose your client the money. I don't   I see an administrative law It sounds like that's the system they're 21 22 statute. 23 imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent 24 with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to 25 fail. 29  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

03-1693 +++$+++  
03-1696 +++$+++    Well, you're still asking for   Well, then why is it moot? Because something could happen. We might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have Page 22  1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 this other case going. So as long as -- you're prepared, 2 I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. If that's 3 what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is 4 over. It's up to you.   Well, that's -- you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that. I -- I mean, she answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that -- that the person says, you know, Judge, there's another one and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first in some unusual instance. wasn't second pending except   So why isn't it that the end? Page 28  1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 I mean, here it's not moot. They filed the other action. 2 You point out that you not only think something could 3 wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the 4 State claim. And -- and therefore, they have this 5 insurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if 6 and when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.   Why is it moot? Or even on -­ why does claim preclusion apply? I mean, if you win, from what you've said -- somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the State statute of limitations properly violated some Federal law, let's say -- then that would show that the State statute of limitations applied and barred their claim. Would that be sufficient to knock out the Federal suit too?   I mean, is -- does the State statute of limitations, if -- if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?   I mean, if you -- if you win, then -- then -- if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case? Is it the same issue?   So it may not be the same Page 39  1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 issue. Then -- then they say, okay, it's not going to be 2 claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's 3 not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. And 4 therefore, they could proceed with their Federal case, 5 which is what they want to do I guess.   It's explaining the unclear by to the incomprehensible. But go ahead. (Laughter.)
03-184 +++$+++     Now, why -- why do you say    Would you elaborate for this 5 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 reason?

Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?   That's the question I'd like answered.   Because?

03-750 +++$+++ 
03-814 +++$+++    Should we clarify that? Because I don't -- I didn't read the case saying what Justice Scalia just said or what you -- what it says is that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial -- in terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in navigation.    Obviously, a croupier has such a connection.    It doesn't say anything about being connected to the navigating part.    So far.   All right. So we have a degree 47  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 of freedom on this. But -- but the -- the question then 2 is, is it -- how -- I'm getting the impression from you 3 and -- and from the SG that it's rather deeply embedded in 4 the law, if we start reading the Fifth Circuit cases, that 5 if we define X as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel 6 in navigation, that the cases have said the word in 7 navigation mean nothing, with one exception. The 8 exception is if you actually have like a physical cemented 9 connection to the land so they can't escape. Otherwise, 10 if it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to 11 sea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning. If it's 12 a vessel, it's a vessel in navigation. If it's my garage 13 door, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in 14 navigation. 15 Now, how accurate is that assumption I'm now 16 making? What would I read in the law? Is that definition 17 of in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really 18 embedded in the law?

03-892 +++$+++     I thought the class action distinction that the commissioner had was between opt in and opt out.    Is there any constitutional protection?  The Sixteenth Amendment refers to an income tax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grossly exceeds in many cases a person's income.  That would be quite a far-out theory at the moment.    But I -- that's why I ask you. Is there any protection in the law whatsoever?  Or if 24 1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005  ￼1 Congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see -- 2 say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small 3 business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses. So 4 it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income. 5 There's no protection in your view against that result. 6 And you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it 7 decided to do it.    Like somebody stealing a check mailbox from my employer.  Right?  Okay.    So what is your theory, I mean,   Precisely, please. MR. not   Your -- your -- you want to fill in the blank, in other words, and say where the assignment of income is such, such that B was in effect the person who really earned the income, unlike Mrs. Lucas' -- what Mr. Lucas' or maybe Mr. Earl -- I don't know --    -- husband -- the wife didn't earn the income.    The -- the answer to the hypothetical about the agent and so forth is, well, so be it.  If a person wants to go to the trouble of carving out some of his income and assigning that over to the agent, let him.  Except for perhaps provisions of the code which we cannot now envisage -- I can't because I'm not an expert -- it doesn't matter since, after all, it would be deductible anyway.  Is that -- is that what you're saying? 51 1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005     Those were less enlightened times.

I don't see why it has to -- why that matters if in fact all -- if you go into a car, a police car, and you have -- drive through the neighborhood and look around, you are using a specific investigative tool, the police car, to look around and find out going on.    What I'm trying to get my own mind it's not a question of the tools.  It's a question of the expectation of privacy.    I want to focus you on the I think what you're doing, which is a 18 Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a 19 whole range of searches that don't even fall within the 20 Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a 21 justification. And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs 22 is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word 23 English search. 24 So I want to know why it is that this dog search 25 is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e., 36 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of 2 what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.

03-932 +++$+++     All right.  Now, what's wrong theory?    It's clear.  I mean, it's clear.    And -- and is there any other?    But I told him to underline it. In paragraph 179, he found the word, and it caused damage.  Okay?  And in paragraph 177, it says the same.  That's all he could find.  And they were harmed. That's what it says.    It could come out because he doesn't say anything but it sort of oozes out as earning reports come in, but it has to come out. Now, if you're saying that, then I find what you're saying consistent what I think Judge Posner said. And that's really what I'm interested in because I read what he said. It seemed to me right. Now --   But that's a --   What's the problem here? He -- 54  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 I mean, well, you heard what he said. And it sounded to 2 me that he agrees with you he has to prove that in fact 3 the fraud not only led to the overpayment, but that also 4 later on the client who bought the stock lost money 5 because the market went down, and that default, which cost 6 him the money, is caused by the fraud. 7 8 9 comes out 10 11 do, it seems to me there's no case here.    When it comes out, it just in subtle ways as well as direct ways. Now, do you agree with that?  If they -- if you ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 with what the Reform Act was trying to achieve which is to give the defendants a chance to respond and actually have the motion to dismiss serve as a meaningful screen in dealing with those cases.

04-104 +++$+++     So I'll ask you about it, if you want. [Laughter.]    Now, how, how serious an objection is that?  Or do you recommend that, if 46 ￼ 1   you lose on this point, we take the approach of, 2   in that way, making the guidelines advisory?    But, I mean, if you take common law to mean England, as well as the United States, there weren't here, because the sentences weren't appealable,  but in England, they were appealable, and they had a common law work out of what they called the "tariff," which is what the 10 11   range of reasonableness was or wasn't.  And the 12   prosecution, I believe, could appeal it of being 13   too low; and the defense, being too high.  And the 14   question was, Was the sentence reasonable?  The 15   appellate court could set it. 16           Now, if we had a system like that -- and 17   this is my serious question -- is it 18   unconstitutional under Apprendi if appeals court 19   judges reviewing a sentence could say, "This is 20   the range of reason, this is arbitrary up here, or 21   this is arbitrary down there"?    Well, there is just what I said, just what I said.   Okay.    But the idea is that this works because most cases are plea bargained.   So what you'll do if 7   you're right, is all you would say is any time 8   that the prosecutor wants to say that you 9   committed the bank robbery or you committed the 10   drug offense with more than a minimal amount of 11   money or more than a minimal amount of drug, or 12   there were guns, they get into a bargain, and they 13   end up with a sentence once they bargain -- if 14   that's the sentence, because they're not even 15   going to contest it before the judge, both sides 16   will come in and agree.  But in those few cases 17   where they do contest it, you would have to have 18   the jury find the facts.   Yeah, before we began with Apprendi? .   Nothing.
04-1067 +++$+++     Right.    All right.  Where -- 38  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 That's It is there    -- is the law --    -- there are 200,000 cases Chicago, alone.  I think that there might be    There aren't exigent ￼1 sacrifice. And that is, she can't take them into a 2 room in which he has a constitutional expectation of 3 privacy. I will concede that if he says, "I don't 4 want you in the bedroom," that will be a sacrifice. 5 But what I am saying is that there is no serious 6 argument that they can't have the conversation in a 7 place where she feels secure. That's on the porch, 8 that's in a police car. 9 If she says, "I need you to come up," and 10 there's been abuse, then what would have happened in 11 this case -- let me explain what happened in this 12 case. The officers asked Mr. Randolph first. He said 13 no. They found out -- had found out from her that 14 there was drug paraphernalia on the premises. What 15 they had to do in order to conduct this search -- if 16 they wanted to search, rather than having her bring 17 the materials out -- is to pick up the phone and get a 18 telephonic warrant, which would have taken less than 5 19 minutes. 20 The real reason I bring to your attention 21 the 200,000 domestic disturbances is that what you 22 should be concerned about, I think, is not the 15 23 cases, which is not a serious intrusion on law 24 enforcement interests over 30 years, but it's the many 25 times in which our family relationships ebb and flow. 41  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 We are concerned here with the person -- the Fourth 2 Amendment is -- it's not the person who has the drugs 3 or the abuser. Consent searches involve a situation 4 in which the police come to the door, and they say, 5 "Can we search?" Because they do as much as they are 6 permitted to do. And the person just says, "Sure," 7 perhaps completely ignorant of her rights. There's no 8 reason to believe anything is going on. And what the 9 State's position is, is that, despite the fact that 10 this is the home, and that the core of the 11 constitutional right to privacy in the text of the 12 Fourth Amendment is that the only thing he can do to 13 be secure 14 live with 15 16 17 18 - 19 20 21 say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy. And 22 when you do live with someone else, you compromise 23 your individual privacy interest to that extent. We 24 know that you compromise it to the extent that if you 25 happen not to be there, and that person says, "Sure, 42  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 in the language of the Constitution is not someone else.  Remember, the theory --    An expectation of privacy. lingering question here I'd like to get your I don't know what the expectation is, is my If I think of social -- I've never been in a 10 I'd do. If I imagine myself in a normal social 11 situation, I think probably, if I am the typical 12 person, which may or may not be, I -- 13 [Laughter.]    Uh-huh.

If you have thousands of people, somebody will be if it is random.  If there were nobody who was picked seven times, that would show it wasn’t random. So, you know --    -- whether he has a good constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful --    What are they?  How many people are there?  How many people are tested if you try to calculate it?  How many --    -- in the Federal Government?    All you do is you get a bell curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they’ll 10 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- do it --    No.  It’s -- it’s not hard    But the -- the --    All right.  Regardless, this is beside the point. I -- all right.  Can I -- I just want you at some point to get to not just the constitutional question.  Maybe he can go in and raise his claim.  I don’t know if he should have exhausted or not, et cetera.    But I find it hard, in reading this, to believe the following.  Like any other worker, I mean, normally you have a collective 11 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- bargaining agreement, and the union takes up your minor thing.  And here, what you’re saying is although if it’s a major thing, like a personnel action, there’s a special thing where you get in -- you know, you -- you get into court way down the road.  It’s very complicated.  This individual, even though he classifies it as a grievance where the union is supposed to take it up and the union tells him we’re not going to take it up, we don’t believe in your claim, that then he can run in to a Federal judge. Now, that -- that I find surprising, and I’d like you to explain how in your theory that works.    Well, why isn’t the thing to do here -- I -- I see that you are raising a significant question in respect to -- at least in my view, in respect to the -- an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute.  Leave the Constitution aside, but it might violate a number of practices, good practices, et cetera.  But why isn’t focusing on that the thing for the plaintiff here to do is he goes to the union -- I’m just reading from page 6 and 7 of your brief -- and he says, I would like you to invoke arbitration?  And they might do it.  Now, if they do it and it comes out a way they don’t like, he then -- they might file exceptions and they might 18 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- win. But what you’re worried about is if they don’t win or if they don’t do it, they can go to court only if it involved an unfair labor practice or a major adverse personnel action.  That’s what’s worrying you, I take it.    Well, why isn’t it, at that stage if he doesn’t get into court, you then say that that isn’t true?  They should be able to come to court in other instances as well, making the same kinds of arguments that you’re making now.    You -- you -- I -- I believe that there are millions of instances, perhaps.  Now, I’m -- when I think something like this, I’m quite often wrong.  But I thought that the reason that 19 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- exhaustion is required is not always because statutes require it.  It’s partly because of the word final in the APA, which applies here as well, and it’s also because of the common law of administrative law that requires people to exhaust their remedies.    But it’s not rewriting.  I mean -- I mean, it’s perhaps.    All right.  You think -- fine. The -- the -- but the -- the issue it seems that could be dispositive of this, in respect to the non-constitutional claims -- and this is why I want to get your response -- is simply that it is a fair implication from Congress having set up on non- constitutional matters a system of arbitration to require your client to go through that system before 58 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- seeking to get review of the non-constitutional matters in a Federal district court.  Now, that’s the normal rule in administrative law.  What is the argument that it wouldn’t apply in your case?    Now you want us to hold you don’t have judicial review --    -- under the statute.    No, but the answer -- please, I didn’t mean to cut off your answer.    I want to hear your answer to the question that if I agree with you that on non- constitutional matters, if this system doesn’t work for your client, he gets review in a Federal district court.  Suppose I agree with you on that.  What is the 59 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- argument against requiring him to exhaust the remedy that is there, namely a request for arbitration --    -- as an implication from the statute?    All right.  Now, is there any other claim -- any other answer to the argument other than they waived it?    What?    Did I -- could you give -- give the same answer --    -- in respect to your constitutional claim?  Why, given the presence of section 705 of the act --    -- one’s -- forget it.    Your time is up.  That’s --
04-1140 +++$+++     I want to know what it is you're arguing for.  That is, I -- when I get through all these words in the attorneys-fees cases, I've got it in my mind that, like the civil rights statute, they say, "You normally get fees, unless you shouldn't."  All right?  That means you're normally gonna to get them.    The plaintiff, anyway. All right?  Then we have a case with a copyright. The copyright says it's all the way up to the district court, really, which means a grab-bag, and what the particular judge thinks is fair in the instance.  And I guess you could have a rule saying, "You hardly ever get fees."  So, in my mind, I got it, "Well, who knows?" and, "No, you almost always do," or, "No, you almost always don't."  Now, is that a good characterization?  And what -- which one of those three are you arguing for?    I know you're not arguing for "You always don't." [Laughter.]    All right.  Then, which one do you want?  Do you want the thing --    Yes.    All right.  Now, if you want "you always get them," in the civil liberties cases there is a good policy reason, according to the court, underlying that judgment of how Congress wanted to give this to people to vindicate civil liberties.  I've never heard of a policy of closing the Federal court door, because if, in fact, you were to have that rule in this case, it would simply discourage people from removing it in cases where they think they have a good claim to remove it, because they'd have to pay huge costs if they were wrong.  So, I'm not aware of any closing doors of Federal court policy.   Now I -- 17  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005    Therefore, I'm trying to out in terms of the policy --    -- as well as the 10 language. 11 saying that I don't know why you have a better claim 12 than a copyright plaintiff, and I can think of why 13 you don't have as good a claim as a civil rights 14 plaintiff, the reason I said. So, what is your 15 response to that?
04-1144 +++$+++     Have I stated it You've focused on it, thought about it,
04-1152 +++$+++     But that isn't --    -- that isn't relevant.    Oh, there are --    -- students --    So, why isn't --    So, in fact, to be clear, you also think schools that are angry at the military because they're too favorable to gays in the military, they have the same right.   Absolutely, Your -- Okay. -- Honor, because -- And also the same right Bob they disapprove of social    All right, so --    Yes, okay.  So, if that --    -- if that's the case, then it's going to be pretty tough --    -- for the military to get campus.  And I just wonder, if that's an need, why you don't have here what I'd say is the first-amendment area, that the remedy for 1 in diversity, they may not -- they may even believe in 2 racial segregation, for all I know. I hope there are 3 not too many --    But I would --    -- I would like the answer to my question, because I'm thinking, as you correctly 44  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 say, if you have that right, so do all the worse segregationists you can imagine, et cetera.    And here -- yes, and here there is a need of some kind to get the military in. And what the Government in this statute asks you -- because I, personally, couldn't find anything in the record that finds that student who thinks, by letting the military person in, that that school, which basically is completely against the military in this area, suddenly becomes for it.  And I haven't even found in the record an instance where there was a recruiter who told people that they couldn't join the military if they were gay.    So, we have not a tremendous demonstration there of a need on the university side. And my question was, What's wrong with the Government saying, "University, you disapprove of what we do.  The remedy for such a situation is not less speech, it is more speech."    Go and explain it. MR. last question    Well, the speech is on their side.  The Government just says, "Let our recruiters in."  So, why isn't it sort of like, "Pay the property tax"?  "I don't want to.  I hate the government."    -- "I'm withholding the money because I want to express my message."    The message is, "Join the Army."  The --    -- message of the property tax is, "Pay the -- pay for the" --    -- "Government's expenses."
04-1170 +++$+++     And can -- can you go back to Justice Souter's question for a minute?  Because the way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions 6 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 that I'd like you to make: first, that there could be 2 such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this 3 is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a 4 sense. But I'll make the assumption there could be 5 such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law 6 leaves this open, a matter that can be argued. 7 But suppose that we do make that assumption 8 for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this 9 made-up case is the case of the following. We have 10 aggravating factors and break them down into molecules 11 on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, 12 there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the 13 juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same 14 number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And 15 in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the 16 situation, you must say death. 17 Now, if that's the case, how would you 18 reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that 19 says if you're going to sentence someone to death, 20 there has to be something special about his case that 21 means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case 22 because, after all, for every molecule of specialness 23 that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation 24 that doesn't? 25 So that's where I am, trying to get the cases 7 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 out of it and trying to take very seriously the 2 hypothetical that is before us.

On page 396 of 14 the appendix, you'll see the customers complaining in 15 petitioners' own survey that they couldn't get the ink 16 consumption rates out of Trident. 17 This is a case in which, if you shroud to the 18 consumer the true life cycle cost of using the 19 printhead with the ink need -- needed to run it, you're 20 going to create lots of inefficiencies in the market. 21 You're going to create, first of all, the 22 inefficiencies of enforcing the tie. You're going to 23 create the inefficiencies and social costs of creating 24 alternative routes when the customers seek to go 25 elsewhere.

04-1332 +++$+++     I guess it's true, is it -- I'm testing my own understanding of this -- that if, in fact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter, if you had a State and that State gave a State law remedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail or something, then that State law remedy would continue in existence because the thing in the law that sets aside that State court remedy is a different part of the same chapter --    -- in 2679(b)?    But the whole point of the Westfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of 14  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 action.    A lot of things.    They wanted to get rid of tort suits --    All right.  So, therefore, if in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean, Congress would have both removed the State lawsuits in 2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the exceptions.  But that would have the statute defeat itself, and therefore, that case that you're citing came to a correct result.    That's right?    Okay.

I mean, you could say the 7 purpose of the cause -- of the knock-and-announce 8 rule is to keep people out of there without knocking 9 and announcing. And if that's the purpose of it, 10 it's right within the risk, right cause.    So, you do --   No, no --    -- the difference is --    All right, look, this -- I'd appreciate your explaining this -- this the evidence that ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 is going to be issued anyway.  So, it isn't a question of whether it would have been issued if they had behaved properly, it's a question of what will really happen in the absence of the illegality.    Now, that's what I thought inevitable discovery here was, and, in the absence of these people entering the apartment illegally, they wouldn't have found a thing, because --    -- there was nothing else in motion.

And, by the way, my concern is not that it's a "bad thing," in quotes.  My concern is that it's hard for me to think Congress would have done something that wouldn't have had much effect.    Right.

And if, in fact, 20 I'm right, you see what I'm -- I find your argument 21 excellent on the first part, but so is the 22 Government's.

04-1495 +++$+++     But you really want three things.  You say we want the protection, number one, of there -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that's the end of it.

And I guess, number four, you have to prove the whole thing by clear and convincing evidence.    It sounds a little bit like the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you know, five or -- what about one?    What about this one?  And I want to know -- you simply say you need clear and convincing evidence that that was the motive and it wouldn't have been brought otherwise.  And the existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary. Now, have States and other places tried things like that without the world collapsing?    So as far as you know, every State and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in 19 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even 2 a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause, 3 that's the end of it.

04-1506 +++$+++     Well, I don't understand --    And that's the end of it.    Well, I have no idea about that.  I'm interested in this nest of statutes, and the question I think that I would have is why doesn't the statute propose the route for a State in your -- in your position that I just said.  If they have a good faith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this good faith settlement is attributable to the medical expense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can sue the other party.  And if you're in the case, you just proceed with the suit.    They can't settle your claim out from under you.    I want to go back to the Federal statutes and the State statute.    Why isn't this discussion just suggest what the answer is to the legal question raised?   The answer is, of course, you cannot get a 9 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 hold of this money in the hands of the victim. The 2 money in the hands of the accident victim is not your 3 money. It is not medical expense money. It was 4 stipulated that it is not. That doesn't leave you 5 without a remedy. The remedy is to go against the 6 causer of the accident and get the extra money that you 7 think is entitled to you. The statutes say that 8 literally, and why not just follow them?    Yes, but it's -- it's relevant.  And I'm trying to think through the practicalities of it, which you're more familiar with. Suppose that you win this.  If you win this, then the defendant's insurance companies know that they're subject to further liability for the medicals in every case.  And why won't they sit there and tell you at this settlement, hey, we're not going to enter into this unless you get the State involved so they sign off on it too?  We're not going to just compromise some of 47 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 our liability.

Which is not quite the same volatility perhaps, but --    I have a different question 10 11 I'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed 12 yet. On the expenditure limits, there is a case, 13 Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that 14 expenditure limits are not constitutional. Now, 15 whether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am 16 I not bound by that? 17 And insofar as you try to distinguish it, 18 you've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts 19 to distinguish it. And therefore, I'd like to hear why 20 you think 21 important 22 agreed at 23 I'm not bound by a past precedent in an matter, with which I may or may not have the time.
04-1544 +++$+++     I guess what you're going to hear in 5-10 minutes --    -- you might as well deal with it now --    -- is that the inter vivos -- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interference with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be brought at the time of the probate proceeding.  And for that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that reason, they didn't have jurisdiction.    All right.  Now, let's suppose you're --    -- suppose they're right about their interpretation.    And the strongest case for you on that is?    You said this Court has repeatedly said.  So what --    That -- that sounds to me like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not preemption but, you know, res judicata. But just out of curiosity or -- because I think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing that there was an intent to create the catchall trust? --    It had all those documents.    Why?  Why?  Why?  That is to the finding is, is that there was a different catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go ￼1 married, do it, and they never did it. Now, that seems 2 to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or 3 with the will. It just happens that those are 4 evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely 5 happened with the catchall trust. 6 So I don't see why those are necessary. I 7 don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I 8 don't see whether or not those are barred, those 9 particular facts have anything to do with this, as far 10 as jurisdiction is concerned. 11 Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.    So -- so, in other words, if it -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he gives a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15, nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore.  You have to go to the probate court.

I understand your argument.  Your argument that you have made is, at the very least, you can't say that this deterrent effect is that big a deal.  I mean, now, there were other reasons justifying it.  They said, for example, if one --    Yes, and they made a big case in this.  It's on 188 in the appendix.    And they made a major point. They said that with the newspapers, they set fires, they throw feces.

04-368 +++$+++ 
04-373 +++$+++     It may be close to the truth.  Now, we have a case, a hypothetical.  The defendant is sitting there, the police say, "Question?"  And he says, "I want to see my lawyer."  And the policeman says the following, "That's fine, go ahead, we'll get him.  By the way, if you see him, we'll execute you.  Are you sure you don't want to talk to us?" That's plainly unlawful, isn't it?   Fine.   Now --   Now --   Now, the same thing happens, but is, "You'd better talk to us, or you'll be what he says executed.  Think about it."  Equally unlawful, right?   Okay.   Now, a minute --   -- passes while he's thinking about it.  Okay?  Is it -- is it unlawful now, because a minute has passed before he says yes?   I just --    No.  Now it's 15 minutes.  Now it's 30 minutes.  Okay?  Now, a court says 30 minutes is the same as one minute, "We don't think the passage of 29 extra minutes made a difference."  And what's your reply?  Not in legalism. You're going to say, "Oh, no, the passage of 30 minutes, rather than 1 minute, makes all the difference."  And I would like to know why.   I --   Yes, that's fine. I'm not -- I'm - - I want you to say that kind of thing.  You're saying it's not just 30 minutes, it's "also some other things happened."  What?   So, that's --   -- possible. That definitely cuts 14  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 in your favor, unless, of course, it sounds like a good- cop/bad-cop routine. And --   -- people --   But that's --   -- subjectively true. And so, I'd simply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, and there is a finding that the defendant -- here, we have 30 minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said, "He said he can't talk to us.  We can't do anything about it." We have that.  Is there anything else?    Yes.   -- we have a passage -- JUSTICE STEVENS elementary questions?   The reason that my -- I was able to give my hypothetical before --   -- the reason that you'd have to say, "You will not be better off -- you will not be worse off in respect to the death penalty, by -- you know, we -- it won't" --   -- "make you any better off to talk to the lawyer" -- Sorry.  Strike. The reason that the policeman, to cure, would have to say, "Look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the death penalty, to talk without your lawyer," is because that was the implication of his question, that was the implication - - going to get    -- of the wrongful statement.    The implication was, "You're not death if you talk to us without a lawyer."    But if it had been some other questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative 49  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 implication came out of those questions, which might have been nothing.   So timely --   Yes.   All right, so --
04-433 +++$+++     I'm rather surprised at your answers because I was thinking you want to draw a rather clear line between where fraud is at issue, and only fraud.  Proximate cause, case A, the fraud does nothing but lowers the cost of the firm; case B, the fraud is something that directly is aimed to raise the cost of a particular specified competitor.  I see a clear difference between those two cases, but you apparently don't.    No, no, it's not nebulous. It's absolutely clear.  In the one hand, you are targeting a particular defendant to raise -- a particular competitor to raise his costs.  In the other hand, you are taking an action that simply lowers your own and, therefore, equally will hurt any competitor, whether there's one or a million.    No.  If you had my test, you'd win this case.    No, no.  I don't want to give you a win --    on a theory that --
04-473 +++$+++    I guess our law clerks would every day.   -- anything that goes on in my chamber that isn't a matter of public concern, and I would think everything at OSHA and everything at -- look, I'll -- let me put my question to you, because you're going to make an argument that I don't think is too widely shared; namely, that Pickering decides this case. If that's your argument, I'd like to ask you a question based on the assumption Pickering does not decide this case. And it seems to me that Pickering involves a case in which it's both a matter of public concern and outside the scope of employment. 35  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 a matter of 4 5 6 want to know how you believe the first amendment requires 7 us to decide this case. And as I read this case, in the 8 record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at 9 an affidavit. The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs    And here we have a case that is public concern, but inside.    So, in those circumstances, I 10 were trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up 11 came from. They saw tire tracks. The tire tracks went 12 back to a fence at the end of a long driveway. 13 So, I looked in the record. I couldn't find the 14 affidavit. So, I assume that's what it says. And I 15 wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said. What they 16 said is that your client agreed that there were tire 17 tracks. There were tire tracks that did not go the whole 18 length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the 19 house, where they got the search warrant for. And, they 20 added, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken 21 up. 22 All right. So, we have two sides to this 23 argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that 24 they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were 25 lying. And we also have a letter that your client wrote, 36  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate 2 and clearly misleading. 3 Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says, "I 4 think that that letter is not the right tone. Maybe 5 you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good 6 faith, maybe they're not. And so, if you don't change 7 that tone, I'm going to discipline you." All right? 8 Now, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me, 9 perhaps, very much like this case. How, in your opinion, 10 does the first amendment handle such a matter?   -- a standard.    We live in a world where people are leaking things all the time.  And there are thousands of things that are in the public interest every day.  But what's bothering me is, while I see the Government's rule as protecting the interests of the employer, it's very hard for me to believe that never is there an instance where the first amendment offers protection.  But the only choice you've given me is a rule that says every dispute 50  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 of the public interest is going to go right into constitutional litigation.  And I don't like that either. So, am I hopelessly --    -- forced to choose which is the lesser of the evils, or is there some middle approach that gives discretion to the Government, but doesn't allow them to exceed that discretion in a certain category of cases?  If so, what?  And --    -- how would you phrase it?    Is that your answer?    All right --    -- I've got -- you've got me way.  Now, I'm not saying I -- I have to think 10 part of the 11 this through, but you got part of the way. You say here, 12 there's an independent constitutional basis for the speech 13 being permitted. But, now, still within that, the 14 Government agency has to have some authority to discipline 15 a person, even there, because, after all, he might have 16 been accusing these sheriffs of things that were really 17 not justified by what they, in fact, did. Or maybe he was 18 right. What about that part of the standard? Do you want 19 to say that the Government wins, as long as it behaved 20 reasonably? Do you want to say that the Government loses 21 only if there was an abuse of ordinary employer 22 discretion? Do you want to say the Government -- et 23 cetera. What do you want to say?   All right. Suppose -- MS. ROBIN-VERGEER hypothetically.  Indeed, the employer has broad discretion to discipline the employee for the manner -- or whatever he does -- even in such an area, but that discretion can be abused.  And, therefore, it is up to the judge to determine whether a jury could find such abuse of discretion here. standard.
04-480 +++$+++     What's the answer?    -- but the problem, of course, is that it could well be, in each of those instances, that there will be vast numbers of infringing uses that are foreseeable.
04-495 +++$+++     So -- so this -- I mean, that's what I don't understand what this case is about because I -- I'm amazed that -- I think it is too detailed what they're requiring of you, by far. But the elements are I have to know.  I'm an inmate.  I want to know what is this about.  Suppose I think they're wrong.  I need to know how to tell them they're wrong.  And the other thing I think I'd need to know is after the committee or the warden decides against me, what are his reasons.  I'm not asking for a book.  All I want to know are the basic reasons. Now, those things I can't work out from the briefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him 14  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 those new things, those two things, or doesn't.    -- and a summary of the evidence relied on.  Now, I'm just reading that.  What is it I'm reading?    All right.  Where is -- where    I'm sorry.  You go ahead.    What that tells him is nothing facts.  That tells him he's been charged.    Now, the new policy goes on to ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So your point is in the past, they didn't give them the information.    Then they promulgated a new policy and the new policy says nothing about it.   Well, what it says about --    So why can't I assume they will tell him so he'll know what's going on?  And then if they don't, you'd have an as-applied challenge.    That was before the new policy.    What I'm now saying is I can understand exactly why you might feel the way you do.  But our job is to not necessarily take that feeling.  But shouldn't we presume that the State will administer words that comport with the basic elements, not every detail as you want, but they will administer this new policy in accord with those basic elements of fairness?  Isn't that giving a -- sort of like a deference to the State, which maybe we should?    Can you just give me 1 minute on the other issue?
04-514 +++$+++     If you're -- if you're going to -- if you're going to consider something that wasn't a recall of a mandate as if it was, why don't you consider it as a rule 41(b) action?    They didn't recall it, didn't -- did they?  Did they recall it?  They issued it and then recalled it?    Fine.    Correct.  So we did -- they didn't recall it.  So, of course, 41(b) does not have to do with recalls.  41(b) has to do with issuances, and 41(b) says the court may shorten or extend the time for issuing.  Now, why wouldn't that be the obvious rule to apply to what occurred here?     Is that --    But isn't that the reading of circuit?    And all the circuits have just been wrong in their interpretation.    I don't either.
04-563 +++$+++    No, but every lower court that has -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller. Is that true, or not true?   No, of course not in the habeas context. I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the civil law, wouldn't we use the word "core operative fact"? Or would we? I'm not as familiar with this as you. What is the answer? --   No?   But, of course, we're trying to decide what is the transaction.   Right. So what about the injury? What about that? That the injury -- the trial's over, say, six weeks -- the injury takes place at the time of introduction? Or is the injury the whole time the -- the guilty verdict?   Well, why doesn't the 1981 -- given -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly, but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? I think the injury that took place from both violations took place at the time of trial.   Okay, I --   Forget it.

Victims of efforts to interfere 2 with a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they 3 can't. And one question is whether this particular 4 individual fits within those doctrines. And you have 5 to be an expert on contract law to know. 6 But in respect to the civil rights law, I 7 guess your position is -- and this is what I want to 8 know -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to 9 be the same for white people as for black people.    So how do we deal with this? to say, do I have to become an expert on law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the look, the -- the question here is not what the law is except insofar as it's relevant to 18 That is 19 contract 20 circuit, 21 contract 22 whether there's a differential in treatment?
04-597 +++$+++    They say, "Of course you have to make a motion." And, so far, I've heard no response whatsoever to what I'd think is a fairly basic question in this case. And I'm assuming   Ever?   If there's no evidence at all. You have a patent, and a patent is a monopoly.  And so, what -- obviously, it monopolizes a market, it monopolizes the market of the patent.  And you'd have to be a genius in antitrust law to know something's wrong with that argument.  And so, how could it all be plain?   That has nothing to do with my   You were saying that the mistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that there was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was a market. So, I'm saying a person who knows a little, but not a lot, of antitrust law would think, "Obviously, there's a market here. There's the market covered by the patent."   Obviously, there's injury, because a patent allows you to raise the price. End of 45  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 the matter.

04-607 +++$+++     But you told the -- you said, judge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies section 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and concise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate Morse?    And you argued that specifically?  And so your problem -- I guess that you said that.  I mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on page 6.    And it's the language.    That's what it said.  It 10 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 didn't say Morse. It said Diehr. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 paragraph on 9 argument. 10 11 12 simply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to 13 get us to think seriously about it.    Dier incorporates Morse.

"The correlating step is a simple conclusion 5 that a cobalamin/folate deficiency exists vel non based on 6 the assaying step." 7 And what that means is now, as a result of the 8 Federal Circuit's decision, unlike the district court's 9 decision, we now know that every homocysteine test 10 automatically infringes because every doctor will 11 reflexively look at it and think about the phenomenon 12 associated with it.

The fact is we don't know what that original panel thought. 21 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Absolutely right.

But we can't be sure what they would have done, and because we can't be sure what they would have done, I guess it might well have made a difference that the State told that panel we think Stumpf pulled the trigger.

But what's the principle according to which we're drawing it?    But the --
04-881 +++$+++     It didn't contain the bar at the time that they said, "You can collect it."  In the later statute, which said, "You now can collect out of Social Security," when they passed that, did it contain a 10-year bar?    I thought the Higher Education Act said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act say, "No statute of limitations applies to us"?    Fine.  In --    -- 1991, it said, "No statute of limitations applies to us."  Then, in what year did the statute -- was passed which said, "And you can collect money out of Social Security payments for higher education"?    All right.  Why isn't that the end of it?  So --    -- so there was no -- there was no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security Act; and then, in 1996, they say, "And now go get them."    What can we do about that?    What did they say?    It has a 10-year bar.  But the earlier 1991 Act says, "That doesn't apply to us." 6  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005    Is that what your -- I'm trying to understand this.    Yes.    Okay.     The only problem is, it doesn't say that.    All right, but that's --    -- unless there's some special    -- for thinking that it And so, what's the special reason --    -- here?  You have an earlier
04-885 +++$+++     Tell me, if you're -- if you're right -- let's suppose you're right.  I'm over here.  That's -- [Laughter.]    That's all right.  So, it's hard to figure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the sound.  I don't know if there's a modern system that would help with that, but -- you're right. Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right. What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak, and they owe a lot of money to the States.  So, the States figure this out after a while.  It takes a few years to seep through, but once they see what they can do, they say, "Here's what we'll do.  Settle your claims against the State, which happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar.  Give us the money.  And you're -- we're out of it."  So, they settle it. A month later, bankrupt. Now, two things have happened.  The States got 50 cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the dollar, because they were a month ahead of it.  The second thing that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to come in and be rehabilitated.  So, the result of this is two bad 6  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors 2 fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance 3 to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined. So, given the 4 Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say 5 that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very, 6 very seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic 7 purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?
04-905 +++$+++    So, you go back to the language -- are you finished with that answer? Go ahead and finish, if you want.   In respect to the language, how do you read it? I think it's ambiguous. "To discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities." Do you read it -- "different purchaser" -- "to discriminate in price in respect to that commodity that is purchased"? Do you read it "to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities -- i.e., the commodity, the particular item -- the commodity there refers to the particular item in respect to which there is the discrimination"? How do you want to read it, literally? I just want your --    -- literal reading of the statute to -- I agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it.  I agree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side.  I agree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particular language.  So, look at the phrase and read the language as you want me to read it.   That's all I want --   -- the textual answer.   Oh, no, no. I'm very --   -- was conceded in this case, that effect on the competition. There are two separate 6 7 there's the 8 things. There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored 9 dealer. In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the 10 statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that 11 doesn't count. I'm not focusing on that. 12 I am focusing upon the truck that he did not 13 purchase. The reason that the disfavored dealer did not 14 purchase that truck is that he had a rival -- maybe there's only 15 one case of it, but there's at least one -- he had a rival, the 16 favored dealer, who got the purchase. He got the order from the 17 customer, and then ordered the truck. Now, in that one, I take 18 it, the 19 dealer. 20 21 problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored    All right.  But what you're hearing what?  He was a dealer whose line of business was to 22 is, "So 23 purchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a 24 commodity -- namely, Volvo trucks."   Yes.   The effect of such discrimination next-door rival, in effect, "got the sale." Do you that isn't enough?   Let's assume I don't agree with you Now --   -- what?   Fine. That's --    You've put your finger right on it. My question is so obvious that you're not giving me an answer. Every case for 60 years has been on your side of it.  Those judges, though, were -- must have been reading some language. And how did they interpret that language?  That's all I'm asking you.  A very literal question.  It has nothing to do with policy or anything.  And all I want you to do is take the statute and read the language so that it is possible for you to win this case.    Okay.   No, I said -- I said they -- in -- for you is that, in respect to discrimination item, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase 41  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 of injury. In respect to instances where you have a strong case 2 of the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as I 3 just defined it.    When he didn't get the sale, there was no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer in respect to which the discrimination existed. --    Okay?  Now, it's that second class    Yes.    Of course it's distinct.  Of course --   Oh, well, you have a --    You suggest something very -- to me, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, I think, from prior law that --    If you want to go look at this, you know, you say, all right, here's -- we should be realistic about it.  We're going to be realistic.  Realistic, they -- we're only 50  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 now looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item, but the profit was lower.  There's no purchaser problem.    But they got a lower profit.  And I think, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that that counts as an injury.    Yes.  Yes, but it's -- you know, it shows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out of business.    Indeed, the market in -- the dealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market, which it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the result of -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there that would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust law.  So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to Morton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that was quite formalistic.  It didn't really look to the injury to competition in a market.  It had a formalistic slogan that would, in fact, be a proxy for that.    So, what do follow your -- we follow your advice, we 51 you think of that?  We say, "Okay, we're going Washington, DC 20005 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- ￼1 to be very realistic in the future. Forget the presumptions. 2 And, court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of 3 increased concentration through people going out of business, 4 will lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies 5 there." What about that? I mean, I don't know if you -- you 6 know, I --
04-928 +++$+++     Can you --    Can you --    Well, that isn't the thrust 22 is that if, in fact, this evidence from the 23 comes in under State law, it comes in under 24 because -- I have the cite; you know the --    But under --    -- Oregon law, what is not clear is -- you want to put the mother on the stand.    Now, do you want to go into anything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?    I mean, that --    That's right.  So --    -- that's why I want that.  That's what's ambiguous.    Look, you only get to go into something if it was not otherwise -- if it is otherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to. The reason they think it is relevant is because of a constitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court. So, if you want to go into something, we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant.  If you want to ask the same thing, that's just a question of whether you have to have a transcript or a live witness.  And I don't know that that's a question that 39 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 depends on their constitutional holding.  So, I want to know, Do you want to go into things that are not there in the original trial, yes or no?    Okay.    Now, I'm not being tricky I want to know if we have to go to the words relevant" in the Oregon statute -- relevant," particularly in respect to this about it. "otherwise "otherwise question of residual doubt.    I really would like an answer, if possible.    Right.  And they said that relevance is -- of residual doubt is relevant.  And the reason that it's relevant is because the Constitution of the United States requires the jury to hear it.    That is what I am focusing on, and I want to know if you want to go into "otherwise relevant," for that reason. 42 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Okay.  So, let's go to the constitutional --    -- issue.  Now, let's imagine we have a trial.  And at the trial, we have a lot of evidence about the alibi.    And what the State Court says, "This is our law.  When a person is" -- now go to the sentencing phase, the jury has heard it --    Okay?  So, they take it into account.  And, moreover, we tell them they have to consider it.    Okay?  That's a State law. Now, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle, and now we go back just to the sentencing?  Here's what we do.  We introduce the transcript.  And, moreover, we introduce some live witnesses to say what they said before, but nothing else. Now, you're saying there is a constitutional right to present an additional witness on the matter 45 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that has already been litigated to go into things that were not there in the trial before.    Now, my goodness, if you had real evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the first time?  And if, in fact, you -- it's not such good evidence, and so forth, why does the State have to waste its time to hear some more about the alibi that you didn't put in the first time?  I mean, you know, that's what you're saying the Constitution protects. I'm being a little skeptical.  I want to know what your answer is.    No, I'm agreeing with you --    -- insofar as you have a right to put in what you've put in the first time.    I agree with you on that one.  But you said you wanted to do something else. You wouldn't say, "We don't want to do something else."

I might think that 10   a design is a component or it isn't a component, but 11   think of these three features:  One, this is something 12   that is totally modular.  It is developed, bought and 13   sold entirely independent of any of the hardware to 14   which it is, with which it is combined, and between 15   which it moves continuously as it operates.  Number two, 16   it can be removed or updated entirely independently of 17   the other components.  And it is dynamic, unlike 18   designs, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to 19   make something, all of which are exhausted.  They have 20   done their work when the thing is made.  That's why 21 22 23 24   about how to make something.  They are instructions 25   about what the other things that are made should do and those things are called hardware.

The difference with the rule you are 20   advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A 21   with your first case, is going to have to guess whether 22   it is in this case or not in this case necessarily 23   related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're 24   going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.

05-1256 +++$+++     Can I ask you -- are you    I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that  ￼ 1   to a different person who wasn't there.  Now -- so he 2   couldn't defend against him.  That person didn't present 3   a claim.  So we are certain of that. 4               Now, we're not certain whether that's what 5   happened here.  It may have done.  There is certainly a 6   lot of language to suggest it, and there is some 7   language the other way.  So we remand it to the court 8   with that instruction that they cannot permit this to 9   have happened if it happened.  Whether it happened and 10   what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part 11   and things about instructions, etc.  Now, what's your 12 13 14 15   with the position we are taking.  Whether it happened 16   here or not is an interesting question.  It is in the 17   nature of a limiting instruction, which was basically 18   what this was.  You can use the evidence for one 19   purpose, legitimate purpose, but don't use it for an 20   illegitimate purpose.  But we can't tell ordinarily, 21   because jury deliberations are secret and we can't probe 22   what they have decided, we can't probe whether they have 23   imposed global punishment or not. 24               But we anticipate the problem.

It's not meant    I want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical. (Laughter.)    I'm not -- I'm asking you --    -- to answer my hypothetical please.  If in fact -- you didn't want me to repeat it?    Then what is the answer?    In your view, is my hypothetical covered or not?    It is not.    And therefore, if we accept 13 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 your interpretation, then all those employers who, 2 instead of contributing directly to health funds, 3 instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, 4 will discover they do not have the advantage of the 5 fifth priority.    Well, they're doing that to get a standard.    And I'd like to know what your -- they're trying to use that as a basis for separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp from the health benefit.  And they're saying here's an example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the same side as the health benefit.  Now, that's their approach. What's your approach to the standard? What 52 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 rule or system would you use from deciding which 2 insured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and 3 which ones don't?    So if, in fact -- if, in State legislature mandates certain health then the plan that provides those benefits ￼1 they suggest, and it truly is a broadening. It is not 2 subrogation. The bondholder would not have a 3 subrogated claim. F&M Bank would not have a subrogated 4 claim. They would have a claim, a direct claim, just 5 as Zurich does here. 6 And I think that the issue we come back to -- 7 and I'm glad my brothers ended with that as well because 8 that's where we began. The issue is what is the 9 Court's proper approach to this attempt to enlarge the 10 priority under subsection (a)(4). It is not correct 11 that this Court departs from the idea that priorities 12 are a deviation from the bedrock principle of equality 13 of -- equality of distribution. That remains good law, 14 cited by this Court a number of times. 15 The cases they purportedly cite to the 16 contrary were plain language cases, were Embassy 17 Restaurant and Joint Industries Board. This Court 18 didn't even feel necessary to cite that principle 19 because of the -- because of the plain language. Where 20 is the plain language establishing clearly, as this 21 Court requires, that this is a plan? Where is the 22 plain language establishing clearly that this is an 23 employee benefit? The insurance policy. That's what 24 we're talking 25 statute. The 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 about.  Not the workers' compensation insurance policy may benefit the 54 Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 employer.  The statute may benefit the employee.  But we are talking about contributions to an employee benefit plan.  Zurich's insurance policy is neither. Unless there are further questions, Mr. Chief Justice, that concludes my argument. Strain.

Now I think there'd be the difference that 18   you're trying to argue, and I don't think it cuts or 19   you.  Because in the first case, what they've done is 20   hire somebody to perform a governmental function.  In 21   the second case, what they've done is to the people who 22   are regulated and have the interest, in announcing they 23   have red apples, they've said, you do it yourself.    The other possibility is they say to the apple companies, you do your own  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Chairman of the -- Chairman of the FTC said why.  Here's 2   why; he said it's better undertaken by private 3   researchers.  It's a mechanism that we can rely on to 4   ensure accurate reporting. 5               Then, what the FTC did is to supervise the 6   performance of the test.  It goes into the laboratories. 7   It makes sure it has done it its way.  And then it 8   accepts those results --    All right.  So what you are saying is that this function is so separable and it is so much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating it to the third party that did nothing of the testing, that even if you delegate it to the second party which does testing and then benefits from the testing, that's still not enough to take it out.    Is that -- have I got that    I, I see the argument now.    Then is there any, any 39 authority ever, that you found for that? (Laughter.)  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    I have a quick question.  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Is there anything in the complaint that alleges you 2   didn't perform the tests properly?

The FTC perceives it as -- these industries 19   -- and these companies, and as I said, even the 20   petitioners in their remand petition are challenging the 21   low tar and nicotine rate measured by the company's 22   testing procedures.  So yes, I'd like to have it be 23   something different but it isn't something different. 24   It is what the companies have done, and through this    No, I said apple institute. You know, that seemed to me to be the case where it was the apple institute or whatever it was that was the delegate, and then they applied the test, and the people they were applying the test to weren't. 25   mechanism.
05-130 +++$+++     On Justice Scalia's question, I was trying to think of some, and I was trying to think the analogy might -- you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a ferris wheel or something.  What you want is a person who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed the public generally.  And now would a -- would a court issue an injunction there?  And as I think about that, I don't realize I don't know the answer.    Yes, that's what -- I mean, that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to use his property and never uses it himself.    And there, I don't know how courts do normally act in other areas of property law.    Why?  I mean, I think there are so many factors that could enter into it.    What I was going to ask was if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and, moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large, will not take that product and develop it further, then it's fairly easy to calculate damages. Now, couple that with a client or a patentee who also waits for a long time, waits till the invention is embedded in a series of other inventions so that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far 41 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- more than this particular invention is worth because the infringer would have to give up the entire invention.    Couple that with a patent that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief, reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me, that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent their process for a supermarket.  I -- I mean, you'd worry about that as a judge.  And couple that with all the other things that are here. Now, special case?  Why not?    The main point -- what I was trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the patent troll case.    On that very point, my question there really was -- that was the heart of it -- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent- related value attached to whether you practice it yourself or not.  It's just that when you license it, 44 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- it's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.    But it's easier to calculate the damage.  Now, at least in some subset of cases. So if you have a case where, on the one hand, it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the same time you fear that to issue an injunction will produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in the balance.    So the -- other things being equal --    No.  Willful, willful.  It wouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's willful, the reason that he might be willful is he thinks that the patentee is holding him up.

So they're just saying, we only 20   get the ones that are in conflict.  Now, they then have 21   a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they 22   don't.

But I want to come back to why it is that the multiemployer plan distributes the assets in precisely the same way that the purchase of an annuity from an insurance company does.    They do not, okay.  So I'm trying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   administrator then has to do?

What are, what is it we are    No.  No.  I'm not, I'm 8   distributing?  A simple question, I guess, for a 9   statistician.  I unfortunately am not one and can't find 10 11 12 13 14 15   know what I'm distributing.  And if you don't know I one, so I have no idea what this statute means. (Laughter.)    Not a value.  I want to 16 17 18 19   that you did know what it was.  I thought you simply 20   quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.    I'm sorry, I don't know how 11  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers?  If    So, so in other words we 10   you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute 11   is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?    Well, I -- I thought not. Is there a --    Yeah -- that -- right.  But I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, a set of things that's being distributed in a certain order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.    And if that's what percentile refers to, I just want to know what those 10 11   things are that are being distributed.  And - and that's 12   where I find the ambiguity.  And if there is an 13   ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the 14   agency at least as I understand it.  So -- so that's why 15   I asked the question.    Clearly.    No, you could do it that way and the reason the Government, I think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result.    That the object of the 15   statute is to catch the outliers.  And if you, for  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   number of small LEAs at the bottom, which is I think a 2   huge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and 3   let them to float off in their poverty.  I think, I can 4   understand where there is --    That's all right.  I 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   and you win.  But if the language does permit it, the 25   reason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect,    I understand that.  If the language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, 20  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in my view to get to the Government's result.  It might 2   just barely permit it.  But one of the things on their 3   side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd 4   result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because 5   there is such variation in the number of pupils among 6   school districts in different states.    Why doesn't it -- why 21 22 23 24   such per-pupil expenditure.  And that --    And why, why don't you take the top five where we have 10 percent of the students, let's take the second five and they happens to have the same number on the card as the first five, and why don't they fall in the first 5 percent?    Now how are you going to get that so it doesn't just say just list cards with per-pupil expenditure on it, different ones and take the top five?    Do you have a lot of cards have a lot --    Yeah.    How do you want to say it, per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?    Or how do you want to say 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   pupil?  You say the word such is broad enough to include 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 per-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil?    And I don't know where to look to discover if you're right or wrong.

Where the incompatibility exists is post 6   deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having 7   these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if 8   you can get the longer statute of limitations under the 9   general refund statute.

I'm trying to get at the question is this the union's money or is this the workers', the teachers' money?    So does he get this money back if they violate the statute.    And you're saying that the real problem with this statute is that it throws in ballot issues along with candidate elections.    But on that first one, did they discuss that at some length in the lower court - Subject to Final Review 10   opinion?  I don't --    And I see that you've put a lot of weight on this argument. 1 2 3 4 5 6   this.  That's viewpoint discrimination.  But this is 7 8 9 content discrimination and the Court has held in Consolidated Edison and a number of other cases that that is also a constitutional problem.    What you're saying right now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the word "election." 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   to consider.  I also think it's a matter that when we 24   get to that point at least --    And the lower court didn't consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back for other things such as the State Constitution, for them to consider this matter on remand?    If that's yes, then the 53  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   category here is election speech.  If you're going to 2   call a statute that treats election speech especially, 3   then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in 4   that category.

And courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny to campaign finance regulation because there are speech interests on both sides of the equation.    I'm glad you said yes to me because that implies a no to the last question. (Laughter.)

05-200 +++$+++     It's quite possible no one in Congress thought about this --    -- which is common.  So if it is common, why is it that we would not use the same approach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in Kimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the contract?  Whereas here, the rights at stake are really those of the United States in that they are going to get the money.  We have a statute.  We have all those things I just listed.  It covers only Federal employees.  Should -- there are strong interests in uniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera. So what is the difference between this case, other than a technical difference?  I concede that one. The title is not United States.  It's Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever.    Empire, et cetera.  But aside from that, why is it different?    I -- I wasn't thinking of of uniformity. (Laughter.)    I was thinking of the contract -- the contracts that the carriers enter into 38 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 with the individual Federal employees in different 2 places. And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those 3 contracts all read the same or they don't. And so far, 4 you have found one example of where they read 5 differently. Some contracts apparently say when you 6 reimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and 7 others say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract 8 attorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it. 9 And I grant you that is a difference. 10 And I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as 11 to whether you have to get OPM approval for that 12 difference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off, 13 we want the same. And also I'd like other examples. 14 What I'm trying to do, to be clear about it, 15 is I'm trying to see how similar this is to the 16 instance of the Federal employee checks, which this 17 Court many, many years ago said, when you pay your 18 Federal employees and you write a check, it's Federal 19 law that's going to govern the interpretation of the 20 endorsement. I want to see how similar it is and how 21 different. 22 I have two differences. One is the name on 23 this case is Empire, not United States, and the second 24 difference is the one you just mentioned about may 25 rather than must. Now, are there others? 39 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    Well, I would have thought is whether Federal law governs this --    -- and they come to Federal So what is clearly -- maybe I -- maybe you've ￼1 throughout the country and then it seeks to recover 2 from one of the drawees or one of the people who 3 endorsed the check on the ground it was fraudulent, we 4 know that it is Federal law that must govern those 5 checks. Right? From Clearfield.   That's quite good. What are you reading from?    So it's identical.  There is no difference between every individual's contract, every Federal employee's -- I guess it's a contract with the Federal employee.  Isn't it?  I mean, he's bound by it you say.    All right.  So I am -- in Alaska, Virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece of paper.  They enroll and then they're bound by it.    And the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.
05-204 +++$+++ 
05-259 +++$+++     Well, the answer would be because Congress is worried that people won't complain. 7 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1   you insult them.  You -- I mean, it's easy to think of 2 3 4 5   the D.C. Circuit standard?  They -- they say that you 6   have to show that the employer's action would have been 7   material, which means the action might well have things that don't rise to the level of the -- Ellerth. So, I mean, if I -- maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say, 8   dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting 9   a charge of discrimination.  Now, how about that?  That 10   has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed, 11   et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also 12   allows the judge to focus on the particular case and 13   see if what the person is doing is reasonable.  It 14   holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness, 15   which is common in law.    Well, in fact, if it turns out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the person can't be at the power lunch because she's a woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that ￼1   count as a violation?    -- to me there are many, many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list 22   Circuit -- much -- the standards seem much -- not as 23   different as you might -- as it seems to me you're 24   saying.  But -- but they're -- they're trying to be a 25   little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific 17 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1   Ellerth language because they recognize there are many 2   possible ways of seriously injuring a person with the 3   intent or -- to stop them from complaining.  That gives 4   effect to the language differences.    And that's the virtue of their standard.

05-380 +++$+++     All right.  If that's right --     And that's the area of    Now, Congress has said that --    Right.  Fine.  Okay.  They make a finding that although we don't disagree with 18  ￼22 23 24 25   the statute.  That might be a permissible way of  1   that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health 2   or safety of the mother.  That's where we are.  Now as I 3   look at the record, I see many, many, many doctors 4   telling Congress and everybody else that it is 5   necessary, and safe.  And I see other doctors telling 6   Congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't 7   necessary, ever for safety. 8               And so if medical opinion is divided, and 9   I'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to 10   know your reaction.  If medical opinion is divided, why 11   wouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say 12   this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to 13   permit its use but only where appropriate medical 14   opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of 15   the mother? 16 17   such case so it's no problem.  But if Congress is wrong, 18   then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure 19   and Congress couldn't object to that because the 20   Congress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then 21   Congress was wrong.  They agreed that we had a health or Now, if Congress is right, there will be no safety exception.    And otherwise not.

Disagree.  I'd like to hear the answer. (Laughter.)    Yes.    Yes, which would have to be a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the plaintiff that falls within (b). 34 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    In other words, if -- I mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue in a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted or not.  They've never had an appeal.  So they get it tried.  The whole case is tried out, and then the -- some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted. But they can't decide that.  They can't decide it because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite in the same case before the case was final.    And if they don't -- and if they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say, this is the same case?  There is only one case.  It isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think that district judge was wrong.  We think that Federal district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising since it was decided after he wrote the opinion. (Laughter.) 41 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    But it's so odd.    So -- so it goes back to the State court and the State court says, yes, that's right.  We've not heard of Romania either.  It's not a country. All right.  Now, you're saying there we are for all time.  Everybody is stuck with this holding.    Is that right?  Maybe that's why I'm so surprised that such could be the law.    Then the district wrong too I guess because the district court same -- court was made the
05-416 +++$+++     I'm think -- oh, well, I guess -- unlike IIRIRA, it is apparently unknown.    There was a predecessor act, 10 and the predecessor act used this same language, just 11 about. And what it said was, "Judge, you may require 7 it isn't 8 9 12 exhaustion of such remedies as are available." And, given 13 that language, nobody thought that was a procedure default 14 rule; it just meant the judge, if there's a remedy 15 available, can say, "Prisoner, go do it," in an 16 appropriate case. And all that happened here, if you look 17 at the history, is, they changed the "may" to a "must." 18 And all the people that wrote in were writing in about 19 that. Nobody dreamt, nobody said, nothing suggests, that 20 what Congress intended to do was to bring in the 21 procedural default aspect of it. And there would have 22 been a lot of objections if they had. So, that's the 23 argument the other way. 24 Now, I'd like to know what do you have at all 25 that overcomes what I just said? 7 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 part, the 3 -- that's 4 Honor is referring to -- in part, precluded the 5 possibility of a default -- procedural default bar largely 6 because it required a continuance of a case for 90 -- or I 7 believe it started out as 180 days, and then became 90 8 days. And -- in order to permit the judge to order the 9 inmate to go back and exhaust -- and under those 10 circumstances, even if he had been untimely by virtue of 11 the continuance language, he was, nonetheless, permitted 12 to return to Federal Court. So, I think by virtue of the 13 language of the statute, it's at least possible that 14 Congress had a -- deliberately excluded that possibility. 15 Moreover, I think that the statutory history and   Uh-huh.   All right. So, I take it from your answer he didn't really say anything helpful to you --   -- except to refer to the name of the case --   -- in which case, what we have on the -- all right. Is that right?    Denied.    Okay.  Now, I'd say that's -- means he isn't exhausting.  He's failed to exhaust, as I'm using the term.    All right.    Now, I want to get rid of that argument.

Was that involving a -- is Yes. And was that involving a party or noise, or what was it involving?    I mean, I wouldn't want this to be the party case.

05-608 +++$+++ 
05-669 +++$+++  
05-705 +++$+++     You haven't. Maybe -- if this 10   doesn't clarify it.  I think everyone has about the same 11   question.  You have a bunch of pay phone operators.  And 12   if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody 13   would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much.  You 14   owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree 15   that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring 16   a lawsuit and get the 2 cents.  Right under 47 U.S.C. 17   201(b). 18          Now, the only difference here seems to be that it 19   wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much. 20   They weren't paying what they owed.  They should have 21   paid what they owed.  And that, says the FCC, is, under 22   201(b), an unreasonable practice.  And, therefore, go in 23   and collect it in court.  Now, what is the answer to 24   that? 25          So far I have heard nothing that suggests 14  ￼1   that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 2   201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was.  Now, 3   what's wrong with what I said?  I'm simply trying to  4 5 6 7   with that, Justice Breyer.  The first thing is that in 8   contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in 9   the absence of regulations, long distance providers would 10   owe pay phone operators zero.  There's no reason why long 11   distance providers would give money to pay phone 12   operators. 13          The 24 cents here is to capture what callers 14   owe the pay phone operators.  And so the FCC has come up 15   with an administrative system.  But there's nothing 16   unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not 17   giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory 18   regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is 19   unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example 20 --    Okay.  Then what should we do?    Just like AT&T when, in fact -- or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way  ￼ 1   think, has captained that position.  And what we're 2   saying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is 3   something that long distance providers or any common 4   carrier ought to be compensating somebody for.  But what 5   we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative 6   creature.  And then it gets to the second reason why --
05-746 +++$+++     As we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13. Instruction 13 used the word direct.    You object to 13.  You said it should use the word in whole or in part. 12  ￼    All right.  So if I reread the blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, that your real objection, not responding to the other side, has simply been about the standard to use in  ￼ask them that.    You're going to say yes. So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether -- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole or in part.    Causation.    I think I'm seeing now, I think the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on  ￼ 1   the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it 2   violated the equivalence.  But as soon as you do that, 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 you're going to have to think about what the right standard should be for a new trial.    And if you stop there, probably, they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the right standard.    And if you really think about it, you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one that the court gave, is the right standard and should 14 15 16 17 18   happens in the future.  Now --    But you're saying unless you say that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what  ￼ 1   language of the statute itself?    The other side submits a proposed  ￼13 14 15 16   And I don't think we disagree about that either.  It 17   specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation 18   may be present.  And if it is, if the defendant is at 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 least one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers even slightly --
05-785 +++$+++     Why couldn't there be here?  I mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not - Subject to Final Review 1   fundamental rights that we need to order them removed. 2   Not just as a matter of supervisory power, but as a 3   constitutional requirement. 4          So it is a spectrum test, Your Honor.  And it's 5   essentially a totality test of the circumstances of the 6   buttons, let's say, and there can't be a bright line 7   rule.  The circumstances -- 11   exaggerate.  But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea. 12   For obvious reasons. 13          Now, at some point, if enough judges say that, 14   each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't 15   say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that 16   inherent risk that it's unconstitutional.  But if some 17   point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is 18   quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a 19   courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does 20   it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what 21   opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and 22   unconstitutional?    Absolutely right.  Suppose you think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners, posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   lines among buttons.  It is pretty hard to draw lines 18   among banners.  And the only way to guarantee fair trials 19   in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this.  No Now, why?  Not just because of decorum.  But because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury. And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do, I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters. How would you explain -- you just say the law 20 21 22 23 24 25   that?  Because that is a concern I have. just doesn't permit that.    What do you want to say about 16  ￼ - Subject to Final Review
05-848 +++$+++ 
05-908 +++$+++     Okay.
05-983 +++$+++     And it says that the procedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   about the whole Act.  Throughout the whole Act, they 33 word, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure in the same section, without saying anything, would be just for the students and not for the parents? that way. I mean, I find that hard to read the statute    No, I'm not.  I'm talking  ￼talk about parents and students.    And who writes the check? The student?    No.  Of course.  The parent  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               Now why should I read that it way?    He can't complain in court or -- well, it sounds as if you were saying that. You're saying that the hearing officer has to decide against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent. 37  ￼ - Subject to Final Review Isn't that your point?    Oh, well -- right.  I'm    Oh, I would agree, we can be on the same grounds there.    I agree that if the parent isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to complain about, you know, whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if 25 that -- 38  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   parent has something to complain about.  The parent 5   hasn't got the money that he was supposed to get.  Now 6   we have something to complain about, so therefore, we're 7   aggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved 8   person can go to court.    So, now it looks as if the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   parents have procedural rights unless that procedural -- 2   or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in 3   aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents.  We 4   give procedural protection to people in order to 5   vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, 6   and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart. 7   You're saying one person has a substantive right, the 8   other people have procedural right.  And I don't see 9   conceptually how you can make that split.  And if you don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the right to the free public -- the free appropriate public education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, a right of the family group, the parents and the child together, rather than the right of the child alone. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   right to a FAPE to the child.  And because the child 22   does not have capacity, Congress implemented a pragmatic 23   system to allow the parents to protect those rights. So conceptually, how do you defend the distinction that you make between substantive rights on one person and procedural rights in another?    States --    -- if some people bring claims against you under this because you didn't have a good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant. Isn't that what you're saying it says?    You don't pay for it, you can't pay for it out of the grant?    Okay.  So we're not paying 10 11 12   for this, you pay for it.  Is that right?  ￼ - Subject to Final Review

The U.S. Code is filled with the 14   word "attempt."  Just opening it at random, there are 15   attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are 16   attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to 17   rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there. 18               Is it the Government's practice whenever 19   they charge a violation of any of these provisions to 20   not just use the word "attempt," but to use the words 21   "substantial step"?

They impute the additional service to you.    Now I understand it. Now, this individual says, I was working there after the age of 55, I only worked for 14 years, 23 24   Mr. Justice.  Justice Breyer, the reason that you get 25   additional before age 55 is the same as the reason why 5    And not after?    Okay.  Now I'll say that I think is the discrimination of which he is complaining. And now what he would like to know is what possible  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               Now, explain to me what the reason is for 2   that.    No.  He says now, what he  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   and-a-half percent per year.  Good, I'm glad you do 2   that.  Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half 3   percent as well.  Treat us alike. 4               What's your response?    But that's the point,    There -- that's what the complaint is, I think, that you say it's the second part  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that you just said.  What you do when the person is 2   disabled and he is not yet 55 -- he hasn't qualified 3   yet -- is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him 4   you give him credit for years he hasn't worked.  Now, 5   the older person who is still working and is also 6   disabled says:  Fine, you let me retire, but you don't 7   give me any extra years. 8               Now that's the complaint, I think.  So that 9   if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to 10   retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he 11   is credited with 14 years; while the person who started 12   at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years. 13   He is given the 10 extra years.  So the first person, 14   older person, says:  You gave him some extra years; you 15   didn't have to give him those extra years in order to 16   qualify him to retire.  You could have just said you can 17   retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me 18   no extra years.  Why not? 19 20 21 22   eligible to retire.  The plan is a single plan that 23   provides a benefit.  If you start older, you have to 24   work less to get there.  By the same token, by starting 25   closer to retirement you need less added to your balance

But if the government's right, then the reason Congress did this is that it recognized what I think is the truth, that felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in many different ways under the laws of many different States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition. - Subject to Final Review Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself which is a more plausible purpose. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   misdemeanors or felonies.

The safety valve being that 10 11   the party leaders cannot just choose anybody.

If you assume it is self-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find out -- you said that the President was unreasonable in a sense of saying Texas do that over again -- I assume the reason he asked Texas to have the hearing is because the ICJ knew -- and I guess maybe he knew -- that the only hearing they'd had on this subject -- as far as I can see; I looked at it, there didn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their 21 22 23 24 25 had a lawyer, but that lawyer later got into quite a lot of trouble, I think.    He had two lawyers.  One got into trouble, and the other didn't? 70 - Subject to Final Review    Okay, they vigorously defended him.    Fine.  Fine.  My point is there's no evidence of that.    There is?  In the first habeas hearing? 10 11 12 13 14   affidavit from the Mexican Consulate.  Once the Mexican 15   Consulate started assisting Medellin, they prepared an 16   affidavit, and the affidavit said if we had been 17   contacted, we would have told you not to confess; and we 18   would have told you to get a lawyer.  The problem with 19   that is Medellin confessed within about three hours of 20   being arrested, and even the ICJ in Avena said that 21   notification had to occur within 72 hours.    I read the whole thing.    It was in the first - Subject to Final Review 1   excused -- it's in that hearing that I didn't see what 2   that finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that 3   the President wanted Texas to do it is it would be 4   easiest for Texas to go back to that.    So you think there was no reason for the ICJ to ask the President --    And what did happen to the lawyers Texas gave him?
06-989 +++$+++     On that point -- the reason I think you're -- there's a little chaos here is because you said -- your question is phrased, does the FAA  ￼18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 absence of that statute, is there inherent authority in the district judge? Now, I don't know the answer to either of those questions.    My temptation is to say they're open questions and they'd have to be argued on remand, which makes this case the case of the century, I 12 - Subject to Final Review 1   doesn't preclude it. 2               But then would we have to go back and say 3   what is the source?  There has to be some source of law 4   that authorizes this contractual agreement, and there 5   could be two possible sources.  And my question here is, 6   is it clear that in fact either of these two sources 7   does? 8 9 The first source is State law.  I gather the difficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just like the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask 10 11   the Oregon courts:  Is this a legitimate contract under 12   Oregon State law. 13               The alternative source of law is the Federal 14   judge's case management authority.  And there we have a 15   statute which clearly gives the judge some kind of 16   authority, but not for your case because your case 17   exceeds the jurisdictional amount.  Therefore, in the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   guess, in a certain respect.  It's quite a difficult 2   case.    Have you ever argued that this is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    Have you ever argued that?    Yes, under Oregon law. Have you ever argued Oregon law?

It says 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   reason that it didn't in Bell Atlantic.  The Court 21   specifically said we are not going to rely on district 22   courts to weed out potentially meritless claims because 23   we recognize the burdens that discovery can impose in 24   the civil and in trust contexts.  And those burdens are 25   multiplied many times here where you are talking about 18 And the second question I'm going to ask you, when you tell me what that power is, which apparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but whatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't that work to solve your problem?    I'll bet those people are being harassed --    And the reason you can't make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?    The judge there is supposed to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward. And so why don't you make this argument right at that 10 11 12   point?  If you are right you win; if not, you lose.    And that's also true, I guess, of complaints, and every other legal question.

07-11191 +++$+++     What is the theory of this? I understand in hearsay, which as we have just seen demonstrated, is very complicated, filled with all kinds of rules --    -- some of which I may recall and others of which I certainly don't. (Laughter.)    But the -- the 12  1   Confrontation Clause, I would have thought, would have 2   picked out the heart of that.  So we have Sir Walter 3   Raleigh and Sir Walter Raleigh says, "Bring in 4   witnesses," which they wouldn't.  So why shouldn't we 5 6 7 8 9   he wants.  He has had his chance to cross-examine  say what this clause is about is Sir Walter Raleigh?    Bring in the witnesses. Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what ￼10   them.  End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the 11   hearsay law.    And how often will you say I understand it's admissible, but I would like as well ￼ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 very often? Suppose you learn that that witness is -- is 4,000 miles away, so you say, I’d like to call this witness, and you know perfectly well that it's going to be virtually impossible for that witness to be produced. What happens?    I'm trying to think of something that’s hearsay, and --    -- and what I'm trying to figure out --    -- is will defense attorneys, if they have the right under the Constitution to insist that a lab technician be 20  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 present, in cases where they happen to know that lab technician has left the job and is married and is reliving in a distant State, say okay, let's call her. And that way the prosecution really cannot present the case except at inordinate expense. And I'm concerned about that --    -- but I don't see quite 10 11 12 13   -- I didn't select data.  I just got -- presented the 14   data on the States that I had, and my own State of  ￼how to deal with it, how much of a problem it is, and the impact on this particular situation.

Depending on 17   how the lab is organized -- usually, labs can organize 18   so that only one person needs to -- needs to present. 19             In any event, of course, the State is 20   acknowledging that, if the defendant brings -- demands 21   they have to bring in the witnesses, that’s not at 22 issue.    No, no, it's no confrontation because in this instance the hearsay prevents the confrontation.    You don't believe so, but you gave me an answer saying they did have to, so --

So 3   when you speak of the "burden," you mean the challenger 4   has the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to 5   find prejudice -- to articulate some theory of how there 6   was prejudice.

That's not your 12   client -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything 13   else is the same. 14               Well, does that mean because they forgot to 15   tell the client that the client has to go and produce 16   some evidence, and she thought the Veterans 17   Administration would produce all the evidence?

It is truly a game of gotcha that 3   just nullifies the defendant's due process rights. 4               And that precedent I think would be of great 5   concern in various fields of law.  This is a rule of law 6   that will apply in civil rights cases in the future, 7   criminal cases, all sorts of cases. 8               So I -- I think if this Court does apply its 9   own criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise 10   in futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter.  We 11 12 13 14   well, why was it an exercise in futility?  That's what I didn't have any reason to think we had to submit this again on a separate piece of paper.
07-1223 +++$+++     All right.  So I'm trying to figure out how the statute works.    And it seems to me that the way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way, 12  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen? 2   No?  Okay.  Forget that.  I was going to shorthand that 3   because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking 4   of. 5               What happens is that the -- the State court 6   now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and 7   you don't prevail.  All right.  Now, he goes into 8   Federal court and he has some new facts.  Now, either 9   they are such that they transform the claim and it's a 10   new claim.  I mean, in that case there is an argument 11   for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't.  Now, if 12   they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge, 13   is go look and decide on the basis of what they 14   presented to the State.  That's the end of it. 15 16 17 18   if there was cause and prejudice.  And that's how it's 19   supposed to work.  And if there was cause and prejudice, 20   then you have the hearing.  Okay?  That's how it's Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust. You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see 21   supposed to work factually. 22               I have no idea if that's what went on here, 23   but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some 24   confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in 25   the State.  Then there is some other thing that this 13  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   might be the same claim.  I mean, I don't see how we get 2   to the question we took this case to decide, frankly, 3   without knowing what the basis was and whether it was 4   correct for the district court to give him any hearing 5 at all. 6 7   address that.  I think that that's essentially how this 8   works in this case.  What the district -- what the 9   district court did here is it first made a finding of 10   was there diligence?  Because it has to do that under 11   Michael Williams to even take the next step.  Did the    Well, why wouldn't you say right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State court, and exhausts it?    Why not? - Subject to Final Review    Well, you must have been assuming then that the State would not give that person a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.    Suppose it were really new.    Yes, but so is it in Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where you could bring the thing up because you couldn't possibly have gotten over it.    So in Virginia a person discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the 16  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something 2   unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under 3   Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?    I mean that's not an obvious answer to that one.    What it's going to do is it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   don't think you can under Holland, et cetera. 2               Now, you know, just to make this a little 3   bit clearer, hopefully, in -- in Keeney, upon which this 4   Court drew in Michael Williams, the Court looked -- the 5   Court did -- looked at a potential distinction between 6   the failure properly to make a claim in State court and 7   the failure properly to develop the facts for that 8 claim. 9               Now, the Court looked at that distinction in 10   the context of seeing whether cause and prejudice, which 11   applied to certainly the major claim in the State court, 12   should apply to the failure to fully develop it.  And 13   what it said is that distinguishing between those two 14   circumstances is irrational. 15               Now, I would submit that it's similarly 16   irrational to attribute to Congress the intent to 17   distinguish between the circumstances, or because of 18   these limitations you have in State court, despite your 19   effort, you weren't able to fully develop the record. 20               And the State decided the case on an 21   inadequate record.  It comes to Federal court.  Do you 22   simply defer?  I mean do you simply stop when you say 23   the State court reasonably decided this case based on an 24   inadequate State court record, or do you allow that 25   record to be fully developed and decide it on its 26  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   merits? 2               That's, I think, the issue that we are 3   presenting today.

That's exactly what 17 18 19 20   injunction.  Even if you agree with Respondents on the 21   likelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a 22   showing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally 23   flawed.

Then we have to reach this hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of the facts on the record before it.    So we have to reach a huge number of issues which we've never decided.    And then we would have to say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they might have taken them most favorable to the defendant. 5 6   Is that what we're supposed to do?  Is it unreasonable 7   of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of 8   reading these facts as most possible favorable for the 9   defendant?  Is that what we should do?  ￼23 24 25 If the State court adjudication was -- was contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might be the "total fool" rule, in other words no one but a 24 - Subject to Final Review 1   issue is not really properly before this Court.

It says a claim includes a    Yes. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   end it?  Why doesn't -- how do you win, then, given the    Well -- so why doesn't that    That's right, that's right.    But that's why the definition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why I'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly ambiguous, the language of "knowingly makes a false statement to get a false claim paid." Now, the "false claim" is the claim that they made to the contractor, because that's the 10   Now, you could read those words "paid by the government" 11   to say "and there has to be a causal connection," which 12   is what you're saying, that you have to make the false 13   statement, make the claim, and that led the government 14 to pay. 15               But you could also say it's paid by the 16   government when the money to pay it comes out of 17   government funds, because it was paid by the government 18   even though the government gave the money to build the 19   school 100 years ago.  But it's there in the bank 20   account, and then the contractor took the money from the 21   bank account that the government put in and paid it.  In 22   such a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by 23   the government.    It was a false claim. That's there.    That's true.
07-219 +++$+++     All right.  Now, what 11   happens to that Federal rule?  One thing we know  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   to me it makes a difference from the point of view of 2   stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule, 3   has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has 4   eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining 5   only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine 6   outlier. 7 8 9 And I don't know what the history is.    I know.  That's beside the point to my question.    But the -- I mean, the obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of the officer of the corporation, including the captain, 35 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   the total compensation paid was $500 million.  The 5   company paid nearly a billion dollars for natural 6   resources harm.

07-308 +++$+++     Now, what they want is they want three years before that.    And they're too late under 17 18 19 20 21   they're home-free.  They get their payment back and they 22   get their interest.  Now let's go to the three preceding 23   years.  I'm a little confused about that because I can't 24   work out -- I suppose that the government is saying:    I'm saying for three years 25   You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you 6  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   don't get your interest.  Or is the government saying: 2   You get your money back; you just don't get the 3   interest?  Which is it?  And I don't see how it could be 4 5 6 7 8 9 the latter.    Okay.    So when I decide this case, I should forget the words "any sum"?
07-312 +++$+++     Fine.  If it's your point  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   exactly, then I guess I must agree with that.  I'll hear 2   from the other side.  Except I thought your point was it 3   makes it difference whether the transfer takes place 4   before the plan is confirmed or after.  So I may be just 5   confused about that.    I'm not speaking of the language for the moment.  I want you to forget about the language and assume the language is ambiguous.  That's a different question.  My question is, assuming that the language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found, assuming that, however, is there any reason why a reasonable human being would make this distinction? That's my question.  And there may be an answer, but I want to know what answer is.    I would appreciate an answer to the question.    What?  That's what I want to know.  And I'll add a qualification.  I'd say I would read into this a context, and the context is the whole 9  ￼19 20 21 22 23 24 25    What is the reason?  That's what I want you to focus on, for making that  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 of the statute in our view provides that the authority flows from the confirmed plan.    Why can't you just say that?  Why can't you say, you want to record this taxation, pay the tax.  And when you come in later, because it was confirmed, show us the paper.  We'll give you the money back. How does that interfere with -- with    Why is it an administrative burden?  The burden is entirely on the people who want their money back.  They come in.  They file a piece of paper.  It says Federal bankruptcy judge signed, plan 18  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   confirmed, and it would take, I guess, a few minutes to 2   read through it to see they're telling the truth, which 3   you always have the problem in a tax, and then you give 4   them their money back.    It's on page 38, the last line, the next to the last line.    The red brief.    Yes.    No, no.  I'm sorry. Doesn't the rejection have to take place prior to the plan being confirmed?    Does it or doesn't it? 55  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Prior to in your opinion or not prior to?    I'm sorry.  I don't understand how that would work.  I have a contract with Boeing for $500 million.

I understand that.  But I'm sorry -- doesn't the plan which its confirmed have a list of the creditors and how they are treated?    All right.  How do we write the plan if, in fact, no breach has occurred and he hasn't become a creditor until the plan is, in fact,  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 is in a different context, which is saying that the rejection is -- constitutes a breach but gas not been assumed, and at that point it has not been assumed, but at the point of confirmation --
07-320 +++$+++  
07-330 +++$+++     Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I thought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say the same thing as (1)?  It says if the sentence is too high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as the court considers appropriate.    Subject to (g), which has to do with the district court. Then the other part says if it is too low and it was the government that appealed, the court shall set it aside and send it back with such instructions as it considers appropriate, again subject to (g). So all three say the same thing.    That's what --    That's right.    But you don't have --    Well, could do you this? Because this is quite helpful to me.  Reading, I started out where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of this argument.  I thought the district court normally has it open, to the judge, to resentence.  Resentence is 44  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 resentence.  You can't be vindictive, but that's the limit.  That's how it works normally, I thought. And given -- if that's so, then you look at the three sections we just saw, try to read them together, and say they certainly are written with the notion that the noticing of a plain error on the other side is going to be few and far between if ever. So the normal way to handle it is just what we said:  The judge decides on the record and the appeal -- I decide this for the defendant here.  But I've noticed something, says the writing judge.  And of course it's open on resentencing to go into that.    So if you were going to do something other than that, in the court of appeals, you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a fairly good reason.  So you don't close off the escape hatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly, but you say it's going to be few and far between. Now does that work?    All right.

How is it handled under your rule? 16   How is that handled generally?  How should it be and is there any law that tells me, when he requests a counsel be appointed, when they have to do it?    So the answer is no.    What happens -- what happens if -- the part that's worrying and I don't know 17   handled? 18    No.  No.  That's easy.

07-463 +++$+++     Let's imagine that Congress 5  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   did, Congress did say:  By the way, lawyers who have 2   handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value 3   has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an 4   affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch 5   may appeal from the court's promulgation of the 6   following general rule, dah, dah, dah.  And that 7   Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?    Right.  Those who -- fine, forget that, yeah. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   it up.  But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that 25   time or the clients who had certain cases were not 6    You mean Article III and at Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster, whatever they had, they must have had some procedural rules, and sometimes they had general procedural rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look  ￼3 4 5 6   suppose. 7 Do we know the answer to that?

That's just what I am trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper 10 11   that says "Notice."  Now suppose Congress says, if you 12   can show you are the kind of person who regularly asks 13   and needs such notices, and if a regulation is 14   promulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge 15   that reg prior to enforcement.  Now does that violate 16   Article III?    I am looking for a principle that is going to help me.

07-512 +++$+++     So we needn't reach the issue in this case?
07-513 +++$+++     Well, either of those things are negligence or worse.    So what I didn't understand is why you would charge the police with anything or suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one was negligent or worse.    Why, if there is no  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   just hypothesized.  That is where the machines --    I mean, I don't know what  ￼6 7 8 9   things then?  I wouldn't think so -- happened in history --    -- but do they suppress    Can I use 30 seconds of your eight minutes because I want some clarity on this. 14 15 16 17   separate things:  The nature of the bad conduct: is it 18   negligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question 19   is who engaged in it -- a police department official or 20   some other official? 21               I thought this case was about the second 22   question, but now I'm confused about the first question 23   because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer 24   makes a negligent error.  He goes to the wrong house. 25   And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts 54    Divide in your mind two  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   to arrest the wrong person:  Is the evidence suppressed? 2               If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I 3   don't see why a clerical official should be held to a 4   higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then 5   quite possibly the clerical official should be held to 6   the same standard.  So you've heard the government say 7   well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent 8   official -- a negligent officer would not have that 9   evidence suppressed.  Well, what is it? 10 11 12 13   suppressed.  There are cases where the mistake of the 14   officer was a reasonable mistake, that is.  He did not 15   --    Excuse me, because I think  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of the other exceptions to the exclusionary rule does not apply, then the evidence will be suppressed.    All right.

We had a 5   complicated structure involving seniority, really.  And 6   part of that old seniority system was this rule which 7   was legal at the time.  It is no longer legal. structure today in the same kind of way that was at 11   issue at Bazemore.  It's a complicated set of rules that 12   you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled 13   to what, just as they did that in Bazemore.  So I began 14   to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very 15   much like Bazemore?  What is your response?    I take it you are not saying anything that is in effect and is still there, 20   created on the basis of discrimination.  Then you move 21   it, whole cloth, into the post-new world.  And it's the 22   administration of that complicated system of rules that 23   was created out of the discrimination, but it's 24   administration today that makes it like Bazemore.
07-544 +++$+++     Yes.    Right.  So why don't we 27  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   just send it back and say apply the standard?    There it is.  And it's  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   have a certain state of intent.  You have to have 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   seem to say that, or more so.  It says, you can only 9   apply -- jury, you can only apply this special 10   instruction if two things are true:  First, in lines 9 11   through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that 12   you have to be engaged in the crime.  And then just 13   before that, it says, and you have to have one of two 14   states of mind.  You have to either intend to kill the 15   person or at least be recklessly indifferent.  And since 16   that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a 17   mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much.  That's one 18   of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of 19   evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.    And that's wrong.  Put them together, but then look at the instruction on page 13, which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   he exhibited reckless indifference because he saw the 2   mortally wounded victim lying there, and the D.A. said, 3   did you try to resuscitate him?  Have you ever had a CPR 4   class?  I did once.  Well, did you do CPR on him?  No. 5   Did you call 9-11?  You didn't care whether he lived or 6   died, did you? 7               So this entire line of cross-examination, to 8   which the district attorney came back again, though 9   somewhat less dramatically, at 1330 of the transcript 10   and again at 1337 to 1338, commenting that he -- that 11   Mr. Pulido did not go back in at some later point to 12   check on the victim's condition, that entire line of 13   cross-examination encouraged the theme that even under 14   Mr. Pulido's own account of the facts, he showed 15   reckless indifference.  And --    I'm sure that would be -- I 18 19 20 21 22 23   didn't already do it, but we'll do it now."  Let them 24   say what they want to say.    Just go do it.  And then they can say "we already did it," or they can say "we  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   don't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as 2   I've mentioned if the court, if the court remains, 3   remains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was 4   simply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should 5   be sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be 6   the Court's inclination.  Let me offer another angle for 7   why what the Ninth Circuit did is entirely compatible 8   with Brecht. 9               In civil cases, this Court routinely applies 10   the same sort of general verdict analysis which in 11   criminal cases has become to be known as the Stromberg 12   line.  In fact, it did it as recently this summer in the 13   Exxon Valdez case.  Now civil cases don't have Chapman, 14   they don't have structural defect; civil cases are 15   subject to a harmless error standard which ultimately 16   goes back to the identical statute which was construed 17   in Kotteakos. 18               And going back to the opinion of the Court 19   in O'Neal, in addressing the relationship between 20   Kotteakos/Brecht harmless error review and civil 21   harmless error review, the Court indicated he think 22   rather strongly that those standards are either 23   equivalent or to the extent that they differ, the 24   Brecht/ Kotteakos standard is less forgiving of error 25   because of the liberty interest at stake.  Now that 36  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   means two things.  From a retrospective point of view of 2   simply construing this Court's different lines of cases, 3   I think it demonstrates that this general verdict 4   analysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type 5   harmless error analysis, but it also has some 6   perspective implications, because if this Court were to 7   wholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has 8   nothing to do with harmless error review, that's going 9   to impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this 10   Court's opinions, the Court is considering not only the 11   immediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if 12   we rule one way or another. 13               So this case -- this case supports a finding 14   of prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the 15   Ninth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even 16   more strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the 17   rest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror 18   queries and another item which I think may be responsive 19   to some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is 20   the strength of the evidence on the various theories. 21               There were three theories and obviously 22   there was evidence in support of the prosecution's main 23   theory that Pulido shot the victim himself.  There was 24   evidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in 25   the form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the 37  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   invalid late-joiner theory.  Out of these the one theory 2   that had least support in the record before the jury was 3   the valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness 4   testified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some 5   fashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the 6   prosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in 7   argument because the prosecutor was very clear: 8   Prosecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting 9   instructions just in case.  They only apply -- if -- 10   they only come into play if you were to believe the 11   defendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you 12   believe the defendant's story the felony murder rule 13   applies. 14               But then the prosecutor immediately went 15   back, "but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon 16   wasn't there.  Aragon didn't do it.  Pulido did it," and 17   prosecutor went back to his primary theory. 18               So the theory which the -- present in the 19   instructions was least before the jury, was the valid 20   aiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded 21   error harmless depends on the notion either that the 22   jury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting 23   or that they necessarily would have adopted one if 24   properly instructed. 25               There is one final point I'd like to make, 38  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   which is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and 2   when one has an error under which the defense testimony 3   even if believed renders the defendant guilty 4   erroneously, that derails the entire defense.  That it 5   seems to me is the quintessential substantial and 6   injurious influence; because it practically renders the 7   trial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if 8   you find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty. 9               So for these reasons and additionally for 10   the very thorough prejudice analysis found in the 11   district court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm, 12   despite the Ninth Circuit's inept nomenclature, but in 13   the event the Court is dissatisfied with that 14   explanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate 15   course in that instance would be to send it back under 16   Brecht. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 39 Unless the Court has any further questions, I'm prepared to submit.

And I think the 7   answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead 8   of making this into a Federal court case, where you have 9   1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that The question is if you have a minor amount at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you 10   the better course to follow is in fact for the 11   plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an 12   aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right 13   institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the 14   limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the 15   limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its 16   ability to provide complete relief. 17               And, indeed, if you read the Respondents' 18   brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in 19   which this entire system worked effectively, a claim 20   that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal 21   Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated 22   in front of the Federal court.  So, to my mind, the 23   right answer to this case is to take these cases all to 24   the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary 25   jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do 15  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   Federal regulation?  They're just sort of out of luck? 7   Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they 8   can take their claims to?  I mean, this is a fluke that 9   there happens to be this Federal agency they could have 10   gone to.  Certainly our principles of standing should 11   not depend upon that fluke, should it?    How is that different?    Just on that very point -- 8   receivable, which is very common?  You finance the 9   accounts.  You take a secured interest in accounts 10   receivable.    In the respect you were just talking about.    I know, but I mean, there  ￼1   community.  I don't know. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Go back to my question, I'd like to get an answer to it.    In respect to the problem you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of counterclaims or those problems, is this case any different than the financing case I just mentioned? 10 11 12 13 14 15   would arise in that context as well.  On the other hand, 16   that's a situation that seems to me is largely driven by 17   the exigencies and by accident in Federal court.  This 18   is situation that is driven into Federal court by the 19   plaintiffs' choice and by the ability and the preference 20   to be in a position to get the benefits of litigation in 21   Federal court without any of the detriments that might 22   otherwise arise in that context.    No.

07-581 +++$+++     I ask you -- let me ask you a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a 6   employer discriminated against you, say, on gender 7   grounds.  You have to go to the EEOC. 8               Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often 9   what they do is they don't really resolve it.  They just 10 11 12 13   know, won't be the bottom line.  People will go there 14   and then they have a right to sue later. give you a letter that gives you a right to sue. So here Congress was so worried about this kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you 15               Now, that's how Congress felt about this 16   particular statute.  Why would they want the union to be 17   the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself 18   hasn't agreed?  I mean, the employee might agree in the 19   first place.  He might say I'm going to take that 20   letter, I'm not going to bring my suit.  That's up to 21   him or her.  But here the employee wants to bring her 22   suit, just like the EEOC letter.    I -- I just want to be sure that at some point you answer this question, if you can. 10 11 12   as I see it, is just what you said:  When can a union 13   require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a 14   court case in an instance where the union member has not 15   signed a special waiver?  That's the question, right? 16   Okay. 17               And what I think some of us were struggling 18   for here is:  If we say yes to you they can force them, I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   Justice Souter, a common law tort claim.  Then we might 43 or no to you they can't, what's the principle? Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend to think they can force the worker into arbitration is where the right grows out of the collective bargaining agreement, period. Then we have what we were talking about with  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   have a State law giving a claim.  Then we might have a 2 3 4    That's why I am asking you for the principle.
07-582 +++$+++     So, what is it -- what are they supposed to do when the event is live, and lo and behold, they have a few people in front of them who 8 9 10 11 12 13 15   cover a baseball game, whenever they cover anything 16   live, they have to have some kind of tape system or for 17   the Emmys, everything is on tape and it's all delayed 18   five seconds?    So, what they -- what they 14   now -- they now do this?  In other words, whenever they  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   breaking news coverage.  I guess I'm talking about, you 2   know, any one of -- they cover the wrestling matches, 3   they cover -- you see what I'm driving at.  And I would 4   like to know what is the state of the art?  You are 5 6 7 8 9 saying the state of the art is right now when I turn on my television set, they all use a delay.    Or are you saying they all have to use a delay? 10 11 12   Music Awards, they will use a delay.  And since the 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 incidents in this case, the 2003 and 2002 instances, the networks have gotten more people who are on hand to bleep isolated expletives.

Because here you are 21   dealing with individuals who have used inappropriate in 22   the past -- Nicole Richie had used inappropriate 23   language in the past.  You had an inappropriate tape 24   delay, you had inappropriate measures in place to ensure 25   that expletives were not used, which in the Commission's 21 they explain all that?    I didn't see it.    So is there an explanation why they made that change?    It hasn't?    It explained -- I mean, the change I saw was that previously the use of these words as a swear was treated differently from the use of these 5 6 7 8   words as a description.

Because to my knowledge, all human activity 7   takes place through speech with a few exceptions that 8   are not here relevant.    But that's the reasoning that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity 15 16 17 18 19 20   somewhere, Justice Stevens.  I appreciate the colloquy. 21   And I think the distinction -- getting back to the point 22   Justice Alito raised, and the sharp distinction that has 23   been made in the compelled speech and compelled dues 24   cases is between the activities -- certainly in the 25   compelled union dues cases, is activities for which 20 him to -- to support the union is, I thought, part of the reasoning behind --    So unless it's political in your view, you don't have that right?
07-615 +++$+++     Isn't that right or --    Dr. Elahi is one of several persons, is that right?    What I'm trying to get at is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments on the Elahi judgment.    That if Iran ends up with 20 - Subject to Final Review 2 3 4 5 6   Iran, Iran will say:  We do not have to have a setoff.    And so that is at issue before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases. If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than 10 11 12 13 14   speaking of:  The status of the Cubic judgment and --    We want the grocery store. And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what 35  ￼15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 you want. do I do?    All right?  So now, which (Laughter.) - Subject to Final Review 1               The United States' view is different.  Who 2   will resolve that question?  The tribunal.  So they say, 3   what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what 4   is at issue is the question of whether we get the money 5   or you get the money.  What money?  The money that is 6   the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in 7   which case it's identical. 8               Now I think in that situation it's easy for 9   me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank 10   account, of course is at issue before the tribunal.  For 11   the question is, does Iran get it or does the United 12   States get it, in the situation where the two other 13   people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it.  I 14   can easily read it that way.  I can also read it the way    All right.  I'll then add that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me, is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate 36  ￼5 Tribunal. 6 - Subject to Final Review 1   victims of terrorism.  That's a worthy goal, and that's 2   one of the points.  But it was to compensate them 3   consistent with the proper running, in the interests of 4   the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims And so this is just the kind of issue we don't want to simply take away and let the victim have, because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule 7 8 9   against us, and we will have to pay it twice.  Okay. That's the argument against you. Now, what's the argument for you? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   thumb on the scale in favor of the victim.  So you do -- 23 24 25 you will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA if you adopt a position consistent with our position. The reality is that given that there are two 37    Yes.    That's one, but --    They are trying to attach the ACMR system.    They are trying to attach    And that's one piece of  ￼10   tribunal. 11 - Subject to Final Review 1   lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would 2   have thought it would only affect it in a way that is 3   positive for me.  Because Iran is saying, look, this 4   doesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran 5   tribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality 6   is whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other 7   lienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get 8   the money, which says to me it's not at issue under any 9   theory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims And so that would be my quickest answer to that; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it simply means that there really is nothing at issue 12 13 14   there.  But it still seems to me that the better way --    Now, I can understand Congress in passing this statute having one of two 10   possible things:  One is say we are just going to cut an 11   arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what 12   we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize 13   anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit 14   within this.  That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a    The other way to look at it is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we will pay these victims something; you know, they are going to get something right from Congress right now, 47  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.
07-636 +++$+++     And I'm tempted to try to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   case law.  They have stated that, but they consider some 2   of the other cases and they might consider this Court's 3   ruling addressing the interpretation of the QDRO 4   provision; that might provide them additional 5   enlightenment as to how they should address the 6   other issue.
07-665 +++$+++     What do we do -- is this  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   morality of people, and also it would help promote the 2   movie.  All right?  Is that true -- is that the actual 3   description here? 4 5   project -- 6 7 8 9   history of it, what does that mean?  I mean, where do we 10   go with that?  Then this is in fact partly an attempt to 11   promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly 12   an attempt to promote a movie.  So, what do we do with 13   that?    Okay.    So -- so if that's the    Why not?  Why not?  Why -- suppose that there -- there are certain messages that private people had like "eat vitamins" --    -- and so they say -- you know, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along 59  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   with a totally different content, "ride the roller 2   coaster," and they say this part of the park is designed 3   to get healthy children, not put children at risk.  So 4   therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't 5   want messages, "ride the roller coaster."  This is all 6   private.  It's the -- you know -- now what? 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So in other words, they -- the --    They can't do either.    Is there any case that says -- can they have playgrounds in the park?    Okay, so we have right in the playground, we have "eat vitamins," "eat your -- clean up all your -- all the food in your plate," "don't throw food at your brother," okay? So -- I mean --    Yes, all private.    Because there are various groups that feel that's important; the city says yes, it is; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail, 10   and not bad ones.  Where does it permit it?  What's the 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   public forum.  And there is not a limit -- case that says that the Government couldn't do that?    Give one and I'll read it. Give me three; I'll read them.    But the children's playground isn't the public forum.    I see where you're going.

But you are out anyway if the crossover vote 10   from the white majority is more than half of what the 11   whole vote is with the black and white together on that 12   side.  So you have a two-to-one ratio. 13               Now, the only virtue of that is that there 14   was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you 15   have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit 16   more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is 17   likely to get in more cases that are justified.  But 18   they still have to prove their three factors.    So we want -- a little flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.    You can't get below 42. I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with your thumb on the scale.    They are -- they are finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers. 45  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   cushion.

If they vote cohesively. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   the white group does not vote cohesively.  Under your 17   hypothetical at least 11 percent have to swing over.

Suppose I'm right as far as the 14   instruction goes.  But say the prosecutor gets everybody 15   mixed up.  Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people 16   mixed up enough, that could becomes a due process 17   violation.  But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot 18   of mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect.  Are 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 there any cases I should look at, one that would tell me how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before it's a due process violation?    In Brown, in that case did 13  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   they find that he did get them too mixed up or he 2   didn't?    He did not.

And I take it your 5   answer to that question is:  Yes, we do allow some 6   payroll deductions for some things.  Okay? 7               So then we look at this one, and it says: 8   No payroll deductions for union activities that are 9   political.  All right?  Now, you either do have or you 10   do not have a justification for that difference.  If you 11   have a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is, 12   justification for the difference, you win.  And if you 13   don't, you lose.

08-103 +++$+++     Well, there's some that 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   are just out of luck.  That is to say, there will not be 24   databases collected, because they cannot be complete 25   because we cannot find the owner.  If we take the 40    I mean, that's the problem that's underlying the fairness of this thing.    In terms of if we take your approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   position that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle 2   disappears and now it's a question of the fairness of 3   the situation.    That's right.  I just wonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of provision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.    Maybe it won't, by the way.    It depends on what the - Subject to Final Review    In 1909 Congress thought all this through with the databases and so forth? (Laughter.) 49  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   1976.  The -- but the databases are a red herring here. 5               Sometimes, technology is different, and,    All right.  Now, that's a sort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it should be, but it's rather surprising that this law is the law that will answer that question.    Well, you say if somebody who owns the copyright. 10 11 12 13 14 15   there are 4,000 books that we can't trace.  Who, now, 16   owns the copyright 100 years later?  And there is no way 17   to get those into our database.  Whether --    Yes.  No.  No.  But what we want to do is we want to have, in our database, all of the material written about slavery, and, lo and behold,  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   access to the Court. 2               The way it relates to the question is that 3   what Congress was trying to do was to give people like 4   you and me information about those copyright owners, so 5   that we could find the owner of the book on slavery. 6               And, as a way to maintain that register, 7   which Congress started in 1790, it said, to the authors 8   of copyrighted works, if you want to use our courts, the 9   judicial powers of the United States, you need to confer 10   this benefit, so that Justice Breyer could find you, if 11   he wants to include your work in the database.  And that 12 13 14 15   411(a) because we were interrupted there.  The parties 16   have offered no convincing explanation for that word, 17   other than to show that Congress understood this whole 18   provision was jurisdictional. 19               It refers, most immediately, to 20   registrability, but that was not a new issue in 1976. 21   Courts have always decided registrability.

Give me your strongest case.    But I’d like an answer to my question, because I can -- I have read the treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that     All right.    I mean, the reason I ask that    The reason I ask that is I think the argument on the other side is that it's so clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying you have special hardship; that that’s so clear what Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back ￼10 11 12 13   and attack it, if they didn't do it.  I mean, that's 14   basically, in my mind, their argument. 15               But I think a simpler way would be to say if 16   it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar 17   itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating 18   from the way that Congress set it out, to which there is 19   no legal objection.  Now, is it really -- what do you 20 21 22 23 24 25 think of that?    I wasn’t making any    But -- but they waited a very long time.

So this is good and mixed up. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    It’s good and mixed up.  So what is -- how is it supposed to work?

08-1191 +++$+++     Now, that's -- I would like 16   jurisdictional issue under principles of international 17   law.  It's the question of the scope of the statute. 18   And there the things against you are three.  One is 19   Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know 20   your answer to.  The second is in Judge Friendly's two 21 opinions. 22               The first opinion -- the second one, rather, 23   Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and 24   foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign 25   plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange, 13  8 9 10 Now, France, Britain and Australia have filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly - Subject to Final Review 1   even if that fraud takes place totally in the United 2   States, the statute wouldn't cover it.  That's Friendly, 3   which started this. 4               And the third thing is what he says in 5   Leasco.  He says:  We cannot see any sound reason for 6   not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs 7   who are Americans.  Okay? ￼11   never considered.  And those three reasons, as we know, 12   is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win, 13   how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate 14   their own securities markets, right? 15               That's all one question:  Professor Sachs, 16   Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco.  But that's 17   what I'd like to hear your answer to.    What do you -- do you want ￼to finish?    Then -- I mean, I can see. 15   criticisms of class actions.  We say, first of all, the 16   American rule means even if our companies here are 17   right, that they are going to have to pay their legal 18   fees.  We don't like punitive damages.  We don't like 19   that we have the opt-out.  And these are all our 20 21 22 23   Then Professor Sachs says:  Read the statute, because 24   they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind 25   of stuff.  Now, that's what I would like you to address citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on our exchange to that stuff. Now, fine, they have a reason on their side. 22  - Subject to Final Review 1   specifically.    Schmidt is in Germany.  He calls him up.    So it's not as easy to 14   exchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn.  He is 15   lying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn 16   Bridge.  So he calls Schmidt.  I am interested in -- he 17   calls Schmidt.  Causation, that's what your last pages 18   of your brief, focus on that.  He calls him and he lies 19   to him.  Actual.  In your theory -­ 20 21 22 23 24 25   Bridge example.

I'm looking -­    No, I'm focusing on the 16 17 18 19 20 21   moment.  What's bothering me, taking off from what the 22   Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test. 23   Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that 24   when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue.  But 25   when you phone your parent company, knowing that they 46 thing on the directness of the causation.    I'm accepting that for the  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the question.

08-1198 +++$+++     But there is no such answer.    Not as out-of-date. (Laughter.)    And I thought that's what Bazzle said, that --    Yes.    I see that now, but then -- but there are two separate questions.    My question was, first, the same as Justice Ginsburg.    And I have a question for you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought your description of who is to decide this matter of whether there is to be a class action was just what you 24   said:  The question of who should decide it is a matter 25   for the parties. 6  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   a contract and background circumstances.  In Bazzle, 10   the contract was:  Any -- all disputes relating to this to me, then.     So when I looked at -- I just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there seemed --    All right.  But what it seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from ￼11 12 13 14 15 16   relate to.  Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay?  That's contract. Here, it doesn't say that.  It says:  "Any dispute arising from the performance, termination, or making of the contract." Now, a class-action determination does 17 18 19 20   saying that what Bazzle said was:  Whenever this is 21 22 23 24 25 silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is answered at arbitration. I can't find it saying that.    So why are all these briefs  what is said.    Now, you're -- so the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who question, who shall decide whether or not in your case class actions are permissible?    The who question here, irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the 18 19 20 21 22 23   And you are saying that's wrong.  And there you run into 24   all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other 25   places, saying when the arbitrator says something, 9    So now we look to the what. They then decided it.    What -- what did they decide?  23 24 25 permissible?  1   unless it's in Marrs, follow it.  That's what you are 2   addressing.    That -- isn't that -- you      They won't?
08-1200 +++$+++     So what -- the part that's worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt 13 14 15 16   and says, yes, it's legal.  And then that's what he 17   thinks.  All the circuits have said this.  And then he 18   asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal.  So there he 19   is.  Everybody's told him it's legal.  And lo and 20   behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite. 21   Well, he shouldn't be liable.  And if he has to worry 22   about that, he can never defend his client.  The only 23   answer is:  Whatever the man says who is opposed to your 24   client, that's what you have to do.  That can't be the 25   meaning of this statute. write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now, is that legal? And the lawyer looks up everything in sight  6 ￼22 23 24 25    Yes.    It's not a mistake.  The point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get surprised because courts don't always act the way they think is reasonable.    Both.    Ah, but that's in your view 20 21 22 23 24   it's unfair.  It's worse than unfair.  The lawyer is 25   under an obligation to represent his client, and he your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position, let alone the client.    It -- it's not just that  8 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 9 1   cannot do anything but tell the client:  Just pay money 2   to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is 3   totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever 4   decided it.  Now, how can you put lawyers in that 5   position?    But it -- but it suggests  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of 2   this that avoids the result I said, if possible.  And 3   there is a different way of going about it, which is you 4   could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer 5   imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it 6   does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before 7   you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has 8   to look into it.  He has to have asked the FTC.  He has 9   to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter 10   back.  And if there are one or two circuits that hold 11   the other way, well, where?  And if you don't, you are 12 13 14 15   surprise.    So -- I get -- okay.    Okay.  But then what -- how -- but I still can't figure out how we get this thing to work here, and -- and you just came up with a new idea.
08-1214 +++$+++     Yes, that's right, and they  1   went on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in 2   respect to the contract that might not even have been 3 signed yet.    -- to decide whether it  1   issue isn't the NLRB ruling, although that’s going to 2   have to be drawn upon.  There is a denial that a 3   contract was formed on July 2nd that continues to 4   today.  And the question is:  Where does that get 5   decided?  Does it get decided in a court, as we did 6   before with a unanimous jury verdict?  Or does that 7   now get vacated and sent to an arbitrator with no 8   agreement --    So, why isn’t --    Why is that a difficult 7   hour from the moment when this red contract takes 8 effect. 9             Okay?  And, now we have an issue, when 10   everybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the 11   contract to arbitration.  We’ll send the application 12   of the contract to -- to arbitration.  One of the 13   questions is:  When, for purposes of the $32, did this 14   contract, which we have admittedly signed, take 15   effect?  Why isn't that question for an arbitrator? ￼16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   for the strike.

08-1314 +++$+++    And the agency would simply say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just the minimum. It's so easy to say that, but I haven't found agencies saying it. I don't know why.   We are forced to deal with the situation we have; and the situation we have in Geier is filled with indications that they really wanted a mix because of the unusual circumstances present there.   You have to point to something here that shows that.   So if the government continuously says, this is what the agency means and the agency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the chances are they will come to a better, correct conclusion than I will with my law clerks -­   -- because I have a lot to do. All right. (Laughter.)   That's the practical. I'm sorry, but that is the practical idea that I think underlies what was said in Geier.   No, but it did -- we are dealing with 1989 primarily.   And in 1989, I think -- we are at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency said was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are actually more effective. Now, we are reluctant to recommend them for the center seat or aisle seat because people might get caught in the spools. On the other hand, manufacturers may be able to work out that problem. Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to try to figure out a way around it. And the SG, looking at all that stuff, says, you see, they didn't mind if manufacturers were put under another legal obligation to do it, because they'd have no objection to making the manufacturers do it, they are just not certain yet.   Now that's -- that's how I read what was said.   They wrote It doesn't sound like they are against a tort suit that would require you to do so, because, in 39 - Subject to Final Review ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 principle at least, all of those things should be taken into account.   Those arguments are what I think Justice Sotomayor was saying If the agency wants to displace those tort suits often, all they have to do is say that the purpose is something like you are saying and that they are intended to be displaced.   It doesn't have to. That's 40 - Subject to Final Review ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 why I am only making this comment, rather than in the 2 form of this question that maybe I don't understand why 3 they don't.

Now, what’s want to collect all this money; it's too complicated; and so I don't know how many of these messages are related to work and how many they are just mucking around prying into each other's business.    So I would like to know, so 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   -- the city owns the pager.  It's a pager used for work. 25   They are giving a privilege to people if they want to 31 unreasonable about that?

My question, which I just repeated, is why is that an unreasonable thing?    How does that differ from what I just said?    That's the conclusion.  Now, what's your reason?    Well, explain that one to    Okay?  So I start off 14 15 16 17 18 19   could have done it.  They could have got -- they could 20   have got consent from the officers first to do it.  They 21   could have had the officers themselves count the 22   messages.  After all, the officers were the ones that 23   were paying for the overages.    So all right.  Now you tell me why that isn't reasonable.    Now, he says, I still want to 10   didn't sound very practical.  What's the other way? 11 12 13 14 15   to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related.  I’ll 16   tell you that.  I only had two.    Well, the officer is going 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   all you do is business-related.  No more --    Okay.  What's a third way?    But the question, in the 10   reasonable or unreasonable?  So the question -- what I 11   asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result 12   if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have 13   done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000. 14               But I could say a person who doesn't want 15   to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the 16   unverified word of the officers who were using these for 17   God knows what is not being unreasonable.  That's the 18   ultimate issue.  And that's why I’m putting it to you 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   idea.  He just says these are private.  And that allows 37 to show me that what they did was unreasonable.

If we agreed with that, how ￼they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated, and they’ll administer it in a way that will make it hard to select juries. That's the harm I'm worried about.

I can't find any difference in the 8   language.  So what is the difference? board's power?    Clearly.  Okay.  So what is the difference between the situation I just described and this situation where the Board simply delegated its ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   quorum for the board as a whole to act?  Once it's 9   delegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's 10   already said, unless it takes another vote, that it's 11   going to let those three people decide.  It has -- I 12   understand the word "delegated" to mean it's given over 13   its power to a subgroup.  If it wants to take it back, 14   it needs a quorum to do that.  That's what I understand.    Okay.  Now, got that 17 18 19 20 21   other way, why should it be read your way?  I mean, I 22   can think of a lot of reasons why not.  One is something 23   that Justice Scalia was raising:  It may work havoc as 24   to what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the 25   board staff decisions, which are, which aren't.  I can    And -- and, therefore, I would like to know, since you could also read it the 15  - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   for expression of dissent.  And what you have here is 8   you have two members in a group and -- who have publicly 9   announced that on more than one occasion over the last 2 10   years plus 3 months when this board has sat with only 2 11   members, that they have sometimes compromised their 12   opinions in the interest of the institutional purposes, 13   basically to keep the doors open. 14               And so you don't have a full and robust 15   debate.  You don't have the potential for an expression 16   of a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the 17   distinction that we see.
08-146 +++$+++     What?    Okay.    I mean, which one applies 21  ￼1 here? 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    Estoppel?  I don't understand estoppel. 10 11 12 13 14 15   treatises.  So could you explain to me quite simply what 16   is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone 17   who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to 18   have it enforced?    Oh, okay.  That's all I wanted to know is what's the theory in this case.    If that's the theory, I -- unless I think it always applies, I could just say I don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary. 12 13 14 15 16   whether you can enforce it.  Now -- so you'd better say some other things. (Laughter.)    I just have to decide 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   that the court of appeals made.  Is that your theory of 24    Now you're saying, no, we
08-1470 +++$+++     That happened about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it? that he waived, but the former certainly would be neutral. near the --    Okay.  So -- so what we 5    Would you say that that’s -- that's gone past the point where --    What they say is, “a course of conduct” -- we will not hold -- “This does not mean a defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion....”    But the prosecution's burden is great.    I thought Miranda held that you can't question a person unless he waives his right. 23 24 25 Now, is it clear law that once he says "I do not waive my right," the police cannot continue to question him? 12  ￼10 11 12 13 14   Is that -- that's Miranda?  Or at least that's unclear? 15   Is that --    You can question him even 16 17   prerequisite to questioning, but the waiver is not.  In 18   fact -- 19 20   the waiver.  I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a 21   person hasn't waived his right.  Now let's suppose he 22   says, "I do not waive my right."  Okay?    No, I'm not talking about   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12   this.  The question is whether, after 2 hours and 13   15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about 14   Supreme Court law.  Supreme Court law is clear:  You 15   cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't 16   waived his right.  So then the question becomes, is it 17   reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 18   15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is 19   it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that 20   he has not waived his rights?  Is that the question?    Is that clear law, yes or    Okay, yes.  If that's clear law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking him questions and he says nothing, that it has become clear that he has not waived his right?    For the question is not   1   that you are unwilling to waive, then essentially it is 2   in that case -- I want to keep this separate, but that 3   would be an invocation:  I do not wish to answer your 4   questions.  If you make a crystal-clear statement like 5   that, it's a different question. 6               But here Mr. Thompkins didn't say he was 7   unwilling to waive.  He’s participating.  Now, you 8 9 10 11 12 suggest that there was silence --    I grant you, you might argue for a change in the law.    -- in the absence of some special circumstance.    Am I right?  I mean Miranda does not explicitly say that you cannot continue      Then it says, clearly, that even if the police and the prosecution testify he did waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if there's a long questioning, even then, the court should be very careful about admitting it.    And doesn't it flow from that a fortiori that if he doesn’t admit it and all there is, is the long questioning that, there has been no waiver?    He answered three 57  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 questions.   All right. One, do you believe in God? Yes. Two, do you pray to God? Yes. Three, have you asked God for forgiveness for shooting the boy? Yes. Okay. So, where -- where did he waive it?   So, in this case, after 2 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just ￼said, when questions, Miranda is did he waive his Miranda rights?   No, I think any then -- then --   It says you can't admit the stuff after a long questioning unless he waives. Obviously, he says something or there would be nothing to admit.
08-1521 +++$+++     Okay.  How does that work? I think that would be useful for either you or 10 11 12 13 14   briefs.  Look at the statistics.  You know, one side 15   says a million people killed by guns.  Chicago says that 16   their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including -- 17   and they have statistics -- including lots of women in 18   domestic cases.  And the other side disputes it.  This 19   is a highly statistical matter.  Without incorporation, 20   it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided 21   by Federal judges. 22               Now, think of this, too:  That when you have 23   the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, 24   there’s always a big area where it's free speech versus 25   a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus 14 right different from others?    There are two ways.  One is that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the  clarity, but that's a dissenter's view. (Laughter.)  1   life.  When it's free speech versus life, we very often 2   decide in favor of life.  Here every case will be on one 3   side guns, on the other side human life.  Statistics, 4   balancing life versus guns.  How are Federal judges in 5   your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in 6   a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to 7   carry this out?  I want to see where we’re going.    Let me be specific, suppose Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human   1   think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't 2   matter.  How do you decide the case?    -- the ordered liberty   1   you make is, well, given this context, you should not be 2   able to have concealed carry.  Well, maybe that's 3   right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the 4   Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of 5   regulation.    But --    Step one -- step one is    He did, actually. 18 19 20 21 22 23   put in it.  But the question about whether it should be 24   incorporated against the States is a different question 25   than whether they put it in the Constitution. 47
08-1529 +++$+++     I understand that one. The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the Westfall Act to this argument?    Yes, right.  They give the government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a   1 has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with 2 233. Okay. So, what is it to do with this case? 3 Now, what I'm thinking now from your 4 hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's 5 the Carlson thing that is the important thing. Now, you 6 tell me why I'm wrong.   Westfall -- Westfall Act is not -- is not the FTCA, is it?   Oh, it is the -- in other words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act that gives you action against the government.   So it says Okay. You go ahead. You explain it to me. I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen. (Laughter.)    Can't they sue the Federal Government and collect money?    No, I mean, can't your clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their claim?    Did your clients sue the Federal Government?    Did they collect money? 47  3 4 5 6   this case under the -- the Bivens jurisprudence.  I 7   mean, the purpose of Bivens -- this Court has acknowledged 8   recently in Meyer and Malesko is to provide deterrence 9   to -- to Federal officers.  And this is exactly the type common sense. And before I -- I conclude, I just want to speak for a moment about, you know, the importance of ￼ 
08-1553 +++$+++     Is this the language?  It ￼  1   well as a connecting or delivering carrier and required 2   to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the 3   historic purposes of Carmack on its head. 4               The purpose of Carmack was to require the 5   first carrier in the chain to issue a single through 6   bill of lading to the destination that would govern the 7   whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms. 8   No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of 9   lading, so there’s only one receiving carrier.  It's 10   the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper. 11   If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the 12   statute uses the term "originating carrier" 13   interchangeably with "receiving carrier," and it 14   provides venue over that carrier only at the point of 15   origin of the shipment.  That would make absolutely no 16   sense if someone downstream could be the receiving 17   carrier.  In this circumstance you would say, I suppose, 18   that Union Pacific was the receiving carrier --    Why?    All right, so you're saying they don't have to issue --    Fine.  If they don't have to issue a separate receipt, what we’re talking about is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship.  ￼10 11 12 13 14   a person providing common carrier rail transport.  And 15   then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used 16   by or in connection with a railroad.  And my 17   understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction 18   if I don’t -- is that the argument here is the ship is 19   providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection 20   with a railroad.    All right.  Now, if that's correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is  15 16 17 18   defined what the STB's jurisdiction is.  They do not 19   dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional take a moment to explain, because I think it is important.  1   the American portion by rail and no matter how big the 2   foreign part of this transport -- it brings it all within 3   Carmack.  And it means that the bill of ladings issued 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11   I said?  And, second, if it is true why isn't it way 12   contrary to the purpose and a nightmare?    No, but why don't they have to 5   issue a bill of lading?  That's what they say.  So every 6   company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company, 7   every shipowner, even if he’s never been to the 8   United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every 9   one of those is going to have to issue a bill of 10   lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are 11   there, and we know at least one requirement you think 12 applies.    There are two things here I 44   1 2 3 4 5 6   the worst example that frightens me the most.  There is 7   3 miles of railroad transport in the United States, 8   but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box, 9   which has come all over the world, from all over the 10   world.  And if we read this with no limitation, this 11   definition makes the ships that carried it from other 12   places railroads, and once that's railroad 13   transportation, we’re into Carmack. 14               And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is 15   the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt 16   an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability 17   provisions.  And it means the ships that had to issue the 18   bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits -- 19   now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would 20   think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, 21   and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even 22   on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for 23   something that happens within the United States.    Okay.  So now, if we read it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce ￼ 1   is it that gets us out of that?    Yes.    Well, where does it say 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   appendix, and it is 1(e).  “The term ‘carriage of goods’ 23   covers the period from the time when the goods are 24   loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the 25   ship.”  And as the Court in Kirby said -- 46    Yes.  Yes.  Where?    Do you know -- do you know offhand where it says that, just so I -- I’d better --    Good.    Then why are we suing -- why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here?    I see.    Which words?    Yes.    Yes, and it includes transport, just as you defined it, between the United States and another place -- United States and a place in a foreign country.    So that's what this is. This is a shipment between Shanghai and San Francisco or Oakland.    (a)(2).    Oh, sorry.  Between a place in -- oh, transportation in the United States.    Between a place in.    Thank you.    How -- how do you get out of the language that says that a rail carrier providing transportation “shall issue a receipt” for property it receives? Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail carrier under the definition.    And, therefore, it should have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued 59  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack, as I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain things in it that they say aren't there.   Oh, yes, right; and now we carrier --   You can get the definition it includes somebody who provides intermodal there, and equipment. includes services related to that equipment.  ￼And you look at transportation, and transportation   Ah, now all right. Fine.   But -- 60   1 2 3 4 5   put it on the train.  Okay?  So that's inter-service 6   equipment.  What's the language that does it your way?    Now just give me how -- what I would write in the opinion that would in fact -- because what they did here, the ship, is it took a container and ￼13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 instance, everyone who owned a bridge or a track or provided rail cars would be providing railroad transportation.

Now, it was on the basis of that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA. But we have heard from the other side there isn't much of a record on this. So, if you could save me some time here, perhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of underlying bits of evidence where there might be support for that proposition?    BCRA has changed all that.

And suppose he doesn't, though, that he doesn't clear out because he's not sensible, and he just desperately needs the money.    But if they do something reasonably designed -- a reasonable person would clear out, then why not clear out? 1 2 3 4 5   take this in context.  This is a -- these are small 6   business owners who have invested their livelihoods in 7   operating these franchises.  They are trying to keep the    So what's the test?    What's the test?  Because if you say we are going to give an action to a person who didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into a Federal action every single breach of contract or serious breach of contract that there is, which is the precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed this statute. So, what is your test as to we know that your case is the lions and tigers case?    No.  I want to know your test 33  25    I need -- the injunctive remedies in the State court?    So if you -- if you can show me some cases or a test or something where he didn't have to leave, even though the franchisor's conduct was so bad that a reasonable person would have left, then I'm on to something and I know where to go.    You are going to say they have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't. So it doesn't answer my question to just refer to the 43   1   fact that you have a right to.  My question is a 2   practical question:  What's the harm of sticking to the 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the client is not being deprived of a remedy.

08-310 +++$+++     May I ask one other question before you leave this, which is where Justice 9 10 11 14   city can do the rest, if it wants.  Now, here's what we 15   do with the State money.  We give it to the city.  So if 16   the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that 17   little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory 18   of oil and gas property.  And by the way, the name of 19   that little bit of property left over is called "a impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, something like that, on all of it. Now, the State will collect all of it, and 12   we make one exception.  We define which property the 13   State will directly get the money from, and then the 20 ship." 21 Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what Alaska has done here? 13    The way it does is just as I said.  And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to 10   defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) -- 11   all of that.  Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). 12   The -- the State government collects and remits it to 13   the city.  (G), the city can assess the same tax if it 14   wishes.  It doesn't have to -- and keep the money.  (G) 15 is ships. 16               And the reason I have asked that question is 17   I read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic 18   and Community Development which suggested to me that 19   that is Alaska's tax.  I might have that wrong.  I just 20   read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that 21   is Alaska's tax, and --
08-322 +++$+++     No, I'll ask you that question because I'd like to hear your answer to that.    Whatever you want.    Thank you. - Subject to Final Review I have another question.  How long did it take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   couple more years.  The time that is necessary to 20   compile these investigations and the expertise that's 21   necessary to assemble them and cull the data takes some 22   time in my personal experience.    And how long would it have taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the record to figure out what's happening in this respect in every State or in these States district by district?
08-351 +++$+++     And there are lists of  hearing.  1   liberty is not the same as the deprivation of property. 2   The way we do it under our statute -- the way we deal 3   with this issue is there’s -- the statutory regime 4   really has two concepts, one for property, seized 5   property, that -- whose value exceeds 20,000, and one 6 where -- 7 8   to the question is there is no way?  A person who doubts 9   this probable cause has no way.  He has to wait 6 months 10   until there's a forfeiture hearing.  He's out of luck 11   because then it merges with the merits.    So you're saying the answer    Then I don't see why you win this case.    What?    I mean, is there a way or   1 2 3 4 5   hearing.  And once the hearing is filed, Your Honor, it    Look --    But if I have a different position, which is I’d like to see if it's practical to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in   1   address this issue now because there are three Illinois 2   statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, 3   a right to a hearing at least on probable cause.  And 4   that's a matter of Illinois law.  And although the 5   statutes don't seem to say it, they might. 6               And the second is that this seems mixed up 7   in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my 8   mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate 9   questions:  when you are entitled to a final hearing of 10   whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you 11   are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there 12   was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car. 13               Now, that latter question I think might be 14   impractical in many cases to work out until there's been 15   a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which 16   may be much later. 17               But the former question is where I think you 18   have a point, that there are five instances here in this 19   statute where a policeman could seize a car without a 20   warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of 21   them nonetheless.  So your clients might say:  He did 22   not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to 23   contest it. 24               Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a 25   different question than the final hearing about who's 40 ￼ 1   entitled to the car.  And I also see the three statutes 2   and now I see a case where here in front of me 3   everything is mixed up.  So I think -- perhaps I'm just 4   seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up 5   confused and not separated out.  So why don't we 6   wait?  What's your answer now?    Well, can I get to the merits for a second?    Go back to what Justice  8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 somebody comes into my house and takes a baseball card, and he's supposed to have probable cause and he doesn't, I don't see why I can't go get a judge or a magistrate, determine whether he had at my baseball card, and pretty quickly, too. --    But if you go to the other    And why do you give up in respect to baseball cards or anything in effect to the first?
08-441 +++$+++     That's it.  Writes out the 35  ￼14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   appendix. 23 - Subject to Final Review 1   into the employer's office and says:  "I've discovered 2   that Smith was just convicted of larceny."  All right? 3   Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old.  But 4   I take it he can make the defense:  Well, Smith would 5   have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired 6   him, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get 7   off.  But he should make that defense, shouldn't he?    Well, what it says in this instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one --    Well, I have on page 7 of 24   the -- of appellant's brief that the instruction was 25   "the plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in 36  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 defendant's decision."    Now when I read that, I    Yes.    Fine, okay, all right,    Fine.  It played a part.  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Otherwise it played no role.  It was an understudy, a 2   ghost.  It "played a role" if it would have made a 3   difference.  "Played a part," it would have made a 4   difference, just like my first case. 5               So we have an action, other things being 6   equal, that should be illegal under this statute.  But 7   then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a 8   defense:  If you can show that in the absence of that 9   age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway, 10   which means the mix of motives would have been 11   different, then you get off. 12               So, if in the first case we in fact say it 13   should be on the -- burden should be on the employer, 14   why shouldn't it be in the second case?    Will you --    Will you go back?  I'm 15   sorry to be hung up on this point.  Maybe there are  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5   wrong about ordinary tort law?  Possibly.  I don't know 6   it that well.  Is it that I -- is it that this area is 7   special?  Is it that there are cases so you can say any 8   of those three?  I am prepared to be totally wrong.  I 9 hope not.    So is the law here -- am I  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Price Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in 2   that case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a 3   motivating factor is actually a standard below "but for" 4   causation.  The plurality was unwilling to accept even 5   "but for" causation as a requirement under the Age 6   Discrimination and Employment Act.  The rest of the 7   Justices seemed to not -- not accept that.  But that 8   seems to me the very -- yes, the basic holding of the 9   plurality -- again, not of the Court -- is that 10   something less than "but for" causation is required.  I 11   would be delighted, candidly, if the court would go back 12   to just "but for" causation as the element of age 13   discrimination because I think, if you get to that 14   point, you get out of this business of trying to figure 15   out at what point do you shift the burden.  If you --    What they are trying to say, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot about -- we have a human being who did certain acts. 10 11   And we know this.  We know that human being had a mix of 12   motives and that the bad motive played a role.  It was a 13   motivating force.  And that might be sufficient.  It is 14   under Title VII.  And if you want to interpret this by 15   Title VII, that's fine.  That's the end of it. But then we are going to let someone off if we imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation. The hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there. Well, it's hard to prove what human beings would do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real 16 17 18 19 20 21   situation.  And I take it that's the reason we have 22 23 24 25 imposed this burden upon the employer. Is there an analogy to that in tort law?
08-453 +++$+++     Can I -- can I take what Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that I am interested in your response to? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   General.  Is the whole thing in the record? 8 9 10 11 12    Okay.  Now, reading Judge Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he had said was that there are statistical disparities I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney 13   between interest rates and race.  Well, as long as, most 14   unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with 15   minorities being towards the bottom, of course such 16   statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, 17   some not.  So if the only basis for getting this 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   race.  But at that point, they'd have to go get this 39 information is that allegation, it's hard to see how this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.    But it might be quite a different case, if they had gone into court and found individuals who were really getting different interest rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   same information, because that's where they would find 2   whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.
08-472 +++$+++     But that's not what I'm talking about.    We are talking about the 12   first.  We are talking about the first injunction.  The 13   first injunction says that the government may not permit 14   display.  You've covered it up, so you are not 15   permitting display.  You are in compliance. 16 17 18 19 20 21   it to be displayed.  Now, that I can see is an issue 22   before us.  But I don't see any other issue before us. 23 24 25    But what the plaintiff here said is that when you comply with this statute, you will not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   don't display the statue, but to get additional relief, 2   which was don't transfer the statue.  If the transfer 3   had taken place, it would no longer have been the 4   government's property, the government would not have 9 10 11   who owns the land.  I assume the injunctions meant you 12   will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel 13   of government land.    -- this violates the injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed  ￼23 24 25    Thank you.
08-479 +++$+++     But aren't there things 21   administrators deny that, but you have to take her side 22   of the facts.  So taking her side of the facts, why 23   couldn't the school administrators just do what they 24   said they did?  That is, you leave her in her underwear, 25   tell her:  Go shake her underwear.  No reason to do any 21  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   more than that.  Or if she is really embarrassed about 2   that, say:  Go put on a swimming suit, you know.

Or call your mother. 5               I mean, you know, we can think of another -- 6   a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than 7   her version of what went on here.  So that's what I -- I don't see any basis for saying to the school administrator, you know, you  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   did -- she did have her underpants on and her brassiere 2 still on.    Okay.  So that was my  ￼1   females were involved in the search. 2 3   Honor. 4 5   Wright. 6 7 8 9 May I reserve the balance of my time, Your    Because?    All right.

I'm underclothes, which children do when they change for gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and 15 16 17 18   should be clarified.  I don't think there's any dispute 19   what was done in the case of both of these girls.  It 20   wasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear. 21   They were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake, 22   stretch the top of their pants and shake that out. 23   There's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is 24   there?    My question -- my question has to do with accepting --    What they said on page 135 of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having. I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it -- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat    Okay.  I want to know why that search, if that's what happened, would violate the Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.    Well, I thought there was, because I thought on page 135 of the record the official said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that there was -- 1 2 3 4 5 6   they asked her to shake her pants and her bra.  Nobody 7   said that they touched -- the school officials didn't 8   touch her, that's a given.  But they did ask her to    It's not like you have any 15   child has some pills or something, they know people are 16   looking for them, they will stick them in their 17   underwear.  I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean, 18 19 20 21 22 23   this?  I doubt it.

08-586 +++$+++     I thought, by reversing that, picking out what the essence was, you would get pretty close to what you are arguing for, without getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or -- you know, there are a lot of questions here that could float around, of any language we use.
08-598 +++$+++     I'm not -- I'm not going to 22   context?  They wouldn't use the word "double jeopardy." 23   It would be some kind of due process problem.  Maybe 24   there isn't a problem.  Have you run in your research to 25   anything like what I described? 15  ￼ - Subject to Final Review
08-604 +++$+++     It's the same argument -- it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and the words in the APA are "arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion," so somebody who has an unfair procedure says it violates those words.    And I don't really see that it's any different, except we normally go to those words 24 25   there is an important difference.  The first ground of 5    Can you -- could you go  ￼you, because you would know. (Laughter.) - Subject to Final Review 1   Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains 2   why it was unfair.  And the reason basically it was 3   unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to 4   this case would have thought that you should fill up 5   your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to 6   contest.  And after this case, the board said:  By the 7   way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional 8   facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since 9   you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give 10   you a chance to do it now. 11               Okay?  So I read that.  I thought, is there 12   something wrong with that?  And then I thought I'd ask 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   procedures.  But it doesn't guarantee fairness in the 23   abstract.  So what you have to look at are whether the 24   specific procedures that are guaranteed by the statute 25   were complied with, and they were. 14    I'm right in `stating what  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   meant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it -- 2               (Laughter.)
08-645 +++$+++     If that's so, imagine a ￼23 24 25 what this -- this convention is aimed at?    Now -- now, of course, what I'm asking you with my example --    Is why interpret it that way, where all that you have is a rule of law that applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back to the United States and is forced to give her child ￼10 11 12 13   back to whatever this country is.  I have called it X. 14   Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this 15   statute, which seems to have a purpose that’s looking 16   after women and children?    That isn’t my question.    I'm trying to get at what the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation of the law in this kind of situation?    What’s the normal law where you have a couple -- they’re supposed to leave the child in the country, but it doesn't say that.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 certain visiting rights.    And in violation of those rights, the father, say, takes the child to another country in violation of the divorce decree of the first country.    And suppose a parent, violating the decree, takes the child to another country in violation of an ordinary divorce decree. Does the injured parent have a way of getting the child back?    No, you are not understanding my question.    My question is, outside this convention --    You would go and take the court's order to a court in the United States and try to enforce it?    And the American court would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it?    Well, all right.  So our question here is which of the two mechanisms should we use?    I'm sure there isn't, but under the law --    I’ve read through that, and I’ll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through ￼overstating here, but -- but I -- I am in equipoise, 22 23 24 25   brought up?  That is, the parent that has visitation    Canada is on your side; that the House of Lords is -- has some dicta written 46  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 by two judges, which is good, but it wasn't a holding in the case.

08-661 +++$+++     What other paragraph do you want me to focus on?    No, I'm interested in the complaint at the moment.    All right.  So I thought -- ￼I thought -- as I read your complaint, almost every word of it had to do with pro -- per se violations. So I forget those here, right?    You forget -- just yes or 10 11 12 13 14 15   in the markets.  That's what I'm supposed to focus on?    Yes.  Okay.  So I'm looking at the complaint.    You want the Red Sox to compete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that right?    I mean, I don't know where you’re going to get your expert from that is going to say there is competition --    They have very small allowances, the 3-year-olds. --    All right.

But I'm trying to look -- what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific restraint you are focusing on. You listed three or four, and one of them is you want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's true -- you are arguing that the Yankees should compete with the Red Sox in selling shirts. Another thing you are complaining about, which is the one I understand less, is that these teams got together and they agreed that they would just have one person sell all this stuff together. And what you think is that they individually should have decided whether to choose that one person, or maybe to choose two people, or three.    Is that right?    No.    Now, you can't answer that question by announcing the conclusion.    Well, can't it ask someone to do that? Oh.  Oh, you are saying the game.    What does a game to do with 11 12 13 14 15   or distribute caps, you’d be right.  But this is    This is a summary judgment    All right.  Good.  Then I want to know what your position is.     Well, it would be if they tried to do it, but, there, they would be attacked on the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not have the justification such that the antitrust law would allow them to do it.    And they are saying  1   circumstance that you describe, to categorize the 2   decision to build housing as a non-venture activity -- 3   a non-venture decision, and, therefore, it would be 4   evaluated independently of the considerations that 5   apply to the venturers' objective. 6             But, here, you cannot separate the -- the 7   venture activity of -- of -- for both football --    So we don't even ask the question whether under the rule of reason such a thing is reasonable or justified?

And people have to understand it because they 4   have to know what to do to avoid the risk of being 5   prosecuted. 6               Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs, 7   you then require people to apply that standard, not 8   simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but 9   also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting, 10   sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting, 11   humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found, 12   the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras. 13               All right, so there is a whole long -- quail 14   hunting.  There's a whole long list in here of things 15   that people might want to do.  They won't know if it 16   falls within this exemption.  Nobody in every State 17   wants to forbid these things.

I mean, your whole brief is objecting to the instruction, and you didn't include the ￼ - Subject to Final Review    All right.  But, look -- I 9   not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have 10   liability if there's only one incident.  And at that 11   point, I say, gee, I don't know.  I mean, maybe it 12   depends on what the incident is.  Maybe the incident 13   involved somebody saying, hey, Brady?  What's Brady?  Or 14   somebody saying, what's a criminal trial?  I mean, that 15   person needs training. 16               And -- or -- but I don't even have to think 17   of that here, because there were four incidents here. 18   And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird 19   hypotheticals.  So where we have four instances and we 20   have correct instructions, what's the problem?    Okay.  Okay.  We have -- we ￼                - Subject to Final Review 1   have -- all this case?  I thought that they had several 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   true.    All involved -- in other words, there has never in this office been an instance of a Brady violation outside of this case.    Ah.  There were four Brady violations involving this office, okay?    All right.  So now we're talking about not one; we are talking about four --   -- over many years, with ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   tens of thousands of violations, correct?    We don't?    So we have to overturn the jury finding? ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   indifference to the fact that inaction would obviously 2   result in a constitutional violation.  That's what they 3   found. 4               Now, how can we -- assuming that's true and 5   accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there 6   was something unlawful?  Because you're arguing -- 7   you're all arguing about whether the training program 8   really was adequate or not.  They found it was not. 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 What do we do?

09-658 +++$+++    Might. See, that's the trouble. We have a lot of evidence, I think, here, at least by first glance, that -- a lot of evidence he shot the guy. A lot of evidence he carried -- kidnapped him. All right? And now the -- now, maybe it was accidental, but if it was accidental, it's still felony murder; and 24 - Subject to Final Review ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 he received 2 sentence he 3 4 State court's conclusion that this was not prejudicial 5 was clearly wrong. All right. If it's clearly wrong, 6 what is it so clear, that he could get off if he went to 7 trial? through the plea bargaining the minimum could get for that. You started out by saying that the -- the   There is no -- there is no finding that this was not prejudicial?   If I assume that the word and the reference to Strickland were a   I don't want to miss ￼14 15 anything. 16 17 this record 18 appearing at three different stages in the proceeding. 19 First, from his attorney, who articulated this in the 20 sentencing -- it's in the supplemental appendix at page 21 7: Mr. Moore had a very difficult time accepting the 22 fact that this was a felony murder charge, or a felony 23 murder offer. That leads directly to the fact that Mr. 24 Moore did not plead guilty. 25 This is only a nolo plea. And while in some 29   No. The sentence is 25 years mandatory for felony murder. Now, the jury believes just as you said. It believes it was an accident; he never intended to pull the trigger. How does that get him a lighter sentence? That's my question.   Well, then, if he is kidnapped -- if he is convicted of the kidnapping and there was an accidental murder that took place, I believe that that would be felony murder.   Yes. And the defense to kidnapping was what?
09-737 +++$+++    But surely it has to be raised post-trial if your legal argument is I mean, I would have thought that was a classic instance where you do have to make the motion. That's the whole point of having to renew it.   Yes.   Okay. Fine.   Now, how is yours one bit Because what you're saying is that the 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 different? 22 evidence, when you look at it, will show the facts are 23 such that there must have been qualified immunity under 24 the law.   1 that this Court's case law concerning -- the Mitchell 2 line of cases concerning collateral order appeals in the 3 qualified immunity context divides qualified immunity 4 claims into two halves. 5 There are evidentiary sufficiency-based 6 qualified immunity claims, and there are legal claims.   Well, I don't know it would work fine, because it seems to me you have a lot of sufficiency of the evidence thing, but that's another question.   No, no. I mean they went on the jury's resolution of the facts.   For that reason, they can't take the facts as they were in your motion for summary judgment. They have to take them on the basis of -­ they can't just go back and review them on the -- yes.

So now we have two question is, how did your client find out these very 16   questions.  One is, under what circumstances can a group 17   of people broadcast on television something about a 18   private individual that's very obnoxious?  And because 19   of the funeral, you said that -- I accept that from your 20   point of view; that is very obnoxious.  And the second 21   is, to what extent can they put that on the Internet, 22   where the victim is likely to see it?  Either on 23   television or by looking it up on the Internet. 24               Now, those are the two questions that I'm 25   very bothered about.  I don't know what the rules ought 12  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   to be there.  That is, do you think that a person can 2   put anything on the Internet?  Do you think they can put 3   anything on television even if it attacks, say, the most 4   private things of a private individual?  Does 5   Maryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit 6   that?  We know it does.  And what should the rules be 7   there? 8 9 Have I said enough to get you talking? (Laughter.)    Well, you can go ahead and    I'm quite interested.    What about the -- taking -- if you have an instance where the defendant has said on television or on the Internet something absolutely ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   might not leave this alone.  But if it's not going to 5   leave this alone, there's where we need a rule or we 6   need an approach or we need something to tell us how the 7   First Amendment in that instance will begin to -- enter 8   and force a balancing. 9               Is it that you want to say no -- no punitive 10   damages in such a case?  Or that you would have to cause that we are trying to demonstrate how awful the war is. At that point, I think the First Amendment 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   okay, good.  Thank you.  Go ahead.    Hustler -- Hustler v. Falwell is defamation.    Intentional infliction, ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   reasonable, rational connection.

09-804 +++$+++    Okay. Are you finished   If you're finished. As I  - Subject to Final Review 31 1 understand what you have been saying and written, you 2 don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract? I 3 mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan 4 and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it 5 according to terms. That's one view. 6 But if you took that view, you get into 7 problems such as were mentioned. The employer would 8 write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable 9 contract. Nobody would understand it. You'd have to 10 worry about the time when it was less favorable than the 11 written document. So call it a plan if you want, as 12 long as you 13 14 saying just 15 And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that 16 provision govern? I take it there's a provision, 17 1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of 18 accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice 19 in a manner calculated to be understood by the average 20 plan participant. 21 So I would have thought, I read that, I get 22 what you've said in your brief. The summary was 23 inadequate. It wouldn't have been understood, and, 24 therefore, according to this particular provision, those 25 provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void. don't mean it's an enforceable contract. Now, there's a provision that deals with it, what you said in response to Justice Alito. ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 32 So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of those particular void provisions, and you get what you want. Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me, except I don't see that anywhere in this case.   So there's some reason it doesn't seem to appear in the opinions. It doesn't appear in the briefs. It doesn't appear anywhere until you just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or seemed to.   So they could -- they might the company into it.   But the SPD is written by the fiduciary.   And the other is written by - Subject to Final Review ￼ - Subject to Final Review 44 1 the -- by the person who is giving the money, the 2 employer. So now you're saying that it's a contract, 3 even though it wasn't written by the employer and even 4 though it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual 5 -- from the actual plan document. Sometimes they'd be 6 favorable to the employee, sometimes they'd be 7 unfavorable, sometimes they'd be different but neutral. 8 So what's the judge supposed to do? Forget about the 9 basic document and just enforce this thing written by 10 the fiduciary?   Is that true of the certificate of insurance? Is a certificate of insurance a simple document that any consumer is able to understand or -- or is supposed to be?   Is there an example I could look at?

When -- how and when does the person correct the legal error in his sentence?   And if the trial court says no, what does he do?   Fine. Okay. So now we have two appeals. One is from the judgment of conviction; another is from the judgment imposing the sentence. Now, the Federal statute says a 1-year period of limitation shall apply from the date on which the judgment became final. Correct?   Okay. When is the date on which the judgment of the sentence became final?

Our problem is that there is no appeal from the judgment -- from the sentence where he asks for correction as a matter of mercy and not law.

It's the same rule. It's the same procedure.   This would help you just as much, I imagine. I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind.   I know. You see, my basic question is So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever that's decided finally? Why is it collateral at all?

But trying to figure it out, he 3 says look: This whole thing was written for a different 4 purpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those 5 things from the beginning into the tables, we're really 6 going to get into a mess. For example, we are going to 7 give people deductions when they have lease payments, 8 even though they're not owners when they have lease 9 payments. The company owns -- not even an ownership 10 expense, but it does say use the lease payment. And 11 then it has all these other things. 12 So forget it; do a simple thing. It says 13 ownership expense. You go to the registry of motor 14 vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner? And they'll 15 tell you, yes or no. And if the answer is yes, he 16 deducts $471. Sometimes that's too little; sometimes 17 that's too much. But once we depart from that, we're 18 really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all 19 these things mean that were written for other purposes. 20 So, what do you say to that?

So why, if there's inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at the decisions of the appellate courts which write their reasons down, and then you would know whether it is being decided -- applied inconsistently or not inconsistently. Why look at a blank wall? Why not look at people who write opinions? And then you'll find out.   No, of course not. But is your claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding, are you denying, are you just saying nothing about whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of substantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for -­ that's the rule, isn't it?

All right. Then I don't didn't because it would be so easy, if   33 1 courts -- there are six -- there are six district -­ 2 district courts. There are six appellate districts, I 3 guess, within the State -- within the State of 4 California and who knows how many superior courts. For 5 a petitioner to examine the holdings, the rulings in 6 each of those districts would be virtually impossible. 7 The only one -- for a petitioner who is in prison, who 8 is unrepresented by counsel, and let's not forget that 9 non-capital habeas petitioners, and this is a 10 non-capital habeas petitioner, is not represented by 11 counsel.   But it's like having rules; when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find impossible cases that you should have heard because it was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you give the people equitable discretion to depart from it, and pretty soon you get litigation over that. I mean, there's no perfect system.

Once you say that, you're -- you're outside the reg.  I mean, when you read the reg and the policy statement, it's pretty clear what they are thinking of.    No?    It's right here.  It's on -- it's on 53,057.  And what they're explaining is that, and they're talking about a third situation, and they say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that 57  ￼1   provider. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    And so, if it exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider, you have to say what is the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider.  And that involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair or just price for this particular service. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   thought coming in.  I have to look at a lot of things.     No, but what I'm doing there, you see, is now I'm trying to make sense out of an agency interpretation which is other than what it says, where what they're trying to do is to change the nature of the statute from a kickback statute into a statute that protects consumers across the board from paying for things they don't get.    Now, that's where I'm sort of interested in what the legislative history said, et cetera, et cetera.  It's much more complicated than I 58  ￼    And then part of that is -- 9   you might want to say something about the other part.  I 10   mean, the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is 11   to prevent agencies, seeing the supreme importance of 12   their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and 13   in particular transforming into a criminal law something 14   that really wasn't much there. 15               Now, procedure is important in that.  And 16   that's why I'm very interested in whether -- whether 17   they gave notice to the public:  Dear public, we are 18   thinking that this is far more than a kickback statute.

10-1104 +++$+++     The specific case where the State remedy is not available is?    No, no, no, no.  Your --    Your allegation which you believe states a valid claim under Bivens action but not under State law is?    I don't understand specifically what they are.  I mean, it sounds to me that if a person (a) deliberately starves somebody to death, for example, or deliberately gives him something 29   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 which will make him sick when he eats it, that that would at least be negligence and would arise under ordinary State tort law.  So, I'm curious to know what your claim is that does not arise under ordinary State tort law?    I heard the answer in    I want to know specifically what you say they did to your client that doesn't make out a State tort claim.    I heard you say --    -- that.  I just want to know what it is physically you say the defendant did to your client, so that I can evaluate your statement that California gives no tort remedy for that.    Sorry, I don't mean to sound irritated, but I just have trouble getting my question across.    All right.  They failed to give him adequate food for what?  So he could live, or for what?    They gave him -- and if a person in California who has charge of -- of a ward or someone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you're saying California tort law gives no remedy?    I would call it like negligence, you give a remedy.  If it's not negligent, it's deliberate?  Or what?     It seems odd to me because the Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment. So, you have to have a cruel treatment.  And where a person deliberately or negligently subjects someone else to cruel treatment, my -- my law school recollection of many years ago is that there ordinarily is a tort 32  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 suspicious of your statement that there isn't.    Therefore, I ask for some elaboration of that.    When I went to law school, which was many years ago, instead of talking about, like, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they talked about a general thing called negligence.    And it seemed to apply to doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it applied to others, and -- and is there something here that wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric or the general terms of California tort law?    And I know, I don't want you just to repeat yourself. 35  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So, I guess I have the best answer I have.    I would find that rather surprising, too, actually. (Laughter.)    That -- what they're saying is that you're not going to be able to show that; so, it doesn't worry them.
10-1121 +++$+++     Yes, I see that point.  Can I ask you -- oh, are you -- you want to pursue that further, or are we --    All right.  Let me give you this example.    And now I -- but I think I  ￼1   see what your answer is.  Imagine it's year two.  In 2   year one, expenditures broke down so that it was 3   70 percent chargeable, 30 percent not chargeable.  Got 4 that? 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    And normally, under Hudson, that means in year two the deal is the objectors pay 70 percent, right?    In the middle of year two, surprisingly, something comes up.  Something comes up. A surprise to the union, and they want to have a special assessment.  And you're saying they just can't without going through this procedure all over again?    Right.  But in my hypothetical --  1   all going to be used for -- for assessable activities or 2   not.  And they have no -- you're telling me they have 3 no -- 4    Yes, but the hypothetical, if I could continue with it, is -- is perhaps unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and 14 most honest people in the United States, and they've all absolutely guaranteed, and everybody agrees, that this goes to chargeable activity.  And where I was going with my question, which you see where I was -- you're with me on this, right?    And combine the two.  What I'm trying to point out and get your response is that you've been forced into this position to create a workable system.

No, but the -- the problem if you win in this case, and then there is this other way of getting to the same -- the same result, is that the other way of getting to the same result, while permissible, is far less transparent.  And people won't understand it, and it -- it encourages a kind of slyness that seems highly undesirable. And the virtue of the present system is that it does require some forced loans, that's true, but it does wash out in the wash, and it ends up being fair to the objectors.  And it's simply hard to think of a better system that doesn't provide more administrative problems than the existing one.    So, that's -- go ahead.

10-1150 +++$+++     It is also hornbook law that the application of a law of nature can be patented. 10 11 12 13   a law of nature.  Now, we read the words of applying it: 14   Administer a drug, determine the level.  And then it 15   uses the word "wherein," which I'll ask them what that 16   means.  But -- but -- so, they say those two words, 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 administer the drug, determine the level, are the application of the law of nature that they found. Now, there's something odd about that in your view --    -- at least.  And I want to know what.    All right.  So, in this case, what I think the claim is, is that we are applying  ￼15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 look at his little finger.    Okay?  Is that a good patent or isn't it?    Why not?

And there's lots of investment to be protected.    You are getting warmer, 17   to that?  And now we run into problems, because if you 18   have to just not look at the law of nature, don't look 19   at it when you decide whether it's novel, that not only 20   runs into conflict with prior cases, but it doesn't make 21   much sense because really the novel thing is often the 22   law of nature.  But you say you have to add something.    You're going on a 13   limitation thing.  So, you're going to say reject all the 15 fancy hypotheticals I'll also spare you.    But it's pretty easy to think of the same problem you have, you know, which doesn't have this infinity in it.    Which unfortunately we have to deal with.    Yes, but what my opinion lacked, frankly, and that's sometimes the virtue of a dissent in such a case, it lacked -- and Novartis points this out very well in their brief -- it lacked an explanation as to why what I thought was a patent just said observe the correlation. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   application of the law of nature?  And if you look to 22   LabCorp's dissent to find an answer to that question, 23   you're better than I, because I couldn't find it.    Why isn't that an

Okay, what's the second?    Okay.    Oh, it's not self-defeating, because we keep it up, and the word will get around.    And in case, by the way, anyone doubts it, before he even files it -- one of the    But is there any reason to think before you brought this suit that people thought they could remove it to Federal court?    All right.  Aside from the individual ones, what's actually worrying me, which I've tried to bring out, is I'm pretty certain Congress in this statute was trying to protect the average person  ￼1   who can't afford a lawyer who is pestered with these 2   calls.  That's their object. 3 4 5 6 7   gee, I'm not so sure about this.  They don't gain much 8   advantage, the plaintiffs, by being able to go into  And I can think that if you can bring this suit in Federal court, so can the defendants.    And, therefore, I think, 9   Federal court, and there could be some advantage on the 10   defense side to making things more complex, raising 11   legal fees.  Okay? 12               So, that's where I am at this moment.  Now, 13   I'm asking you this because I would like your best 14   answer to disabuse me of this notion which cuts against 15 your case.

And -- and the difference between the 5   monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are 6   fallible; computers aren't. 7               And no one, or at least very rarely, sends 8   human beings to follow people 24 hours a day.  That 9   occasionally happens.  But with the machines, you can. 10   So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 11   1984 from their brief.  I understand they have an 12   interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe 13   overly.  But it still sounds like it. 14               And so, what protection is there, if any, 15   once we accept your view of the case, from this slight 16   futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done 17   more so in their briefs?

And they applied it in circumstances that you think -- the district judge was    I didn't mean literally "whatever words you use."    I'm trying to figure out  20 ￼ 21 1   all the cases that use some words for a standard, which, 2   as you can tell, I'm reluctant to think that that's 3   meaningful in this case. 4               The other is to look at the record to see if 5   he acted within what you would normally think of as the 6   district court's discretionary authority.

10-1320 +++$+++     Well, you could say, well,  15 ￼ 16 1   enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say 2   what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then 3   the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in.  Well, that's an 4   argument. 5 6 7 8 9    So, they make a mistake and now suddenly it’s jeopardy where it wasn't before, or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what was going on in the room, particularly if it's 10 11   changeable. 12 13 14 15   not guilty.  And as to that, with an announcement -- for 16   example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court 17   decision in the Roth case, which is in the briefs, is 18   instructive because in that case the Massachusetts court 19   said very emphatically you should not ask a jury that 20   kind of question, but --    Okay.  So, let's -- go  ￼ 17 1               But in that case, the trial court had asked 2   the jury, and the foreperson had said that they had 3   voted against guilt on the greater offenses.  And so, 4   the Massachusetts court said, if the -- essentially, 5   these are my words -- but if the Double Jeopardy Clause 6   means anything, it means that when you have an 7   announcement like that, it has to matter. 8               And the other point, Your Honor, is that 9   this Court's opinions such as Fong Foo and Sanabria say 10   that it doesn't matter if an acquittal is on an 11   erroneous basis.  Once it happens, we give full double 12   jeopardy consequence to it.  So, even if one thinks that 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   is the premise of your argument.  Only if there is a 21   constitutional necessity to -- to sever the various 22   charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the 23   jury come in on one charge without coming in on the the judge shouldn't have asked the question and it would have been permissible not to ask the question, once he did and once that's on the record, that is of considerable constitutional --    Yes.

I'm only midway,  22 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   happened:  Judge, I want to know what number they were 9 10 11 on when they couldn't reach a --    Foreman 12 Honor. 13  Your Honor, I would like a poll of the jury as to the acquittal as to one and two. get that? Does both -- do both sides have the right to    No.  Well, here's what Judge, I would like a poll of the jury, each juror, as to numbers one, two, three, and four to be sure that they were unanimous on each as to the acquittal, which under the instruction allowed them to go to the next one. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   Constitution require it?  You have to be sure there was 24   an acquittal.  You have to be sure there was an 25   acquittal.  And what -- what I'm doing obviously is I'm Okay?  Constitution requires it?    No, no.  Why doesn't the  23 ￼ spinning out what I see as the constitutional consequences of taking your constitutional position, and I'm going to be ending up by saying I've never heard of this before. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   I haven't heard of.  So, that doesn't prove that much.    But there's a lot of stuff 8 9 10 11 13   saying, including the Massachusetts State that you point 14   to, it's a very simple rule.  And you seem to be arguing 15   past it or around it or -- I think what they say is, 16   once the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the 17   substance; the person's been acquitted once they've made 18   a judgment and announced it.  It -- the Constitution 19   doesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle 20   someone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to 21   force the jury to announce it. 22               But if the jury gets up at the end of the 23   trial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts 24   and said, contrary to the instructions of the judge, 25   contrary to the law of the State, the jury says we (Laughter.)
10-1399 +++$+++     Would you then go back -- I did have the same question Justice Alito asked, and I'd like to hear the answer.  The answer -- that there -- 15   ￼ 1   I'll add one footnote, perhaps, which -- make it a more 2   complete answer, and that is that it makes very little 3   sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1, 4   1990, for example.  He is now disabled.  And so, we 5   calculate what his wage was.  His wage was $200 a week. 6   And now we say:  But that shouldn't exceed twice the 7   average weekly wage, and we're not going to apply it to 8 him. 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 You're going to apply it to him at some random date.  His wage that he's getting paid is figured out as of January 1, 1990.    But the maximum that it could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he finishes a proceeding. Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would you distinguish and why would you get that result?  For those two reasons, it doesn't seem to make much sense to me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense. Now, you explain why that is.    Where now there exactly? It says -- you mean in (c)?  And now, why is it I can't read the statute the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense?  I don't see any words here that stop me from reading it.    You just told me that just has to do with permanent or total disability, and this is far --    But why -- why don't they both?  I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that -- we now have a special thing, you know, which these people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this individual, and the Secretary, the Secretary or his delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time. 18  ￼ 1   And they've got a special thing here for -- for 2   permanent people, permanently disabled, and they're 3   saying as to those people, we're giving them a break. 4   They can't look for more work.  They can't look for -- 5   they're dead, for example, and they can't find other 6   sources of income.  And so, we say that, that if the 7   average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin 8   with, we will raise it a bit.    Oh, yes.  Oh.    I feel slightly like an Abbott and Costello movie, but I'm getting this -- (Laughter.)    I see.  Is your argument this now -- I'm sorry to be so slow.  But that, look, there is a statute here; it that says compensation cannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual weekly -- or the weekly wage.  Then in (3), it says how to calculate that particular number.  And then you go over to (c), and (c) says that calculated number applies to those newly awarded compensation. And you're saying "newly awarded compensation" means somebody got it through an award, not somebody got it automatically.  And since somebody got it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't apply when you just get it because they pay for it, it just doesn't apply.  You have to go get the award.  And the word you're turning on is "newly awarded." 22   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    That's the argument?    I was -- I was --    Now I fully understand your    What about the -- the business was newly awarded the tax credit at the time they made the deduction?
10-1472 +++$+++     How many years has, would you say, the great bulk of the Federal system been deciding this differently from the way you think it should be?    That's the bulk.    Well, when did all this rot set in, in your opinion?  How long?    What's the first one?    You have a case cited from 1812.  I take it that's it.
10-1491 +++$+++     -- to what I was going to    You say there is not a    Yes, but that's a different matter because you can have a principle that applies (Laughter.)    What source have you for 10   footnote 12.  It looks to piracy.  And piracy is 11   allowed -- in rem actions.  You could seize the ship 12   with which the piracy was committed, as you could later 13   slave trading ships.  But you could not seize another 14   ship, and you could not seize the assets of the 15   corporation.  So, piracy --    Okay.  All right.  So, it's -- now, what -- what I'm thinking of is if you go  ￼16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   question of enforcement.  We think that bridge --    And we're -- and so, what we're saying is that there is a -- in certain circumstances, there could be a suit against your 12   corporation.  You'd have to be careful because you 13   recognize that by creating a -- a suit against your 14   corporation, you're saying every country in the world 15   can do the same.  And -- and, therefore -- but maybe there are instances of like, universal jurisdiction recognized under international law where you could be pretty certain no harm would be done by that. And so, what I'm thinking of is -- is a way of enforcing it.
10-1542 +++$+++     That's all you know.    I'm not asking for that. I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know.  All right?  There are -- you know the hypothetical. I want -- one possible thing to say would be that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that he's here for lawful permanent residence, too.  Every circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and moreover there are other areas of law where I have found imputation rules in the immigration law.  Roughly, I have three or four cases on that.  But they're -- they're not exactly comparable. Okay.  So, I just want to know what is it that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him off to China if we don't impute?    I'm not asking that.  You 13  steps with respect to some subset of aliens. Respondent, for example, brings up the LIFE Act, and that is an example of where Congress has taken a step  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 know the question.  I just want your best effort --    -- to give an answer.  Or I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing; it's either imputation or nothing.    And you don't want me to reach that conclusion.     No, no.  That isn't my 14  ￼ 1   hypothetical -- the child is not born in the United 2   States, right? 3               If the child does not independently satisfy 4   the criteria for admissibility, then the child has 5   entered the United States illegally and remains here at 6   the discretion of immigration officials.    I don't see how -- were you    I don't see how the -- you can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well. They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said 24  ￼ 1   the 7 years of domicile have to come after their 2   admission for permanent residence.  And then the dissent 3   says, hey, what about permanent residents?  And what 4   they say is this case is different because, in that 5   earlier case, the parents had never been admitted.  He 6   came after he was married in this case.  He's here after 7   his parents were admitted.  Now, I grant you they didn't 8   explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached 9   their conclusion without it. 10               And then there's a different split in the 11   circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods, 12   you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera.  And 13   that seems to be what Congress resolved. 14               So, I think if you're talking about what was 15   the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did 16   impute for residence.  And then Congress sort of just 17   doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly 18   different thing.  Is that a fair reading, or what do you 19 think?    All right.  1   want to hear your whole argument here.  You're saying 2   they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng 3   case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the 4   fact that you were about to say, that domicile 5   necessarily includes residence.  And is there something 6 else?

I mean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the 46  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 criminal justice system in some way? That's, I think, pretty much what Justice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying that out, because the more I think about it, the more I think maybe that's okay.    Yes, but I --

But I have assumed that that means we're not 4   talking about airplanes; we're talking about the subject 5   matter of the Act.  And so, is this the kind of 6   regulation that is within the subject matter of the Act? 7   And it seems to be.  It has to do with how you slaughter 8   animals.  It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so 9   specific as you say the only things that are within the 10   scope of the Act are the specific requirements that are 11   there already in the Federal Act, then this prohibition 12   against extra regulations means nothing. 13               I mean, it can't mean that.

How does this provision do that? I think maybe there are other provisions, but I thought this provision is talking solely about books, for example, that are already created.   Well, what do you -- Barbara Ringer said a million. She numbers it in the millions. Do you want to say, too?
10-553 +++$+++     What is your take -- what is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding? Suppose we were to say the truth is that the particular 18   ￼ 1   individual here does have some religious obligations in 2   teaching and quite a lot that aren't.  So, she's sort of 3   on the edge.  At the same time, there is a statute 4   which, whether it applies or not, you could take the 5   principle, and it says a religious organization like 6   your client may require that she conform to the 7   religious tenets of the organization. 8               So, Congress focused on this.  And the 9   district court looks at it, and suppose it were to 10   decide:  That's true, but there's no evidence here at 11   all that religious tenets had anything to do with her 12   being dismissed.  No one mentioned them.  She didn't 13   know about them.  I didn't until I read the very 14   excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained 15   the nature of taking civil suits.  No one said that to 16   her, whether it was in someone's mind or not.  She found 17   out on motion for summary judgment.  So, therefore, this 18   wasn't an effort by the religious organization to 19   express its tenets.  She was dismissed. 20               She could have -- they could have had a 21   defense, but it doesn't apply, and, therefore, even 22   though she's sort of like a minister, she loses. 23               What are your objections to that?    Of course, they wanted to fire her because she threatened to sue them.  But what I'm wondering is, is there anywhere before the motion 20  1   know, this teaching is clearly stated, embodied in an 2   elaborate dispute resolution process.  You don't ask 3   for --    Really?  My law clerk couldn't find it.  Can you tell me where -- where someone did say the reason we're dismissing you is because of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring civil suits?    I mean, does anyone explain to her, which she might not have known, that this is a religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to  ￼ 1   for summary judgment where someone explains to her, our 2   motivation here is due to our religious tenet?    Now, what do you --    That's the state of the argument that you're walking into, I think.    No.  I don't agree with that.  I think -- I think what it says is a religious organization may require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets.  It put that in the section defining defenses.  The defenses are part of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says forbids retaliation against an individual for the exercise of any right granted. And, therefore, I don't believe that a person who has failed to violate the substantive section could be held up normally. I mean, I don't --    I can think it's pretty easy to read that exception, even though it's in a different subchapter, into the retaliation exception. And assume for me that that's so.
10-568 +++$+++    That's part of it. But my -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges, and I guess you have a very vague statute which was quoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules with ethics they're not commissioners. I have in my office -­ commissioners; they're committees of judges. And I have in my office seven volumes which - Subject to Final Review I look at when there's a question, as others do, and those seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a committee trying to apply vague statutes and vague rules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally. So what's wrong with Nevada doing exactly the same thing here?   Oh, so you're saying that the difference is that we're judges?   You mean Congress and legislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have 38 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 exactly the same system?   And they have general rules? It's called the common law system.   Well, I -- so you're saying that one who engages has to use a -- a definitive rule-based method rather than a common law method? So my question there would be, assuming your difference between the branches is right, still why?
10-577 +++$+++     Well, suppose somebody goes -- he goes to a country where we have no extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a postcard to the IRS every -- once a month saying  ￼ 1   an action under the --

And the claim is that they made a 4 5   mistake.  That State court that wouldn't hear it made a 6   mistake in not hearing it and deciding it for me.  Okay? 7   So, now we have a State court thing to review.

And  5 the category here is not -- you know, the category isn't 6 crime; the category is what kind of a crime. And this 7 is a crime of violence. In the statute, or if you look 8 at what was charged, it's called voluntary manslaughter. I would think those categories as categories "crime of moral turpitude."   Burglary -- isn't burglary where it might be an occupied building?   Well, no, no. A warehouse. I am being a little quibbling now. Of course, my basic concern -­   Oh, really? Okay.

I'm asking you a specific 18   other guns, were going to be used for any purpose that's 19   illegal -- if he'd said that afterwards, if I take that 20   into account, I say, why isn't that the end of the case? 21   He had no cause to ask for the other guns, period.  Now,    Wait.  Before him?    Or before the -- is -- do I look at the affidavits and the warrant, or do I also look at things that are in neither of those documents but were in the officer's head? 10 11 12 13 14 15   said you -- you look at the warrant.  Under the 16   qualified immunity test and in the criminal suppression 17   context of good faith, you can go outside that and look 18   at the totality of what the officer knew and, if in    Even though you can search    No, but your argument is there was no probable cause for thinking that the guns  38 1   associate with criminal activity, yes, the police can -- 2   can seize that. 3               But it -- but it's -- there's a big 4   difference between thinking about what the police can do 5   if they enter someplace lawfully and how they can 6 react --    And so, how did that  ￼ 1   in the house, if there were other guns, would be used 2   for a crime.  Now, your opponent, your brother there, 3   said when I suggested that:  Oh, no, that's wrong; there 4   is probable cause to think that any guns in the house 5   would be used for a crime.  He hasn't killed the girl 6   yet, and one gun's as good as another.  And he might 7   well take one of those other guns and kill her.  So, 8   there's probable cause to believe that the guns that are 9   in the house, or at least one could reasonably think so, 10   would be used for a crime.  That was his response. 11               Then, as to whether they're likely to be in 12   the house, well, we know this:  We know he has a 13   sawed-off shotgun, and we know he is a member of a gang, 14   which is defined as a group of people engaged in 15   definable criminal activity, creating an atmosphere of 16   fear and intimidation. 17               So, well, people like that have guns.  And 18   when -- where they live, there may well be other guns. 19   So, it is reasonable for me to think there are other 20   guns in the house and reasonable for me to thin k that 21   other guns in the house would be used for killing this 22   girl if he can get to her.  Okay, that's the argument. 23               Now, what's the response?    That's how he knows that. That's how he knows.    Can we read it that way? And if we do read it that way, where does that lead you?

It goes to what is an injury-in-fact, which 17   the Court has, again, repeatedly explained is an 18   invasion of a legally protected interest that is 19   sufficiently concrete and particularized. 20               Now, we don't think that Congress can, 21   through the guise of a right, convert a generalized 22   interest in enforcement of the law into something that 23   an individual can come in to --

It's for the fire department in case of emergency, and what we don't want to have happen is it's used to stove manufacturers to sell homeowners gas stoves.   They could do that?   All right, fine. If they could do that, why can't they do this?   Well, this is information -- see, this is information that starts off being collected because the government requires it to be collected. So it's there for that reason. And the government says we want you to get this information, it's done for this purpose, so, you know, other purposes, and we don't want it to be used for commercial advertising purposes.

Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not precisely always the convincing feature for me.  So, I read what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as I described it.  So, given the situation today, my question remains.    Are there States that have -- or are there any jurisdictions where they don't give immunity to grand jury testimony for complaining witnesses or others?    For how long have they had    For how long?    And -- and have there been many such grand jury actions?

10-875 +++$+++     The -- what you say to me 8   whoever's fault that is, is beside the point.  So, 9   there's no way to get the words to get to the result 10   that you want. 11               I'll tell you the best I could do -- and I 12   see a problem with it -- is you say that -- you go to 13   1226(b)(1), and it says that any unpaid claim of the 14   kind specified in 507(a)(2); and 507(a)(2) talks about 15   administrative expenses and refers you to 503; and 503 16   includes taxes and administrative expenses; and then you 17   say it's -- at 1220 whatever it is, what did I just say?    No, but I was thinking, suppose I do it by reading the word "claims" -- All right?  Now, I don't know what I'm doing  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    -- in 5 -- in 1226, when it says "any unpaid claim" --    Which is what you want to have include taxes --    -- to read that word as including both the 507(a) claims, which are in (1)(a), (1)(b), and -- and also administrative expenses in (2). Can I do that? 10 11 12 13 14   to payment.  "Creditor" is defined as someone who has a 15   claim that arose prepetition, which necessarily means 16   "claim" is broader and not just one that arose    And there must be instances where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are pretty big --    -- and there isn't enough money to go around, and they're going to have to be paid out of future income along with the prepetition debts. And it can be done, but there is a question of priorities, and the Government is saying there is no priority -- I think they're saying that -- for a  17 ￼ 1   course there is. 2               So, what actually happens?  There have been 3   perhaps thousands and thousands of cases, haven't there?

And it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I can't imagine what security it would violate, whether the government were to say, if necessary privately to a judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new authority for this purpose.    Or it could say the contrary.  And so couldn't we find out whether he has standing there without jeopardizing any concern of national security?    Well, there is if, in fact, the government is going to use this statute to continue to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --    Yes. 14   ￼    No, you can't.  You can't do that here.  So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems to be separate from other people.  He seems very likely to have a concrete injury.  If they -- if they aren't wiretapping the people who are described here, who are they wiretapping?  And they passed this statute in order to have extra authority. So put those three things together, and they seem to spell mother, perhaps, you know.
11-10362 +++$+++     Well, why isn't this -- why isn't what the prison guard does law enforcement?  I mean, the law says these people are going to be locked up and he's enforcing that.    It says he's going to be in prison under these da, da, da, da, da.  You know, all that da, da, da means the conditions of the prison, et cetera, they're all regulations, rules, statutes.  He's enforcing them, why not?    Well, so now you're saying what those three things could provide the definition?    And are you saying that?    Yeah, but EPA is not what I'm thinking of, I don't think they are.  I am thinking of policemen.  Okay.  Now, one basic job of a policeman is to patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and not seizing evidence.  They are on patrol.  That's basically what they do.  All right?  Is that a law enforcement activity?    Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand.  So I'm sure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to ordinary policemen.    All right.  But FBI agents, who are the federal police, they're people on Federal enclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal enclaves, they act like policemen, okay.    Okay.  That's favorable.  I mean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a 39  ￼  1 broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble 2 when we consider real policemen. So if you have a broad 3 one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it. 4 If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots 5 of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't 6 doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside 7 your narrow definition. I wish I could think of better 8 examples, but I came up with the ones I did.

He can go sue for his paycheck that he didn't cash?    Okay.  So why is it any different when the -- the defendant -- employer says, 46   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 here's the check.

Now, once you say that, what you have said is, you know, it could still be material for some individual, even though there is no market reliance.

That isn't this.   These were a group of people that ran some hospitals -- some municipal hospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general. They have a lot of power there to acquire other hospitals from outside the system. But, when they do that, there's no reason to think that that gives them the power to acquire it, where it's anticompetitive.   Now, the fact that you can regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one group, doesn't say that you have to bring in anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in others, where they're anticompetitive. That -- that, I think, is his point.   Don't think of it as one thing; think of it as two separate systems.

And by the way, do we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give the agency's own determination some weight?    Yes.

And we are supposed to assume that's what the contract said.  Is that right? And then -- and then we say, now, can you override that with the principle of equity?  Is that the issue you see before us?    Enter best case -- what is your best case?  I'd love to find it.  There's a case that says something like this.    Well -- well, let me tell you what I'm thinking of.  The -- there is a contract, all written down.  They forgot to put a seal on it. They forgot to put a seal on it.  So I guess it's now 1463 or some year like that.  So they go into equity. And now, they are in equity.  And the 47  ￼ 1   plaintiff says, judge, I want you to enforce this 2   contract.  He says, I'm a judge in equity.  He says, I 3   know, but we've agreed, and you enforce it in equity. 4               The contract says, give Smith all the wheat. 5   And equity says -- you know, there are other people who 6   would like some of this wheat, too, so we are not going 7   to follow the contract.  We are going to modify the 8   contract according to equitable principles, which, as 9   you say, they can do.  And the other side says, no, they 10   wouldn't.  They'd follow the contract.  They are just in 11   equity because they forgot the seal. 12               Okay.  What is your best case to show they 13   did, indeed, modify it with the common fund doctrine or 14   some other doctrine?  I want to be sure to read it with 15   a magnifying glass.

That's crude. 6               So they're saying why in heaven's name are 7   we supposed to -- everybody wants to build.  And why 8   should the people that happen to live in wetland have to 9   pay for all the other wetland?  That's just coincidence. 10   So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners 11   Hospital.  You are going to say, no, it isn't like the 12   Shriners Hospital. 13               Now, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an 14   issue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't?
11-1450 +++$+++     This is what I -- could you    -- to Justice Kagan's first question?  I was looking at the words of the statute. And if I look at 1332, which has been on the books a long time, it says, "The district court shall have 11  ￼ 1   original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the 2   matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of 3   $75,000, exclusive of interest, of costs, and" -- et 4   cetera, okay? 5               Then I look here, and it says, "The district 6   court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in 7   which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value 8   of $5 million, exclusive of interest and costs," et 9   cetera, okay?  So the words seem identical. 10               Now, in respect to the first, we know that a 11   lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't 12   care what this is about, I am not asking for more than 13   $75,000, and the Federal court does not have 14   jurisdiction.  Given that's true in the first statute, 15   and given that the second statute is almost identically 16   worded, at least in that part, why can't he do the same 17   thing with the $5 million? 18               And it can't be the words I quoted that 19   stopped him from doing it, so what is the word that 20   stops him from doing it?
11-1518 +++$+++     But you didn't cite to the Latin, did you?    But you didn't have the Latin definition, which I take it from my colleague and 42  ￼ 1 it was confirmed by my law clerks, it comes from 2 medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut 3 down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction.
11-1545 +++$+++     You don't have to talk about it now, but you can talk about it whenever you (Laughter.)
11-159 +++$+++ 
11-161 +++$+++    How many people does that involve, about?
11-166 +++$+++    So -- so what is it really -- what is it really used for, in your opinion?   What?   Yes, I'm sure.
11-182 +++$+++     But can I say that?    No.
11-184 +++$+++  
11-192 +++$+++ 
11-199 +++$+++     Oh, they're talking about  ￼the fair thrust of this?    What do you think it means?    All right.  So, it's hard  ￼ 1               And -- and I could see that you could say 2   that's prejudicial.  I could also see that the 3   government could say it isn't prejudicial.  And it's 4   pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking 5   they were really not thinking about that error.  I mean 6   that was -- or not an error.  I mean, of course, they'd 7   be thinking about that; that was the issue. 8               And as I read the opinion, they 9   said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case, 10   and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't 11   -- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you 12   didn't, say, take it for the truth. 13               And the other, dissenting judge, common, is 14   thinking:  No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard 15   to understand what it means, but there's an implication 16   there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in 17   context that might have made a difference.  So, he comes 18   to a different conclusion. 19               That's what I saw going on.  And I didn't 20   see some big war of standards.  I just saw judges 21   disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an 22   individual case.  So, what can you say to make me change 23 24 25 my mind and think this is a war of standards that we ought to --    Okay.  So, would it satisfy  17 ￼ 1   that verdict the -- whether without that error, the 2   verdict would be the same.  That seems like just two 3   ways of saying the same thing. 4               Now, if what you're saying is put aside that 5   formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing 6   something wrong, which is that they're not looking at 7   the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all, 8   then I understand the argument; but then I ask the 9   question, well, is that what this court did?    Back to Justice --
11-204 +++$+++ 
11-210 +++$+++     How do we know this
11-262 +++$+++     That -- we've never held that in respect to a claim that the real reason the police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a  6 ￼    But -- but you see, it's different arrests and prosecutions.    There's no --    That's their job.    And it's a very emotional    And if something happens to     -- your reason.    In -- in Hartman, Justice Ginsburg and I dissent.    And we referred to a D.C.  43 ￼ 1   United States. 2               And now, I know you're not going to agree 3   with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I 4   agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you 5   react.    Now, he has also lied about whether he touched the President.    Okay.  So, then putting it in their point of view, I just what he actually said. 7               So, you're a Secret Service agent, and you 8   hear him say -- speak like this -- he has every right to 9   speak like that.  I mean people do.  I understand that. 10   But now he's also thinking that -- I'm nervous about 11   this.  The President is here, the Vice President,    -- same thing -- and I've    Killing babies and so forth  49 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    All right.  So, what is he supposed to do in your view?    Well, it is in this    But this situation, I've -- I'm pretty -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   was not in their minds.  That's -- we're doing a First    Nothing there.    He says, okay --    A lot of people in    Well, he lied.  He --
11-345 +++$+++     If you are going to the -- 10   that time flies, but I think only nine of those years 11   have passed. 12               (Laughter.)    So your question is  whether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter? Is that what you're arguing?    Well, how do you want to 8   argue it right now in the next ten minutes?  I'm 21 22 23 24 25 Then, if we had no 10 percent solution, under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable?    But we have a rule that if 12  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something connected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's why I mention that.    Okay.    Or they could -- this is what is underlying my thing here.  I want to get you directly to answer it.  I did look up the figures.  And before Hopwood and the 10 percent plan, it looked on the 25   ￼ 1   African American side, that it averaged about 5 -- 2   5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily. 3               Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went 4   down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about 5   3 and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe.  And then they 6   introduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent.    I saw what happened, you saw the numbers.    Uh-huh.
11-393 +++$+++     Have you come across --    Yes.  Oh, I know.  So, you -- I would say stay out of politics.  That's for Congress, not us.    But the -- the question 79   ￼ 1   here is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have 2   you ever found a severability case where the Court ever 3   said:  Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and, 4   therefore, we strike down these other provisions that 5   have nothing to do with it, which could stand on their 6   feet independently and can be funded separately or don't 7   require money at all.
11-460 +++$+++     Okay.  So you say they have two remedies, that the NRDC, if they think you are polluting, could have done -- could do two things.  One, they could go and get some expert to try to get a sample or to make an estimate, based on what he knows about the industrial sites that it's actually your storm drains that are polluting.  That's one thing they could do; you say they didn't do it. Okay.  The second thing they could do is they go to the permitting authority, and they could say, will you please ask the L.A. County to monitor the actual storm drains when they come in, a sample thereof. And you're saying they could have done that, but they don't have to now because, now, that is a requirement. And we are doing it.    Let me ask a quick    Does it satisfy you if we just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write, and then you all can argue what it means below?  What about that?  Does that satisfy?  Or do you want us to write something special? (Laughter.)
11-465 +++$+++     Well, anything.  Judges can not do their job.  But -- but when you write something like the word "denied," which is all most district judges write in respect to many motions, they read the motion, they think about it, that's their job. So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a judge who is going to have to write certain words will want to do his job or her job, and they will do it. So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that 15   ￼ 1   isn't a big deal. 2               Now, this case, they didn't write that for 3   some reason.  Many do.
11-551 +++$+++    I saw -- I read the Redbook. I might have missed the part that you're about to cite to, because I'd like you to tell me where in the Redbook it says that a contractor who has a contract that says "subject to appropriations" and is then dealing with the law of Congress which says the appropriation will not exceed X million is then entitled to be paid on a contract where he and like contracts do exceed X million. Where does it say that in the Redbook?   I couldn't find it.   So I would appreciate your ￼    But they aren't talking where it says specifically in the contract appropriations." At least I think they're Now, I would like you right now to tell me,  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   They're trying to use that to distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with, well, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a line appropriation. And I thought that just refers to the fact that because there's a line appropriation, the contractor's on notice.   Exactly. And when you do business with the government over a period of years, and it says "subject to appropriation," not necessarily you but your lawyer, who's a good lawyer, should look up and see what the appropriation is or whether it was made. And that's what I gather --   No, no, not as a matter of policy. I'm putting it as a question because that was my first reaction. And I expect you to say, no, Justice Breyer --   -- you're wrong, and that isn't the practice, and here is what I read to show that 35  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 isn't the practice. That's all I'm asking.   By showing me where in the law it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question for the third time, but it says --   Well, here sometimes not everyone pays sufficient attention to these very clear questions. (Laughter.)   Where -- look, hypothetical. Four people, four identical contracts, the words appear, "subject to appropriation."  ￼dollars. later made, appropriate   Each is for a million Then you read the appropriation that was and in that statute, it says, we hereby $3 million, and -- it is, the payments are 36  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 not to exceed $3 million. Okay?  Something like that.    All I want that says each of those four people can the $1 million, totaling $4 million.  I is the authority come in and get want the    Oh, there certainly is. Putting in the words gives the lawyer notice.   I don't want to write something that suddenly upsets what is well established.   And that is that as it says in the contract, you are barred, you are barred from recovering if we don't appropriate enough money. Should it say that wouldn't matter? Is that right? 41  ￼

11-564 +++$+++     Just sniffing.    No, there is in this sense. Justice Scalia just said it.  He said, you do have an expectation of people coming into your door, perhaps even with animals, perhaps even with binoculars, but not looking into the house, not looking into the house from the front step with the binoculars. Now, why is that unconstitutional?  Because it's very unusual that someone would do that, and a homeowner would resent it.    Would a homeowner resent someone coming with a large animal sitting in front of the front step on his property and sitting there sniffing for 5 to 15 minutes? Forget the sniffing.  Just talking, loud 12   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7   here? 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23    I thought what happened here was 5 to 15 minutes.
11-597 +++$+++     Dickinson -- I got written 6  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 down Dickinson.    Kimball Laundry.  Kimball Laundry was the -- laundry facilities.    They took the laundry facilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they went in and they took this building, you know, took the whole thing.    The problem with a flood is you don't take all the land.  You send some stuff in. And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes back, and -- it's called water.  And so I don't know what to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you actually appropriate the property.  I suspect that they are not quite the same. Anything else?  I got Dickinson.  I've got Kimball Laundry.    Yes, Causby.    The flood comes like three months a year every year.  And the erosion, they say that part that's eroded belongs to the Government now. And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in, that's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land. So if I'm right in reading that, if I'm right -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases somewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 okay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it.  There are people all over the country who have probably relied on this stuff.  And that would be so absent a better rule. So what do you suggest would be a better, clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?    You know, but I want to know what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are there --    -- and I'm willing to accept a lot you mentioned.    But what I'm asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of a substitute that would be better?    So a Department of the Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling paths, and even limbs fall off trees.  That's a taking and not a trespass?    Because?    So our department employee trying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through 20   ￼ 1   Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a 2   taking?

11-702 +++$+++     You don't have to say, "never."  The question is what kind of a statute is this State statute?    And the kind of statute that it is, is a statute that is used to prosecute people --    -- with small amounts when they don't sell.    If your version of what that felon intends to distribute --    The distinction there is really picked up by the district attorneys. And if it's not, then they may be right, because -- because then intent to distribute may well often include, as it does under Federal law, people who 11   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sell stuff.    Okay.  Okay.  You didn't. In any words, nobody did it. 25    -- which is the only other 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   think.    And it says, if he completes it, he then is discharged without court adjudication of guilt.    And -- and shall not be deemed a conviction, it says for purposes of this code.    Well, why are we saying he was convicted of anything?
11-713 +++$+++     In which -- in which --    Okay.  El Paso County in the original plan I guess was -- like number 16.  I've got it in front of me.  And they split it, and it was split somewhat differently or not.  Okay.    No, no, right.  It's a    Yes.    Yes.  Correct.    So -- all right.  All right.  Now, why was that wrong?  Why is that wrong? Tell me why it's wrong for them to do that.    No, no, I didn't say that. I said, in their way of thinking, they are taking the 16  ￼20   problem? 21 22 23 24 25    Tell me -- tell me what's
11-770 +++$+++     What is the actual 18  ￼ 1   difference?  I mean, you have two officers or three.  If 2   they go into the property and somebody's there, they can 3   detain him, and Summers gives three reasons:  One, as 4   Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the 5   event that incriminating evidence is found.  We are 6   considering now the case where, instead of going and 7   detaining the people, the people inside the house walk 8   out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an 9   unmarked car outside waiting to go in.  Okay.  That 10   seems to me identical, as you said. 11               The last one is facilitating orderly 12   completion of the search.  That seems to me identical. 13   You want the person there so that he can open a drawer, 14   so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay.  Identical. 15               The third one, where there is the only place 16   for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk 17   of harm to the officers.  Now, the harm, risk of harm to 18   the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that, 19   well, if they leave, they might come back, goodness 20   knows, and they've seen they are looking for the drugs, 21   da, da, da.  Or maybe they will rush out, or maybe there 22   will be a -- well, any, goodness knows what. 23               Now here I can see a slight difference, but 24   maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe they will come back. 25   Maybe they noticed the people in the car outside.  Maybe 19  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   three. 10  they didn't.  Certainly the policemen don't know.  And they might go in quicker, and then the others will be alerted.  I mean, when you talk generally about a risk of harm to the police, it seems to me pretty close, if not identical.    So what am I missing?    You already said the first 11   one's identical.  I don't see how the third one could 12   change, and what about the second?    That's the problem.  The police have to know what they're supposed to do when they go in to search a house, all right?  And they know that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how to fill in that blank.  And therefore, I might rush in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm, and --    They can't stop them from leaving if, blank.
11-796 +++$+++     So we are talking here -- he can do what he wants with the first generation. Anything he wants.  And moreover, when he buys them from Monsanto, he can make new seeds.  He can make generation 2 because they've licensed him to do it. Here, he buys generation 2.  Now, he can do what he wants with those seeds.  But I'll tell you, there is a problem because the coming about of the third generation is itself the infringement.  So the second 7   ￼ 1   generation seeds have nothing to do with it.  If he went 2   into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and 3   he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and 4   behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would 5   have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third 6   generation, would he not?    Don't people or animals eat 17 18   them? 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Well, then why is it the only way you can do is to plant them?  That isn't the only thing you could do with it.    You can go buy them in the 58  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 grain elevator and sell them for other things.    The invented product.  The invented thing.  The invented aspect of the seed is it has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or something that they have.  I understand that.    You don't use that.  I don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead. You go ahead.    The people buying from 59   ￼ 1   grain elevators are mostly people who take these 2   chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell 3   them for making tofu, they sell them to eat, or 4   this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?
11-798 +++$+++     I mean, you can't say, ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 19 1 with respect to the transportation of property? That 2   sometimes is a more factual inquiry.  But that is not at 3   issue here.  The only issue here is whether it can 4 5 6 7 8 9 escape preemption because the Port was arguably motivated in part by a proprietary concern such as community goodwill. None of those words are in the statute, which preempts all actions that have the force and effect of law, and they are preempted on this basis. And I would like to reserve my time.

I mean, I would have thought it was common sense that a lawyer should tell the client the terrible things that are going to happen to him if he pleads guilty, those things that the lawyer knows or should know about and the client may not.  Alright.  That's a very general rule at that level. But some courts have said, no, that isn't true.  That isn't true unless -- if it's -- as Justice Kagan said, if it's a collateral exception, if it's a collateral consequence.  How many had?  Was it only Kentucky, or was it fairly widespread, this exception?    Well, there aren't that 12   ￼ 1   many.  There are eleven, and two of them are 2   specialized.

11-889 +++$+++     Where does it say something    Yes.    All right.  Does that mean that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the river, go into some other State and take the water out of that other State?  I mean, I would have thought, if that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for 6  ￼ 1 doing it. That you'd have some authority set up by the 2 Compact that would decide where, whether it's really 3 true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no 4 such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which 5 it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State 6 courts in different States to try to do what is an 7 extremely complex and controversial administrative job.    Which language is it not consistent with?    Go back to the first one 10   ￼ 1 because what you have done is you've pushed me back to 2 the equal rights. And now if I am going to fight you on 3 it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal 4 rights to water arising within its boundaries. And all 5 you have to say is equal rights to water arising 6 anywhere in the subbasin. 7 And if I just heard that, then I might say 8 okay, I think yours is a little better. But -- but we 9 have this enormous administrative mess that would seem 10 to be created, and both those interpretations seem 11 possible. 12 So let's go back to that and let me hear 13 quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the 14 answer? 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Justice    Well, we're only the instance where there isn't enough water 25 percent in Texas.  And in that instance, 10 And all my question, and I think that was 11 being asked, is there anything else you want to say as 12 to why that's an easy matter to decide?    But there was a point, it seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 -- the '70s, when they drafted this.    So they are in the room, and there are representatives of all four States, and as they say, okay, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet, what happens?  And Louisiana would say, we want at least 25 percent, done.  Arkansas, 25 percent, done. Oklahoma, same, done.  Texas, same, done. But everybody in the room knows that Texas could never get more than 12 percent within its borders. And since it could never get 12 -- more than 12 percent, Louisiana would be sitting there with not really 25 percent but with 38.  And so -- so -- - - - - --    -- that would suggest that, hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must be some way for Texas to get the extra.  Otherwise, why were they saying 25 percent for Texas?  If --    But if in an imaginary conversation --    Why?    Wouldn't that be a fairly easy thing to check going back to 1970 --    -- to find out whether, you know, Texas was just on some little salt flat --    You know, this is an example I made up because I think --    -- an imaginary  ￼    The relevant legal argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us about this Reach in the subbasin.  60 percent goes to Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma.    Okay.  Now, they've never measured it.  That's because they never fought about it, I guess.  And now we have a fight.  So why is it any easier to develop the necessary measuring system there --    -- than it would be here?    And that argues against you because your main point, really, is that this is all too complicated --
11-982 +++$+++     But that look --  I mean, maybe you could suggest to me that I -- that we should change what the law has been or not follow it here, but where I'm taking the law from is Friends of the Earth.    And in Friends of the Earth, it says a defendant -- namely Nike -- claiming 15   ￼ 1   its voluntary compliance moots a case, and what they're 2   claiming is that this -- a covenant moots the case, 3   moots the case, the covenant they gave, there's the 4   formidable burden -- you know, it's formidable, you're 5   quite right -- of showing it is absolutely clear, 6   correct, that the allegedly wrongful behavior, namely, 7   their suing, but their suing in respect to this kind of 8   shoe, could not reasonably be expected to recur. 9               And they say, since we promised in an 10   enforceable promise not to repeat this behavior ever -- 11   100 years, how could it be expected reasonably to recur? 12   How could our behavior, namely suing for infringement in 13   respect to a shoe like this, be reasonably expected to 14   recur, given our covenant?  And your response to that 15 is?
12-123 +++$+++     But not quite. (Laughter.)    Yes?    Okay, okay.  So we shouldn't have to pay because this is all Page 21 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼ 1 2 3 4   falls under Apfel, but not the other part.  As to the 5   compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty 6   decent Apfel argument.  But as to the penalty part, I 7   don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go. 8               It seems to me that as to the penalty part, 9   the key thing is that if they had handed over the 10   raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal 11   Claims and had the compensation done there.  And the 12   fact that the government is penalizing them for not 13   complying with the marketing order does not fall within 14   the rationale of Apfel.    All I was trying to do was to get you on the basic argument, which you started with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to the -- 10 11 12 13 14 15   reasons? 16    Yes. 17 18 19 20 21   a monetary exaction.  That's Apfel, as supplemented by 22   Missouri Pacific Railroad. 23               And third, even if that were not so, the 24   AMAA displaces the Tucker Act and they were required to 25   exhaust their remedies before the Department of
12-126 +++$+++ 
12-133 +++$+++    Expert costs.
12-135 +++$+++ 
12-142 +++$+++    Because -- why?   In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?   Okay. Now what you're   1 saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do 2 with adequate. There is no warning in the world that 3 anybody could have invented that would have made a 4 difference. I'll have to think about that one. But in 5 the meantime, where is it that that's what they said?
12-144 +++$+++ 
12-167 +++$+++  
12-207 +++$+++     Can I ask you a particular specific quick question?    As I read this, this concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary, or attempted burglary.    And so we're not talking about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and all these other things?    The only thing we have to decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause to arrest a person for those four crimes, their fingerprints are all taken.    Okay.  Nothing else.  Thank for rebuttal.    -- I would like you -- I would like you to tell me, okay, it's different from fingerprints and worse because of one, two, three, and I will write it down, and I'll remember it.  I promise.    That's what it's for?  To determine what his name really is? 50  ￼
12-236 +++$+++     Now, on that, just what Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 23 1   claim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get 2   some attorneys' fees paid. 3               Why is that -- why is that so terrible?  Why 4   is that putting such a burden on the government that 5   they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get 6   these words in the statute, too?    But that's in your control, the shadow trials.    You don't have to have a shadow trial if you don't want one.    So your view here it's the 17   same.  No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed early on for a procedural ground, when the record is inadequate, et cetera. You think that in none of those cases Congress would have wanted attorneys' fees. Or is it --    No, no, no, no, the family gives up. 23 24 25 unexceptional result. Thank you.
12-246 +++$+++ 
12-307 +++$+++    Differences between States    Yes, okay. Fine.   Fine, but once -- the first ￼  1 then by operation of the full faith and credit 2 law, that will apply to any -- any couple that wants to 3 go there. 4 And the State that's thinking about doing 5 this is, Hawaii, it's a very nice place to go and get 6 married. And so Congress is worried that people are 7 going to go there, go back to their home jurisdictions, 8 insist on the recognition in their home jurisdictions of 9 their same-sex marriage in Hawaii, and then the Federal 10 government will borrow that definition, and therefore, 11 by the operation of one State's State judiciary, 12 same-sex marriage is basically going to be recognized 13 throughout the country. 14 And what Congress says is, wait a minute. 15 Let's take a timeout here. This is a redefinition of an 16 age-old institution. Let's take a more cautious 17 approach where every sovereign gets to do this for 18 themselves. And so Section 2 of DOMA says we're going ￼19 to make sure that on full faith 20 that a decision of one State --
12-357 +++$+++     What he did was -- and he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.    Now -- now, in fact,  they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, but via the means of the other grocer.  And there is nothing in the words of this Act that says that the property has to be taken from the individual whom you 10 11 12 13 coerce. 14 It's easy to imagine situations where the 15 coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special 16 and so forth, with the person who has the money. So 17 what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person 18 without the property so that he will do a thing such 19 that the person with the property gives them the 20 property? 21 22 23 24 25    All right.  Now just make 11  ￼ 1 it different. What they do is they get the assistant 2 bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing 3 such as shout at a certain time where they know that 4 that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank. 5 I mean, you know, it's easy to think up. 6 What I can't figure out here is, is there 7 some requirement that the person who is coerced has to 8 be the same person as the person who gives them the 9 property. If the answer to that's no, then none of the 10 Government's chamber of horribles is horrible because 11 there's a way around it.    Is the -- is the    It has to be more property, more money, more money in return for less services or something than otherwise.  That's what you're saying. But I don't think that's -- I mean, right.  But the answer -- go ahead because I -- that's the qualification you're making, the MCNally qualification.

12-399 +++$+++ 
12-416 +++$+++     And are there others?    Is there any other?  Are you familiar with any other?  Because I want to be sure I read all of them.    Well, if there are few or none, then I would say, why isn't the government satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes, there can be serious anticompetitive effects.  Yes, sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge, keep that in mind.  Ask him why he has this agreement, ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a less restrictive alternative. In other words, it's up to the district court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case with advice from the attorneys.    Without guidance?

12-484 +++$+++ 
12-547 +++$+++     Do you know about how many?    But what's in the 37 cases then?  I -- they got up there.  I assume the defendant must have brought them.  They must have brought them. They must have wanted to -- to raise the defense, and somebody said no.    Yeah.
