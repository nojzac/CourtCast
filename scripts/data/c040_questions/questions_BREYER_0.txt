02-1472 +++$+++     Yes, okay.  And anything else?    Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there.  I want you to tell me why those sums -- I get the time.  I get the amount.   Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for $10 million?    It was one of the purposes.    Okay.   -- were it an ordinary    Well, they just did, the 2 28  ￼1 let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing 2   to do with it.  It was a typical, ordinary Government 3   contract for pencils.  All right?  Or for soda water. 4   Now, and everything were the same.  Under those 5 circumstances, just an ordinary contract -- and they point 6 to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking -- 7 we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in 8 the Court of Claims. But -- but we have -- we have a 9 contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The 10 -- the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the 11 contract because that 2 percent is available, legally 12   speaking, time, purpose, and -- and amount.  Okay? 13 Classic. 14             Now, what's the Government's view there?   -- to make -- you see what I'm driving --    If this were under Blackhawk.    Okay.  Then let me do this   You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and 14 15   they could have brought their lawsuit.  Now, tell me 16   specifically, if you can -- and this may take you the 17 whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want. 18 What is it that's special about this contract that brings 19   it out of ordinary contracting principles?    -- and I don't see anything contrary to that. 39  1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   I -- I read here -- look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy 47  1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, 2 not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems 3 to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you 4   say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes.  And so 5   I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who 6 really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. 7   So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a 8   point of normal contract law is legally available, I 9 promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I 10 might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now 11   why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.    I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government 1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 57

03-10198 +++$+++     I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a -- a right to have a counsel on appeal.  He can waive a trial. He can waive a jury trial.  But before he has to -- before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.    And why wouldn't he also have to have the -- to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?    All right.  That has nothing to do with equal protection.  It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera.  So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has 16 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 a right to a lawyer. Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.    That's all.  That's the end of    So what's all this complicated thing about?    No, no.  You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.    But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.    I'm mixed up again.  What is the answer to this?  I -- I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us -- in other words, the one that's at issue -- that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.    And does anybody dispute that? 19 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Is that at issue here?

03-1039 +++$+++    I mean, I would perhaps have 30    Doesn't it?  I mean, it -- it -- what's -- what's the exact language of that I just had it here.  It's -- it's gravity.

03-1116 +++$+++     And when you say there is no ￼1 Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a 2 very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment. The 3 Court began trenching on that very broad view immediately 4 in 1939.    Well, I'm trying to think of what Brandeis could have been thinking.    Yes, that's right.  And this is a reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no doubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the dormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of original package doctrine -­ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   Now, he's thinking, "Why is that?  What is that package 18 doctrine?" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause 19   -- it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause -- the dormant 20 Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of 21   the commerce power in the Constitution.  So if we have an 22 amendment that says "that aspect of the dormant Commerce 23 Clause doesn't apply," that means the dormant Commerce    -- which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor. 24 Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant 25   Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two. 17  1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Now, maybe -- I think that's how he's reasoning.    And if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?    I know you do. [Laughter.]    How do you count bottles?  I would have thought the consumers have all the bottles. [Laughter.]
03-1160 +++$+++    Where the Government hasn't 35  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 appeared and told us what they want to do or what they think should be done, et cetera.    -- or otherwise adversely    That's the natural way to read   Now --   -- suppose we read it that way. do you say?
03-1230 +++$+++     Can I ask a quick question? The -- there are three things.  Were -- were you finished?    Sorry.    Okay.    That's -- that's the problem.    That's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them. Well, let me -- I have a question.  I'm trying to test this.  Suppose that I have a company in Maine. All right?  And I have -- I decide all my -- I -- I have all Maine plates, by the way.  And I decide I want my -- now, let's -- one word is license plates.  I'm going to talk about plating.  Another word is the ICC insurance. Let's call it a decal.  And the third kind of a concept is whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee.  All right?  The $100.    All right.  Now, suppose in Maine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to be my home State for purposes of -- what do you call it? The SS?    Yes.  And so I go to Michigan, and now I pay all the registration fees here.  Do I get a -- a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to 37 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 show I did it?    Yes.    Yes, yes.  So -- that's right.    Do I get a decal after I go through all this procedure?  You have a whole form.  I pay $6 for Alabama.  I pay $2 for Idaho, and -- but -- but I do it all in one shopping place which happens to be Michigan.    Then do I get a little certificate to put on the truck to say I did it.  I -- I registered my ICC decal everywhere.    No, it's not.    I know for have to pay.  But Michigan is my -- I question until I get clear on this.    Don't -- when I -- when I go under this -- this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home State -- payments piece of    -- and I make all the relevant to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a paper saying I did it?    Fine.  Now, I'm now plated in Michigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this.  And I go and I make -- I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you this big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting here for Michigan, by the way, is zero.  And you say pay me $100.  No.  I'm not going to do it.  So I haven't paid them the $100.  I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I paid $2 for Idaho.  Do I get the decal or don't I?    Excellent.  Now, if I don't get the decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100 is a charge that falls within the SSI.  It is a charge for a decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me the decal.

03-1238 +++$+++    But "in certain" --   -- that footnote -- that's where I actually got the idea -- it says, "We reserve, in certain situations."  To me, that meant sometimes it can be a major big deal to don clothing -- protective gear; sometimes it isn't -- an apron.  And whose job is it?  Now I'm repeating myself.    The Secretary's.    The -- what happens -- you win   -- clothes. They're protected gear. That's the assumption. That's part of the job. The workday begins. But you have to get there, and you wait to get the clothes. On that --    -- one, why not Skidmore?  Why not the reg?  And, if so, why don't you lose on that one?   First thing --   -- in the day.   But the word --   "Required" is -- sometimes there's a wait, sometimes there's not a wait.  Is that required?   He has to --   -- not a wait.   Is that a required -- or not? And, if it is, where does it say that in the regs?   No, no, no.   I don't mean that.   I mean, is there -- is there a basis in this record -- will it make a difference?  It's not really well briefed, I don't think.    I don't do things on the ground --   -- I'd like it or not.
03-1293 +++$+++  
03-1388 +++$+++     No, no.  I -- but all right. Now, I'm -- I'm being facetious.    But I am aware of -- of people who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily merchant ship.  Now that -- that I think is a common thing.    Are you talking -- because I think that makes a difference for the reason that once you talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign- flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the United States where the costs would be very high probably to change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be tiny.  All right.  So I -- I want to know what you're talking about. MR. just to -- to    Well, that means --    No, go ahead.    Since you don't you say either I think neither may be true.
03-1395 +++$+++ 
03-1407 +++$+++     What -- what --    No, no.  I -- you've missed my I'm sorry.  I put you on the wrong track with my up.  I shouldn't have.    My question is we all agree ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    -- let's say --    Let's try -- let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money.  Now, would -- that you would say would fall within this.    Fine, yes.    Okay.  Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that 32 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice 2 Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar 3 that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from 4 withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old 5 age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent 6 tax in a world that is imperfect?    Should we put any weight on the the name?  I mean, I -- I can't but thinking ￼1 of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any 2 indication, when people passed this, that they didn't 3 think they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible 4 words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?
03-1423 +++$+++ 
03-1454 +++$+++     So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to -- the way that -- you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress.  That's what we'd normally say.   And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.   Well, what it is, is, it's non- economic, and it affects the economic.   This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me -- I guess, on your should have come out my way. [Laughter.]   I thought we didn't need 38 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- framework, Lopez essential to regulate gun-control regulatory Breyer, that's the reason treated, so it exception were treated as ￼1 to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection 2 here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a 3 market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, 4 a little more obvious and a little more close than what I 5 had to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the 6 connection between guns, education, communities, and 7 business. So I would have thought, given the -- and I 8 believe that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far 9 further than this, which is just direct.   So that's -- I just want to know why.   That's all true, but as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?   If has been done, maybe shouldn't make it.
03-1488 +++$+++     Absolutely not.  Because?    It said the words.  They violated the words.  It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?    And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it.  Okay?  There's no problem about a public forum.  So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?    No.  I thought what you were going to say -- but you're not.  So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked.  I thought you were going to 32  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.    But, now, you haven't said that.  I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it. (Laughter.)    But it would be so easy.  I mean, it's virtually no burden.  I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000.  Then I'll stop.  Okay?   Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.    And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense.  It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it?  It's so easy.  Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.

You have a judgment.   And then if they don't give you Page 18  1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 the check, you have a different matter. We have to get it 2 enforced.

03-287 +++$+++     Well,    Okay, fine.    Then we take it as valid.  Then we take it as valid.  That's not a claim you're challenging. But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.    2005?  Okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.    And in the year 2005, I want not to have the -- what are they called?  The 1998 guidelines.  I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the Constitution of the United States.    So you're saying he's going to have this.  I they can't do MR. want an injunction or declaratory relief it.    And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects:  one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.    That's it.  Okay.  We're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas? because what is    Okay.    My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly.  One is called Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even.  Now, so there are -- there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's usually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions.  So I've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.    No.  It was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.    So habeas could be brought    Why not? 32 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    And why would that be bad?    Why would that be bad?    No, no.  But I mean, is -- I'm asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer. Would it be bad?    Because?    Well, I mean, leaving aside -- Congress changed the statute.  It says absolutely it's going to be habeas.  Is there any bad consequence in the law?    We'll catch them in habeas.

03-388 +++$+++     Oh, not necessarily.  It wouldn't be always either way.  I would think that if in fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not having designed the super-safe product or the unreasonableness consists of not having had a different label.    And you're arguing that in this case you have the first.    It seems implausible on -- you 8  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 know, --   Where does it say that?   Because you were just where it says that --    I'm sorry.

03-409 +++$+++    Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.   So as far as -­   So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is ￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 9  Washington, DC 20005 1 confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, 2 it's ridiculous, they can do it.

Now, if we go back a few more years to Stanford, we get three others in there: Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1; and Missouri, 1.   We have a very different   So the reason that I thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of States. Say, New Hampshire, I think, for example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were several States that on the books permitted the death 1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 19  Washington, DC 20005 1 penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. And -­ 2 and that's true across the country. There are a number of 3 States like that. So if we look at the States that 4 actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of 5 the population are in such States. You go back 15 years, 6 and you get these three other States, which raises the 7 percentage. 8 How -- how should I understand that? I'm 9 interested in both sides -­

(Laughter.)    Are people really not allowed to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?   Suppose it was a crime like not wearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that -- suppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if 12  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 you were in Soviet Russia.

Now -- now, how many times people -- I mean, the -- the -- if you've used it only a dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound like a major threat.  What I'm weighing against that is the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of selling Bibles.  That really does happen, and there really were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been giving you. 32  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 do you think that ￼1 And so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why 2 do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the 3 courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't 4 those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? And 5 we start distinguishing one country from another. And 6 what are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan 7 anyway? I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of 8 a dozen cases in 40 years.

03-814 +++$+++     Yes.    So could we say -- could we say that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door?  A, it must be a -- a structure that normally would have a crew or that -- a significant amount of the time.  We would have a connection to the water.  It would be capable of having a master or crew.  What about that?   Why -- why is this an easy case? Because, after all, the First Circuit is struggling 21  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 with the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use 2 section 3. That's fine. But you know that the garage 3 door is not a vessel, and you also know that Jimmy's 4 Harborside is not a vessel. And you also know that 5 Justice Scalia's beached scow or something is not a 6 vessel. And I take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied 7 up for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and 8 one day they take it out to sea and -- because they want 9 to move it across the harbor. I guess that 10 vessel. Is it? Or maybe it is. So why is 11 Because the First Circuit --    Now let's take section 3.    And taking section 3, it seems have the same problems.   All right.

04-1034 +++$+++     Insofar as it seeks to serve of the statute to regulate this.   Well, what am I supposed to do with the case? I read them quickly. I don't necessarily pick up everything. I'll read them again. But if I don't find empirical verification for that statement, what am I supposed to do with this case?   Fine. And where did the agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a wetland acts as a sponge? It's very plausible to me. It's just that there may be a need to drop a citation somewhere. (Laughter.)
04-104 +++$+++     No, what they have is an indeterminate sentence.    California.    And what they say is, "In our practice, what we do is, we think it's reasonable, and we will keep a person in prison for five years in an ordinary bank robbery, but for seven years if he has a gun."  I'm asking if    -- now suppose the people who do it are the parole commission -- as happen to be in the United States, executive branch 10   keep him in for five years, but if he had a gun, 11   he's going to stay in for seven."  Is that 12   unconstitutional?    That's constitutional.    What I'm trying to drive at -- and I'll be -- is that I can't imagine a court holding that a parole commission in the executive branch that has exactly this same system would be behaving unconstitutionally.  It's difficult for me to imagine -- though you say I'm wrong on that -- a court holding it's unconstitutional when a court of appeals does the 63 ￼ 1   same thing reviewing for arbitrariness.    I'm imagining my system 69 ￼23 24 25    No, I -- in my imaginary parole commission -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   unconstitutional?    I mean, I will argue it another time.  I've seen a lot of parole commission guidelines, and I would say they, a lot of them did fall within the Apprendi boundaries. But if we did take it and have the parole commission do it -- "it," being the Apprendi forbidden system, in your view, is it different point.    Is that lawful under the guideline?  Is the judge required to accept the facts as the -- as the prosecution and defense 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 discretionary systems.    It does exist under the guidelines?  How does it?    How?    No, only, only, only if you have statutes that have mandatory minimums or that have lesser sentences.  That's true.    But compared to the status quo, if you have the guidelines alone, one of their basic objectives was to prevent that kind of manipulation.  And, by and large, I thought they had succeeded on that point.    No.    What is your answer to 80 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6   committed.    -- and the complexity.
04-1067 +++$+++ 
04-108 +++$+++     Because?    No.  It could only be taken if there is a public use and there almost always is.  Now, do you agree with that, or do you not agree with my last empirical statement?    Now, that's, of course, my question.  The question is, if you agree with the empirical statement that there almost always is some public benefit attached, then my question is, why must there be a limit within that broad framework?    No, I mean, are you advocating particular ones?    The remaining test is the --    Can I ask you about the Go back for a second.    Is there a lot of disagreement about this?    I mean, it seems to me you might -- whether there is a reasonable assurance that there will in fact be the public use which the state uses as the justification for taking the property.  Is that going to help you that much?    Well, I mean, I don't see how this Court could get into the business of saying you have to have this by a particular day or you have to have 14 witnesses.  I mean, we couldn't impose that sort of thing, could we?    There needs to be a reasonable assurance.    Well, they might well need it here.    But he doesn't -- he doesn't, his second test does not adopt that.  The 27 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 second test which he was arguing at the end is just 2 that there has to be a reasonable assurance that the 3 public use, and it could include all those things, 4 will in fact take place.
04-1084 +++$+++   the Treaty's commentary in front of me that supports you. Are you not going to read that? [Laughter.] because I    And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera.  And there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a Treaty.  All right?  Now, the Government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting DMT.  Now, what's the response to that?   It says "DMT." And then it has another -- and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if you look at that list and it says "DMT," means what it says   You're in trouble. That's harder, then, if it's --
04-1131 +++$+++     All right.  So I guess you’re saying, as to the constitutional claim, it’s obvious they have to exhaust. There’s no reason why they don’t have to exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be threatened, if it does come about that it’s threatened, they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask for an injunction.  Any reason they couldn’t do that?    No, no.  What they do is they follow, like any other agency action.  An agency action has taken place.  I think it’s unconstitutional 40 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 or you do.  We exhaust our remedies and then get to court at the end of the day and make our claim. An agency action is threatened.  I am threatened with irreparable injury.  I can go to court, I think, at the time it’s threatened, and say I want a protective order.  I think 705 provides for that specifically.  And -- and, therefore, I’m protected.  I can’t imagine why they couldn’t do that if they have a -- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it does violate the Constitution and they need the protection.  Is there any reason they couldn’t?    No, they wouldn’t.  Their point is that the very -- availing myself of the administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of -- in violation of my constitutional right.  Now, maybe that’s not true, but let’s imagine it’s true.  Then couldn’t they go in and ask for a protective order?  I thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.   Yes. And is there any 41 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- reason that they shouldn’t be able to do that here? Because they are going to say that -- I don’t know they ever can make it out in this case, but they are going to say that my having to go ahead with the number -- test number 15, which, by the way, may never be threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I have to do it, violate an important constitutional right that I need to have protected before undergoing the text -- the test.    Yes.    You think they could not do that under 705.  So there is a difference between you on that. As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find -- but others may disagree with this.  It’s my personal view that the notion of private right of action in this area simply mixes things up.  It’s apples and oranges. It has nothing to do with anything.  That if a person, in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a 42 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed, can get judicial review eventually.  But what you’re saying there I take it is that may be so, but this impliedly says no.    Now, my question is do we have to decide that.  Because, after all, this individual may get relief through the statutory procedures that you admit are provided by asking for grievance arbitration.  He may, the first time he asks for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he wasn’t hurt.  Or he may have been hurt, and they’ll say we don’t it again.  There are a lot of things that can happen. Do we have to decide the issue today of whether if he goes to the union, the union says we won’t arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and it isn’t as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to decide that issue as to whether a person in those circumstances can then subsequently go into court?    So we have to say the easier matter is it’s clear that as to such matters, you must exhaust.  It’s so clear that there is no reason for us to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review, a matter which is disfavored in the law.    I might.  My -- so I don’t know why it wouldn’t be.   What their brief says is that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint has to do with whistleblowing.   And this doesn’t have to do with whistleblowing.   And therefore, even if this were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not open to them.   Is that true? What do you think?

04-1144 +++$+++ 
04-1152 +++$+++     All right.  Now --    So, then what you're saying,    -- and then what's the that question, "Does the Constitution" -- how ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 point, equal access on terms of the -- the terms that are extended -- however you want to think about it, though, there's no difficult constitutional question here.    Yes, but it is an important because the -- there is an amicus brief that read the statute."  And, really, the statute 9 military. Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to 10 the military. So, why not interpret the statute in the 11 way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a 12 difficult constitutional question?
04-1170 +++$+++     That's different from saying not decided.  I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't speak of not decided.  I thought it didn't speak in Kleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up 36 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 its -- his mind. I thought it said the jury has made 2 -- it assumed the juror has made up his mind. That's 3 why I think it's artificial. It says where the jury 4 finds. It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and 5 aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has 6 to find that.

04-1203 +++$+++    Is this relevant to the -- I just saw these as -- I -- just by chance, it - - one of the cases in the SG's brief involved Georgia juvenile facilities, where mentally ill patients were restrained, hit, shackled, put in restraint chairs for hours, sprayed with pepper spray.    And that seemed to be one instance coming out of Georgia.    But was there -- there was a reporter who was one of the disabled people, I think, wasn't there, in Tennessee versus Lane?    And so --    -- what is the right that that reporter has that's specific to courthouses?    Well, was there any problem of that in Tennessee versus Lane?  I thought the courthouse officials there said, "There'll be a trial. No problem there, just whether you have to walk up the steps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below." Was there -- it's the right of access to courthouse, specially?   Ah.

Is that right or wrong?    -- Operation Rescue did the of thing now that they did then, the Petitioners plaintiffs in this case would be able to get 10 specific case, and then there's the more general statutes 11 I was speaking about earlier. But there is a specific 12 right to injunctive relief, and I think the plaintiffs in 13 this case tried to add claims under the FACE Act, but they 14 were -- they were denied the ability to do that. 15 The second way it's not superfluous is the 16 example given by Petitioners, in that it applies to a 17 defendant, for instance, who tries to enlist another 18 person in a robbery, but the neighbor, or the -- excuse 19 me, that person just refuses. The physical-violence 20 clause would apply to that situation regardless of whether 21 that conduct also qualifies as an attempt.    I'd like you to get to the meaning of the Hobbs Act.    And I'll try to focus my own thoughts on this by saying two objections to what you're arguing, related, that when they passed the Hobbs Act, it had a section 2, and section 2 said that, "This is an Act that forbids robbery and extortion, all involving interstate commerce.  And robbery/extortion involve property."  Then it had a section 5.  And section 5 said, "This Act forbids physical violence or threats of violence 40  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 related to section 2." Now, all that happened since then 2 is, there was a recodification. And the recodification 3 wasn't meant to change anything substantive. 4 Second and related point: Enmons. For 35 years, 5 working people in this country have thought they had a 6 right to strike, free of the Hobbs Act. And your 7 interpretation, as the AFL-CIO points out, will gut the 8 right to strike. 9 Now, those are two strong arguments against you, 10 and I'd like to hear your response.    When you see something in a criminal statute that forbids "affecting commerce by," that means that Congress wants to prevent the conduct that will follow the words "by," and it needs a jurisdictional hook, so it puts in "affecting commerce."  That's how I've always understood the Federal criminal code.  Am I --    -- wrong in that?    Well, I -- I mean, one is -- I'm attempted to say, "Well, tell Congress that."  If they want to create a separate offense, they can do it.    Yeah, but I -- then perhaps I an old statute, 1951(c), isn't it?  Is it brand new?    Yeah.    All right.  What is it --    Well, the case that interpreted Act, which is Enmons --    -- seems to rely, for the 50  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 labor-union exemption, on the fact that a threat of 2 violence in an effort to obtain legitimate wages is not 3 within the Act. But if we read "legitimate wages" out of 4 the Act, then I guess we would be left with "the threat of 5 violence."
04-1264 +++$+++     Well, what about --
04-1324 +++$+++     I don't know what they are.    And if --    -- they're not there --    -- then the judge could know, I'm surprised that you haven't raised 20 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-
04-1327 +++$+++     Yes.    Because?    Well, what they'll say --    -- if they want to build it out, is they'll say, look, there -- there is DNA evidence here.  It's absolutely conclusive, and all that the light -- the -- the only doubt of the -- the defense has cast on it is they found that there was some opportunity that the police could have tampered with it.  That's true of 60 percent or so of all chain of custody cases, and that is not sufficient to overcome what it shows.  And therefore, it's not worth the jury's time and it'll prove very confusing to the jury. Now, why would that ruling under 403 be unconstitutional?    And he goes on to write as if it isn't that automatic.  And he then favors you because he says the standards set out in Gregory and Gay, as if they aren't different.    But the language says they are different.  So what do we do?    And so what do we do?  We get the -- we read the opinion literally, and moreover, that's why I asked it.  If you look into the evidence, it looks -- you know, maybe it's closer than you might think.  And if we start looking at the evidence of every case in the United States, it's going to be a problem for everybody.  But -- but -- so what do we do? That's my question.
04-1329 +++$+++     As you're defining it.  As you're defining.    Fine.  Then you're talking about patents where the person who paid for the attorney went to the Patent Office and so forth.  That was just a mistake.    But then are you relying on that, the existence of valueless patents?    If you're going beyond that, which patents are you talking about?    No, I see.
04-1332 +++$+++     Your rule would be this. a complicated area.  I'm sorry.  But if a brings a lawsuit, tort suit, against a ￼1 appealable. And, you know, I think this follows from 2 the Court's decision in -- in Irwin that -- that 3 certain defenses that are available to private parties 4 in litigation should also be available, treated the 5 same way, have the same rules when the Government is 6 being sued like a private party.    Yes.
04-1350 +++$+++ 
04-1360 +++$+++     But that's -- that's ￼1 said that if there are particular facts about this 2 particular entry that would make an officer have 3 reasonable suspicions that he is going to be shot at 4 or the evidence is going to be destroyed, then the 5 officer may dispense with the knock-and-announce 6 requirement. There were no such suspicions in this 7 case, and that's why the prosecution conceded, at the 8 outset and at every step since, that it was a knock- 9 and-announce violation. The officers had no 10 information about this particular --    -- inside the building; just, unfortunately, the means wasn't right.  No warrant.    The means wasn't right. No knock-and-announce.    Yes, okay.    This one is designed to prevent damage to property --    -- et cetera.  So, let's not have the exclusionary rule and rely on the damage remedy where that kind of thing actually occurs, which isn't often.    And if we buy that principle, suppose we were to apply it in the Miranda area -- purpose of a Miranda warning is really to make certain he can have a lawyer, if he wants one, for example.  So, now we prove this guy wouldn't have asked for a lawyer anyway.  All the evidence comes in. I mean, it's an interesting principle.  I see the logic.  But it seems to me to have a lot of implications that this Court has never bought.    I can't think of any other area, fifth or fourth, where we've bought it.  And I've tried to explain, in the question, why we haven't bought it.  Now, you go ahead. 47 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-

04-1376 +++$+++     I -- but I -- I didn't understand this now.  I guess I don't.  Forget the '94/'96 periods.    Suppose it stayed the same throughout.  Would you say, then, that someone who came illegally into the country, and he's caught, and he's married to an American, there's no possibility he can stay, no matter what, no matter how appealing?  Is that the answer?    I'm -- yes, but you're talking technically.    Maybe there's --    -- some other way you could stay. What's the other way? 38 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    -- that, in fact --    -- I now have my client in, after IIRIRA has been enacted, and he says, 10 out fast, next train. Go back. And if you get across 11 that border, you're safe. Because at that point, you 12 can apply; and you're a saint, and you've been married, 13 they'll let you right in, because they'll find out." 14 That's what your view of the law is.    Okay.
04-1414 +++$+++     Where does it say that?    No, no.  I'm reading the warrant.  I'm not reading the affidavit.  It happens to say that the affidavit is -- that that affidavit is -- it's in appendix A, appendix B, but it doesn't say anything about going in on -- where does it say that?    It says -- mine says, you may command to search on or before April 27th for 10 days the person/place named and make the search in the daytime between 6:00 and 10:00.  That's what mine says.    Then there's an affidavit about probable cause.  That's true.  So --    What's not stated?    Where is there a limit?    It is?    What is it that tells us that?  I just happened to read an affidavit where the -- the person says that he won't enter until this package is there, but there are a lot of cause I would think --    Well -- well, he says in his affidavit he's not going to execute it until this package is delivered, but that -- if I read it in a common sense way, say, of course, he isn't going to because he wants to get everything at once.  But after all, he's in the place.  I would say there's a lot of probable cause for him to looking for 12 of these items which are there whether this package is there or not. Of course, he's not going to execute it till later.    Maybe that's the answer.
04-1477 +++$+++     So they find 13 people called Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock.  Now, what do they do?    His wife is living in the 10 11 12 13 14 house. She doesn't. She must not pay any taxes, and 15 she sees these letters coming from him registered and 16 says, oh, they're his problem. That's basically what 17 could have happened.    Were they divorced?    All right.  So he owns the    Wait.  Let -- that.  Fine.  Just have a little box and signs and says, tomorrow leave it at the like FedEx does. (Laughter.)    Is it a tiny minority --
04-1495 +++$+++     And that's what he's arguing    Suppose that the person is convicted.    Yes.  Can you bring your Bivens claim anyway?    Really?  So that's a -- but it's not a civil case.    So you say that if he's convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it may be because of the retaliatory motive.    Yes.    All right.  So you -- so you    -- if he's convicted, that's the end of it --    -- whether there was a retaliatory motive or not.    Oh, that's 1983.    All right.  So what he does    -- he brings his action and he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in fact, criticize everything that we say.    Because?    No, no.  He's saying I was -- I was guilty, but the -- all right.  Anyway --    I won't force you into that.    I'll take basically virtually never if he's convicted.  They concede that you could bring this kind of action if there's no probable cause.  So we're talking about that range where there was probable cause but acquittal.  That's what we're talking about here.    Now, you're -- you're in the 45 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 cases, but I'm -- I'm trying to pursue this. You've 2 given me another idea --    -- weed out the sheep from    -- in that area?    But that -- that's true.  I now think we're making some progress.  I don't think it is quite a qualified immunity.  I think it's possible 49 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and deny them if I am.  One, he's convicted, no case.  Two, no probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case. Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted. Okay?    In that circumstance, suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery.  You don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you show likely, question mark, that the investigator not only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions where any reasonable person would have known that what he was doing was contrary to the Constitution.    And if you don't show that as a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.    I'd like to ask you one other question.  Suppose you win on this on the grounds we've been discussing.  What happens in the middle of the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing? Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?    What happens when the same claim is made in the middle of a trial that I -- whether I'm guilty or innocent?  I haven't been convicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution wouldn't have been brought in the absence of the retaliatory motive.  Can he make that claim in the middle of enough to trial or not?    Well, no, he believes it.    No, no.  He's not acquitted.   He's in the middle of trial 61 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 and he wants to say --

And so, isn't the purpose of -- is there agreement that it only concerns point discharges, or does it concern water quality standards?    Really?    In other words -- discharge from a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedes you win?    It has to be just a standard.    Yes, I --

You a list --   I got -- what about the next were going to -- what I want to do is write down    -- of those things that are not telecommunications.    Well, the ability to engage or use my e-mail is an ability to access messages that other people, who don't work for you, have left for me.  Now, 21  1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    -- and it doesn't seem very different.    But, anyway, what's the third one?    Yes, indeed.    What it is, is a system where I pick up the phone, and what my phone does is -- let's say it had the ability to survey a number of possible people who wanted to talk to me.  Would that suddenly change it from a phone to a computer or an information system?    Because the other people are leaving the information; it's not the phone that's doing it.
04-278 +++$+++     Yes. What did they hold in the Tenth Circuit?  I mean, shall could be mandatory.

They should reask the certified question?
04-340 +++$+++ 
04-368 +++$+++     Okay.  IF that's "corrupt," that cover this case?    How?  Because it seems to me quite a lot of -- by the way, the person who's persuading has to know this.  They have to know 10 no legal right to withhold it. So it seems to me that, on 11 the one hand, that does cover your problem, and, on the 12 other hand, it does not cover this case. Now, that's what 13 I'd like you to reply to.
04-373 +++$+++ 
04-433 +++$+++     I mean, if that's so, then go back for a minute, please, to Justice Souter's question.  It doesn't concern violence.  I'm -- certainly if violence is involved or a direct action against an employee or the competitor himself, then I'll assume you'd win. But the line I think that he drew very clearly and I think Justice Stevens picked up on, as I heard it, is a -- a fraud where the person defrauded is 35 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- not the competitor and the only effect of the fraud is to lower the cost of the person who is doing the fraud. Now, if that's so, you either draw Justice Souter's line or you don't.  If you do draw Justice Souter's line, then you stay out of the thicket.  If you don't, you'll have all the problems that were mentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between one person, two persons, 100 people.  There is no way to know whether the lower cost of the defrauding person did or did not lead to the shift of sales.  There is no way to know, indeed, whether it's a rent, in which case prices didn't fall, or whether it's actually some kind of ability of the competitor -- of the defrauding person to take over the market. All those things that are issue in antitrust cases and totally unsolvable are suddenly imported into RICO, where if you really want to bring a case, bring an antitrust case, and at least people know how to face it there.  That's -- that's the -- that's the kind of claim -- that's the kind of problem that I think you're facing, and I'd like you to have the chance to respond to it.    So what does that mean? Then that means you have like the family vendetta 38 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- exception to the RICO -- (Laughter.)    But, I mean, you see the point.  The point is I don't see how it's administrable in a law, particularly in an economic context --    -- where people who are interested in making money are prepared to say, look, we want to make the money.  We'd like to get rid all our competitors, and then we start distinguishing between they'd like to get rid of all of them.  No, only five.  No, one.  And does that make a difference in whether you can bring a case or not?  I frankly don't see --    Where it would come from would be it would be an alternative way of getting to, say, Justice Souter's test, and it couldn't -- I agree with you -- depend upon whether these are within the realm of people who are relying.  But suppose you had a fraud where nobody had relied.  You see, it was really a failed fraud, and you can get that under Federal law.    Or suppose you have a fraud where the only party that had relied was the government, in which case you don't need them for civil RICO.  And the strong argument, I think, would be where that's the case, cut it off because of all the indirect problems that Holmes goes into.  I'm not -- I'm not accepting it.  I'm just trying -- 43 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-    -- to put it in what I think of as a strong form.    The place where it comes from is the idea that if, in fact, you have these monetary crimes, white collar kinds of crimes, money is at issue, and no one is hurt.  You can proceed against a person under Federal law --    -- where no one is hurt. You catch it in the bud, for example, where no one is hurt.  You don't want the possible class of plaintiffs to spread out into every competitor, into competitors' suppliers.  It's a way of cutting off the potential class to people who are closer to any possible injury 47 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 where, for example, there really wasn't any injury at all.  So, I mean, that's the kind of argument being made for it, not that you find the word reliance somewhere in the statute.    Well, I just tried to say where -- where it was.  It's a -- it's a way of -- with proximate cause, and that's how I think you have to deal with it.  You have a case where there was reliance.    The government.    So what you'd have to say is why that's good enough.

Well, I thought -- I mean, you know, we've had 90 briefs in this, and some briefs tear it apart, and others support it, but we also have briefs from the ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within this system.    The question I wanted to ask you is, given that concern, that there are, conceptually anyway, really excellent uses of this thing, does deliberate -- what is the word?    Yes.  Because what you are worried about, it seemed to me that the actual inducement would take care of.  And if you sent it back and said, "Let's have a trial on actual inducement."  If this really is the extreme case you're talking about, why wouldn't the Petitioners here be bound to win that trial?

04-603 +++$+++     Well, maybe this needs -- I mean, if were to clarify --    Sorry.
04-607 +++$+++     I didn't understand the definiteness doctrine.  I mean, all these things in 1854 I guess weren't so clear.  But I think the precise claim in 25 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 Samuel Morse's case was the use of the motive power of the 2 electric current for making or printing intelligible 3 characters. That sounds absolutely definite. Anyone can 4 understand it. 5 I thought the problem there was that although 6 anyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad 7 as that. You must intend to claim something narrower. And 8 insofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise. So insofar as 9 it's broad, it's too broad, but definite. And insofar as 10 it's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite. Okay? 11 Precisely the claim that they raised before the 12 Federal Circuit and precisely the claim -- with appropriate 13 citations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the 14 Federal Circuit said nothing.
04-623 +++$+++    No.    Suppose, on the commerce-clause I -- on assumption, I don't agree with you, then do I have to decide? [Laughter.]
04-631 +++$+++    Then that's the problem, right there, because I thought -- first, there is a tax -- you get a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody. So, I don't think it's quite -- if you just sit there with --   -- -- "sometimes."   So, they say -- get into interest balancing.    Now, what -- now you have the whole argument that I'm thinking of.  What do you respond?   Well, my question is, If we hold for you here, and we don't take an absolute principle, well, I guess States are forbidden to put any upstream taxes on.   Why isn't that so?    So, now you're telling me something different from what I understood.  I thought you said it probably has happened in the history of this tax --    -- that a distributor picked up a gallon of fuel, held it, and has not yet redistributed it.  So, you're saying that's never happened.    If I'm certain about what the tax is on, what should we do?  Dismiss the case or send it to the -- ask a question, or what?    Okay.  Now what he does, he says, "Call up and" -- he says, "Please deliver it."  Now he doesn't have to pay the tax?   Is the commerce constitutionally --   All right. Well --
04-637 +++$+++     All right.  Who is they?    I'm not interested in what defense counsel did or did not say.  I'm interested in what the Ohio courts did or did not say.    And my point there is my I repeat it or do you have it?    All right.  Let's go to the circuit court of appeals.  When I read the decision of the circuit court of appeals in the due -- what -- what am I reading, which is -- this is in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.    They went on both grounds, first the confession -- sorry -- the guilty plea, and second, the inconsistency.  Now, there I thought that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was -- now, I think I misspoke because I think that's where I see the problem.    You understand what the problem is or shall I --    The Sixth Circuit seemed to be addressing the inconsistency between the sentencing proceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial.  Well, you say the inconsistency we should focus upon is between the Wesley trial and the motion to vacate.  And I think you're right about that because I can't imagine the other being a problem.    It's relevant in terms of evidence, but I think you're asking us to say that there is a due process violation because of the inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to 44 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 vacate. Am I right? 2 3 4 the Sixth 5 question. 6 7 did it in 8 9 point to anything in which they have addressed that    All right.  I'm asking you if Circuit or the Ohio courts has addressed that    So I read this.  You can't 10 question. My quick reading of it -- I couldn't find 11 anything in which they addressed that question. And if 12 that's so, what should we do?

But we had, I thought, like, pages and pages of discovery rules and -- I've never heard, before, of a lawyer who has a -- you know, in this kind of situation, can't find out who owns a building there.  There are records, there are all kinds of things.    -- or did I misread it?    All right.  So --    -- what is the evidence?    Where is it in the appendix?  It said that he -- you sue person X, and I take it the reason that you won this case in the Fourth Circuit -- which was surprising to me -- was that a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident of Virginia, was a partner of the defendant.  Now, I 24 1 don't know what they were using here." Am I right - 2-  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 would like -- and, indeed, it was a partnership of 2 which he was a partner. So, if a Virginia resident 3 is a partner of the defendant, which is a 4 partnership, then maybe you were right. 5 So, I'm interested in: What is the 6 evidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the 7 defendant, which is a partnership?    But to get the real parties before the court, you have to sue them.    And, apparently, you didn't sue the right people until you replied to me. Then I took your argument, because it seemed like seven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument to be the following.  I'm -- I, the plaintiff, sued a defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property Company.  Now, I grant you, there is some evidence that that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas corporation.  One, they showed us the certificate of incorporation, or they got a sworn statement.  Two, 33  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 in my complaint, I said that's what he was. 2 However, there is some evidence the other 3 way. On page 179 and 181, we have a person named 4 Mr. Franzen who says, "I am the senior president, vice 5 president, partner for defendant Lincoln Property 6 Company," in which case, if that's your argument, 7 you're telling us -- is that your argument, that 8 there is some evidence the real defendant, whom I 9 sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent 10 evidence to the contrary?    No, I'd like the -- these are very expensive, this litigation.  You're all the way in the Supreme Court.  It's costing people a lot of money.  And if there is a legal issue here, I'd like to find out what it is. I have exactly the same question Justice Stevens had, which is where I started.  Do you agree that the company you sued, called Lincoln Property, is a Texas corporation, yes or no?    All right.    Then that's out -- fine, that's out of the case. 41  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 The next question is -- of course you could sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or Jolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that real company is a front, that it has no real existence, its -- all its papers and everything to do with it is signed by a totally separate corporation.  Are you saying that's what happened here?  And if that's what happened here, which is the real corporation and people in interest?    I'm not talking about burden-of-proof failure.    I'm asking you, Who is the real corporation or person in interest that Lincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?   Okay. Then you think -- 42  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005
04-721 +++$+++     I don't know how this came about.  I mean -- I mean, I'm asking both sides the same question.  It'll sound very favorable to you, but if you answer it just yes, because it's favorable to you, I might learn, later, I was wrong, and you won't have had a chance to answer.  So, I want your honest opinion on this.  I don't know how this happened.  And I don't know -- did you ask for en banc?   No. I don't know how the 5  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 California Court could have read the opinion -- which, 2 of course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading 3 things into it that weren't there -- but I don't know 4 how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come 5 to this conclusion. I thought that it said, you know, 6 on -- that there are three issues -- what's the word 7 "pending"? Does the word "pending" apply to the time 8 period between when the lower court decides a case and 9 you appeal? That's typically 20 days or 30 days.    This isn't just 20 or 30    So, is it timely? 6  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005    Now --    -- we now get a case where it's 3 years.    And the court says, "It's timely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'" But I thought -- I said, in the opinion, I thought the court adopted that the words "on the merits" do not decide the matter.    Now, what do you --    -- do in those circumstances?    No, but did --    -- you ask for rehearing en banc?  Because any judge, including me, can make a mistake.  What did you do?    Well, why, when you --    -- get a fair -- because any make a mistake --    -- why don't you just go and 9 10 ask the Ninth Circuit to say, "Look, this is not -- 11 read the opinion, read what they said. Correct it."    It's worse.    You're representing the attorney general of California, and you have a lot of litigation in the Ninth Circuit.  It's -- I mean, the other side's going to answer on the merits, if they can.  And they're in an awkward position here, I understand.  But I need to know what to -- what do you think we should do?  I mean, here, we write an opinion, 10  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 and they --    -- it seems to perhaps, inadvertently or not -- and the reason I turn to you is, judges are busy, they have huge dockets --    And, often, unless it's very clearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers take action, you get -- waste everybody's time and money.    So, in other words, he delays, after he gets the library access, for an extra year.    Now, is there any excuse they're making for that?  Because if you don't tell me, they're --    -- going to tell me.    Yes.    But you can't --    -- defer to something --    -- under this statute, where wrote the word "pending."  And I wouldn't    So, there are 25- -- so several thousand cases every year.    All right.  Thousands.    Okay.  So, I don't know what with California procedure when I pass a -- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 expressed clearly -- maybe -- "Courts, look, it says 'reasonable time.'  All right?  Now, reasonable time, in every other State is 30 days, sometimes 20 days."    "Sometimes the most, 60 days.  So, look and see if it was filed within a reasonable time.  That's all.  And if California passes -- some specific thing says something special about it, of course, pay attention to that."  What's wrong with that?  They just would do it like they do any other thing of deciding what happens in --    Yes, that is the problem.    But, now, maybe I'm --    So, the difficulty  of looking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I 35  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we 2 wrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here. 3 First, which was bothering me, had to do with our 4 Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be 5 simple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm 6 not sure about it. The other, which is much more 7 interesting, is what you're talking about. 8 All right, now, on the first one, I read the 9 words. It says the words "on the merits." The Ninth 10 Circuit thought those three words meant that the 11 California Supreme Court could not have considered the 12 petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the 13 merits, just as with the cite. Now, whether these 14 words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we 15 wrote. The next words were, "There are many plausible 16 answers to this question." Sometimes, a court 17 addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was 18 presented in an untimely way. Why? Because they don't 19 present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does, 20 or because it wants to give the reviewing court 21 alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just 22 wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim 23 on the merits. He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer. 24 He gets a postcard. That helps him. So, there are a 25 lot of reasons. And it says, "Conclusion." Given the 36  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 variety of reasons why they might have put the words 2 "on the merits," the fact that they are there, those 3 words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was 4 timely. So, then I read what they wrote. What they 5 wrote is, "When the California Court denies a habeas 6 petition without comment or citation, we have long 7 treated the denial as a decision on the merits." Okay? 8 And then it cites a pre-Carey case. "Therefore, the 9 summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was 10 not dismissed as untimely," citing two pre-Carey cases. 11 Now, I don't see how, since I just said the 12 words "on the merits do not end the issue" -- here, the 13 words weren't even there, but they say, "We're treating 14 it as if they were, and that ends the issue." So, what 15 do we do about that? 16 Then the next question, once I figure that 17 one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're 18 raising, which is quite important and interesting and 19 so forth?    You'd have to get some to go through these cases, and they could -- 19 professor 20 they could figure out how long it is. What do you 21 think it is, from your experience?    Because?    So, there's a special reason.  In your case, is there really a year that isn't explained at all?    Because?    No, forget that.  The library, I'll give you.  What's the rest?    But -- well, did your -- did your client file an affidavit or something saying he didn't have access to the library during the whole period of 3 years?    Well --    -- is there anything in the record that says, during the year after they said, "We'll change your job so you can get access to the library," that he didn't have access to the library?   Well, all right, so what's 42  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 his reason for saying that, "Last year, I was not able 2 to file a petition in California Supreme Court"?    About six months.    So, here we have 180 days -- 180 days, twice 90 -- with no excuse at all presented.    Well, 180 days from what?    Well, I mean, you file --    -- the reply brief in the lower court.  Maybe the judge will take 4 months to decide it.  What's the relation?  I don't understand that. Or maybe it'll take --    -- 2 days --    -- to decide.    Why?  What would the theory be?  I don't understand that.    So, a judge -- you file it. On day -- what -- you file it on April 1st, and then the judge decides it in August.  Or September.  And now it's only 3 days before the 6-months -- you have to file your appeal, like, in 3 days.  That wouldn't make 61  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 sense. And the converse would not --    You can't --    -- file an --    -- appeal before -- oh, can in California.  You're going to file the 10 maybe you 11 appeal before the lower court decides it?    They don't,    In other --    -- they don't, at all.
04-759 +++$+++     Well, anyway, if Louie helps something other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it? Because what the statute says is, it's a question of looking to the --   -- private person.    See, that's exactly what's concerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer. Suppose we do send it back because we think just what you said wasn't so is so, they have to now into this.  They'll have to go into it.  Should we suggest, "Look, you try harder to find a private analogy, because there's almost always a private analogy."  Every Government official has some similarities to private people, and some differences. So, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest, "No, actually, there are quite a few differences."  I don't have much of a feeling for which way to go on that. 39  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    No, that's not -- that's not what I've been asking.    And to expose everything I was -- perhaps the better thing is to say, "There's always a private analogy," or try very hard, because if you really found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe there would be no recovery, because the statute simply speaks about private party.    And this is a statute designed to give people recovery --    -- when people commit torts. 40  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Yes, it does, but that -- would we end up there, because of the way the statute's written?  You avoid the whole matter if you say, "Look for the closest private person, no matter what."  And maybe that's --
04-848 +++$+++     So, if --    I take it, on your theory, that that -- there is no lawsuit.    But are -- you got the -- well, that's exactly the point I'd like you to hone in on, because I don't see what's -- you say, "Well, we're defenseless."  Why are you more defenseless than any other business that leaves things on porches?  That might be, you know, 482 million apple deliverers or Domino Pizza 36  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 people. I don't know. Or they -- they ring the bell, 2 probably, but some -- MCDonald's hamburgers, lots of -- 3 department stores. I mean, a lot of people leave things 4 on porches. So, why are you more defenseless than they?    All right.  Well, that's --    -- that's what people are likely to trip over.  I mean, they're not likely to trip over a letter.
04-881 +++$+++     And then, indeed, the whole point of it -- it's entitled "Limited Offset Ability," parenthesis -- "Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only to Debts of Less than Ten Years)," end parenthesis.  That's the title of the Act, and then it says just what I say, repeating that.    But you're not going to treat    -- one the same.  You see, what they're saying here is -- they want to say that what I've just said is what Congress wrote in this Act.  And --    -- I'm making it harder and harder for you to accept that saying --    -- automatically.
04-885 +++$+++     I thought (b) and (c) -- tell if I'm right about this -- but suppose an individual bankruptcy, and sometime prior to the bankruptcy the individual got into an automobile accident and ran into a State building and wrecked it.  All right?  Now, I take it that, in a State that hasn't waived sovereign immunity, that individual, were he not bankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages caused by a claim that the wall was too high or something.  Each is claiming the other is negligent.  I guess the person wouldn't be able to file.  And the fact that he's bankrupt, he couldn't, either.    Okay.  Now, in (b), I guess it's saying that if the State happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought his negligent suit against him, he can respond.    So, if, in fact, you were to lose on (a), I guess the whole section would fall, because it wouldn't make any sense anymore, and we'd just wipe out the whole thing, (a), (b), and (c).    All right.  So, then the case really turns on the extent to which the Government can -- sorry, the extent to which Congress can waive sovereign immunity, as 33  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution permits them to do what they did in (a).    And if you win on that, you win. And if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably fall.    I'm not sure, because if you lose on the whole thing -- suppose you were to say Congress doesn't have the power to do anything there.  I just wonder if (b) and (c) would survive, because they may have had something else in mind.  But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.    A light bulb went out.    And you have some of those.    Are you trying to get those in this   Oh, okay.

That's not enough to prove an injury to competition? clearly --    What's the authority for that?    That's a different matter. That's a -- what -- I'm saying, What authority is there -- have there been cases in which that was not viewed?  After all, let's suppose the dealers are located geographically in about place, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same customers.  They overlap.

How is anybody going to administer the standard that you are asking the Court to enunciate?    No problem.    How do you know that isn't Your Honor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   was -- you see, they have the same allegations.  I don't a disguise when they say --    Ah, ah.

05-1240 +++$+++     But that's the problem.  I  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's 2   being argued in my court that the policemen did 3   something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct, 4   that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the 5   correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that 6   the conviction if there is a conviction in the state 7   court later, will necessarily be vitiated.  If the 8 9 10 11   correct. 12 13   correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, 14   whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, 15   which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it 16   won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal 17   tolling rules. 18               I don't see any way to get to a sensible 19   result here without either having clear abstention 20   rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I 21   suggested before.  Am I right?  If I'm wrong, let me 22   know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?    All right.  If that's  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reason that this court has always respected the tolling 2   rules that states have whereas accrual is a Federal 3   question. 4               But with that slight caveat, I do believe 5   that those are the two main options.  But I don't 6   believe the Court should be indifferent as between them. 7   There are very serious practical reasons weighing down 8   on our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and 9   filing not immediately, of course -- the case need only 10   be filed within the period of the statute of 11   limitations. 12               Thereafter it might well be that some cases, 13   maybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a 14   stay of some sort while the Federal -- excuse me -- 15   while the criminal case is ongoing. 16               But that question, figuring out whether a 17   stay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a 18   ongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out 19   than whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether 20   it's critical evidence, whether there was other 21 evidence.    If you delay accrual by tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some instances the policemen won't know for quite a while  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   should be preserving your records, and you are not in 2   repose. 3               This Court has respected those as very 4   important interests.  They are absolutely not served by 5   a rule of delayed accrual.  At the same time, the rule 6   to allow a stay where necessary - as I indicated, it's 7   not going to be all of the cases, and it's far easier to 8   figure it out.  The Federal district court figures it 9   out by having the defendant, the criminal defendant, who 10   is a plaintiff in his court, come in and is asked a 11   question:  Are you currently -- 12 13 14 15   state court.  I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not 16   like they're looking for cases.  They're going to say in 17   most cases:  Stay granted, come back when this is over. 18   They don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation 19   with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter
05-1256 +++$+++     Now I think we all agree 11   that that's an appropriate thing to say.  And as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?    The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors 9   products liability.  And it's pretty hard to think of a 10   products liability case where the jury found negligence, 11   where they might not also find these factors.  Because 12   in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the 13   company.  Somebody will have been hurt and likely 14   seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim 15   in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often 16   is, at least in this instance.  And now you read these 17   five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, 18   well, you read the jury factors like that and they can 19   do almost anything.  And it's that, it's that fact that 20   anything goes that I found disturbing.

Am I right in thinking that it is conflict the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply 16 17 18 19   important point.  And our position is there are actually 20   several ways in which you could analyze this case and 21   arrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's 22   regulations are valid.  One is looking simply at 23   statutory language and saying we would, we the Court 24   would reach this result as we did in the Franklin 25   National Bank case even without any regulation.  And 31 preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the case of a national bank?    Conflict preemption basically strikes down a State law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.    All right.  Now, with that in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 precisely the same result?    Would you or not?

But of course, memory is 2   fallible, including mine.  Therefore, I raise the 3   question. 4    No, no.  I'm not talking about that because I guess that would be trying to 12   be quite a good thing, and that's years ago.  In all 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   cases this Court has ever held.  In every single case 21   involving an embargo or a local processing requirement 22   or a local needs requirement, if you just substitute "in 23   public ownership" you'd have the exact same case --    Yeah, I think it would. The same logic would apply.    Nationalized industries? 10 11 12 13   even have to get into the theory.  What happens in a lot 14   of municipalities of course is that they decide, well, 15   we're going to run the waste treatment facility and 16   we're going to tax the people in the municipality to 17   support it and the service is going to be free.  Now, is    Well, it's about --    Well, is there something 21 22 23 24   being protected was this plan.  The town had to fund its 25   transfer station, a transfer station that it was going perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of protection, only one individual was protected.    Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable -- recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less. And that's why they want to do it, and of 10   the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, 11   it just won't work.  It is rather like electricity, 12   interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the 13   same thing.  They want discriminatory rates in order to 14   push out the possibility of poorer people getting 15   electricity.  This they want to do the same thing but 16   they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage 17   recycling. 18    Like it --    I actually point out that California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize - Subject to Final Review that's not the argument you make.

We filed our proof of 2   claim, then PG&E objected to our proof of claim, but 3   Justice Ginsburg, PG&E did a lot more than just object 4   to our contingent reimbursement rights.  They 5   mischaracterized our subrogation rights as claims; they 6   sought to disallow our subrogation claims; and they 7   sought to subordinate our claims.  Plus in addition, 8   they sought to disallow the claims of the injured 9   workers. 10               So we had to respond to the litigation that 11   was commenced.  We had to defend our rights, and we were 12   successful.  The workers' claims were ultimately left 13   unimpaired in the bankruptcy as they should have been. 14   PG&E was fully responsible for paying the workers' 15   claims. 16 17 18 19 20 21   of Federal common law.  It's not justified by any    My question is, I have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that 19 - Subject to Final Review 1   forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a 2   case where parties argue reasonably about whether the 3   contract itself covers this kind of fee.  And maybe it 4   doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera. 5               But let's take a very straightforward case. 6   It's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a 7   mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it 8   says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection.  It 9 10 11 12 13 15   read Collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in 16   such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of 17   an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' 18 fees.    And there must be other 14   instances in which there wasn't any security.  And if I  ￼9 10 11 all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets. Explain it. 24 25    And, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not -- there is no article that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal.    Well, how do you avoid -- what about their statement from Collier?    Because? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   me?    Then you explain that to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   context.    It is a contingent claim. And you're saying this is the same.    Yes, but I mean you don't  ￼3 4 5 6   one had.  Which one in particular? 7 8 9    How -- can we decide?  But I'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong, 17   wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at 18   all, you'll be delighted.  And if we say the reason it's 19   wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees 20   regardless, they'll be delighted.  And our only other 21 22 23 24 25   complication.  There's another case on which the Ninth alternative is to not say why it's wrong or -- I mean, that's the problem.    Oh, in other words what he implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?

And so it says either estimate or 23   liquidate, but always as of the date of the filing of 24   the petition.  Now as of the date of the filing of the 25   petition it would be impossible to estimate without a 47 supposed to either liquidate them or estimate them.

And 20   if that's going to have any effect aside from an income 21   effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread 22   line or go to other places where they have other jobs at 23   lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the might do that if they drove out all the buying competitors, and now what are they going to try to do? What they will try to do if they get that terrible monopoly, which would be bad --    Right.  Drive prices way 24   woods business and selling at a reasonable price.

And if you can 5   tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an 6   instruction something like, look to see whether they can 7   sell them reasonably at a profit.  Or, look to see even 8   if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could 9   recoup whatever they are losing later.

05-593 +++$+++     All right.  Good, I'm glad that someone did. [Laughter.]    The basic point I think in  ￼ 1   practicality of it.  I don't think you can give me a 2   case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge 3   to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government, 4   to tell me if anything went on here that might have been 5   within the scope of employment.  And I look at what 6   you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't 7   defend it.  If you say yes, you can defend it and that's 8 9 10 13   white and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor 14   poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses, 15   the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence 16   that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee 17   was acting within the scope or not. 18               If I could use a simple example of assault. 19   If the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee 20   for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the 21   supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her 22   fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her. 23   Even if that would be outside the scope of employment, 24   the employee might say -- the supervisor rather might 25   say, I never raised my hand at all.  I raised my voice 29 going to be the end of it as long as your view is based on a reasonable reading of the record.    And as long as a jury could find that there is a view of the record such that the plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it. What's the problem?    The only problem is if you admit that you can't prove anything like that.    No, not a fortiori, for the reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the defendant the right to call in the Government to defend  ￼ 1   take away that limited determination in Westfall.  That 2   was the only point.  Congress could have written a 3   statute the way.  What's your response to that?
05-595 +++$+++ 
05-608 +++$+++     All right.  If we were to reach the question, which is very interesting, "What is the Government's position as to which of those three positions is the right position?" -- were we to reach it -- I agree with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is -- if it were, what would be your view? have anything to do with the question before us, which is whether it is a case or controversy? 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   -- you would have to consider each case on its terms.  And 24   it's not clear, from this Court's cases, where the    Let's suppose --    Well --    Will you assume Justice 37 - Subject to Final Review 1   issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a 2   case or controversy?    The hypothetical is --    -- that they write into the contract -- the party who's the licensee says, "And we stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is 16   invalid."  Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for 17   business reasons.  Therefore, the licensee and the 18   licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and 19   he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he 20   can go into court and challenge the patent."  So, we 21 22 23 24   state of the law.  The state of the law is that there is 25   no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a 38 assume that's written into the contract.    And now, let us also assume a  ￼1   condition in a contract.  All right? 8 9 10 11 12    But he says, by the way, "If I win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses"    No.  Now, that's --    I'm not asking --    It is --    -- it is, under other fields of  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it.  I'm just 7   wondering if there is an additional reason that there has 8   to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the 9   absence of the declaratory judgment action.  It's that and I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.    Yes.

So I take it their argument was, maybe with hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language,  ￼1   now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have 2   accepted it.  And all the rest of what he's saying is 3   just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something 4   like that.  But what about that one? 5 6 7 8 9    Well, I mean, should we answer the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a 15 16 17 18   were wrong.  What's your view of that?    Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon all that, that's just a series of different arguments that we'd like the Court to say.    If you read it carefully, you'll see it, basically. (Laughter.)
05-785 +++$+++     In this case.    This reason -- suppose, hypothetically, I would think -- well, the rule should be  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was 2   cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta. 3          All right.  You write for me the words I'm 4   supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.
05-848 +++$+++     Can I ask you about an  ￼ 1   argument.  On page 26 of your brief, I think it's 2   explained well.  You set out the regs and the reg says 3   that a major modification is "any physical change in the 4   method of operation that would lead to a significant net 5   emissions increase."  Then you have little (iii), which 6   is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which 7   leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of 8   operation or the production rate. 9               So that's out of it.  Now, the question is 10   what's in it?  If that's out of it, what's in it?  I 11   think what they've said is, if you think about that, 12   we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical 13   change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but 14   just means you can run it more hours.  And they say their 15   proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation 16   for years and years and years.  Indeed, we did what we 17   did thinking that was it. 18               And then after we did what we did, they 19   pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't 20   it; now it means any physical change, like you change a 21   nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased 22   capacity to emit more.  It's just you run it more hours. 23               Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's 24   not what this reg has been about.  And they made that 25   argument, according to them, very strongly and the 23  ￼ 1   Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all 2   around and made some propositions of law that it's hard 3   for even them to defend. 4               All right.  Now, that's what I think, that's 5   what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the 6   heart of it.  And if it is, what do you say?    No, we didn't address it. 24               That's what I'm using it as a basis for 25   thinking that they were not saying to have a change, the 29  ￼ 1   word "change" includes only a change in physical 2   facilities that increases the amount of emission per 3   hour.  Am I right?  Or --    Because?    They say because the Fourth Circuit didn't go really on that, it went on some statutory thing, and -- 10 11 12   opinion.  That's not the judgment.  The judgment of the 13   court of appeals is that this enforcement--    The obvious reason to do it is, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say,  ￼ 1   plant.  And what somebody works out, which is normal, is 2   demand for electricity is increasing.  And so what we 3   will do is we're going to take these turbines and 4   system, and we're going to change it really radically. 5   It doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now 6   we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 7   12 hours a day.  So there's going to be twice as much 8   pollution in the air.  Now the whole idea of the PSD 9   system is you don't have twice as much pollution in the 10   air, and I guess that's why they wanted to do it.    No.  I was just thinking, then you're left with what you called the weak argument, arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see how you make the stronger one, what you think is stronger, since you made it before, or a version of it before the D.C. Circuit.    No.  As being outside the statute at that time, and you did.    That's what it is.
05-908 +++$+++     While you're talking about 24 - Subject to Final Review 1   has to be 25, it has to be 45.  I would actually suggest 2   that the danger is in the opposite direction.

Why practically? 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was is this basically a kind of last report?  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Now you stop this.

Even though it's going to 18 19 20   bilk people out of millions of dollars?    I would have thought the answer was no, but there we are.    Is it true or not what I said, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you had a dishonest debtor, the present -- the proceeding is 10 11 12 13   dismissed on 7.  He gets the papers back.  The papers 14   permit him access to a hidden source of resources, and 15   he steals them basically.  Is that possible or is that 16   fanciful?  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
05-998 +++$+++     Yes, I assume we know that.  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   to my question, yes or no?  I'm saying after the -- 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    That's right.  So the answer is no?    And if you can't raise that, which is a major area because there's a harmless error is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same true here where the error is far more likely to be simply technical and make no difference given the adequacy of the evidence?    It does as well in my case.    Yes.  Zero.    Yes, but what is the answer  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   error?  Let's take a case where somebody is charged with 8   possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  And 9   before the grand jury, we look at the transcript, we see 10   that the prosecutor introduced evidence of five 11   judgments of convictions for felony offenses.  And the 12   jury is properly charged that they have to find that 13   this individual was a convicted felon.  And there's 14   simply -- and then when the case is tried at, when the 15   case is tried the defense even stipulates that the 16   person is a convicted felon. 17               But there's a clerical mistake in preparing 18   the indictment.  And it doesn't recite the fact that the 19   defendant was previously convicted of a felony.  It's 20   your position that there must be a reversal there?    Can't you ask for a bill of    Well, then you would have had no problem.    No, I'm not denying that. I just didn't think that had anything to do with this 19 20 21 22   requirement, which seems a little vague.  It's been hard 23   for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one 24   you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule 25   you have to have facts. 37 indictment initially was to set forth what crime the person was accused of and inform him of that. You are saying, and then there is another  ￼12 13 14 15 16 17 18   talking about.  And I would point out as of today the 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Government has still not identified a single act that is their overt act.    I couldn't find any case in 10   case that went the other way, a general statement.  They 11   said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have 12   to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et 13 cetera. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   notice.  But that's a different argument than the fact 24   that there was no indictment.  Notice can be cured by a 25   bill of particulars, by the fact that you've had a    Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or isn't followed a lot.    No.  All right.  So I thought normally essential facts means simply the facts -- you can state the essential facts by writing 14   the statute and normally that tells you.  Now, is that 15   true?  One case that seems to go the other way is 16   Russell. 17    Normally, yes.    Why more than any other  ￼ 1 means.

06-10119 +++$+++     Yes.  If you look at the 20 21 22   top of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I 23   think, is that the prosecutor is posing a general 24   question.  And then he poses his question -- or she -- 25   and goes around and gets an answer.  Here is Mr. Lindey. 32  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   So they start out with the death penalty.  They have 2   some ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366.  Then the 3   prosecutor says, "Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said 4   you could not impose the death penalty."  "Mrs. Goff -- 5   Ms. Goff:  I could consider the death penalty."  "Ms. 6   DuPont:  I couldn't hear."  Prosecutor:  You could 7   consider both?"  "Yes, I would consider it."  "Ms. 8   DuBois:  I could consider it.  Yes."  "Ms. Archonie:  I 9   could consider it."  "Mrs. Alvino:  I could consider 10   it."  "Ms. Scott:  I could.  I could." 11               Now, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me 12   -- to me.  It seems that what they're talking about, 13   each of them, is the death penalty because that's what, 14   by the time they got to the top of 367, they were 15   talking about.  Maybe there's ambiguity there. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   penalty.  But, by the time you get back to Ms. Scott --    But I haven't noticed in anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you just made.    And a slight hesitation. Now, what do you say to that?

That's Virginia. 4               So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the 5   evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make, 6   for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a 7   person who's driving without a license will keep driving 8   once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas 9   Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such 10   a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?    Can we go back for a 11   second?  Because, the reason I asked my question is I  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving. 2   So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what 3   we had in Whren. 4               Now I want you to say -- I want your 5   comments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement, 6   because I want to get your reaction to that point of 7   view.  I'm not saying I hold it.  But I'm putting it 8   forward so that I can get your reaction and argument.    Putting cases aside for the    I mean if we reach this If you -- all right.  If you have lost on the first question, this is not an unreasonable search -- arrest, rather, under the Fourth Amendment. 8 9 10 11 13   -- and so now we're talking about minor things under 14   State law that is secondary at the least. 15               And there, when the policeman make a mistake 16   about that, the reason we let him search is he might be 17   hurt, the policeman.  There's danger involved. 18               And so I don't see why at the moment that 19   rationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason 20   for it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is 21   a violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he, 22   you know, thought the guy was going to keep driving 23   under the suspended license or, you know, might be risky 24   or might not show up.

06-116 +++$+++     Because?    No.  It doesn't secure it one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take - Subject to Final Review 10   it into account when you set your taxes.  Just as is 11   true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind. 12   Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its 13   statute, but so could it change its statute in respect 14   to a school, a university, or whatever the other things 15   are that are off those tax rolls.  You know that, you 16   know, your answer was circular.  That assumes that the 17   whole property is, but it isn't.    Which one?  You say they've all used market values?

You say go, good-bye, and we'll give you some good deals here if you'll really go, but you pursue your appeals.    Cannot.  Okay.  But you can    You can't go anywhere.    So you lose all your appeals, not just your motion-to-reopen appeals if you leave the country?    And if we decide against you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in every case is after there is a final order, the alien will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a few extra days.    Have I got it right, what your point is? 12 13 14 15 16 17   might be a year; it might be a year and a half.  New 18   developments or changed circumstances are far more 19   likely to have happened during that period of time than 20   they would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure 21   that -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of 22   the appeal. 23               So an alien in this position who has been 24   granted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to 25   reopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to 42    Well, if they don't provide for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it  ￼5 6 7 8   adjustment. 9 - Subject to Final Review 1   you to get out of here in respect to this 60 days, so 2   you have to give up that.  You're not getting those 3   benefits.  Now, it's a tough bargain, but it seems 4   reasonable.

And, therefore, I thought this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that trial court judge unless that trial court judge is making an absolute rule, which he may have been. 10 11 12 13 14 15   that.    Now, you tell me if the 10   rules are different in the Tenth Circuit?  Do they out 11 12 13 14 15   normally, why should they here?  If this kind of rule is 16   -- as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other 17   evidence, any other evidence at all.  It may be 18   relevant, or it may not be.  It depends on the case.

The new information was not 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 brought up by either side --    The --the part I'm trying 6   with a claim.  All right.  Manufacturer:  That's 7   pre-empted.  The claim is that you should have told the 8   FDA and added something to your label. 9   Manufacturer:  That's preempted.  Plaintiff:  Well, you 10   haven't read this reg here.  The reg here which has been 11   in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add 12   something.  I mean you can go and add something to show 13   a contra indication, and that's the end of it. 14               Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess, 15   without the horrible things happening that Justice 16   Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know. 17   But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new 18   information.  I take it that's in 1982.  That's the 19   first time that happened. 20               Now, if I'm right about that, what happens 21   when no one says a word about that?  Of course, if the 22   manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe 23   the plaintiff would have said:  And it was new.  It was 24   new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word.  Are you 25   following what I'm saying? 49  ￼about that. - Subject to Final Review    So what I'm trying to figure out -- and I don't know if "burden of proof" is the right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on 2   them. 3               And so in the case where there is silence, I 4   would respectfully submit the manufacturer is not 5   complying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there 6   is current information about all of the side- effect 7   risks of its drugs. 8 Thank you.

And there the investment 19   advisors are likely to be special.  So you can't say 20   investment advice is always special or never special. 21               Now, again, this seems to me not unknown, 22   this kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and 23   therefore there tend to be methods of allowing 24   exceptions, of putting burdens.

And that 2   there wouldn't be Article III standing for that 3   particular individual, not the taxpayer --    That's what I was saying. I said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a rule; and the rule is what I suggested.    Based on money.    So you're saying that what Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested at least what Justice Stewart said?    Is that right or not?    No.  I never met anyone who did, but I guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody 22   might think that, I guess.

And it's 6   interesting that the way in which the question is 7   presented in their brief and in their question presented 8   in the petition for certiorari is not in terms of the 9   ACCA statutory language.  It does not ask:  What is the 10   penalty prescribed by law for this offense?  It asks: 11   Could repeat offenders be subjected to an enhanced 12   penalty of ten years?

Now 3   those three sets of things require a balance.  And we 4   have a hundred years of history where this Court and 5   Congress and others have balanced those three sets of 6   considerations, and they've come out one way.  Now, the 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way. There are good arguments on both sides.  Why should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things?

Price fixing, horizontal, I guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too. 10 11 12 13   our experience and in the experience of the courts.

Because using your do 2   you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine 3   cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the 4   weak inference and not the strong inference.  And what 5 6 7 8 9 I'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this Seventh Amendment problem.    Because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   curious way, you have blinders on.  You look at the 17   complaint.  You read it in the light favorable to the 18   pleader.  You do not weigh.  That is a jury function. 19   You do not look for exculpatory explanations.    What do you think about the 5 6 7 8   some other words.  So therefore, take strong inference. 9   The most helpful thing is take it, look at the I see -- I think words, words, words. And what Congress said was strong inference, and we're not going to get any further by looking for 10   complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong 11   inference.  Or maybe we'd say it isn't.  We read it, and 12   avoid all the other issues.  What do you think about 13   that? 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

And their 10   point of view, one of their points of view was that the 11   state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a 12   skimpy swimming suit.  No.  Well, you can have the 13   demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're 14   going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want 15   to see you don't have to see you.  And there your client 16   said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth.  At least 17   we didn't in the past.  And then looking at that I 18   thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a 19   preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to 20   call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up 21   the cloth.  It was pretty clear the State would, and it 22   should have been pretty clear that they were going to 23   ignore it, which they did. 24               And why is this any different than having 25   won an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but 43 the attorney's fees?    No, I would be surprised.    The other thing that I wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party?

And he says 4   the real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to 5   sue them because they're the ones who dumped this and 6   they've cost me $9 million.  And it turns out that Union 7   through precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has 8   settled this very matter for one dollar with EPA. 9 Barred? 10 11 12 13   and that's what he's saying.  That's what he's saying, 14   that's why he has brought his second acorn, because he 15   said there's a huge difference here.  What you will do 16   is if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court 17   as to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle 18   with the Federal Government you're home free.

So if we're being literal and if you 12   win this case, I don't see how -- and I'm worried about 13   this, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably 14   very common, that all over the country it's the family, 15   the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, 16   maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who 17   is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so 18   they don't have to be brought to an institution. 19               And if you win this case, it seems to me 20   suddenly there will be millions of people who will be 21   unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who 22   will move to institutions.  Now, if I were to say that 23   that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a 24   legal point because it's a question of what people 25   intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the 27  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   truth.

And the only thing I left 19   out before was, if you're prepared to say the 20   Constitution the Constitution requires us to let 21   corporations and unions buy these kinds of ads, well, 22   how could it be constitutional to have a statute that 23   forbids them to contribute directly to the candidate, 24   something that's been in existence only since I guess 25   1904?

Then we have the question of 14   the authority -- of the inherent authority, not 15   statutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits 16   of cases and decide them in different ways. 17               I don't know the answer to those questions, 18   but I think they are quite important.  So what do I do?

So long as it 25   was not binding on the Federal court, because you can't there anything wrong in this case if they had come in with an agreed statement of fact?    All right.  I'm trying to get to my question; I'm not asking it very well. What they agreed to is an agreed statement of facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and    What I'm driving at, whether I've asked it well or not --    -- is is how is it any different from coming in with an agreed statement of  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   State arbitration laws -- it's a different animal.

We were -- we were 7   litigating under this agreement also in the district 8   court, and we brought a question of fact to the district 9   court.  When the district court first sent this back to 10   the arbitrator, it went through and basically told the 11   arbitrator:  You know, you haven't looked at these 12   facts; you haven't looked at these fact; you haven't 13   looked at these facts.  I believe it's Pet. App. 57a. 14   And it sent it back to show the arbitrator's work.  I 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   arbitration?

07-10374 +++$+++     But what is the neutral reason related to the administration of courts that leads the State to close its door to a damage suit under 1983 against correctional officers?    -- taking as the assumption 10   exactly what Justice Ginsburg said.  I mean, I can't  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   such a situation.  So I would think that the way we 10   would apply it is take the standard and ask the State, 11   what is the neutral administrative-related reason? 12   Because what they are saying is, if you look at this, 13   from an administrative point of view, it's that 14   red-haired, one-eyed man with a limp.    This is not that case. This is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't allow -- damage actions like the Federal action --    -- and this Court has not decided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   but not exclusively prisoner complaints, that arise out 2 of prisons. 3               That is a very large and burdensome amount 4   of litigation, unlike litigation against State police, 5   which some have said is comparable, which is dispersed 6   all over the State.  This is concentrated where the 7   large prisons are; and it is a reasonable decision -- a 8   neutral reason, if you will -- for the State to decide 9   to take those actions out of the courts of general 10   jurisdiction, to take actions -- damage actions arising 11   out of the prisons out of the courts of general 12   jurisdiction, where it would be concentrated in a few 13   counties where the large prisons are.    You don't offer them a court of claims, because what you offer in the court of  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   courts?  I don't know what the numbers are?  Have you 2   looked them up at all?    -- 1983 actions, but maybe they bring them mostly in Federal court.    Okay.  So one way to test 10 11   this out would be the following:  If we had numbers and 12   knew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage 13   actions against prisoners were being brought in State 14   courts in districts that have prisons there, and then we 15   saw how much New York was really hurting and then we 16   asked another question, maybe there is some Federal 17   security actions, you see, where there is no State 18   comparable action and we found out, well, the State lets 19   them bring these actions in State court.  So, there are 20   ways of dealing with this empirically.  Have you any 21   sense of it?

Now, there are a lot  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 evidence, adverse evidence obtained after 30 hours, violated the admission, violated some totally different rule of evidence, as your opinion does (a) mean, judge, it doesn't matter if it's triple hearsay or it doesn't matter if it violates some authentication requirement, it doesn't matter if it violates, you know, it has to be relevant, pertinent, not a waste of time -- it doesn't matter; admit it?    No, of course it doesn't 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   point, Justice Breyer.  The other rules that might 19   permit exclusion of a voluntary confession in the Rules 20   of Evidence are explicit, or they are there because the 21   courts interpreted that rule to require it.  That's not 22   what happened in MCNabb-Mallory, and I don't think 23 that --    So if it doesn't mean that, then why does it mean that we should ignore this other rule of evidence contained in Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?    No, of course not.    And I think you are right. I think we agree on that. So, if the defendant said, if you look under the rock you will find the writing such-and-such, it might not be authenticated for that particular writing. 14   There are many reasons.  It might be triple hearsay, 15   what he says.  I mean, you know, there are a variety of 16   things, aren't there?  Maybe I am wrong.    The reason I brought that  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   it having anything to do with Miranda, without it having 2   anything to do with coerced confession. 3               And similarly, there are many reasons for 4   bringing him forward that have nothing to do with 5   either.

Now that's the -- the question I want responded to in the legal context of, has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?    And what is the answer to 43  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that?    Yes.  But, remember, they 10 11 12   are saying in the tolling cases, in my words:  Hey, we could have gone after the processor if we wanted --    -- if there had been a substantial transformation, because the key to this concept of "sale" is the word "substantial" 13 14 15 16 17 18   transformation. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    In which --    No.  Okay.

That's their evidence. 8               On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them 9   to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the 10   defendant told them about his drug use.  At which point 11   the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the 12   arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you 13   arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on 14 drugs?

Or maybe he said that the courts had decided 10   it because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent 11   positions, first saying that the trial courts decided 12   it, and they did decide it, but by accident.  They 13   thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it 14   referred to an earlier claim. 15               So first they tell the courts -- and you 16   wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar 17   because there were a lot of words written.  They tell 18   the courts:  It's been decided, judge.  Don't worry. 19   They decided it:  Adequate State ground.  And next they 20   wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then 21   they announce:  Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that 22   there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says 23   that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for 24   not knowing of it in the first place.  And he didn't 25   know of it until 1993. 40  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               So I see the State taking opposite 2   positions, and -- and what seems from the briefs 3   inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused.  What 4 5 6 7   if I could just say one thing about the Brady.  We don't 8   dispute that the material in question is relevant to the 9   defense and is relevant to the sentence. is it that happened in this case?    Yes.    Okay.  So there the cases in this Court would say if a State appeals court writes - Subject to Final Review So let's go back and see what the State district court held, and I think that the State district court held that it had been decided, not that it had 10 11   you don't know whether it was decided:  For example, 12   they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided, 13   then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is 14   look to the lower court to see what they actually did. 15               So we follow that rule, and we get to 16   exactly what justice Alito said:  That what they did was a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   I've been getting the runaround.  First, they tell me 25   it's one thing; then they tell me another.  All I can 44 they were holding that this has already been decided.    Don't you think at this point the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs:  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   tell you is this:  No one has ever passed on the merits 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   runaround.  The Petitioner has always throughout this 9   litigation proceeded on the premise that the CCA -- the 10   Court of Criminal Appeals's decision in Tennessee was 11   based on a waiver.  All of his briefs in the lower court 12   and in the -- the sixth circuit reflect that. 13               The District Court proceeded as if that 14   ruling was a waiver.  The sixth circuit in its 2001 15   decision, if you look at page 62-A and 62 -- 63-A at the 16   bottom, the -- the sixth circuit specifically said the 17   Tennessee waiver rule is plainly applicable to the Brady 18   claim.  And the Tennessee courts explicitly relied on 19   the waiver rule. 20               It wasn't until the 2007 opinion that the -- 21   the sixth circuit even discussed this notion of previous 22   determination, and only then in response to what I think 23   was a red herring injected by the dissenting opinion 24   that somehow the -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's 25   decision stood for something different than what the 45 of this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.    So you choose the procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.    Could the explanation of this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the State first argued that it had already been decided; then in later courts the State changed its theory and announced that it had been waived?    Isn't that why they're writing about waiver? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   Court of Criminal Appeals relied on a waiver.  In the -- 17   in the brief to the Sixth Circuit --

Well, to put my chips on the table, which you probably understand, I thought the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion. do?

If 15   you stop a car for a traffic stop, you can search it for 16   all kinds of things.  You can do all kinds of things not 17   related.  So if that's what they're relying on, I    All right.  I would say suspect that that's not right, that it had to do with a different subject matter.    Say I was lawfully stopped. 18 19 20 21 22   All right.  Go ahead.  I want to get all of them in 23 24 25 front of me.    The question is, how did she do that?

So now we have  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Okay.  You're stopped in an urban area.  The policeman 2   says you are stopped, and you are stopped lawfully. 3   Will you get out of the car?  Yes.

We certainly 6 didn't take this case to decide whether the passenger 7 was free to leave or not. That -- that was not the 8 issue on which we took the case. And you claim that 9   that issue has already been resolved by findings of the 10   lower courts?    What are the facts?  That is, this happened quite close to the beginning of the -- of the stop, didn't it?    We don't know.  I -- I read    We don't?    Yes.    Well, is there any reason to think it was half an hour?

07-1125 +++$+++     That's simple.    All right.  But you could    Okay.    So your point then is -- 38  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   and that's why I have had trouble with this case -- is 2   that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort 3   of seems to say, "if there is a difference, of course 4   you can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference, 5   you can't."  I mean, everybody here seems to agree to 6   that, I guess. 7               So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya 8   started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where 9   Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the 10   funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he 11   doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between 12   suing an institution and suing an individual.  So maybe 13   what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't 14 say it.    So you were saying if it's an individual acting in his official capacity, you cannot sue him under Title IX?    Yes.  Okay.    Then their answer to that 10 11 12 13 14   1983 suit.  And then you reply, but there are bars here 15   of collateral estoppel.

If she went to the 20   doctor, maybe she would have found something out. true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me that that's wrong, and here was something, okay? On the other hand, we have your case.  Your 21               Again, I have no doubt, there is harmful 22   error.  So this case is a theoretical law professor's 23   case that is never going to come up, because there is 24   never any doubt.  Either the VA did walk him through it 25   and it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up 29  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   it makes sense to tell the government:  Government, you 7   have to come up with every possible conceivable factual 8   scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came 9   in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.    It certainly does because 22 23 24 25   this is not doctors trying to receive benefits.  This is those who currently receive disabilities receive benefits for PTSD.

So what I can't figure out is how to deal with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in any real situation.    I know all this and why 16   we have in our case a first element notice error.  The 17   question where the veteran does not even know what 18   evidence he needs to put forward, in that case it makes 19   sense because of the high likelihood of prejudice to 20   have a general rule that the burden should be on the 21   government and not on the veteran.

I mean, if this is the ruling in the 25   State --    Okay.    Sorenson was the agent and the principal, the broker who was selling some land.    And I think in that case they also said, "By the way, you've got basically the instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked" -- no, that was the case where they said, "You overlooked in your instruction an important allegation of fact," which allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a 10 11   broker. 12 13 14 15 16   been instructed upon.  That's why there didn't have to 17   be the offer of an instruction.

So anyhow that's the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   are two answers; I was being facetious as to why we 2   didn't push this argument the last time.  It was largely 3   because the Federal Circuit concluded the last time 4   based on IMLA alone that there was in fact a sufficient 5   right-creating provision.  And therefore we depended --    Well the regs you didn't - Subject to Final Review 1   here in that respect?  What we seem to have is two later 2   provisions that say the government shall have no 3   liability when it enters into leases.  I mean, maybe 4   that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly 5   escaping it.  And then I guess there is some regs that 6   were promulgated after the lease was entered into and 7   seem on their face to deal with other matters.  Okay, 12   emphasize, so forget them.  If you don't want to rely on 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 them we won't.

Now I understand it.  The 20   conundrum of this case is he didn't tell the police, I 21   have a lawyer.  He had one. 22               Now, if he had hired one and not told the 23   police, it would be the same result as we just said, 24   wouldn't it?  If he had one but didn't tell the police, 25   the police could not initiate questioning; am I right or 33    Correct.    Correct, that's the  ￼7 8 9 me that you want the same result in both cases, that would go a long way towards convincing me. be the same?    The same whether you hired the lawyer or the same whether the lawyer was appointed?    He tells some of the 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   presume that.  I mean, you would be overriding the 24   testimony of the officers.    Can I ask -- I'm getting a  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Miranda point, the police cannot talk to him further, 2   though he can initiate. 3               Now, everyone agreeing, what do we do with a 4   case where a person doesn't have a lawyer, but he 5   requests one?  Now, in such a circumstance, we're going 6   to treat it as if he had one.  That's the prophylactic 7   part.  But here's a case where he really has one.  So it 8   doesn't fall outside Jackson.  It falls within the basic 9   assumption of Jackson, that the difference between 10   having a lawyer and not having a lawyer is, if you have 11   a lawyer, the police can initiate nothing.  You can't 12   talk to him. 13               Now, if that's right, your case -- I mean, 14   I'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a 15   fortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson. 16   Now, explain to me why I've got it wrong.    Accept that, for argument's 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   already asserted.  That was the crux, it seemed to me, 24   of Jackson, that this defendant had asserted his right 25   to counsel at the arraignment.  They then approached him 48    I see. 49  ￼ - Subject to Final Review

That is, at a prior time the D-D 8   had been shipped to B&B's facility in sealed drums, so 9   whatever the possibility that it might be misused later, 10   it wouldn't be spilled or leaked during the process of 11   delivery and transfer.  But Shell decided that it was to 12   its economic advantage to require bulk storage of D-D.    Independent but not at the time of the spill. 21 22 23 24 25   pick it up and take it away.  Those parties could easily 31    Then in your view what it is is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal when the company knows that the transporter on arrival may spill some of the product?    I guess then every oil company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in the United States is going to be -- fall within that because a lot of people do spill things. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   we have control?  Shell says to its buyer, see that the 17   delivery is made in the following way, so it doesn't 18   spill all over the place.  If Shell did control, it    No that's at that point, 18               So that in your trash hauler case, it seems 19   to work pretty well for me that when we say that that 20   trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was 21   its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the 22   dump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its 23   purpose. 24               So how do we deal with that?  The statute 25   tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a 39  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that 2   way.  Now, that seems to work. 3               So we get your example.

And you started 5   down that track, but the reason this is of probably more 6   than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case 7   in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into 8   stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it 9   is. 10               So what would you say to someone who has 11   accepted certain legal principles that we have had in 12   prior cases?  And you want to say nonetheless you win. 13   Okay.  Why?    Why do you say there is no stare decisis problem?    And so it differs from Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?    It differs from Sand?  You  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   considered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if 2   all of the lower courts were lined up against it, which 3   is far from the -- far from the case here.  What you 4   have is a just few lower courts in either correction.  I 5 6 7 8 9 gather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided to grant certiorari in this case, because there's some dispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this principle works in maritime law.

One is this business 18   about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a 19   policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a 20   tanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently 21   enforced policy.

And this court said you don't have to go if 20   it is not a tax.  And what they mean by not a tax, is 21   that it can't plausibly be defended by the government as 22   a tax.  This doesn't happen often.  This is an    In looking at your 10   concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS.  And 11   there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too 12   far out, you can go get an injunction.  That's what 13   you're pointing to.  And then you're argument is, 14   because of that authority, that kind of an exception for 15   the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of 16   limitation and administrative requirement.  And your 17   problem is the latter has never been held.  And the 18   reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when 19   you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about 20   basic equity, but when you're talking about later on 21   administrative requirements, there's really no reason 22   they couldn't have filed the claim.

So I suppose that child molesting of all those kinds that are listed in 41 (c) (1) and (2), which you know I'm sure, would count as rape if committed on a person under 12. Some are absolutely horrible.  Some are just bad.

What is the law here in Texas in respect to this particular magistration  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual 2   accused therein." 3               All right.  Now, what happens -- and I think 4   it would be helpful to know the answer to this -- in 5   what might be a rare instance, but the truth of the 6   matter is there was probable cause to arrest that 7   individual when he was arrested, but there isn't now. 8   So because he came in -- you know, he said here's 14 9   cousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all 10   agree.  I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that 11   means there isn't now.

But what's happening in this proceeding is that 25   the magistrate is deciding that there is probable cause 32    I could -- I can think there would be tremendous constitutional significance and it would make a difference if all that's really happening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which case we might have liberty interests and others at  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   to hold him, in which case it's more like, not 2   completely like, but more like what happens in an 3   indictment or an arraignment, et cetera.    No, I know there may not be, but what about in general.    Okay.  That's what I would    Suppose you were to say that where the State arrests an individual, brings him before a neutral official and intends and does impose a significant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of bringing that individual to trial, there is a - Subject to Final Review 1   assumption was assuming that the defendant is remanded 2   to custody.  I added that. 10   presumption that that -- forget the presumption.  If 11   that happens for the purpose, the primary purpose, 12   primary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at 13   that point the Sixth Amendment right attaches. 14               Now, the State would not have to give him a 15   lawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for 16   example, as in Gouveia, keeping the prisons safe. 17               For example, it's quite clear under the 18   circumstances, there are 14 people accused, they 19   couldn't have all have done it, they want to investigate 20   further.  Or maybe there are other examples.  But, for 21   the primary purpose, then the right attaches. 22               So you pick up Gerstein and add to Gerstein 23   that additional requirement.  What about that?  What 24   harm would that cause?  What inconvenience would it 25   cause, what difficulties, et cetera? 41  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    Yes.

Rather, every action where we praise 6   or blame people must be a voluntary action.  The classic 7   example is:  "The wind blew my arm."

How    -- and you will discover, of course, that your word "involuntary" is never something where the action is involuntary that we praise  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   action, and an action where there is a degree of 2   freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too 3   skewed.  And we see that in the criminal law by a 4 5 6 7 8 9 reading into statutes that say nothing of the word "intentional," and by the use of the duress defense. Now what reason do we have for thinking that Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?    People use that word "intent" in the course of the human race to encompass 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17   question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I 18   have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes 19   to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you 20   don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a 21   person responsible morally into the statute?

But the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   assistance in persecution contains an implicit duress 2   limitation seems to me very different from the question 3   whether it contains an implied knowledge limitation. 4   And the latter question is not present here with respect 5   to a prison guard who, by his own admission, knew 6   exactly what was going on and deliberately implemented 7   torture by keeping people in the sun, exposed in the sun 8   to the point of death.

You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the partners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over here, and through negligence they have got the wrong 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   man?

That's administrable.    I mean are we going to have one of these spectrum things?    I got that point.

And 7   we've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do 8   that and they do it.  Now, is there some indication that 9   that's turned out to be abusive?  Is there indication 10   that there are other problems with the rule as it turned 11   out to be complicated?  What kinds of things you could 12 13 14 15   and the answer is that -- two things:  One, and first 16   and foremost, Belton's general assumption, which is 17   essentially required for the application of the say that will overcome what I'm putting forth as a kind of reluctance.

I mean, it -- it -- I don't 21   think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent 22   claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under 23   some set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to 24   get the discovery that this just won't be worth it. 25               Now that might be right.

Well, I was trying to produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight 15 16 17 18 19 20   Court, it should be set aside and restated.  However, 21   the very case that the Cipollone decision in the 22   plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that 23   plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the 24   opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize, 25   minimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning 9    Well, why -- why would 14  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side 2   raises here is just what Cipollone said.  I can 3   understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States 4   telling cigarette companies what to say about health and 5   smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad.  I 6 7 8 9 10 11   different applications of that in different States.  Of 12   course, every national advertiser faces that situation 13   at the moment.  Everyone who advertises across the 14   nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws 15   differently administered in different States.  Yet, 16   they'd survive.  There is no evidence even that there is 17   a problem.  So why would Congress want to get rid of 18   that particular statute?    That's what I want you to 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   of states imposing warning requirements.  And the 22   tobacco companies went to Congress and said, we do not 23   want special burdens imposed on us.  We don't want 24   special advantages, but please don't impose special 25   burdens on the cigarette industry. 34 do with the purpose of the statute not the text. I'm not making your argument for you.  I'm giving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30 seconds dealing with the purposes that either says there is something to that line or there isn't.
07-581 +++$+++     Is also true -- is that also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of 28  ￼8 9 10    Why? - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5   workplace safety.  Somebody is hurt as a result of 6   machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate 7   notice or so forth.  Is your view the same there?    A tort suit.  It says, some -- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not concerned with discrimination; we are concerned with 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   specifically directed at union discrimination.  The 23   legislative history of these statutes indicates that 24   discrimination by unions was one of the concerns 25   animating Congress -- 29    Doesn't this allow discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination by the employer?    Now, you say section 30 doesn't say anything about union discrimination particularly; it just talks about discrimination.    Fine.  So you think sometimes unions do discriminate?    All right.  And sometimes unions also would rather have the more effective machine or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can 10 11 12   replicate anything you might think.  We can think of 13   tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and 14   employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of 15   discrimination suits.  Most unions don't want 16   discrimination.  I mean, most of the time.  And most 17   unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time. 18               So if I decide for you in this case, am I 19   also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort 20   suits or contract suits or just whether or not the 21   workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites? 22   I mean, you know?    That's the only reason? Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that I see no more reason today why a union would like discrimination, then I can see a reason why they would like a dangerous machine?    If I think that, then I should decide against you?    Very helpful of you.    Then I replicate my 32  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   question because what I'm thinking is simply that there 2   are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims 3   that people go to arbitration over.  And what I'm 4   wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of 5   such claims that I have now said that a union, through a 6   collective bargaining contract, can force the employee 7   against his will to go to arbitration over?  I don't 8   have a feeling for that from the briefs.  I don't have a 9   feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims 10   are special in that regard, that there's no line in that 11   regard, or that there's some other line.    Well, can you give me a hint as to the principle? (Laughter.)
07-582 +++$+++     I am interested in the
07-588 +++$+++     Well, the -- the -- one question I have on this is if I look at the two standards -- and the first one is "best practical" -- it 19  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   they've changed the phrase.  It doesn't get rid of cost, 5   but it simply says you shall take into account the cost 6   of achieving such effluent reduction. the total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent-reduction benefits. Then you look at "best available," and 7 8 9 "cost." 10 11 12   Senator Muskie said at the time.    So they both use the word    Then you look at what  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   goal.  There are other ways of getting there.  Of 5   course, see that it isn't absurd.  And for 30 years the 6   agency has had a way.  It has talked about "grossly costs, but don't do it too much. And, therefore, you would say:  Don't apply one of these big formal things when you reach your final 7   disproportionate." 8               Now, that's the whole background to the 9   question.  My question is, of course:  Why not let 10   sleeping dogs lie?  Let the agency take it into account 11   the way it's done it to prevent absurd results, but not 12   try to do it so that it's so refined you can't even take 13   account of what a fish is worth unless they happen to be 14   one of the 1.2 percent that goes to market.    Well now, what they are going to argue, I guess, is going to be up to them, and I would be very interested in hearing it.    And then you would be 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   they have used for 30 years.  Is it grossly 17   disproportionate?  Are you -- is it feasible?  Is it 18   practical?  Are you using costs along with other things? 19   How do you feel about some slightly vague thing like 22 23 24 25 went too far in saying that you can never take costs into account.    Of course, you can sometimes take account of them, and the standard that we think is there -- I'm just imagining this -- is the one 20 that? 21    You are happy with that?    All right.  So it's simply saying the Second Circuit was wrong, the use of the word "cost" is meaningless without some idea --    -- of what the costs are relevant to, but a -- but a vague, grossly 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   is:  Yes, if for 30 years they have not been mandating 20   closed-cycle cooling under that standing -- standard, so 21   from the industry's perspective, that probably is an 22   acceptable standard. 23               But the real point here is that when we 24   start talking about to what degree can you compare the 25   costs, is it significantly greater than, is it wholly 23 disproportionate test is okay with you?    Is it or not?    The one they used for 30 years at EPA, is that all right or not all right?    But to be honest about it, I would have to say the reason it isn't available is quite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the harm -- that particular adverse impact which is killing 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   a -- a water animal.  The reason it isn't is because it 22   doesn't kill any water animals.  Well, let me be honest; 23 24 25 it kills one, or it kills two --    Or it kills three, and 36    No, no, no, but best available says take costs into account.    Now, there is a way of doing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that they have some discretion over, that doesn't involve some enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am 10 11   searching for.  I don't -- I am not sitting here with an 12   answer.  I'm trying to find a way of making sense of 13   this.    Well, what about the  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   be arguing that they can't take that into account, 2   which, for an environmental agency, I would have 3   thought, "But they must take it into account."    Now, I'm worried about what you are saying that may make it so difficult for them that they won't be able to do the job.    I agree.    And the page -- the page of the legislative history or the page of the text of the statute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it 5 6 7   with your son.  It costs $100.    What page?  I will read it    I know 316(b).
07-591 +++$+++     Well, of course, it    And that's why -- and maybe you have nothing else you want to say on this point. It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.    It seems like there are some things going one way, and some things going the other on the issue of whether to call it "testimonial."    That's true.    All right.  Now, is there anything else you want to add to me on those 10 11 12   assumptions?    I absolutely see that 20  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   point.  So that - all right, go back to the plea 2   bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a 3   little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining 4   system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, 5   the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense 6   bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added 7   weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to 8   insist that you call these people.  You don't even know 9   where they are.  I'm not going to accept the lab report. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   study where you might say what the price of this is.  Of 18   course, it happens already every day with other And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place because he thought you would say something like that. So I'm not -- is there anything you can say about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining? Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?    No, no, there's a
07-608 +++$+++     That's the conclusion.  ￼8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 question to see if there is anything at all more?    I don't want the text.  I want something for my purposes.    Okay.    No, I've got the words.  If the best you can do is point me to the words of the Justice, is that the legislative history does not speak 18   on this particular matter.  It is silent on this.    So the -- the -- the  ￼5 6 7 8 9    Making progress.  And you're saying that in the House there were some people who didn't want it to extend to beyond 17 States?    And how do we know that?
07-610 +++$+++     There is no remedy at all.    So union members who are being gypped, they just have to put up with it.    Right.  Are you saying you could bring a lawsuit or not?    So either -- in these cases everybody in the union whether they're forced or not,  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   way from the national is an interest that's shared 2   equally by the members and the nonmembers.  It's not 3   something that creates a First Amendment concern.
07-615 +++$+++ 
07-636 +++$+++     Well, could we do this?  I mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   we, say, grant the question now and ask that people file 2   an additional brief if they want to say something? 3               It just seems to me an awful waste of money 4   and everybody's time to send it back and have it make 5   another trip.  So what's your suggestion as to how we 6   proceed? 7 8 9    You see, I want to be fair 16   everything they have to say.  That's what's worrying me.    Well, that doesn't make too much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just 35  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody.  She 2   just doesn't take it.  So it goes to the beneficiary -- 3   it goes to the person who made up the plan.  It's a 4 5 6 7   before us, which is a case of waiver.  And of course the 8   argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law, little hard to pay to him, because he is dead. So I mean if you read it literally, it doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case 9   waiver is treated differently.  And if it weren't, you'd 10   have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a 11   benefit that's given to you by someone else. 12               And so let's interpret this and make sense 13   of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest 14   of the law to say a waiver is waivered.  It's not giving 15   something to somebody else.    I'm sorry.  It says, if it's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.    I know you do, and that's 13 14   Breyer. 15 16   what I need to ask.    Now, you think that includes the giver, the payor?    Well, that's where this goes if you waive it.    I'm five minutes behind.  I 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   plan benefits.  That is completely foreign to the 25   efficient and simple operation that Congress had in 43    Okay?  I get it.    I can understand an anti- 11   alienation provision.  That's some guy who is going to  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   comply with ERISA.  The most -- the most direct and 10   simplest one is the change of beneficiary form.  William 11   didn't do that here.  That's undisputed.  They could 12   have entered into a QDRO, and that would have gone -- 13   the money would have gone to Liv as an alternate payee. 14   That would have taken the benefits, consistent with 15   ERISA, away from Liv and given them to Kari.  They could 16   have done that.    I see.    Suppose she's married for 40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and 10 11   then he wants a divorce.  Doesn't she have some right to 12   some of that money.    Does she get some of the money he saved?    So it's not exactly that 21 22 23 24   entitled.  It's only a spouse who is entitled to the 25   benefits . just changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her something else.
07-665 +++$+++     That seems to be the 23  ￼Did you -- - Subject to Final Review 1   problem I have is that we seem to be applying these 2   subcategories in a very absolute way.  Why can't we call 3   this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with 4   Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we 5   do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate 6   to a legitimate objective?  I know how you're going to 7   answer that question.  You're going to say:  Of course, 8   it is. 9 But what's interesting me is, are we bound in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what 10 11 12   seems to me to be at the heart of the matter?  The 13   answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is:  Of 14   course the Government can't do that because it's 15   disproportionate.    But suppose they only accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all the Republicans?    Now, what in the First Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would not stop that? 17 18 19 20 21   freely.  But as a matter of rational basis review under 22   the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see 23   how the Government would have a legitimate governmental 24   interest in pure partisan activity. 25               But the Free Speech Clause, what it does is 27
07-689 +++$+++     Section 2 -- does vote dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a black group, could have elected a candidate of our choice more likely than the white group, but because you are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   that can happen.  But is the evil we are trying to get    There are a lot of reasons 33  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together 2   in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting 3   their candidate elected than when the white group does 4 the same?    That's what we should do?    Then I'm back to my problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   are going to need a lot of crossovers.  And the more 2   crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say 3   that that white group is out there trying to beat them. 4               So there's a kind of natural stopping place. 5   When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural 6   stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.  It sort of 7   fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist 8   that the black group had to be twice as many as the 9   white group that crossed over.  A little arbitrary, but 10   at least we were getting to the same -- to the right 11   thing.  I mean -- respond as you wish.
07-751 +++$+++     And if it's easier to deal with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the rest of it.    We don't always have to do it, but I mean once.
07-772 +++$+++     No.  But what I mean by that is that the prosecution would have had to have gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using shorthand for that --    -- more mixed up than they did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.    All my questions from the whole case. emphasize we are not alleging prosecutorial misconduct 10 11 12 13   in this case in any way.  The problem is --    I realize that but what the 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   have premedication, Justice Kennedy.  I think the best 22   answer I can give and I -- is that we agree with the 23   State on this.  We agree with what the State said at 24   page 31 of its brief, that it had to prove that    What's the difference between that and punching him in the stomach?    This argument -- I'm  ￼3 4 5 6 7 8 9 the State gives the jury as to what Washington law means, it is clear that's the argument they're making. On the facts they made alternative arguments.

And --    And in a real suit, there is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's what we want arbitrated.    So this one is not so hard to figure out.    There might be some that    Well, in his case, in the Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get into court, probably don't because they are bringing this under a State law?    Is this right?  I'm asking if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good response in rebuttal.    So, what you could have is you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between them, and one is from Vermont; the other from 10 11 12   California. 13 14 15 16   of -- that never could come into Federal court.  I mean    So there is jurisdiction. And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters 17 18 19 20 21   theory.    But nevertheless, we have a Federal court issuing this injunction, under their  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount --    So if you didn't look through, then this would apply to nothing?    If the arbitration --    The arbitration agreement has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, then you could have really important Federal questions in substantive issues --    -- that couldn't come in  ￼11 12 13 14 15 16 17   not. 18 - Subject to Final Review 1   the arbitration agreement does.  The arbitration -- but 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 now you're saying, well, that second case is never going to arise.

Then, will you try to say in a sentence or two if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't apply to any kind of an effort to raise money for political purposes where they say to the government you got to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?

And -- and so I don't 22 23 24 25   this, but the way I heard it was:  Well, don't worry, 39    Now, I heard from -- and I might interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   because if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of 2   Engineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard 3   anyway.  And now you are sort of saying:  Well, or they 4   are going to apply some standard.  And then there was a 5 6 7 8   effluent?  Justice Alito's question is, well, do they 9   apply the fill standard?  And between my response to question of well, what standard, and we got a little vague there. Now, what happens if it goes to the EPA as 10   these two answers, I still don't understand how it 11   works.  It's -- help me.

Okay.  I guess cyanide isn't toxic. But the -- the -- now I just heard that if the EPA doesn't give the permit, but the Corps of Engineers does, the EPA has the power to veto the 2 3 4 5   permit.  Is that right?    Why not?  If they have a veto power --    I know it comes under a different statute, but in any instance where in fact they see that some of their rules that they promulgate are being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers is not paying attention to those rules, they can veto    If they don't veto it, then that would be a way of reconciling these two things. 17 it. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    So couldn't they veto it?

That's their honest reason.    No, it does.  It says it’s the judicial process that does it.    It's the judicial process and its expanse --    -- that forces the settlements that create unjust results.    That may be, and suppose they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period.

08-1065 +++$+++     So I agree with you on  ￼17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 See, your footnote 6 presumes that the prosecutor doesn't know.    There's a different tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what 24   think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors 25   involved in the questioning process.  That -- that has a 44  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   kind of check on the police. 2               And the concern I'd have is that the --this 3   will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved 4   in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least 5   not before the police are well on the way.  And that is 6 7 8 9   risk of that kind of disincentive?  Now, are you just a very negative incentive, I would think. So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule that you could live with that will in fact minimize the 10 11 12 13 14   cause.  It turns on and off as you're talking to the 15   witness.  First what he says, you have the probable 16   cause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't.  I 17   mean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best 18   thought to this problem and tell me what is the most 19   safe rule that will allow you to win your case?    Or is there something -- I mean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5   Chicago, I think.

And they say they do it in 6 7 8 9   get legal advice about what they're doing.  And this    Where have you got it now? You've got it as when there is probable cause for believing that someone has committed a crime?    Someone?  So it's someone -- needn't be the particular person they eventually indict?    Uh-huh.
08-108 +++$+++     Well, why not just says 32  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   "means of identification," then?  I mean, it's odd to 2   write a statute that has elements and you put the word 3   "knowingly," and the knowingly is supposed to modify 4   some elements but not others.  I can't think of other 5   statutes that do that.  There may be some. 6               It's pretty peculiar.  You could have left 7   off the last element.  I mean, if you are drafting a 8   criminal statute, anyone would know that.    That's going to be jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like --  ￼23 24 25 person either way. I don't think that is true of the Chin statute, though I tend make a very strong argument that 35 - Subject to Final Review 1   trafficking crime." 2               In Chin the D.C. Circuit said in every other 3   court of appeals who have considered the question has 4   said the defendant does not need to be specifically 5   aware that the individual in question is less than 18 6 years old.    All that is true, and that  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft. 2               And where the argument lies is between did 3   Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to 4   engage in identity theft or people who, while not 5   intending to do so, have that effect.  That's the issue. 6 7 8 9   said.  It is rather hard to say.  So, therefore, suppose 10   I use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying 11   out.  I am not buying it. 12               In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences, 13   there is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of 14   Lenity with bite.  And that is because mandatory 15   minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw 16   some people into the box who shouldn't be there.  And if 17   this person should be there and we put him outside, the 18   judge could give him the same sentence anyway. 19               So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person 20   outside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the 21   government is small.  The harm to the individual by 22   wrongly throwing him into the box is great.  The Rule of 23   Lenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of 24   cases where it has particular force, but this is one of 25 them. 42    And I don't thing I can resolve that one way or the other from anything you have  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    That's why I raised it.

08-1119 +++$+++ 
08-1134 +++$+++     Now, that would be quite --    Wait a moment.  What would it be in the case where you have a discharge order and it says things in it which somebody feels fall within 1 ￼10   later, because he will say that, since it falls in that 11   category, the judgment is void insofar as this language 12   covers what I don't want it to cover?    Is it the case if somebody feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he --  4 5 6 7   13 years later and say that the judgment was void?  Is 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the answer of the government yes or no?    All right.  Is there any --  1   weren't met.  I sent him a notice, but it was in a 2   balloon, okay.  You know, was the notice a real notice, 3   wasn't it?  People argue about that. So in any case where you have a person who says, no, they weren't met, and the other side says, yes, they were met, that first person can come back
08-1151 +++$+++     Tell me if I'm right, and if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer, justify it, if you can.    No --    I'm giving you what I took   1   have to do with contact with water. 2               Instead, the most important point is to look 3   at Martin v. Busch, which was a case where the State 4   lowered the water in a lake, the upland owners at -- the 5   property line was determined not to have moved, they 6   didn't have any contact with the water any longer, and 7   the submerged sovereignty lands became the State's 8   property.  There's no right of contact there.  It’s --    Well, why do we have to say ￼17   right? 18 19   think there's a fourth.  Yes, the fourth is that nobody 20   can build anything there that is harmful, except if it's 21   to do with the environment; that's not harmful, that's 22   helpful to the beach owner.  It's supposed to be 23   helpful.  And, five, you get your beach guaranteed. 24               So all of those things are things you get 25   under this Act in an intermediate case where it's a 43 So those are at least three things, and I  1   little like an avulsion and a little not like an 2   avulsion.  Now, do I add anything to my list?  And do  3 4 5 6 7   to know.  What more?    Okay, that's what I wanted ￼16 17 18 19   and submit that in the just compensation hearing?  When 20   the landowner comes in and says, look, you have taken my 21   property and it is worth $100,000, and you come in and 22   say oh, no, no; it's not worth $100,000; look at all 23   these things we saved and gave you.  It's only -- what 24   you have lost is only worth $20,000.  And a court will 25   review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what 44 consent of the owners.    So it's not that it's a    -- and you're compensating; it is a reason why this is a -- I am somewhat putting words in your mouth, but I mean -- 45   1               (Laughter.)
08-1175 +++$+++     Yes.    I'm just asking you to point to the words that tell him that.    Don't have you a right to talk to a lawyer at a grand jury?    Yes, correct.  And so aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you 16 17 18 19   have three responses to that.  First, under Miranda the warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you during the interrogation?    It doesn't use the word 11  5 6 7 8 9    Well, what FBI are we 18               And so, is there some other case that 19   says -- or some other FBI statement that they give 20   people that doesn't use the words "with you," that says 21   you don't have to say "with you during," or doesn't have 22   to say "present during"?  Was there some other case that 23   said that? 24 25   warning does have that.  However, there have been 13    Excuse me.  Can you just devote one minute before you finish –-    -- to the question of why    But there were four. One is to have during, in the presence of, the right to have a lawyer during the interrogation, in the presence of, with him at the time.    Now, that's one of  1   talk to an attorney before answering any questions and 2   during this interview would infer the unstated 3   restriction that he can talk to an attorney but only by 4   phone or only remotely --    They didn't say anything about during.    So anyway -- then they don't need to mention “during” at all because if that's right, the FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling 29    It wasn't though, actually.    It isn't -- it isn't  1   you, you have a right to counsel.  It doesn't say  ￼ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   during.  This would be okay if they said nothing at all 10 about it.    So then you think that, in fact, going by that warning, that there is no constitutional right to have them say a word about  7 8 9    This Court has referred
08-1191 +++$+++     Or any other.  Or -- read the next word.    Or France or England or any of these others?
08-1198 +++$+++     What?   The -- but the -- as I recall, the way I would have interpreted -- imagine a worker who ￼20 21 22 23   describe the bottom line is:  They have found a meeting 24   of the minds as to what this means. might look to public policy. They might look almost to anything under the sun they think is relevant, and the way, in jargon, you 25               Now, of course, it isn't really a meeting of 41   1   the minds.  But that's just the summary of the 2   conclusion as to what, objectively read, those words in 3   the contract mean.  Now, that's how I think I would have 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13   they're saying is:  It may be true that the arbitrators, 14   when they looked at some of those elements, really got 15   it wrong.  Now, if they are correct on that -- this is 16   the other question I have.  You are going to say:  No, 17   they're not -- they didn't get it that wrong; wrong, 18   maybe, but not that wrong. 19               All right.  Now, can they not do this?  The 20   next person who has this form contract does not so 21   readily agree it's up to the arbitrator to say whether 22   that contains a class action or not.  Rather, they say: 23   I read this contract as reserving that question to the 24   court.  It's not the same language as was there in 25   Bazzle; it's not the same industry of the kind you had 42 learned it. Is that still done, or is there some other way of describing it?    If that's contract law --    -- then I take it what   1   in Bazzle; and, therefore, a judge should decide that. 2   That's the meeting of the minds on the who question.  And 3   then we’ll get it all resolved, because the judge might 4   come out differently if they're right, and maybe 5   arbitrators will follow the judge. 6               I’m interested, because we might have to write 7   something, in your answer to that question.    There’s a supplemental agreement here because I thought --    -- in reading this, the supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3 --    -- of the AAA, and it’s supplement --    -- rule 3 of the AAA supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote, "determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, partial, final award, on the construction of the 52  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class."    So I thought the supplemental agreement said --   -- apply Rule 3, and therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the 10   question put in Rule 3.  Is that right? 11 12 13 14 15 16   Arbitration Clause?  That's what Mr. Waxman referred us     So then we could get the question by reading page 7 of the blue brief.
08-1200 +++$+++     That's true of antitrust defendants, too.    No, I see that.  Is it -- is it -- what do you think of the idea that your  37 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with 2   the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the 3   substantive provisions, so that there is no violation 4   for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and 5   asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are 6   against them?  What you would have to do. 7 8 9 That isn't so hard to do as I first thought, because the words that seem to make -- the primary words of what is outlawed are the words "unfair or 10   unconscionable means."  Now I -- I doubt -- you would 11   know -- I doubt that there are other words in the 12   statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that 13   really shouldn't be forbidden.  I mean, they shouldn't 14   call people up in the middle of the night and harass 15   them and so forth. 16               But -- but you could read unfair and 17   unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is 18   really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were 19   against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that 20   he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably. 21   What about that?    I was wondering if you know, can you give me just a rough idea, of the percentage of instances in which people write to the FTC to take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just says, "Well, we won't tell you."    How many have asked?    I mean, it seems to me that's the obvious solution to the problem, that -- until you hold they are not -- they are liable for mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of time and -- and get a safe harbor. It's -- so I don't know what we could do to suggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the statute, should be used.    That means lawyer, if you are worried about this, go write before you do it.

Yes, probably the Commerce Clause power.    So it's fine -- 36  ￼    You set up a prison where, in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal release date, so can it in prison. 10 11 12 13 14   think, a couple of responses.  First of all, this is ­ 15   - that is no part of the government's argument in this 16   case.  Their -- their argument is a backward-looking 17   argument that locates its power in the fact that they 18   have had these people in their custody, and they can't 19   responsibly let them go. 20             What you are positing is more of a forward­ 21   looking argument that would essentially create a 22   Federal parens patriae power, that the Federal 23   government has --
08-1301 +++$+++     Yes.    Yes, but that’s -- that’s true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved.    That is, what I’m -- the reason I brought up the other is because if this is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress might be trying to get as many people as they want to register. ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   comprehensive nationwide registration scheme.  And one 22   of the things that that required was -- anticipated, was 23   standardization among the States. But this -- this also serves some purpose, like we’re going to make Alabama get some information, makes it easier to catch these people, that purpose wouldn't be served when the travel takes place before this takes effect because Alabama wouldn't have kept the information then.    Okay.  So the person who hasn't registered in California --    He’s afraid of the Feds. He didn't -- he wasn't afraid of the California police,   1   notifying different jurisdictions when somebody moves 2   from one to another --    The only reason I bring it 15   up is if this is a very close case.

Of course it could.    But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment.    The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment.    -- it can’t -- you agree that that couldn't be?    Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   the attorney's fees.  It happens that he can't keep 22   those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the 23   $500.  He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, 24   just as the trust eventually has to give the $500 to the 25   beneficiary.  So I'm simply saying -- drawing a    Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money that he has just gotten from the government, including 29  - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   I’m looking at the definition.

And then you've defined "payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in that money.    And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether    Okay. 32  - Subject to Final Review    And it's $5,000 of money and  possible? government?

In other words -- in other 18   repayment agreement.  The concept of a repayment 19   agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking 20   about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two 21   reasons:  Number one, SSI benefits by statute are 22   limited to, quote, "aged, blind, and disabled people who 23   have little or no money." 24               So, I don't know where the disabled or blind 25   or aged person is going to get the money to enter into 46  - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   to file the case in Federal court.  And, so, there is 5   60 days to, you know, meet with the client and try to 6   get an answer out of the government.  I've never tried 7   to do this -- I don't know anyone who has -- but I don't 8   think you’re going to get much of an answer at 60 days 9   asking the government to do this so the attorney can 10   then recover a fee. 11               Finally, there’s -- there’s a critical 12   point here that I need to get to, which is that I think 13   Congress has told us exactly what this language means. 14   Here's why. 15               In 1985, Congress enacts EAJA and uses this 16   section 3 language which talks about who gets the fee, 17   large or smaller fee.  Okay.  In 1992, Congress extends 18   EAJA to Veterans claims.  And when it does that, in 38 19   U.S.C. 5904, Congress uses the same language, down to 20   the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in 21 1985. 22               During this entire period -- and here's why 23   that's important -- during that entire period from 1985 24   to 1992, and indeed continuing many years after that, 25   but for purposes here, 1992, the administration is every 47 any repayment agreement. But the second reason it's fanciful is that ￼the attorney only has 60 days from final agency action  - Subject to Final Review 1   time paying the attorney’s fee to the attorney under 2   EAJA.  And so when Congress in 1992 uses the same 3   language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for 4   Social Security EAJA claims 7 years earlier, 5   Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the 6   settled administrative construction --

08-1341 +++$+++     Now, nobody else uses that. It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any justification for their using it?    Because unless I can hear a justification, I would guess I would vote to say send it back and let them use the same standard anybody else does.    What's your response to    And it says that all the other ￼ 1   that is that we are seeking a retrial here.  You know, 2   you speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the 3   gentleman can be tried on that conduct that was 4   post-enactment. 5               But in response to Your Honor's question, I 6   think, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in 7   this whole case is, it all ran together in front of the 8   jury, and they saw all of this proof with no 9   instruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the -- 10   the mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in 11   front of that had to have a -- 21 22 23 24   under this circumstance was justified.  When the court 25   saw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say if  ￼12 13   the -- 14 15   the Second Circuit.  That's what we’re concerned about.    So why don't you make    That's true.  And also no person should be convicted with a confession that was ￼10               Now, for all those latter things, every 11   court apparently uses the normal standard.  So why would 12   we in this case use a special standard?
08-1371 +++$+++     So I have an absolute void in this record, which in turn I think would be important to fill that void, because their justification -- 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   bias issue, and -- and they want to say:  That isn't 18   much, because that isn't really the point here, and 19   that's what we think, anyway.  It's just an example of    -- is they don't want to get into this, it's too complicated, and we’re not And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay  - Subject to Final Review 1   know what it really is, which I don't have, what should 2   I do?

So if, in fact, the --    -- they have clubs and they’re not services, and what they do is they discuss -- they discuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can they have separate discussions -- women?    -- men from -- men and   Well, that's their problem here.

Let's try juror number -- let's try 76 "Right." "Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking that, if that's what you really think. You just need to tell us that.” “Okay.” “That's what you think, isn't it?” “It's been a long time since I answered that questionnaire.” “Right. Now, as you" -- Okay? Now, that’s -- that, as far as I could tell, is as close as I can get to a recantation of what she thought originally.    You’re not saying that.    Then if you're not saying that, what the person has to carry around with them is an agency treatise. (Laughter.)    Yes, I mean, of course they intend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the case that is not obvious that worries me, and --    -- in the case that is not obvious, of course they intend to withhold
08-1402 +++$+++     Now, why is it -- I’m just  1   there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors 2   that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about 3   the merits of that. 4             I mean, I see a negative, and I see a 5   positive.  So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously 6   bad, nor is it obviously good.  So what should I do? 7 8 9    Right.    Well, but -- but that's just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing.    The problem we're seeing is that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization rate and they have a higher minority population, then you will end up with the leftover juries having a lower minority population. Now, the explanation for that is that you choose the district judges -- you choose the district  1   say I'm not sure. 2             I think you have fewer minorities, that's 3   true, but people get to serve closer to home.  Now -- 4   now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this?    So what if --    All right.  So is -- 10 11 12 13 14   what was permitted.  Here you’re trying to say this is 15   required.  The school’s case was, these are measures 16   the district could take if it wanted to.  But you are 17   saying these are measures the district must take 
08-1423 +++$+++    I have to say, I didn't even see it in the legislative history. I didn't think they made a big deal about jobbers. I like history here. Go back to 1792.   I do read legislative history, but I didn't really find anything that said that they were worried about an American and a British publisher dividing rights, and they want them to do that. There is no problem with that, because there has never been a sale. So they divide the rights. And there isn't even a problem with -- with buyers from the British publisher, because a reasonable vertically imposed territorial agreement or other restriction on resale is lawful.   And if it's reasonable, they don't even need copyright.   If it isn't reasonable, why should they have it?   Here. But in Europe, I were lawful.

08-1457 +++$+++     Yes. 30    Yes.    Is that when the 400 cases that you are talking about were?    And 1947.  And how many cases were decided by two members about, I'm not asking for -- during the times you are talking about before the present two-member boards?    I thought they -- they simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier statutory phrase, and they are changing those words because grammatically you now need it? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   quorum would be three as well.  But -- but the language 18   is quite specific on this and, contrary to what the D.C. 19   Circuit found, "at all times" is modified by that
08-146 +++$+++     Well, I thought the first issue -- I never got past the first issue.    And the first issue was, 10   does he have a right to appeal?  And I read the statute, 11   and to me section 16 says yes.  He asked for a stay.  It 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Is there any -- is there any other example in the law -- I can't think of one -- where you say this party has so silly an argument, which is really what you're saying --    -- that we don't even let    It seems to me I've gotten a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you can't appeal.    As to that, if you did 23               As to the second point, you say -- I was 24   surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that 25   we are now supposed to reach what we would call the 28  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   merits of the appeal.  Now, there you just heard your 2   co-counsel say:  Look, you don't have to decide whether 3   my equitable theory is good or not.  You haven't read 4   the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment.  And -- 5   and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a 6   third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that 7   two others make. 8               The statute doesn't say he can't.  The 9   statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it. 10   And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an 11   assignment, for example, you would think, of course, 12   there are other people, say an assignee, who could 13   enforce it.    And so, so -- is it possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   can -- you can interpret the contract until the cows 2   come home, you're never going to find the Petitioners in 3   it.  So that the question --    Something related to that. 40 - Subject to Final Review 1   things, maybe four:  Party to the agreement, party to 2   the action, party to the arbitration, or party-like 3   person.  And I would be concerned about hanging it on -- 4   on that.  So my -- my answer is, because of the way it's 5 6 7 8 9 used in sections 3, 4, 5, 9, I would be concerned about -- about resting on that.    So is that -- is that 11   right, or is it wrong?  What's your insight or guess on    I'm just looking for ways of separating these sheep from goats. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   that section 3 was ambiguous.  You don't know if the 24   reference to "parties" means parties to the arbitration 25   agreement or parties in the litigation.  So how can we
08-1470 +++$+++     Why do you say it would 25 have to seek a waiver before they interrogate.    I mean the Respondent.    Which -- which are the  
08-1521 +++$+++     But there is a difference.    Because the -- one of the reasons -- 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 of that brief, and you’ll see the differences, even accepting Heller.    -- at least, is that -- you’ve read, I'm sure, that all the law professors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say even Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 self-defense right, which goes a long way to understand why the Heller decision came out the way that it came out. And I would simply finish by noting that the one thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about Blackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on the right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right that should apply to the States.
08-1529 +++$+++ 
08-1553 +++$+++     Is -- is there a way to -- are you finished?    We don't even get into this problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier?    That's a separate argument?    Did the Ninth Circuit pass 28    But mid-carriage -- it only   1   on that argument?
08-1555 +++$+++     The statute would block the 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   you couldn't possibly be interfering.  You couldn't there may be a different principle, but we can sue you now.    All right.  And you’re saying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, so  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 anybody --    -- who was part of the official operation --    -- even though there is no present interference?    Why?  Why?    Because if the state doesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason than in the incident where the entity is no longer part of the state?    Oh, no, you may have act of 17 ￼ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you’ve said.    And that's my question you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis?    Well, what is your --    Right.  The question I think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it’s 23   suing England or -- he’s suing an active state for an 24   official act.  And the judge says:  I have read the 25   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed.  Judge, 29  1   let me amend this.  And all he does is he fills in 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 the names of the individuals, because there were some individuals who did the act. Now, does he suddenly fall outside the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed the names of the people who did it, and everything else was the same?    Well, it doesn't protect --    So wait --    -- you’re saying this Act  1 2 3 4   would have.  If they thought, in the Restatement’s 5   words -- which are not just if you are doing an official 6   act.  If you are doing an official act, and the exercise question is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would have thought that is a suit against the state. Now, there may be many reasons that they ￼10 11 12   is only good as against a bad lawyer?  Because any 13 14 15 16 17   lawyer.  Is that what you’re saying?    There is never a case where this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   to say.  The second half of the Restatement says you state, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming the officer instead.     Fine.  If you’re going to give that answer --    -- which I thought was what you would give --    -- then I have added my 20   question:  Sometimes the individual, in the first set of 21   cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the 22   state.  Sometimes the individual does not count as the 23   state.  And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to 24   work out the principle of when that individual would 25   fall within the FSIA -- as you now, via 32
08-1569 +++$+++ 
08-192 +++$+++     Why are you going through all this sort of parsing, I mean, looking at the 32  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   legislative history as well as the statute in 1970? 2   What is your answer to the last point that they made, 3   that what Congress wanted to do was to make simple 4   possession a misdemeanor, that's why they changed the 5   word, which -- "offense" to "felony."  That's why they 6 7 8 9   up, and that's why they amended it, right.  So -- so the changed the word "felony" to "misdemeanor." And I can't imagine why else they amended the statute, and just because I was curious I looked it 10   legislative history makes that clear. 11               So what you've done is figure out a way -- 12   the government's figured out a way to do the opposite of 13   what they want, to take people who simply possess and 14   transform it into a felony.  Now, what justification is 15   there in the law for doing that?    -- second.    What one comes to mind?    That's jurisdictional. What I'm looking for is there's a business and a customer, the statute punishes the business worse than 16   where it's the way he does it -- i.e., whether he uses a 17   telephone or whether he uses a telegram or semaphore 18   signals or -- where the -- where the means of 19   communication here or something like that suddenly 20   transform him? 21               Anything else that comes to mind?  I didn't 22   expect there to be, but I just thought maybe you would 23   think of an analogy, which would be helpful.    And what should I read and where exactly --
08-205 +++$+++     Yes.    Yes.    And the individual contribution also covers people who would like to give 11   $2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit.  And maybe  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of quid pro 2   quo corruption.  And you know, Justice Breyer, what the 3   Court said in that case is because it's not inhibiting 4   someone from actually speaking, it's -- it's giving 5   money to someone --    It's important --    Yes. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16   what -- what -- there is not a sufficient record.  The 17   reason --the government has shifted position here.  They 18   were, first of all, talking about the so-called 19   distortion rationale in Austin, the distortion rationale 20   which they seem to have abandoned in the -- in the 21   supplemental briefs filed in connection with this 22   argument, and they resorted to the corruption, 23   appearance of corruption.  There isn't a sufficient 24   record of this.  There isn't --
08-214 +++$+++     What is your best?    So we'd be making this up out of whole cloth, it seems to me.    -- because Miles says don't 21 22 23 24 25   that in this hearing.  We said what we do with these
08-240 +++$+++ 
08-267 +++$+++     Well, if that's so, then I  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 right.    Then you're saying that what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis, indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was in it can bring constitutional challenges?    Yes, okay, and we see those  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   instance that we're talking about, he can never be 2   retried.  So in fact the difference would be, in your 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 view, the civilians who bring this would never be retried if they're right.    And so they would have in that sense greater protection in the military system than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not 10   always there.  Now, why would Congress have intended 11   that?    I knew it was.    I'm telling you my honest 12   problem which I'm trying to think through:  Where are we 13 14 15 16   way or the other way?  That's why I asked the question. 17   So all I'm asking is your best thought on it.    What's going to happen one  ￼20 21 22 23 24 25 final the conviction was set aside, and I would note the Court in that case observed the personal jurisdiction was no obstacle to granting the coram nobis relief. you know?    All right.  It's a habeas 10 11   Your Honor. 12 13   case.  Now, do you have -- can you do that in the 14   military?    Aiding what jurisdiction?    But they've already directly reviewed it.  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    So there is no more direct review to be had?    I see. - Subject to Final Review
08-289 +++$+++ 
08-304 +++$+++     The arguments in this case, my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I 10 11 12   can remember, really.  For each one, there is a 13   counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air. 14               So if -- since we have to decide it, it 15   should -- should I take this into account:  That if the 16   Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that 17   there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards 18   at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have 19   them.  No question.  They front-run the government. 20   They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in 21   the newspaper. 22               But if you are right, then they are going to 23   have to assign people to look at these obscure 24   administrative reports that didn't even get in the 25   newspaper.  So they want to do that, they don't have 13  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   people to do it, and they say these people are 2   performing a service of sorts by reading them, the 3   reports, for them and telling them about it.  And there 4   it is, balanced. 5               But they are the ones who suffer.  You see, 6   they suffer both ways.  They suffer if people don't tell 7   them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting 8   unjustified rewards because the money comes from the 9   Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent.  So if 10   they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special 11   attention to their views as to how the balance works 12   out?    What's the state of the law  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   state of the law?    I think you'd have to say 10 11 12 13   that.  But -- but now, what is the state of law on that? 14 15 16 17 18 19   I mean, to me it makes no sense.  We are only talking 20   about things that don't get into the newspapers.  So -- 21   and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of 22   this would be, look, we don't have people to go send 23   around to every -- read every State report.  We just 24   don't have that personnel.  So we rely on these    What are we supposed to do? 25   whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified.  I 25  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   would think the same thing would be absolutely true of 2   State criminal proceedings that don't get into the 3   newspaper.  There are probably 50 -- several 4   thousands -- thousands and thousands. 5               So how to read these differently is a 6   problem for me.  And I think that's on your side of it. 7   But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to 8   me is the -- is the question here.    Is there any history, which I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history or anything else that you can point to, to me that's important, showing that that first criminal hearing means just Federal?    And they meant criminal 26  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    You say "exactly."  I was  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   of a public disclosure as a Federal report?  I mean, we 2   are told that this particular report was filed with the 3   U.S. Department of Agriculture.    And the reason that it's -- it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that cuts against you is because of this sorting of the context where they are focusing on Federal. And, if everybody is working in that context, then nothing said about State means they are just assuming it's all applying to Federal. Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able to put your finger on, is something that shows that my last statement is not right. 50  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9    I think in the -- it was -- it probably came out in governmental affairs in the Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time.
08-305 +++$+++     What about more than that?    Why not -- I mean, suppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute, which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the 32  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   to begin with, and they get something.  If they have -- 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 if they have a disability, this program pays them something, right.    What is that?    All right.  So in other words --    -- a parent who has a disabled child who never thinks about the public school system still gets some money, but not as much, for the disabled child? - Subject to Final Review    It's money to the school.    And so, it's money that goes to the school for a program?    All right.  Now, would it then work, what is -- would this system work under the 7               Now, if you put in -- put the child in a 8   public school, and they find a free appropriate public 9   education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do 10   it.  Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can, 11   you can send the child to a private school, but it 12   has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school 13 system. 14               Now, that's what you don't want the 15   interpretation to be?  You don't -- you are against 16   that.  But -- but let's amend it a little.    I am reading the language.

Let's look at this tax. 12   This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal 13   property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your 14   brief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on 15   mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and 16   various types of personal property defined under State 17   law as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery, 18   supplies and maintenance equipment. 19               They come back and they say, as to your 20   mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all 21   that's happening there is either you have exempted them 22   or they are fixed in place, and they are like real 23   property and that's what you are doing.  As to the other 24   things, you do not impose a tax on those other things. 25   Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things. 36  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 And it may be that you help the State do it by providing them with the assessment, and it may be even that you could do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships. Now I think I have that argument right.  If I do, what's the answer to it?    If I don't, what's the right argument? 10 11 12   described.  And it -- and section 29. - Subject to Final Review    May impose doesn't help if you don't do it.    State imposes it or --    And you write the check to    All the things you listed on page 11 --    The -- the oil and gas, motor vehicles, machinery, appliances, supplies, and maintenance equipment.  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    What about a porthole tax? 44 - Subject to Final Review 1   tonnage simply as a single crude measure.  But isn't it 2   fair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine 3   capacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the 4   tonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship, 5   for just the reason that Justice Scalia gave?  It 6   determines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and 7   what it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into 8   the value of the ship.  Isn't that true?

And the Florida statute, by 27  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 State. 12               What’s the constitutional justification for 13   making a person wait for 6 months before he gets a 14   neutral judicial official to say whether there was even 15   cause to take his car?

So we're never going 5   to have that one. 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 what a trustee does is they liquidate the asset, they generate the value that is there, and they distribute that value to creditors.    Why?  I mean, you sit down 17  4 5 6 7   work everything out, fine.  What's the problem? 8 9 10 11 12    The rule is -- and that's what it's about -- the rule is about where you object,  1   with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try 2   to work things out.  That meeting goes on as long as you 3   want.  And if it appears there’s an argument about ￼valuation, you file an objection.    If it appears everybody can 13   the trustee objects to the list.

But with all respect, 8   that is not what the statute and the rules say.  What 9   the statute and the rules say is if you have an 10   objection to the property claimed as exempt on the list 11   -- and as a historical matter over time, Schedule C has 12   required debtors to put additional information besides 13   their exemptions.    It says “the list.”  So that's where I think you're becoming awfully legalistic, to try to distinguish between the list and the property in A and B. I mean, what do you -- these are about     And when that happened, did trustees file objections within 30 days or didn't they?    He had been a bankruptcy judge, so maybe he knows.    Now, I don't know who knows, because I'm worried the government has looked into this, and somebody's telling them who knows it's the opposite.    Yes, but how did it work    You are certain?

I think we are reviewing a -- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard, and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn, but we would like to know what he charges when he asks for money from people who do not have this kind of supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different to ask him why. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23   You may have an answer to the question.  There may be a 24   perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.    Okay, so what's the problem then with saying that in the opinion?    Well, it's pretty unusual that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the case in front of us a case where it would be relevant.    The answer dispositive? Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the answers would be quite different.    All right.  So -- but you no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an 10   issue.  There might -- I mean, maybe there is some. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   there might be cases where it's so out of line.  And he 25   said the comparison would be to other mutual funds.  He 39 That's the only issue, whether this should be dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to take into account where relevant?    So you have no objection to send it back and say look, of course this is relevant, perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?    You object if we turn them upside down?    Well, I'm saying the tone, be a little careful here.

The 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   Constitution as later interpreted.  So if that's what 20   you discover on the collateral appeal, a similar Constitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore there is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy Clause, right?    All right.  So you're saying here, the evidence the first time was such that they couldn't give him the death penalty under the 21   reasoning would somehow lead you to the similar result. 22   Is that the argument?

08-674 +++$+++     It isn't in the case.    This is a case in which, as I think most cases where they approve contracts, what they're finding is that the contract rate in this circumstance, or here the settlement rate in this circumstance, is a just and reasonable rate, because. 10 11 12 13 14   All right?  So what are we supposed to do?  I mean, are 15   you going to say he's wrong, the lower court's wrong, 16   because they got the whole thing mixed up.

We actually 5   believe the court erred in announcing that rule.  It -- from the binding effect of the contract rates, do you?    But you would -- would you agree with my assumptions there?    That what this case is about -- and it's a fortiori from the ordinary contract case -- is that sometimes an agency, because of particular economic circumstances, concludes that a particular rate-setting system is a just and reasonable system, and once that's in place, then as part of that system is the rule you can only challenge it when it violates the public interest, for example. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18   discretion or it departs from the statute.  But if the 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 whole business is okay, that's the end of it.    Now, have I just said the correct law in your view or not?

So 9   we're supposed to say, if that were a Mobile-Sierra 10   contract, which it isn't, then we should decide whether 11   a third party could attack it, about which the 12   Commission has said nothing.  Is that right? 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   depends upon the other.  The validity depends upon the 22   other.  It's all part of a package. 23 24 25    What's the assumption?

You may think that.  But you 21   don't think it for yourselves, you don't think it for 22   somebody else, and here's some reasons why you don't 23   think it for us. 24               And if they agree with your reasons, they'll 25   say:  Fine, go ahead.

But I agree with all that 10 11   you are saying.  What I am saying my hard time is here 12   is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable 13   decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really 14   rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of 15   defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no 16   sympathy?    Well, he talked about  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               I thought he was trying to spend a lot of 2   time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial 3   remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert 4   because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them 5 enough. 6               And so you describe that for a couple of 7   pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he 8   talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked 9   about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, 10   is because he recognizes this is the most sensational 11   case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are 12   going to congratulate you. 13               But what you are doing here is you are 14   applying a standard, and you are proud to be an 15   American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane 16   standard that requires you to not give the death penalty 17   when the man's insane. 18               Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 19   9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over. 20   And how can I -- since there is a lower court that 21   seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say 22 it wasn't?

Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he would even number them. And it's fairly common to find a court of appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17, and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.    Now, that -- that happens all the time.    And, now, it's very, very common that, in making that argument, there could be some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be 35    What we do is we assume they did it for a bad reason?

You have to have all those  ￼1   nondisclosure? 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 me to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled because the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common law of what's important to tell either the public or a private employer? And I don't know how to define that issue of importance --    I thought materiality just has to do with whether a false statement you make, in fact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the harmful effect. 10 11 12   is -- 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   mean now.  In the cases you just mention, the bribe 21   case?  Right, the legislature is not going to gain.  The 22   legislator or the briber might, but somebody will. 23               And the object of those bribes was that 24   there would be economic gain, and that was what -- when 25   I went through all those MCNally cases, I thought I 50    That's always there.    No, and the -- and the reason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   could fit them into this alternative Altshuler thing, 2   but now, you -- you worry me that you have a different 3   test that will bring in like any failure to fill out a 4   disclosure form. 5               A deliberate failure to answer a box, one 6   out of 1,000, for every government employee, would 7   immediately -- 20 years in jail.
08-905 +++$+++    Is there no difference, then, between the two of you, or what?   Okay. So do you think -- you think the standard should be -- and I can find out from the government, and I will, I guess -- that it should be -- that you have to -- a reasonable person having talked to the guy in Burma would walk away thinking, Fraud. That's the standard; you think they’re both there -- 39  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 but both of you agree you have to find the guy in Burma, though it could turn out that other features of the case, 6 months earlier, would put a reasonable person on notice to begin looking for somebody in Burma?    So you both agree about that?     So -- so you want to say, you ought to get enough information from that or in all the other things the same, so that you have -- are able 19 20 21 22 23 24   not so worried about that.  I know there's a lot less, 25   but -- or more, whatever -- but I am --    No, I'm not saying -- I'm 40  
08-911 +++$+++     Exactly the same is true of 12   the substantive decision.  I mean, that has nothing to 13   do with it. 14 15   going.  I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of 16   this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am 17   trying on, and I'm sure there’s a lot wrong with it, 18   that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the 19   procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and 20   treat them the same way that they are treating the 21   substantive decisions.  So that in his case, he wins. 22   Because he gets review of the substance, he should get 23   review of a reopening.  It's the same thing.  And in 24   some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get 25   review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the 18 I want to know -- look, this is where I'm  1   reopening.  Both are the same thing.  They are just 2   filed at different times. 3               So that, to me, is the only reading of this 4   statute that I have yet found that made sense.  But 5   since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making 6   some huge mistake.  But that's what you can tell me. 7               (Laughter.)    Yes.    New things have happened; that's why he wants it reopened.    No, he's not, but his motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to     Something new came up. That's why he -- I think, isn't it true, often people want it reopened because something new came up?    Okay.    No, no.    Oh, I'm asking you, what possible sense could it make?  ￼10 11 12 13 14 15 16   he loses.  Something new comes up, and what does he 17   want?  Grace in respect of fraud in light of this new 18   fact.    Look, we're -- two issues. One is grace in respect to -- let's call it fraud, and 19               Now, my question would be:  What possible 20   sense does it make to say the courts cannot review the 21   first, but they could review the second?    Oh, by the way, this reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute. That's where I get to the problem. 1 2 3 4 5   whether it's done by regulation or done by statute.  And ￼6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context. Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or whether it's done by statute.    Do you want to say anything ￼about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I 6   discretion given by statute or given by regulation, and 7   we draw the line on reviewability there. 8               Now, what we're talking about is a big set 9   of cases, including frauds and various things where 10   there is some discretion substantively to let the person 11   stay.  Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says 12   if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review.  But if 13   it's asylum, we want review.  Isn't that how it works, 14   basically -- basically?    I didn't leave anyone out. No one is universal. (Laughter.)    How do we know they didn't? I mean, there’s such a thing in the law called -- what we think of often -- they often use the word "ancillary"   1   with it the application to ancillary matters, the thing 2   that are bound up in X, even though they don't have a 3   separate sentence because you can't think of everything 4   that describes every matter ancillary to X.  That's ￼5 6 7 8 9 normal in law.    Yes, and we would say those decisions specified includes those decisions that are 10 11   totally wrapped up in the same thing.  So that if a 12   person tries to escape this by simply making his main 13   argument in a rehearing petition, he can't escape it, 14   because it's really the same thing.    Exactly, and that's why I ended up with this unusual -- (Laughter.)
08-964 +++$+++     Well, if you leave something out, Congress can put it back in, tailoring 10   case where Congress would take something out. 11               Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess 12   the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we 13   won’t have -- you know -- since you referred to 14   Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what 15 you think. 16 17   circumstances.  One of them is in section 273, to 18   provide prior user rights for business methods.  Another    Okay.  Well then, if that 6  19 20 21 22 23 24 25 example, a corporation, a human being -- these are things that are not covered by the statutory categories.    Okay.  Fine.  Now, suppose I reject that view, hypothetically, and suppose I were to take the view that this is way too far, that that’s --    That's exactly what I -- maybe I can get you to inadvertently help by -- a 16   hypothesis you don't like.  That's why I say it's ￼ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 inadvertent. actually four things in the patent law which everyone You said there are two things.  There are  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   we don't work in a vacuum.  We work in a context.    Well, thank you.  I thought that was the issue, not the answer.    Suppose you say this.  I'm 16 17 18 19 20 21   They have pulled back.  That's a mood.  That's a mood. 22   They’ve pulled back insofar as they are pulling back 23   from business methods, not machines, dah, dah, dah, dah, 24   dah.  Okay?  You say we see no problem with that. 25               Now, they have left much unresolved.  One, 31 mean -- and Diehr has these words in it, similar words; it just says “e.g.” -- are you following me?    Okay.  Now, you say what is it they have done in this case in the Federal Circuit?  1   transformation; how broad or narrow is that?  We don't 2   know.  Many people's problems will be solved if it's  ￼3 4 5 6   machine by adding a computer on at the end?  They've 7   flagged that as a problem.  They haven't answered it. 8   Could there ever be a situation where it doesn't meet 9   this test but still is patentable?  We’re not sure. either broad on the one hand or narrow in the other. Two, are you automatically patented -- in the patent statute, if you just sort of reduce this to a 10 11 12 13   them. 14    Yes.    Do you see what I'm trying 15   to do?  I'm trying to note the things that have been 16   raised in these 80 briefs insofar as possible, say 17   there’s a lot there for the future that we can't really 18   decide, but say as a pull back, okay.    Okay.  Well, then what is  ￼right?    But then all we do is every example that I just gave, that I thought were examples that certainly wouldn’t be patented, you simply patent ￼6   that.  Now, it's a machine. 7               So all the business patents are all right 8   back in.  Now, that -- what I think we were looking 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 for was -- or at least I was -- was why that isn't so, and how you are going to later, down the road, deal with this situation of all you do is you get somebody who knows computers, and you turn every business patent into a setting of switches on a machine because there are no businesses that don't use those machines.
08-969 +++$+++     Well, that would mean the States have a new method, which I don't think they use, a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who makes two false statements or a false statement in two 27  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would 2   have vast repercussions.  I mean, it might be very 3   beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis; 4   but --    Or focused on.  It's come up but not focused on.    So in your view California --    -- which has a $10 billion deficit, could go through, find every instance where a corporation made two false statements in two tax returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're 10 11 12 13   owed. 14 - Subject to Final Review    It doesn't say systematic  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   what Congress intended.  If you look --    Oh, well, that cuts against    Because if they put in one, 10 11   your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need 12   that or not.  Your theory applies to every tax, every 13   tax. 14 15 16 17 18   question.    No, but go back to my  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   raised.  But the -- but the -- RICO has been 10   consistently interpreted by this Court in an 11   expansionist mode, and despite that Congress has not 12   truncated it except in the one area of securities 13   violation and only because they found that there were 14   ample remedies in securities law, and because they 15   thought it was inappropriate to use exclusively mail and 16   wire fraud.    Well, that's a pretty far-reaching --    Do you know anybody, any court that has ever said that?    So all of these would be 8   prosecute, State or Federal?  So normally it's State if 9   it's a State tax.  But it's one thing to say Congress 10   didn't care about that and quite another thing to say 11   that Congress didn't care if the States were going to 12   use this in order to collect three times what the taxes 13   are owed.  And so they're looking for a way to cut off 14   this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax -- 15   failure to pay your State taxes.  And that's why they've 16   hit on this idea of the antitrust.  I don't know if 17   that's a satisfactory idea.  I don't see the solution. 18 19 20 21   not allowed to sue was not because of the injury.  It 22   was not -- it was the directness of the injury.  This 23   Court pointed out the fact that there was the I think I see the problem.    Why is that relevant as far as cause is concerned?
08-970 +++$+++ 
08-974 +++$+++ 
08-992 +++$+++     So they are going to say, I  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   -- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of 2   the most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a 3   difference, it made no difference.    Now, next sentence, which 38    How would you fill in this  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   maybe would never be written:  This is not to say that 2   discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it 3   could be applied inconsistently. 4               Now, there could be another sentence, 5   because that other sentence would have to go on to the 6   fact that any discretionary rule will never be applied 7   with perfect consistency or anywhere near it.  That 8 9 10 12   any sentence we could put in there?  So you hedged on 13   there, and probably they will, too, because it's very 14   hard to find the right sentence. 15               You don't want the simple application of 16   discretion, you say -- which inevitably means some 17   inconsistency, to make a State rule inadequate.  On the 18   other hand, they can't go too far.  So what is too far?
08-998 +++$+++  
09-10245 +++$+++    Well, how could it not be? Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to apply the guideline? If he doesn't say that, isn't he applying the guideline?   Whether he gives the specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or whether he says, I have a special case and I depart under section 5 of the guidelines. Both of those are guideline sentences, aren't they?   How?   Give me an example.   What?   What he does is he applies the guideline sentence. He has to do that. Now, within that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he got the information. He says, I am satisfied it applies -- done. Now are we supposed to look further and say what his true reason is? Is that what you're saying?   You were -- you were just at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right? It was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July 2005 and we came out with Booker in -­   It's on the cusp. 7 - Subject to Final Review
09-1036 +++$+++ 
09-10876 +++$+++    But it's not just -­   It's not just chain of think the Chief Justice is trying to get at 19 Smith turns 20 21 make him go 22 wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the 23 following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he 24 can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing 25 about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone a lever on a machine to B. Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you into court; that's our case. And what I 12  - Subject to Final Review 1 said in the laboratory to another person, and those two 2 people aren't in court. Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, the intermediate step. I'd either like to wrong about that, you don't have to have 3 4 I think, of 5 be told I'm 6 them, or explain whatever you'd like.
09-1088 +++$+++    Well, then why isn't this a part of the thing, if you have a new claim here, go to the State first?
09-11121 +++$+++    But nothing in the majority conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding. I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again, so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test. But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no support.
09-11311 +++$+++    But looking at it - Subject to Final Review 1 just said that's my view of it. 2 The -- the -- so what do we do? I mean, I 3 can deal with a lot of other States, but Arizona has 4 exactly the same classification of felony when you use a 5 vehicle and when you use a vehicle creating a serious 6 risk of physical harm to others. It's in the same 7 provision, same statute, same category. How do we work 8 with that, in your opinion? 9 10 11 doing? You 12 and 46 other States?   Are you following what I'm understand the difference between Arizona 9 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 10 1 situations that involved physical risk because, as 2 everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's 3 probably very often the case that the defendant is 4 charged only under -- under category 1, where, you know, 5 if he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't 6 that so?   I can deal with it more easily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me now is what we're supposed to do is   So we're here trying to decide whether the (A) one does. - Subject to Final Review 11   know, and the reason I don't that offense language of (A) And the answer is I don't know is I don't know how is applied in Indiana.

09-11556 +++$+++    So that shouldn't be introduced into his trial for driving without a license.   All right. Now the question I had heard put was, suppose after they got this information, they don't arrest him then, but he gets into the car again and starts driving. You said then they could arrest him?   Is that right? Why? Why isn't -- why isn't that just as much the fruit of the poisonous tree? They found out he doesn't have a license by the record which came to them from an illegal stop. I just don't understand it. Did I get you right as to what you said?   So therefore they couldn't arrest him. So what they do is they -- is that right?   Because?   Because?   Well, what -- what is that 14 word, the "bad faith"? I take it your rule is identical ￼15 if when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the 16 records, the records say he has no license, and in 17 addition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 3 18 triple axe murders. Again, you can't do anything about 19 it? 20 21 22 do anything 23 24 25   What? How?   Why?   So if, in fact, a policeman stops a person without cause and learns as a result of that that there are many warrants outstanding against him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he introduce those warrants into court as evidence or whatever if it's relevant?   Suppose the way that the policeman stops the person and gets the information illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house, the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just think this case has lots of implications, and I'm looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of different situations.   Well, you say that if, in fact, he learns that this man from the public records is 18 - Subject to Final Review ￼ 1 a triple axe murderer -­ - Subject to Final Review   -- he can do nothing about 2 3 4 it, I said? 5 it. I just 6 7 again, just 8 warrant, is 9 the -- Davis. That's not something that would be 10 introduced in court. It's just a method for bringing 11 the defendant into court. And so in that case, they 12 would properly be allowed to arrest him. And if there 13 was -­   Yes, and I was testing that. I want to know   I mean, not an incorrect rule, the opposite rule. No rule.

09-1233 +++$+++    Now, there we are. More time; what's supposed to happen?   Yes, it was 2.31 or something like that.   And did they approve the 2.3 -- is that in place, 2.35? Did they approve that?   And is there any evidence here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the constitutional violation?   So I take it from your answer the answer is no, there is no evidence.   Well, what he says -- what the receiver says about the 2.35, that it is a significant step farther. It is certainly better than no construction at all. However, that is not equivalent to a conclusion that that current compromise will result in sustainable constitutional health care at current population density levels. That's what he said about it. So -- so we have his views, and I'm back to my question: What else 11  ￼ 1 is supposed to happen?   What specifically will happen? I mean, at the moment, you know, we could go through -- we have all these briefs. I mean, there are all these experts, all the reports. Everybody is saying 26  ￼  1 you need to spend the money. And we have -- if you 2 really want to cure the constitutional violation, we 3 have the legislature rejecting 8 billion but 2, which -­ 4 2.35, and so -- and nothing, and a void, and give us 5 more time. 6 I mean, I read the newspaper. It doesn't 7 seem to me California has been voting a lot of money for 8 new programs. The -- the -- what is it -- what is it 9 specifically that would happen that would cure this 10 problem were we to say -- I mean, a big human rights 11 problem -- what would we say -- what would happen if we 12 were to say, no, this panel's wrong? What would happen 13 that would cure the problem?   Preceding page, whatever I have it -- it was 253.   There are about six pages 15 16 17 that was -- 18 19 20 where they summarize evidence from all kinds of 21 criminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000 22 technical parole violators that are being sent to prison 23 who haven't committed additional crimes, and they could 24 perhaps be released from some of the time that they're 25 spending in prison. Then they go on to this good time, 57  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 which would, I guess, lead to people who are 50 years old or 60 years old who have been in prison for 40 years would be released at age 55 instead of age 75. I guess there's some category there.   Then they had several other things. Okay. Now, what are some facts about that?   Is there any likelihood -­   Is there any evidence on -- I -- I see their suggestions that the technical parole violators go elsewhere -­   -- that the elderly and infirm prisoners -­  ￼released.   The good time credits for older people would have effect, be increased, and also, halfway houses and other kinds of prison facilities which used to be called less -- less physically restrictive punishments, or taking the money you save and building new prisons. Okay, that seems to be the gamut. Is there any evidence, statistically or otherwise -- because it used to be that States did rely on halfway houses, that relied upon -- they relied upon certain camps -- prison camps -­   -- for example, and some of them were pretty tough. And there were a whole range of what used to be called intermediate punishments.   All right. Is there any statistical evidence on the part -- on the point that is -- that Justice Alito raised -­   -- as to whether these did or did not result in higher crime rates?

Is there something special about this, that Federal rules don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have, and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on appeal, it doesn't apply to him?

It wasn't anybody's fault. Why shouldn't we go back and say do it again, and now, let's -- since his case is still on appeal, it's the same question. What's the argument against doing that? Why can't we? I'm sure there's some rule out there that says we can't do this, but I want to know what it is because it seems fair.
09-150 +++$+++    What do you mean? How could it possibly be admissible? First, there has to be a degree of formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay tests. So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, it is not admissible.   Well, of course, there are exceptions. There could, in fact, there could be a co-conspirator exception. There could be a dying declaration exception.

So the answer is no, it's not the case that whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him questions, it's going to be admissible. It depends. The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon.   It would not apply? There are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule? And there are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?   I thought there were, in my copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

I’ll write them down and look at them later.    Where does it say that? Where does it say that on 19a?    I thought what the district court said was “impute” the knowledge.    Well, I -- I know.  I would say in reading this, that both courts have made the most elementary mistake of the English language in thinking that when a person doesn't know something but should have known it, that that’s inconsistent with a mistake. That's the very definition of a mistake.    Now, all I want is some citation from you that shows that isn't what they thought.   Well, that's the conclusion, and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have had constructive knowledge.

Isn't that true?    What possible reason is there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?    Is there such a reason?    And I’m just saying, did he  - Subject to Final Review 1   establish under regulations of the FMC financial 2   responsibility. 3               And those regulations tell you that, at 4   least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a 5   written designation of a person in the United States as 6   a legal agent for service of process, and they are 7   referring to instances in which somebody on a ship 8   suffered an accident. 9               So since you say that you are complying with 10   that, I would like to know the name and address of that 11   person in the United States for whom you must send legal 12   process, because if obviously that had been on the 13   ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff 14   would have sent the notice.

So if (o) you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is immediately appealable and must be appealed within 14 days because of that 3582.    And then you said (o) applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an 10   applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, 11   that restitution is made final and embodied in another 12   judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be 13 appealed. 14               So if you’re right about (o) applying, then 15   the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of 16   luck.

Normally, that's the 2   rule.  It's the scope of the arbitration agreement. 3   That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes 4   that's not the argument.  The argument could be:  Well, 5   there are four different provisions in the arbitration 6   section, and we think one of them is void because it's, 7   say, unconscionable, but the others are okay.  Now, that 8   one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough 9   say I want that one to go to arbitration. 10               And the third one is that you have a 11   contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on 12   four separate pieces of paper, and what you’re saying 13   is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe 14   unconscionability is the equivalent.  On that one I'm 15 with you. 16               I don't see how you can submit -- agree to 17   submit that to the arbitrator, because there’s no 18   agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid 19   one under State law. 20               But what are you arguing?  That this is that 21   case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that 22   middle case where you have 10 provisions and you’re 23   saying that this one over here is unconscionable but 24   that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid 25   arbitration agreement. I agree with that.  It's just that 33 ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   certain provisions of it are invalid because they’re 2   unfair.  What are you arguing in this case?    Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement 10   you’re arguing over the scope of different provisions 11   or whether certain provisions within it are valid or 12   invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if 13   it’s clear enough?

And it defines those as   And I -- and how -- how do you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear language which says what these standards refer to?   Yes, but it doesn't -- for example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and they cost you $48 extra.

What's the answer? 10 11 12 13 definition in the form.   No, I know, but it's for ownership; it's not for, for example, whistling. It's for ownership.

10-1001 +++$+++     I don't understand.  Could you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor asked?  She said:  What happens in Arizona?  You said a prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone through his first round of appeal.  He is given a form, which you said is a simple form:  Do you want to proceed 12   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7   lawyer. 8  in collateral review?  And he answers yes.  Then does Arizona appoint a lawyer or not?    Ah.  So, now you're talking 9   about the second round.  You're talking about does he  ￼ 1   appoint lawyers or not in these different States.  It 2   seems to me that has nothing to do with this case. 3               This case comes out of a State that does 4   appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your 5   client, should have from your point of view at least one 6   full, effective chance to say:  Every lawyer I have been 7   appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible. 8   And -- or whether the State can block that from being 9   heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and 10   the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even 11   raise.  That's the issue; is that it?    Okay.    Now let's start at ground  ￼ 1   arguing that.  What is the rule that you are arguing 2   for?  What limiting principle do you have so that we do 3   not have an endless right of counsel?    Well, in a sense it does, but he's never going to win the infinite continuum.

Maybe for 6.  ￼ 1   With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone 2   for 10.  You see? 3               And so, the comparison there -- and it will 4   work with whatever numbers you want.  The comparison 5   there is very different.  And the comparison doesn't -- 6   doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it 7   may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no 8   longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman. 9               We have three different rationales.  All of 10   them are related to a serious problem, which is the 11   problem of discrimination against women because the 12   employers think they'll be home more.  And so, you see 13   the conclusion I'm drawing?  Yes, okay.  So -- so, where 14 are we?    He was.    He was -- he's absolutely  right, and that's why this isn't a health spa thing, (D).

10-1018 +++$+++     What would have happened if Abraham Lincoln today were there?  And I gather what happened is they thought the local prosecutor is good, but Lincoln is better.  So, we'll let Lincoln prosecute this case. Now, in your view, Abraham Lincoln would not have had immunity, but the local prosecutor would have.    They did exactly the same thing, by the way; it was just that Lincoln had a better reputation.  Every word was the same.    But in your -- I'm asking you, in your opinion, when I write this opinion, is I could say not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a public prosecutor brought in for the occasion?  In your opinion, he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones, the local prosecutor, would have?    I'm just trying to get your 37  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Is it because it's Abraham Lincoln or --    But investigatory functions -- they don't get immunity.  So, if Lincoln had looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into this; I don't think we should prosecute.  And what they said was use your judgment.    Okay.  So, there are problems with both standards both ways.  This is one of the things that -- that is bothering me.    Imagine in this case the lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor and so forth, and they said -- not necessarily this event; they said we want to do X.  And the lawyer said: 38   ￼16   dilemma? 17    No, no, no.  What I'm assuming in the question is, since it's a close question, he has to worry about a court saying:  You were wrong in saying it was legal.  It was not legal. The matter was unclear, but it was not legal. At that point, he becomes subject to much 39  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 damages.  But, of course, the others do not, and he had to tell them go ahead with it.  You understand my point.    So, what is the answer?    Well, that may be, but what I'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules?  If we don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and you agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my hypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of rules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's too bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it, or something else.  That's why I want your answer.    I change it slightly, and he puts them up to it.    Because I don't know why he couldn't.  I mean, you know, he says go do it.  Or, in other words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead.

I have to read this about six times to get this one in my head.

If it isn't in the briefs, it -- maybe I'm off on a track here, but it seems to me a pretty obvious question.    I mean, we have a statute that looks like a kickback statute, and the reason it looks like a kickback statute is it refers both to the person giving and to the persons receiving, and it seems to make them equally liable. Now, you want to apply it to a situation where I don't think you want to hold consumers liable. 19  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 And so, I think you have to explain to me why this statute doesn't --   -- on your reading of it.    Oh, you mean it's all prosecutorial discretion?  In other words, if you happen to be a consumer you just have to rely on the goodwill of the prosecutor; is that the idea?    What more?    So, you would say -- is    Is this a fair statement in your view -- and we'll hear theirs on rebuttal -- that in respect to the 1992 regulation, there is a sentence which says, "A charge by a person for which ... nominal 41     Was comment received in respect to that?
10-1062 +++$+++     How can they bring an action?  I'd like some clarification here.  The Corps's regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit. 40   ￼ 1   I mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day 2   after getting this order, you'd run up against the reg, 3   which says we won't give you any after the fact -- we 4   won't even consider this matter, until any required 5   initial corrective measures are made. 6               And then, just to be safe, they say that no 7   permit application will be accepted unless the Corps 8   determines that concurrent processing of an 9   after-the-fact permit application is clearly 10   appropriate.  "Clearly." 11               So, I looked at those two things and said, 12   of course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers; 13   they're not going to accept it unless you have a very 14   unusual case.  So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong 15   about that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit 16   applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted.  Maybe 17   there are a lot.    Okay.

I mean, my point --    Assume with me the eighth versus quarter of an inch, which is the law of nature part, is not obvious.

When this ABC case was argued in front of the commission -- I have here about 30 briefs at least, maybe 40, and they are  12 ￼ 13 1   Because as it comes up here, we are -- whereas I thought 2   when we granted cert, quite honestly, that this was Fox 3   coming back, as I've read the brief it isn't at all. 4   This is a new case, nothing to do with what we decided 5   before.  This is the case of ABC, period.  And it is an 6   attack on the 2001 guidelines, not fleeting expletives. 7               And, therefore, I want to know, at least 8   satisfy myself, that this Fox -- this ABC case has gone 9   through ordinary procedures and, indeed, these arguments 10   have all been made in front of the commission and 11   they've been rejected.    And -- and we're worried about small stations that cannot censor people because    Yes.     And -- and why is that not -- I'm not saying -- taking this point of view, but I'm saying why isn't that just time, manner, and circumstance that puts you to very little trouble and allows everybody to see it and, therefore, is  41 ￼ 42    All right.    I see where you're going -- the question.    Which -- you haven't seen 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   right, just what you said?  And say this is an instance, you said, and you did, which I thank you.    And -- and my question, which I've been trying to get so you'd see very precisely what it is, is why don't I just say, if you're  43 ￼ 1   case by case, in which, for the reasons, then I quote 2   you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of 3   the guideline to this case.  In other words, what I'm 4   driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: 5   Does this case in front of us really call for the 6   earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in 7   the -- in the briefs? 8               And that's what I'm trying to figure out, 9   and that's why I am particularly worried about whether 10   or not this whole big argument here was presented to the 11   FCC about whether we have to reach that far.  Now do you 12   see where I was trying to get?    My law clerk found 17.    My law clerk found --    But your only conclusion from that is that they can't have any rule.    That their -- what is -- I looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're -- tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the rule ought to be.    Yes.  All right.    Yes.
10-1320 +++$+++     No.  They say to the judge, 11   acquittal for a State without the bitter.  So, the sweet 12   is an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to 13   reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next 14   thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and 15   that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first 16 system. 17               The bitter that most States take with that 18   is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree 19   on these things and they agree on a verdict of not 20   guilty, we're stuck with that. 21               Now, what Arkansas seems to want is a system 22   in which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater 23   charges before going to the less, but won't take the 24   consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree 25   that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.  ￼ 1 2 3 4   and an acquittal-first instruction.  They recognize the 5   difference between a partial verdict and a general
10-1399 +++$+++     That's right.    And the wage could have changed in those few weeks.    The first week he didn't get the notice.  Then the second week he did get the notice.  Which week does he calculate the payment on?  ￼    Then we can't -- we cannot read this thing "award" to mean award by the employer. We can't mean it to read "award" by the -- by the government, in your view.  We have to mean it to mean the time that he became entitled to some money.    Yes.    And the tough thing is saying, well, that that's an award.  That's what this case turns on.    And what you pointed to in the statute is you pointed to some situations which say we have situation 3 and 4, and they're not present here; but in situation 3 or 4, award does mean this.    All right.  That's --    You don't have another example of a -- of a situation where "award" did mean -- and so, you're saying there are some others where "award" doesn't mean, okay.  But --    -- is there anything -- what's the most analogous thing you can find anywhere where award has referred to the time a person became entitled to a thing, prior to the time anyone was -- became obliged to give him some money?    Even if that time first was the period for -- way for calculating the money? example --    910(h)(1).     No, no, don't do it again.
10-1472 +++$+++     I'm sure you'd like to win  ￼1 2 3 4 true. 5 on any subsection. (Laughter.)     Is there anything in the 35  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 history of the '78 statute which suggested that Congress didn't want these taxed?    That means you don't have to look at this.
10-1491 +++$+++     So -- so, why -- why  ￼ 23 1   then -- you want to answer in your brief and -- this 2   question, I find impossibly difficult, maybe highly 3   fact-dependent.  There is no United States Supreme Court 4   of the World.  There is no way of getting unified law on 5   the points of whether when we interpret a common law 6   Federal -- a system of Federal common law to decide 7   whether a corporation can be defendant in every – a 8   defendant in a certain kind of case.  Every other country 9   could do the same.  And there's no way of resolving it.  All 10   right? 11               So, I find that a difficult question.  I 12   don't know why that's in this case.  I would have 13   thought the question in this case is, can a private 14   actor be sued for certain violations of -- of 15   substantive criminal law?  The answer is "yes."  Okay? 16   Genocide, for example. 17               And then the question is -- a corporation is 18   a private actor, and is there any reason why, just like 19   any other private actor, a corporation couldn't be sued 20   for genocide?  And there the answer is I don't know, but 21   I'll find out when the other side argues.  You see? 22               (Laughter.)    You know?  I mean -- so -- so, why isn't that -- why are we going into -- I mean, you have good reason for doing it, and I want to hear 19   domestic tort law.  And it clearly can be.  It could be 20   at the time this statute was enacted, and it can be 21   today. 22 23 24 25
10-1542 +++$+++     You had an example in your brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was an example of status rather than intent.  The example  ￼ 1   that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is 2   where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you 3   can't get it if you were resettled in another country. 4   And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement 5   program.  And then that seemed like a status, a 6   residence.  Were you resettled in the other country or 7   were you not?  That's his status, and then that's 8   imputed to the child.
10-174 +++$+++  
10-179 +++$+++    Make it totally fair. Nobody is being treated unfairly. Structurally, it does injure the -- the prestige or something or the structure or the integrity of the Federal Government -- judiciary, Federal judiciary -- to allow the bankruptcy judge to  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 adjudicate a direct claim; why is a counterclaim different?
10-188 +++$+++    So what -- why -- imagine everything here is the same. That is, what I imagine happened here is that an individual wrote and asked for a FOIA request. Did Schindler Elevator file a certain kind of statement. And you say that's not a report. Now, imagine everything the same except the person who asks is called Joe Smith, fraud officer for the agency. Everything else is the same. Now is it a report?   All right.   That is exactly what happened here.   I'm just telling you the facts are just what I said.   Everything the same except 13 14 facts. The 15 16 17 he signs his name, "fraud officer."
10-209 +++$+++     Well, you --  first, there's nothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there?  I mean, the text of the Sixth Amendment talks about criminal prosecutions requiring the assistance of counsel for defense, period.    Okay.  So, there's nothing 10   haven't seen anything in any case which was other than 11   case specific.  That is, this issue hasn't been decided 12   before, not to my knowledge.  The language can be taken 13   out of those cases, as you've very properly done.  And 14   so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases. 15   Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself.  In 95 percent of 16   the cases, they do plead guilty.  And what's the problem 17   about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the 18   offer he gave before? 19               Well, I mean, I don't really see if there -- 20   and prejudice?  What if a person's been executed?  If he 21   had gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he 22   would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay? 23   That's my imaginary case.  I can think of one where 24   there's prejudice.  He's dead.  All right?  So, what's 25   the answer in my imaginary case, if it's not in the 19  ￼ 1   amendment, not in -- not a holding, et cetera?    Death.  Let's say death.    He shows that never did he ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and moved on vacation and never told him about the plea offer.  That's my hypothetical.    The lists are legion where 23  1   and I want to make sure that I get out my answer to your 2   capital hypothetical, because you don't look just at 3   whether the sentence that resulted was worse than the 4   sentence that could have resulted.  If that were the 5   case, Fretwell would have come out the other way. 6   That's death if -- with no objection made, life sentence 7   if the objection had been made.  So, it's not an 8   outcome -- it's not a narrow comparison of outcomes. 9   What you look at is how the sentence was produced.  Is 10   this defendant entitled, had this -- to a lesser 11 sentence?  ￼ 1   people don't get the sentence that they deserve because, 2   for example, the lawyer was inadequate.  I mean --
10-218 +++$+++     It's owned by the State. Oh, you mean the navigable -- I get mixed up in that.    Okay.  Now we have to define what's an extended strip.    The navigable ones are  23 ￼23 24 25 original jurisdiction, we appoint a master, it's worked out, and we review the master's report. We can't do that here because it's a case --  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   it's 5 feet of land or not.  What are we wrecking?    Okay.  So, how much are we wrecking if we just say, look, the bit that's nonnavigable is different from the bit that's navigable?    Period.  Doesn't matter if  24 ￼ 25 1   why didn't you go into, or why couldn't you go into, a 2   quiet title action in Federal court?    I mean, little creeks somewhere which you'd think, gee, those belong to the State, but turns out the feds own the land underneath the little creek; is that right?    Yes.    What case should I look at to see that it was really meant that that -- this -- see, start where Justice Scalia was and then say what Justice Kennedy just said --    -- and then thinking, well -- I'm thinking, well, Montello was a case that involved a different purpose, and now the later cases, although they quoted the language, it didn't have a  40 ￼ 1   role.  Am I right or not?    When you say "wreak havoc," do you mean to say that the States have leased those strips with the waterfalls which are impassable to hydroelectric companies, and the leases will have to be renegotiated or something like that? 10 11 12 13 14   leases on that.  I'm talking about things like public 15   access for fishing, for example.  The States have cited 16   the Steelheader case in Oregon.  And this is what's
10-224 +++$+++     Yes.    Suppose we agree with you about that.  We say, if I agree with you about that, there we are; you're supposed to pick up this animal which is on the slaughterhouse floor and kill it right away.  That seems to have to do with operations.  All the rest of these other 10 provisions are just variations on that theme, according to the Government, and we send it back for them to argue this out below.    Well, there are 10 other parts.  There are 10 other parts.
10-235 +++$+++    Is there a case like that? MR. ROTHFELD might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in a rough area is something that happens with a sudden stop: You run a risk of turning your leg. I agree with you about the snake. Is there any case about the snake?   Okay. So the furthest -­ the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and twists his ankle.   I don't know. Is that proximate cause or not? Maybe it isn't.   But there has been no such case, to your knowledge?   It is not foreseeable. - Subject to Final Review   You're just saying, it's all foreseeable, not foreseeable.
10-277 +++$+++    Is the -- is the common question of law or fact whether, given the training which central management knew -­   -- given the facts about what people say and how they behave, many of which central management knew, and given the results which central management knew or should have known, should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?   If that is a fair way to is that a question that every one of the women class shares in common?
10-290 +++$+++    No, no. The judge says 13 14 want you to 15 Jury: Yes. 16 17 these cases 18 impossible for judge to fashion at that level of 19 specificity the factual issues to be considered by the 20 jury. But more fundamentally, if you're getting into 21 that level of detail and addressing questions that the 22 Patent Office didn't even consider or certainly did not 23 have an opportunity to consider with the full array of 24 procedural advantages that litigation and discovery 25 offer, it just makes no sense to impose a heightened 17 ￼Now it's up to the judge.   I wanted your opinion on validity or a useful instruction for juries. MR. HUNGAR 10 couldn't have intended that in 1952 because it hadn't 11 yet created re-examination.
10-382 +++$+++    I would like to get an answer to my question.   My question, to go back to it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust accounts for a thousand tribes. - Subject to Final Review  of the Interior says to a lawyer: I fear there is kind of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe. There is no threat of litigation. As far as I can tell, the answer to this will have no implication for anything else in the government. Will you please look at it and give me a memo what to do? 16  And imagine that several of than $500,000 in cash. And one day the Secretary - Subject to Final Review 1 Now, why should that memo not be given to 2 the lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the 3 Union Trust 4 memo to the 5 6 First, as this Court recognized, starting back in 1912 7 in the Heckman case, and reiterated in the Candelaria 8 and Minnesota cases after that, is that the United Company you would give the lawyer -- the beneficiary?   -- in this very limited described, what harm would befall the
10-444 +++$+++     But, now, you've read these cases, and now we're right on what I think is the point, because we've both defined a possible constitutional right, but there's a practical problem.  All right? Now, the States and others have dealt with this on your side --    -- for the last 30 years. And, presumably, you, but not me, have read a lot more 10 11   cases. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  Now, have they developed -- as you look across those cases, are there some States or places that have developed reasonably tough standards in respect to what counts as ineffective assistance and in respect to whether it made a difference that would help to alleviate the concern that this would turn into a great mess?  Which it hasn't, apparently.
10-507 +++$+++     Well, why wouldn't they have been -- I mean, as I understand it, if a person of a certain set -- and it's the same set in both, virtually, the same set of people -- where they're injured on navigable waters or piers and docks and so forth, it's the Longshore Act.  And if you're on the platform, it's this Act, so far.  And the benefits are the same.    Okay.  So, the only thing that extending this does, I think he says, is imagine a person who worked on a platform goes to get some platform bits repaired miles from the sea.  Now, that person would not be covered by Longshore Act, would he?    Okay.  So, he's saying what point was there for Congress to do that?    No.  And he would be covered by this, if they're right, but not if Clement is  ￼ 1   workers' compensation schemes function, both at the time 2   that OCSLA was adopted and today, which is that the 3   coverage provides comprehensive benefits from the start 4   of the workday to the end of the workday.

10-568 +++$+++    The statute says "or advocate the passage of." So I guess that's speech.   And the -- I mean, the basic question is, again, do you agree with Justice Scalia's question, the import of it; or don't you?   If it doesn't apply, if voting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the law or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment; and if it is speech, then you get into some of the questions that were raised, is this too vague or is it not? So which is it?   -- which says -­   -- either it is speech or that's why we're asking the question, to get 9 your opinion -­ 8 not, and so   -- by the First Amendment?   No, I'm not asking for 20  in respect of voting is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 willing to do -­   I think his argument is -- -- that the Ethics Commission at least in upon the fact that he was the campaign 23 commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, 24 even in part, that an individual had a political 25 association with him previously. 50  - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 this Court, 4 5 happened to 6 If Mr. Carrigan -- Mr. Vasquez does two things, he's a 7 campaign manager, he's a -- he assists in development. 8 If Mr. Carrigan had had exactly the same relationship, 9 but had just been working with him on the development   It may be a new argument in I don't know.   Is that a new argument in as I've stated it to you?
10-577 +++$+++ 
10-637 +++$+++     How does that happen if -- let's imagine Smith is convicted of some kind of disorderly conduct, and he goes through the State courts and it's upheld.  And then at some time thereafter -- I leave vague how -- how much time.  Maybe it's a couple of months or something.  The Supreme Court says that particular kind of conduct is protected by the First Amendment.  So, now it falls within the exception for you can't criminalize this. Now, habeas is filed.  Smith files habeas. Well, how can he get that heard?  Because this particular provision says that unless it was clear at the time under, in your view, of the State statute -- the final State decision on the matter, he can't get into habeas.  Now, it wasn't clear.    He goes to State court under a collateral review.    Suppose there is no such --
10-680 +++$+++    I just gave you the    No, no, no. I'm taking you to a special room, and in this special room, I'm going to ask you questions for 20 minutes.   There's no other circumstance. That's it. Everything else is the same as here, except he added those words. Now what?   Not in custody.   He would have thought he 18 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 could leave after 20 minutes.   Okay.   What's the difference?

So, my grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls  ￼21 22 23 24 25    -- can't sue?    What is the -- I think --  ￼15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 example in the qui tam context, but to think of one right on point is a little hard, though I thought there must be some.    The what?    And you can do that?
10-779 +++$+++ 
10-788 +++$+++     Is it different from -- I mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking. I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand jury room, and then there is some evidence about what went on inside.  And I don't know when you're supposed to introduce what. So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that if you win, the rule about when you should use or when you still can use the testimony that's given in the grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when you can use the testimony of a witness at trial. See, I would have thought that immunity means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm wrong about that.  You sometimes can use it.  So, then I don't know when you can use it and when you can't. Maybe you know.  You've studied this case.  I admit I haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have. (Laughter.)    Yes.    Is the prosecutor immune? I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining witness is not when they get an arrest warrant.  Is the prosecutor immune when he is taking the step of getting an information or indictment?    He is immune?    All right.  So, this is equivalent to doing that.  That's a prosecutorial function.  The prosecution would be immune.    Of course, this isn't a prosecutor; this is a subordinate.  The person here is the defendant who is not the prosecutor --    No.    No.
10-844 +++$+++     Okay.  It says, "If the [NDA] holder" -- now that's -- that's Novo -- "holder of the approval" -- "the approval holder for the drug, a" -- I'm skipping words -- "a use of which is claimed 10 11 12 13   use that's claimed by the patent.  If you bring "a 14   patent infringement action against the [ANDA] applicant" 15   -- that's them -- "the [ANDA] applicant may assert a 16   counterclaim" -- which they want to do -- "seeking an 17   order requiring the holder to correct...the patent 18   information on the ground that the patent does not 19   claim...an approved method of using the drug." 20               So, I look at that with those words -- I've 21   skipped words.  I look at those words, and I say that's 22   what they're saying.  They're saying the use that -- 23   that your patent does not cover a portion of the set of 24   things described by your use.  And, therefore, they 25   would like to correct the description so that the is "a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus." So, that's the use that you're -- that's the  33 ￼ 1 2 3 4   those literal words.  And, of course, the purpose is 5   what we've been arguing about.  But just looking at the description no longer covers something that you do not have -- a use that you do not have a patent on. Now, that would seem to me to fit within 6 7 8 9   indication.  You quoted the indication, that is, a literal words, why doesn't it fit?    You know, I know that    If you're right that patent  37 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   It was -- it is a very narrow provision.  The FTC report 9   that's cited in the briefs identified eight cases in the 10   first 18 years of Hatch-Waxman that raised this problem 11   of improper listing, mostly due to successive 30-month 12   stays.  That was fixed in the counterclaim, and the that had lots and lots of additional patent information.    And this is about the most technical statute I ever read --    -- and -- and when I'm talking about patent information among (b) and (c), we have the Government telling us that that covers this. And why don't I just stop right there and say thank goodness I'm out of this case -- and I'm not out of it. (Laughter.)
10-875 +++$+++     Just following up on    -- I'm looking for what I'd call past practice, where there must be a lot --    -- that would shed some 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   are three people who incurred their own taxes.  One is 23   section -- section 12; one is section 13; and one is 24   individuals in section 11.  Is that right?    -- it talks about administrative expenses incurred by the estate.    And so, you're saying here  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5   literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes.  Now, 6   the bite would come up if it turned out, when they were 7   getting around to settle these things, that there isn't 8   enough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's -- 9   no, to pay fully domestic support obligations, wages, 10   and also Federal taxes. 11               Isn't that -- that's where it's going to 12   show up, because the question will be, do you have to 13   shave the Federal taxes because they're coming in to be 14   paid as an administrative expense priority which is 15   only there as number 2, I think, in light of number 1. 16   Or do you not shave them at all?  If they're liable 17   personally, there isn't any reduction in the amount of 18   the Federal Government -- if they're allowed because 19   it's one of the estate's expenses basically, using the 20   estate very, very loosely, then they would have to take 21   a reduction, too.  Am I right?  Are you following it?    At least that's my --    No.  The administrative expenses don't have to be paid in full if there isn't enough money for them too in unsecured claims for domestic support obligations, because administrative expenses is the second priority; it isn't the first.    Okay.    Yes.    They mean to treat the postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government instance where the business will continue, and, therefore, you have said in order to continue, you have to pay all your tax liability and all your administrative expenses.    Therefore, what difference does it make whether you do or whether you don't treat
10-879 +++$+++     Well, give me an example.    Does that have anything to do with this case, the removal, never further -- no further use of a bit of a locomotive?    No.  Okay.  Let's get to this case.    Oh, I didn't know anybody denied that, that the State could regulate the repair shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed require what equipment workers have to have.  I thought we're only talking about those rules of State law that would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of 20   ￼ 1   design in his locomotive.
10-895 +++$+++     But what are -- I mean, what are we arguing about?  It's a -- he should have filled in the blank and said there's a Speedy Trial Act issue, and he didn't.  The judge didn't.  He should have done it; he didn't.    So, now I am the court of appeals judge, I get this, and I say, oh, my God, he forgot to fill in the right number; I'll tell you what, I'll fill it in, and I'll sign my name.  Is that legal?    I'm a judge in the court of appeals.  I have the case here.  I say -- I say:  Oh, my God, I've read the appendix.  I don't always read appendices, but sometimes I do.  And I notice that there's blank here, and it's supposed to say Speedy Trial Act.  So, I get out my pen, and I say Speedy Trial Act, SB.  I sign it.  Okay?  Now, is everything okay?    All right.  So, what are we 28   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 arguing about?  Why not just say, look, this is like the Copyright Act registration requirement?    I mean, it's not jurisdictional in the sense that the court has to look through all these appendices itself to see that everything is perfect.  It's just something you should do.  And if you didn't do it, then in an appropriate case, the judge could do it himself or waive it or whatever makes sense in the circumstance.  What's wrong with that?    Well, suppose we say -- if they entered judgment without it, we will assume, nunc pro tunc, they did it.    What is the horrible thing about that?    You tell me.  This is a statute the purpose of which was to speed things up, 30   ￼ 1   which was to help courts of appeals by eliminating 2 dross --    Well, yes, you're giving the    I've just said the statute doesn't.  They can take the appeal, and they're not going to get anywhere because of this error of the lower court judge --    -- unless the court of appeals, having looked at the record a little bit, discovers that there is a substantial constitutional question, and they know what it is, and then they fill in the blanks.    And in the language -- it allows that, I believe, and the purpose would allow it, for, after all, the purpose is to be more efficient, not less efficient.  And I can't think of any harm that's done reading it that way. 43  nobody anything.  So -- so, why not, since the language permits it, do that?
10-930 +++$+++     Why would we, in this kind 21   of case, as opposed to, say, some other case, where a 22   witness is missing and it's crucial?  The district court 23   does have authority to grant stays.  And we haven't 24   said, but no longer than a year.  Why do we say, but if 25   they do it in a reasonable time? 22 20  ￼ 1               If they abuse their discretion, there is 2   mandamus, or there are other ways of controlling the 3   discretion.  Why are we suddenly here, in this case, 4   imposing a fixed number of days? 5               I mean, the reason, of course, that the 6   Psychological Association says 6 months to 9 months is 7   they have different studies.  In some places, it's 6 8   months; in some places, it's 9 months.  And -- and so 9   why are we picking a number out of a hat here, when we 10   don't elsewhere?
10-945 +++$+++    What helps me is to know what the category of things is that the jail in your opinion is going to have to look into the characteristics of this individual person, and when I look at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests.   And when I look at some of the cases, there's a long list, like violence, drugs, and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can just use a general -- the fact that he was arrested -­   -- for the thing. But there are other ones, minor ones, where you do. So, what's your rule on that?   Okay. Then the next question which we'll get -­   -- who is a minor offender and how do you administer that rule?   Unfortunately, I'm asking them, and it's the same question.   How do you want us to write this so that jail personnel all over the country -­   -- have to be able to follow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do.   You said before was 2 feet is too close, but 5 feet is okay. Are you sticking with that?   Yes.
10-948 +++$+++  
11-10189 +++$+++     Because I did not get that impression from the State Bar brief, but you are saying that is how it works? ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼5 6 7 8 9 appeals, will you please direct the trial court to have an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of trial counsel before you hear the appeal?    You go to the court of 1 2 3 4   appeals, and what do you say?  You say, court of    Is that yes or no?    Okay.  So you are just saying that they are all wrong about how Texas works, so I guess you -- you could refer to a case where that 22 23 24   got the transcript, months later, and they looked back, 25   and they said, oh, dear, there was something wrong with    Cooks vs. State.  And they ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼1   the trial performance.  So we go to the Federal 2   appeals -- the State appeals court, and we say, State 3   appeals court, please direct an evidentiary hearing. 4               And they directed an evidentiary hearing, 5   and they had an evidentiary hearing before the trial 6   judge -- really, what would have happened on State 7 habeas? 8 9    All right.  Now, I am puzzled about what I'm supposed to do because I would have thought that the standard's fairly easy, that this individual must always have one full and fair opportunity to present his claim of inadequate assistance at trial. There are certain things that could deprive 21   incompetent.  Or the State, at a certain stage, didn't 22   give him enough proceeding.  All right? 23               Well, what do I do, where people are 24   disagreeing about how the State procedure works, as to 25   whether it was full and fair?  What do I do?  What is Page 30 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 31 1 your suggestion? 2 By the way, if he doesn't get the full and 3 fair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge 4 that he has a substantial claim, that that trial was 5 not -- so what do you suggest?    But -- but don't say never. All right.  So one thing we got --    They are not saying never. 10 11   They are just saying it works so much better.  What they 12   say is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time, 13   it's easier to develop it.  Please.  We won't say never. 14   We'll just say hardly ever. 15               Now, what's -- what is the -- what is your 16   view about whether that person has had a full and fair 17   opportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance 18   claim in the State courts.    What is the standard you are advocating?    Yes, the dissent said that. (Laughter.)
11-1025 +++$+++     And then, the Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary 43  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Is there a way of resolving it?  That is, is it open to the government, if you prevail, and we say, you know, they have this extra broad authority, there is no way to check it through a court, it does cause harm, these are the most likely people to be harmed and there is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to think it will be used for them, that the government -- is there some way the government could say, in camera even, no, we are not doing it?  Here are our procedures. We are not going to show them to anybody but you, judge. I mean, is there a way for the government to show that you're wrong --    -- and that we're wrong when we think you're right?    What?
11-10362 +++$+++ 
11-1059 +++$+++     No, no, no.  Do you see what I'm driving at? In other words, if Congress had explicitly said, in 216(b), that the Third Circuit's procedure is the correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his case in such circumstances, if they had said that explicitly, is there a constitutional objection?  If so, what could it be?    Now, I could find nothing the other way, so I thought of the canon of interpretation that equity deems to have been done what ought to have been done -- or something like that. Others on the Court will know -- but the -- the point is that there are instances --    What?  Yes. It remained on the docket in the Westminster courts, even though there was no plaintiff. So I would ask you again:  Is there any 25   ￼ 1   counterexample?  Is there any instance from equity or 2   elsewhere, where there is a constitutional objection, 3   had they said it, at which point our question is have 4   they said it?    Well, why?  Why?    Because that's -- why? Why, is my question?
11-1085 +++$+++     All right.  So you're saying, in this kind of case, the -- the materiality or not is not likely to be specially sufficient -- specially significant.  In fact, you are going to decide if it is a common issue, and there is no reason to import that common issue into the preliminary finding, even if what I just parroted, we hope, is true.    -- that is something special to get into this theory.    The publicity of the matter, that is not traditionally a common element of the tort.  That is something special to get into this    With materiality, it is a common element of the tort always; it is traditionally there; it will be litigated, so there is no special reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at the outset.
11-1118 +++$+++  
11-1160 +++$+++    That -- that's where I am, and I -- I'm not at all decided.   Yes, I think I know that.   You are not understanding my question, I guess. You have to take as a given that, even though what you say is true, I would find that this 14  ￼  1 statute clearly prohibits the application of the 2 antitrust laws to pricing decisions. That's the job of 3 the authority. 4 Now, if I start with that, then you will 5 say, okay, I have to decide against you. Or you might 6 say, even so, I win because mergers are different. Now, 7 that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.   -- and yet, probably would purposes of the statute by lowering the   Do you think that's the 15   1 null set? I -- I don't think that's --   What does the words mean, "to form and operate one or more major networks of hospitals"?   Which follow -- which follow the words "to acquire and operate projects, defined to include hospitals." So -- so what about those words? Why aren't they good enough?   I'm looking at Section 30 -- well, where are we? 31-7-75(3).   And this falls within the words "to acquire and operate projects"?   And --   And can't -- in other words, the -- the two hospitals in the town, when they say, the price here -- you shall see that the price is not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please get together and be certain that you have similar terms and you have similar agreements and similar prices there, we don't want either of you to be higher, that -- you would then proceed against them for that?   And would you also do the same if -- if the electricity regulator in any State or telephone -- a local telephone regulator --   How is that?
11-1175 +++$+++     It doesn't -- where does it say that? Where was the --    But it isn't quite as good a point, as you seem to suggest.  That is, it's a not so low value and the costs are not so high --    -- in order to make it.   So she says if I -- if I you tease your sister, I'm going to give her your allowance and her allowance, that 10 that doesn't mean that the sister loses her allowance if 11 you don't tease her. 12 I mean, there are a lot of instances --
11-1221 +++$+++     Is that right?    I mean, that's what we have to make up in order to --    Is there anything else?    Well, maybe we should say, look, this is a statute that is absolute.  There is no interest.  All this does is run around, without being too pejorative, it runs around the earlier cases, which is your basic point.  It's absolute.
11-1231 +++$+++ 
11-1274 +++$+++    Does it apply to Social Security? Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?   Does this statute apply to Social Security?   Does it apply to Veterans Affairs? Yes or no or you don't know?

Veterans Affairs we don't know, antitrust we don't know. Okay.   Medicare, Medicaid?
11-1285 +++$+++ 
11-1327 +++$+++     Now, you're beginning to make distinctions.    And once you make those distinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which was there is a distinction.  The distinction is whether it's a procedural ground or -- and Justice Harlan's -- 36  ￼ 1   it's whether there was -- "Just talk to the U.S. 2   attorney, I didn't like it," or "Talk to the witness," 3   or "The prosecution brought too late." 4               The other side of it, where the clause 5   attaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis, 6   not enough evidence.  I said -- I don't want to repeat 7   myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a 8   simple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases, 9   and why shouldn't we follow it?
11-1347 +++$+++     Am I right or wrong?  I want to know if I'm right or wrong.    They would? 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Well, thank you for Justice Ginsburg's answer.  She is quite helpful. (Laughter.)    I was there, but I didn't understand it as fully, and now, I do.    Unless there is some accommodation here, what worries me is this:  If you win this case, it's not going to be better.  Maybe for your client, it will be, but for others in your position, it's not going to be better. And what's worrying me, to put it on the table, so you can respond, is that, in similar 38   ￼ 1   situations, district judges will think this child 2   belongs in England; this child belongs in France; this 3   child belongs in China, wherever they belong.  But in 4   the back of their mind will be the possibility that they 5   are wrong, and they know there is a right to appeal. 6               And so instead of being able in these 7   border cases -- borderline cases, instead of being able 8   to send the child back home, they will think, I've got 9   to keep the child here, so that the other party has the 10   right to appeal.  Now, it seems to me, in general, that 11   would be bad for the child.  It would be -- and it's bad 12   for our system. 13               And it would be better to work out a system 14   that you can send the child back, and then if you're 15   reversed on appeal, it does matter to the other 16   country's courts.
11-1351 +++$+++     Yes.    Well, then you win, as long as I find it confusing. (Laughter.)    And if -- and you say, ah, but it says, "for purposes of this section."  Okay.  I look at "for purposes of this section," and the purposes of this section -- the very first whole sentence has to do with 1089.  It has to do with the scope.  It has to do with the general waiver.    From what?    I mean, what was the theory of it?  I mean, here it's just -- it's a person, he's at work, he does happen to work for the Federal government, instead of working for someone else --    -- and everybody else, you have to respond, and you -- if liable, you'd have to pay damages for the battery.  Now, where -- where did the immunity come from --    -- if the Federal employee did it?
11-139 +++$+++ 
11-1425 +++$+++ 
11-1447 +++$+++     Of course, you can.  In fact, there is too much coal.  That's an     The -- the -- but -- but in  ￼ 1   framework.  I assume that in your favor.  I assume 2   whether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but 3   they haven't quite, or maybe they have -- it means 4 nothing. 5               Now, having assumed that, it seems to me 6   what your argument is, is that this is a form of 7   regulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking 8   about.  And that -- that's what was going on in -- in 9   Penn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went 10   too far or whatever.  The lower courts could do that.  I 11   got that part. 12               Now, I want you to answer the question, 13   which is, am I right?  Is there another part -- a 14   different part to this case, called the Nollan/Dolan 15   part and explain that to me.  That's why I asked the 16   question.  I want to hear what you're going to say.    Okay.  So, if I'm right about the framework, that takes care of all the 
11-1450 +++$+++ 
11-1518 +++$+++     But I didn't think there's here in which admissing -- mistake of law, 20 21 it negative 22 23 of the law, 24 what you're 25 it comes into the question A, if you didn't have it; and Is that right?  Where does it, where does the intent in respect to what happened?    Oh, yes.  Wait, wait.  You say -- you mean either, both?  I mean, there is no doubt here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned. It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional.  So you don't have to worry about that one. Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd like to hear your answer to.  I thought it might have come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take it, that there has to be an element in which the person not only knows what he has done, but that he does it with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and then fill in the blanks, or?    All right.  Then if that's 25  ￼ 1 your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy 2 said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement 3 and larceny are set off. These two concern fraud and 4 defalcation in respect to the trust. There is a case of 5 this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust 6 requires an element of moral turpitude. 7 That suggests a knowledge that what you are 8 doing violates the law. And if we read in pari materia, 9 we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed 10 more so. Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in 11 respect to embezzlement, which is outside the 12 parenthesis. 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Why?  Defalcation on your definition would seem to be more likely to be thought innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances than would fraud.    No.  It may mean, for example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was you took some money that belonged to the trust given by 26  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 your father to help your mother.  And your mother says, help me, and the brothers and sisters will benefit well too.  And so you go to your insurance guy and he says, sure, no problem.  And then, lo and behold, they did it. I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct was as described. (Laughter.)    Is it -- before we leave this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a picture of they're being innocent.  But we are in a court that this Court has described as a court of equity or akin thereto.    One principle I used to learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, but not anybody else. Now, we have two lower courts that are saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least they don't understand it.  That this, the other client has tried to get him to sell the property, but they write the properties are abandoned and uninsurable. Even though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't sell it. And so do you have clean hands?  Not you yourself.  You didn't take the money and you do not have dirty hands, all right? But did your client here, hands because two courts have said he sold his collateral and he would have and saved everybody a lot of trouble? does he lack clean should have just gotten the money     Because? 31  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 could? 7     Did we remand it so they 9 into -- into evidence at the bankruptcy court and he did 10 not. There are facts outside the record as there are on 11 both sides with regard to this issue, why the trust 12 would not allow subsequent sales. 13 But it does go back to an important point, 14 and that's that the Petitioner did have, and retains 15 today, an opportunity to go back to State court and seek 16 a reduction in this judgment should he so desire. 17 A reduction in the judgment would reduce the 18 debt, and if there is no debt, then there is nothing for 19 the trust to collect subsequent to this discharge or 20 subsequent to the lack of discharge, as Respondent is 23 24 25
11-1545 +++$+++     I mean, that's such a simple -- I mean, that's Louis Jaffe.  That -- that's the founders of administrative law.  That's everybody until we get into a straightjacket.  And it isn't -- even Chevron doesn't go against us, if you don't think of it as a straightjacket.    You don't have to -- I'm sorry I brought this up. (Laughter.)    Okay.  Now --    Right.  And so I agree with you, this flows a fortiori from the majority. But I didn't think -- and this is what I wonder -- is -- you say unelected Federal bureaucrats. Administrative law is about Federal administration. That is Federal administrative law. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   added?    What was added?  What was  ￼ 1   meaning of the language "reasonable time," to give it 2   more precise content, to allow -- to deal with the 3   failure to act situation --

There are things you have to 8   acknowledge in writing.  It's a very complicated 9   subject.  And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to 10   read it the way you want.  But I want you to reply to 11   that.    Where is that sentence?    Is it the bottom of the    It says, "Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking intestate property as a child or a parent shall be deemed such."    So?

Okay.    The obvious practical thing   -- is that -- that, you 25 know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't 24  42 ￼ 1   even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could 2   do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my 3   child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he 4   fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception 5   for being acknowledged?    Okay.  What I'm actually worried about and want you to address is I just -- if we were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned about is many different applicants coming back later. about that one?    Does it?  It doesn't say  43 ￼ 44 1   That's what State intestacy is concerned about.  And you 2   don't really know who their parents is.  Another thing 3   is there are already children who are eating up all of 4   the money.  And then some new person shows up, and you 5   have to take the money away from the other children in 6   order to give it to this new child.  And all the time, 7 8 9 11   us to sort of -- applying this old law to new 12   technology, just overlook those complications.
11-161 +++$+++    Why can the State, when they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to give them back their money, on your theory? That's my simple question.   Why aren't they?   Okay. Fine. They define here who is similarly situated, and the people who aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.   This is where we're drawing the State law.   What's wrong with that?   Oh, I see the -­   Oddly enough, I was not suggesting that. (Laughter.)   It's not their rationale, perfect?   What?   The argument isn't that it's expensive to administer as much as it is there are 1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid up. We don't have enough money to pay them all back. That's why we don't want to pay them back. At the same time, we don't want to collect the money for 30 years from these other people who aren't fully paid yet.   The question, I guess, is, is that rational?
11-166 +++$+++    So why not? And you can read it. You don't have to read it the way that -- that you want. You could read it the opposite way, too.   No, I'm looking at it from the perspective of a bankruptcy system --   -- that is trying to get secured creditors what they have their security in, while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able to stretch out his payments.    Good.   You know, but the concern was -- I gather there is no other bidder, you have said.  You've just found the stalking horse.  You agree to pay the stalking horse a million and a half dollars, in case he doesn't get it.  And then the people from the inside are being hired by the stalking horse, if he wins.    Now, I'm not -- I'm sure they are acting very honestly.  But you would have to say, in such a situation, that there is an incentive to try to value everything on the low side by the debtor to 23  ￼  1 make sure that stalking horse gets the property. And 2 that incentive is destroyed -- or at least doesn't work, 3 if you allow the creditor bid.
11-182 +++$+++     Well, let's -- let me just go back because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the question, I think, others are asking.  And one way to focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement.  ￼ 1   problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the 2   policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE, 3   cannot detain the person for longer than he would have 4   done in the absence of this provision. 5               Now, in your view, is there any preemption 6   exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument 7   against that sentence as I have just interpreted it?  I 8   don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm 9 asking. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    And if so, what?    Look, in the Federal  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 happened anyway, all that happens is the person -- the policeman makes a phone call.  Now, that's what I'm trying to get at. If that were the situation, and we said it had to be the situation, then what in the Federal statute would that conflict with, where we have two provisions that say any policeman can call?    What's the -- that's -- that's where I'm trying to push you.    Because, in my mind, I'm not clear what your answer is to that.
11-184 +++$+++  
11-192 +++$+++     This case is about you want to go to -- you want to go the Federal Circuit, they want you to go to the Seventh Circuit?    Okay.    Not in tort.  This seems an 34  ￼7 right? 8  1   awful lot like a tort, or tell me why it isn't.  I mean, 2   what you are saying is there's a statute that says you 3   can't print more than the last five digits of a card or 4   the date, the expiration date, and they did both and you 5   want to say "or" means one or the other, it doesn't mean 6   and/or.  That's what the case is about fundamentally, 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16    Yes, can you do and/or or or.  All right, got it.  Now, if you print -- in your view of it, they printed too much about a person's credit card.    It sounds like an -- sort of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a 17 tort.    Well, I mean, the -- a lot of these provisions are technical, like the one I think is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the Government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble damages, does it?    Minimum damage, punitive damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations compared to the court of claims.    2 years.  And they have 6 in the other?    Right.  So is -- are you 49  ￼ 1   also saying, FCRA, the underlying statute, clearly 2   waives sovereign immunity, so we don't have to worry 3   about whether the standard is a weak standard or a tough 4   standard, doesn't matter.  We win anyway.
11-199 +++$+++     -- where the particular piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's the kind of thing that could really make a difference. I mean, they were in tears, et cetera. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22   difference?  Could it have made a difference in this 23   case?  Could it have?  And the answer is going to be 24   "no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not 25   have thought it made a critical difference.    All right.  Now, in my reading of this, which I once had to read about 100 harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question, could this illegally admitted evidence make a  ￼ 1               And that's just putting the same thing I 2   think slightly differently.  But the answer in 3   Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going 4   to think it has nothing to do with rationality.  If the 5   jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close 6   case.  And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a 7   difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless. 8               And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't 9   have made a difference to any rational person, he's 10   going to say "harmless."  Period. 11               Now, that was my impression reading those 12   cases.  And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting 13   at that.  And -- use them.  Answer them rather than me, 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21   harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  But even in those 22   cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as 23   a whole and says that there was so much evidence before 24   this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that 25   a rational jury would have gotten to the same result, because that's what I'm interested in. (Laughter.)

But why shouldn't I try to get there? 12 13 14 15 16   one general and one specific to detailers.  The general    No, we don't.  All right.    That's --    The --    Are they paid commissions? If they're -- if the salesman or the promotion agent, as the case may be, is successful in his territory in getting doctors to prescribe the drug, does he receive extra pay?    What does that mean?  Does he -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it says is a person who often obtains a commission on his    And now what I'm trying to figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask the question -- are these people, people who in some sense or other receive commissions on their sales?

And we can blame it 3     in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary. 4     There is blame to go around.  So, the question is, what 5     do I do as a judge? 6                 And partly my instinct is get somebody to 7     decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of 8     Labor, because this is a hard question.  And that's 9     where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he 10     says all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what 11     case do we cite? 12                 And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer. 13     I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them 14     with care.  And then I have the statute here, which 15     talks about the Secretary doing the definition of 16     "outside salesman," and I have lots of rules and 17     regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in 18     my opinion.

Well, how does it work in the law now, where we have similar statutes, and there's an additional requirement when you're imitating, say, a Federal officer or somebody else you shouldn't, you have to perform an overt act that asserts authority that the impersonator claims to have.  What does that add? Do you have to -- does it add enough to just make it not pure speech, to limit -- to wall off the things about -- the things that we're worried about in the First Amendment? Or there's another one, you have to falsely assume or exercise powers, duties, and privileges.  Those are ways statutes have of limiting this thing.  How does that work?

11-393 +++$+++     But what he's thinking --    What he's thinking of is 25   this:  I think Justice Scalia is thinking, I suspect, of  ￼ 1   -- imagine a tax which says this tax, amount Y, goes to 2   purpose X, which will pay for half of purpose X.  The 3   other half will come from the exchanges somehow.  That 4   second half is unconstitutional.  Purpose X can't 5   possibly be carried out now with only half the money. 6               Does the government just sit there 7   collecting half the money forever because nobody can 8   ever challenge it?  You see, there -- if it were 9   inextricably connected, is it enough to say, well, we 10   won't consider that because maybe somebody else could 11   bring that case and then there is no one else? 12               I mean, is that --
11-460 +++$+++     And if they did hold what you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two 30  ￼ 1 cases.    It's that issue that what we have to decide.    Sometimes, the Court says the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but it just says, "Reversed."    But the question -- the 32   ￼ 1     question is when do we do the one or the other, and I 2     think, here, what they're saying is, just write the word 3     "Reversed," we'll deal with the rest of it.  All right. 4 So that's --
11-465 +++$+++     The remaining 14 lines do consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say they didn't consider the Federal issue?    No, they didn't quote -- Nesler doesn't.  What they did in Nesler is quote a Federal case.  And what they do here is not just say Nesler, they quote the Federal case.    Well, maybe it doesn't. Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly state what Federal law is.  Everybody has some concerns 37   ￼ 1   about that one. 2               But what I don't see is how when they spend 3   14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they 4   believe sets the standard for impartiality and 5   partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the 6   Federal issue.
11-551 +++$+++    But the contract doesn't That's Ferris. I thought that the -- the real world is, in 23 mention it. 24 25 contracting, you typically have both a statute that says 16  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   -- and in the contract, it says, "subject to appropriation," putting the contracting party on notice.   So which were you answering?   The words in the contract are "subject to appropriations."   Yes.   Okay. So in that world -- now we get to the question -- in that world, what happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be 17  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay some?
11-556 +++$+++     Have you --    They have, or they have    Well, you've looked this up.  And apparently, for about a dozen years, the EEOC has had, as -- as an alternative basis for qualifying as a supervisor, the individual has authority to direct the employee's daily work activities. And in addition, we have three circuits that for some period of years have been following roughly the same kind of rule. Now, has this problem of the country music or the other problems raised, have they turned out to be a significant problem in those circuits or for the EEOC?
11-564 +++$+++     You're assuming the 10   that? 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 conclusion in these things.  I mean, I thought since Katz the rule has been whether the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy in -- which is infringed or violated or interfered with when the government acts.  So it's a question of does he have that reasonable expectation.  So now we're back to exactly where we were.  Your opponents say, no, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy --    -- to protect a person with a dog coming up to the door and going (indicating), all right?  Now, your response to that is what? 38   ￼    I'll look at this later, but I'm rather surprised.  My understanding of the case law was the Chief Justice's, and I thought what you're supposed to look at is the behavior of the individual, the police officer, who comes to the door or looks into the house, not his subjective motive. Now, as we just heard, you said, and with support here, that Jones changed that, but I don't know what in Jones changed that.  Jones was the case where the police did in fact go to a person's car and physically put something in it.  That's -- something that tracked.  That's behavior.    So what is it in Jones that said what we're supposed to look at is not behavior, but the subjective intent of the officer?    I mean, it may be a search. I see that.
11-597 +++$+++     Well, but that's the issue.    What does it say?    Yes, but they made this --    Yes.    All right.  So -- well, that's the part -- that's the point.  The reason they don't compensate there is it apparently had something to do with everybody suffering the cinders.  But where the cinders went out of the train and they ended up on just one person's property because there were some pipes or something, then it was a taking.
11-626 +++$+++     This cup.  What about the    Oh, well, this is lighter than you think.    But it wasn't carrying    Well, that's true.  And of course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or something that is on top.  But when you have a thing that carries itself, that isn't good enough. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25   house.    It has to be something to do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.    That's what part of the 37  ￼
11-697 +++$+++     But you don't have to say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured directly and received an American copyright and satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the conditions of the American statute, even though, for technical reasons, it didn't apply.    That's what your argument is, I take it.    So we are off on a kind of curly cue here.    I take it that the reason they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because 13   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage of the First Sale Doctrine.    He's in the middle of printing it.  And therefore you have to change the language.  So they changed the language to "lawfully made under this title."    Am I right; or, if I am wrong, why did they change it?    I couldn't find a word.  I could not find a word of that in the legislative history.  Irwin Karp, who was the strongest representative for the publishers, said you couldn't do that ten years earlier. So is there --    No, but you just said yes in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.  So she'll find exactly what there is there, so I would like to know what it is.    Your -- 602(a) has plenty of meaning.  I mean, an American copyright holder licenses a British company to publish the work under British copyright law.  602(a) says he can't import the books into the United States, period.    No, no exception I take it once I bring back five copies and I give one to my son.     Oh, fair use.    The reason -- what I was trying to bring up and I didn't do it artfully --    -- is, imagine Toyota, all right?  Millions sold in the United States.  They have copyrighted sound systems.  They have copyrighted GPS systems.  When people buy them in America, they think they're going to be able to resell them. Now, under your reading -- now, this is one of their horribles, I gather, and I want to know your answer to it.  Under their reading, the millions of Americans who buy Toyotas could not resell them without 28   ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 getting the permission of the copyright holder of every item in that car which is copyrighted.    Is that right?    Am I right or am I wrong? Am I off base or am I wrong -- am I right?    Well, how do you distinguish?  How do you distinguish?    Now, explain to me, because there are horribles if I summarize them, millions and millions of dollars' worth of items with copyrighted indications of some kind in them that we import every year; libraries with three hundred million books bought from foreign publishers that they might sell, resell, or use; museums that buy Picassos that now, under our last case, receive American protection as soon as that 29   ￼1   Picasso comes to the United States, and they can't 2   display it without getting permission from the five 3   heirs who are disputing ownership of the Picasso 4   copyrights. 5 6 7 8 bear. 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 So I'm asking you to spend some time telling me why I'm wrong.  Those are some of the horribles that they sketch.  And if I am looking for the bear in the mouse hole, I look at those horribles, and there I see that    But we need to --    The main point is that horribles haven't occurred.  Right?    Sometimes horribles don't occur because no one can believe it. Now, for example, I believe there is going to be a storm, but it hasn't started yet. So I would like to know -- I would like to know, if you were the lawyer for the Toyota distributor, and if you were the lawyer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or you are the lawyer for a university library, and your client comes to you and says, my God, I just read the Supreme Court opinion.  It says that we can't start selling these old books or -- or lending them or putting them in our word processor or reselling the 36   ￼ 1   Toyota without the -- without looking -- displaying the 2   Picasso without the permission of the copyright holder, 3   who may or may not be Toyota itself. 4               What, as their lawyer, do you tell them?  Do 5   you tell them, hey, no problem; or, do you tell them, 6   you might become a law violator; or, do you tell them, I 7   better litigate this?  What do you tell them?

And by way of guidance on that, what I would --    Yes, I read -- I read -- I read the opinion and what she said on the phone and so 41  ￼ 1 forth.    Then he goes on to say just what Justice Scalia says. And I -- I did read that as saying, well, when you apply -- I read it consistent what they've said in -- elsewhere, which is that what they're doing is population grows; you have to have one person, one vote; 53  ￼ 1   the legislature itself in the new plan did create a 2   minority, whatever you -- the opportunity district here; 3   so, we're following what they did; we're taking into 4   account population, and it turns out to be, and we do 5   create it as -- in which case there is some ambiguity 6 here.
11-770 +++$+++     If -- if the police executing the valid search warrant walked through the gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the house had not yet passed through the gate, then under Summers the police would have the right to detain him. All right.  So the question here is he's walked through the gate.  All right.  Now, I guess the 37  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7   right. 8  not want to push him back.  I don't know what the neighborhood is like and maybe somebody will get killed. I mean, that's the kind of argument --    I know you'd say that was 10   gate for Fourth Amendment purposes.  When he steps 11   through the gate, he's just as much of a flight risk, a 12   danger to officers and just as able to assist in the 13   orderly completion of a search.
11-796 +++$+++     And some of the self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end up inadvertently all over the place.  Is there anything in the patent law that deals with that?  Is an involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law as a voluntary infringer?    Is -- is there precautions that you take?  I mean, is there anything in patent law that helps?    Right.    Well, the person plants it. 44   ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 law. 12 13   example, and this goes to I think the comment made by 14   the Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we 15   haven't had this case yet.  You did have this case in -- 16   in Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know, 17   Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating 18   System on it, which is patented, and was being exported 19   overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that 20   were manufactured overseas.  And AT&T's patent, which 21   was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the 22   Windows software. 23               And this Court held that, although the 24   writing of the Windows Operating System into computers 25   in the United States would have infringed the patent, 45    I mean, he plants it, but he doesn't even know, you know.  He's just got -- we can imagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a -- where Justice Kagan's question could apply.    But you're just saying that would need a --    -- modification in patent    What about -- what about the other question --    No, no, no, I want to go back to a different question that was asked, which was the question what do you think we should do about this other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect?  I mean, I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is just permissive. 46  ￼ 1               It is to create generation 2.

And that would seem contrary to the 11   First Sale Doctrine.    Then you use the word 10 11   "use." 12 13 14   and you get to the same place.    Then you use the word "use"  ￼13 14 15   it. 16 17 18   articles like software and, you know, soybeans that 19   consume themselves in any use, other than an art 20   experiment.    So lease it.

I know you're about expansive control here, but some modicum of control over who enters our land. 9 10 11 13   owner of land has to have some control of the type which 14   ATA and the government says we can't have control over. 15   I will give you a simple example, where we cut a hole in 16   our fence and say the trucks can come in, you can come 17   in on Navy Way, but you can't come in on Prospect 18   Street.  That under a strict definition of the statute 19   would be prohibited to us.  But you can't prohibit a 20   landowner from saying, you've got to identify yourself.

No, but I mean if the general rule is that Strickland evolves to pick up 35   ￼ 1   changing professional norms, and that -- you looked at 2   30 cases and that's what you get out of them -- and then 3   it turns out that at the time this case began, there was 4   such a professional norm; and all that happened in 5   Padilla is that the Court following its general practice 6   said apply that professional norm; then why doesn't the 7   other side win?
11-864 +++$+++    Hornbook law   This case, this case, hornbook law What things? And now, we have a list of four. And the district court says exactly what? If we prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these people in the class, then what we do is we later look into how much that monopolization raised the prices above competitive levels. And I offer a model to look at the competitive levels and look at what happened over here, and there we are, it will help. Okay? Now, hornbook law, whether that's so or not so is a matter for later, but see first if there is liability. Okay. That's their argument. What's the answer?   Is?   That's -- I mean, that's   You have the right to prove that they weren't, fine.   And this does, too -­ 15  10 raise price 11 12 13 above the competitive level?   And if --   -- how is it different from    No, you shouldn't.   Did I get my analysis right?    I want to know -- if you think of the examples I just -- do you, as the plaintiff, when you draw up your list of class members, have to have on that list people who really were hurt by the -- or plausibly were hurt by the exercise of market power? And you have to have some way of picking them out, and you have chosen this model as a way. So I guess they could object on the ground that model is worthless. Is this analysis right? And you would have to show, no, it isn't worthless.   You don't have to show that much. I think you only have to show it's a plausible model.   And because it's a regulated industry, the regulator, in your view, is doing one of the worst jobs in history. They are willing to come in and overbuild and everything, so he must be letting prices -- all right. Suppose the judge or lawyer were to find, that's okay, it doesn't matter, all we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says.

And they say, no, it's not likely.  That's the end of it.  They're just as if they manufactured cell phones.    But if they were to say -- you know, we make new shoes all the time.    And this is some kind of thing we might well consider, and we have people working on it; and they are considering whether to do it or not, it's well in the works -- they win.  Okay? What did they say?    So you say, okay, this is the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this.  You seem to have conducted this case without that standard quite in mind.  It's tough for Nike, but they can do it -- you know, depending on the facts, and you have these protective orders, da, da, da, so send it back, use the right standard, and give Nike a chance and give them a chance, and that way, we --    What about that?  I would like to know what the answer to that question is here.    Excellent.    Well, that's your opinion, that you will win on remand.  Okay.

Now, I would think 6   if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all 7   these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim 8   that should be made in a Federal district court, period, 9   not the Court of Claims.  Because their government isn't 10   going to compensate them for anything.  That's against Okay, that's their view of it, something like that, isn't it?    Fine.  So they're making 11 12 13 14   tell us that.  So I have a feeling this is somehow not a the whole point of the program. Either this program is valid or it isn't.

Now, you explain to me why that purely instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.    The just compensation, I take it, in the program is supposed to come from the the taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean they have to pay higher prices as consumers. 19 20 21 22 23 24   to the merits.  It goes to whether or not it makes sense 25   to think that the Court of Claims has something to say    No, no.  No, it doesn't go ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 44 1 about this. And suppose we did this. Suppose we said, 2   given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it 3   was -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this 4   very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we 5   think this is the kind of program and challenge to 6   the program where there isn't going to be a remedy 7   really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead 8   in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these 9   enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide 10   the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going 11   to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all. 12   So tell me why not.    Yes.    I -- no, no.  I just wanted to know what the word "acquire" -- 19 20 21 22 23   possess.  And a handler is anyone who sells raisins. 24   There was no mystery about this.

So you want to say and that's also true when the person is actually innocent, if you can prove that, delay it. Is that what you're saying?   Well, he has his one year, and he gives four criteria, and the four criteria, sometimes, are not exclusive. And you want to say yours is one of the times.    Well, what is your answer? MR.

12-133 +++$+++    Yes, maybe. (Laughter.)   If you want to argue that stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right. Maybe you do need experts on that. I don't know that we want to get into this, but I just want to know if you want to concede that there is no way to win this case in arbitration unless they spend $300,000.   -- the question -- the   Now, what are the circumstances here? The record leaves us uncertain, we remand it for further consideration of what they are.  ￼certainly --   Because that isn't the 55   1 issue they decided, whether it could be enforced. They 2 decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration 3 agreement could be enforced.   Or you have to do without. I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration costs. So how is that handled?   You said you waived that point, whatever -- however it is. You waived it. Never raised it. The Court of Appeals took it as if it were arbitration costs.   I believe you.
12-135 +++$+++    Look, I'm going to say something and you are going to say, that's right, that's just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you don't think of it. The arbitrator in front of me, so you better tell me why I'm wrong because they certainly 32  ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 will and they are in the briefs. Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language here says all disputes will go to arbitration. It doesn't say whether they are supposed to be class or can be or can't be. You decide what it means. And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision. So what kind of a case is it? Small claims. And then it says something about court suits where they have class. Hmm, gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says, that's what it means. It means it could include class, too. Okay? Where in our case law is that a manifest disregard? He's looked at the language, there were two plausible constructions, he came up with one of them. What's the problem? Now, that's of course their problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why they are saying no it's not going to help me.   So -- obviously you don't. (Laughter.)   Use whatever word you want. Manifest disregard, stick to the law. Now, suppose the arbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it. I see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball. Now, we would strike that down because that is not relevant. But he didn't say magic 8-ball. He said class. And there are many class arbitrations. So it isn't quite magic 8-ball. Now, you explain to me --   A magic 8-ball is you have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts. (Laughter.)
12-142 +++$+++ 
12-144 +++$+++     What the brief says is, of course, you can appoint people.  It's not just that you appoint them, it's that the State's interest when it defends a law is the interest in executing the law of the State.  So all you have to do is give a person that interest.  But when a person has the interest of defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of the State of California, there can be all kinds of conflicts, all kinds of situations. That's what I got out of the brief.  So give the person that interest.  And that, they say, is what's missing here.  And you'll say -- I mean, that's -- that's here, and you say it's missing here.    Why is it missing here?

12-207 +++$+++     In the case of -- do you have any information -- are there instances with fingerprints where returns have not come back for as long as 30 days?  Or are they all, or almost all, done in 5 minutes?
12-236 +++$+++ 
12-246 +++$+++     Then what's the law?  What is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of his tax return.  The IRS gets it.  Later, it turns out to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he left this blank.  Okay? Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right.    I mean, isn't it -- you're 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 line. 21 22 23 24 25    Okay.  Then you need a    Then what is -- then you need a line.  So where is -- there's the tax case; then we have a case they're selling tickets to the policeman's ball, and somebody comes to the door, and 5  not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell the government anything and, later on, it turns out to be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.  I mean, do you want to go that far?  ￼ 1 the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around 2 before, and he doesn't answer. Okay? Now, that's 3 probably not an invocation. 4 And then we have the clear line, which, in 5 custody, and, now, you want to extend that line. And so 6 what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend 7 it, what line do I draw?    It depends on the  ￼ 1 another common situation where a defendant meets up with 2 the police, gives a story, and then, later, changes the 3 story. And the question is asked at trial, you never 4 volunteered that story to the -- to the police when they 5 questioned you. 6 Would that be silence, to you? Would that 7 be an invocation of his right not to incriminate 8 himself? Or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred 9 from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to 10 say this, but not that, so this is a made-up story.    You're not in an inherently coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation, you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations, you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth Amendment --  Constitution or something in  and that's what -- -- or tap on the order to indicate -- -- that's what's at issue    Yeah.    Right.  And that's saying because, there, we have a line.  It's called the in-custody line.  Once you get outside of custody --    Well, I don't want to make the government's argument for them.  They'll make it very well.    Because I -- well, now, they cite for the proposition, I think, that it -- that the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note 37 of Miranda.  Okay.  I just read it.    Is there any authority, or is it just your opinion that we have to go on?     No, fine.  But what's your opinion?  I mean, what is the law in respect to that single point?  And at least to me, I'd -- I'd like to know your opinion on that.
12-307 +++$+++    Or if there's no interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday. It seems to me, forgetting your -- your preferable argument, it's a violation of equal protection everywhere. Well, if it is, then all States have to have something like pacts. And if they have to have something like pacts, then you say then they also have to allow marriage. So then are you not arguing they all have to allow marriage? And then you say no. All right, so with that point --
12-357 +++$+++     Now, that seems very far- reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case -- the abortion clinic case, et cetera, and it is easy to reconcile with the honest services case.    Well, I mean, that sounds technical.  You see, the problem I'm interested in is, by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is an appropriate threat which has as a condition the person doing the job differently?  That's true of whether it's a postman, you know, any public official, any private official, anybody.    That seems very far-reaching.  So what's the answer?    No, no.  No attaining question.  I'm just thinking is it reasonable to call a secretary doing one job which takes 3 percent of her time that hour property, in a way is that different from taking control of Macy's?    And -- and it seems to me that probably it is.    No, no, I'm not worried about copyrights or other intangibles.    You don't have -- you don't have property in there.  You have a thing of value --    -- is there some -- I mean, it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger position when you say that the recommendation not to buy or to buy of value. a particular service from somebody is a thing    Have they in the Court been treated as a thing of value means property?    So no.
12-398 +++$+++     Can I ask a question, which I don't think will be taken from your time.    But I have to ask you this. Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason is because of the nature of the claim.  Okay, I look at their claim.  Their claim says they want, "the isolated DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1." Then we turn to that and the first thing it says right there is it says, "The molecule involved is" -- "Molecule type:  cDNA."  And then it has a long list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay. So molecule type, cDNA.  So they say what do you mean they aren't claiming cDNA?  That's what they say they're claiming.    Because of the word 22   ￼ 1 "wherein." So I go back to the "wherein" in Prometheus 2 and the "wherein" -- you read "wherein" as in context, 3 and in this context you mean to say that a person who 4 makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as 5 well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under 6 claim 2?    I mean, I looked at that read the "wherein" depending on context.    And then depending on -- you got -- you heard what I said, so I want 21 22 that.    Yes, I  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY    Well, that's true, but then you were saying something that I just didn't understand because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and it's attached to two ends. But also in the body, perhaps because cells die, there is isolated DNA.  And that means that the DNA strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies, and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very few of them in the world, but there are some, by the laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely the BRCA1 gene. Now, have I misread what the scientists told us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong? that -- There's you may Justice    I probably misread it. a better chance that I've misread it. (Laughter.)    Well, which one have I not 38  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 you -- 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 read --     So in other words, you're saying that the Lander brief is wrong.    I want to know because I have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a matter of science it was correct.  So I would like to know whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it is correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are disagreeing with it, as a matter of science.    I'd like a yes or no 17 answer. 18    As a matter of science.    Okay.  Very well.  If you are saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell me that it's wrong.    No -- yes -- I need to know --    And I would like you to express your view on that because that's the framework that I am bringing to the case.    You are saying it gets past    Well, that's -- that's the mean, all parts of the human body?  Anything the body that you snip out and isolate?    And it gets through 101?  ￼ 1 but liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your 2 organ. But it's the same thing. It is the same thing 3 when it's inside the body and it's out. That's where 4 our -- 5 6 7 8 patentable.
12-399 +++$+++     And so 1915(a) means -- that's right.    Well, you're thinking about this case.  I'm thinking in general.  I think the question --    I mean, through a set and decide.  They have unless -- unless something overcomes there is good cause to the contrary. they'll have to go to give it to him the preference or     So what do we do about    Actually, it does -- does (f) apply, in your opinion, to this case or not?    And (f) has something of the best interest standard tilted towards the Indian 10 parent. 11 12 13    Is that right or not?  I mean, as I read it it's something.  It's tough, but it's    So in your view the best interest standard does not apply, but rather (f)  ￼    You should if I'm not (Laughter.)    All right.  So you can say, oh, there's no such thing as a parent, a father who only sees the mother --    All right.  Okay.

12-416 +++$+++     Okay.  Suppose -- this 36  ￼ 1   sounds like an argument, a discussion that you’d have in 2   the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction 3   to this.  Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very 4   anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit.  In deciding 5   whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices 6   without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may 7   take that into account.  Two, do not take into account 8   the strength of a patent.  Three, do not try to 9   relitigate the patent. 10               Four, there are several possible 11   justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs, 12   litigation costs -- the other products, different 13   assessments of -- of value.  Five, there could be, in 14   fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you 15   just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice 16   Kagan, but there could be.  We don't know.  Okay? 17               So start with where we were.  Could be 18   anticompetitive.  Give the defense a chance to go 19   through five, one through five, and if they convince you 20   there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we 21   can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the 22   sixth, too.  Okay?  Now, judge, weigh and decide. 23   That's what we do.  So we've structured it somewhat to 24   keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs 25   given to us.  What's wrong with that? 37  ￼
12-418 +++$+++     Okay.  Then why not this?    So somehow I have to get out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential violation of due process part, the equal protection ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼1   that, and I've dissented in other cases on other 2   grounds. 3 4 5 6   unfortunate problems in the military.  They discover 7   there is a mental illness problem.  The person's out of 8   the military.  But the law says you can go and tell the 9   local mental health authorities about this person even 10   though he's no longer there. 11               And suppose the person had a criminal 12   problem in the military and was in prison and suppose 13   the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the 14   situation where he unfortunately got into that problem, 15   and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities 16   about his problems so they can take appropriate action. 17               Now, if they can do that, why can't they 18   have the power under Article I to say really, you all 19   have to register.  Now, maybe there are other things, 20   but you got this problem in the military.  You were 21   convicted in the military.  You did it in the military. 22   We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as 23   part of our military regulation, to be able to tell 24   authorities about you and to make you register according 25   to State law. All right.  But in -- in just trying to do that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have Page 31 ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 32 1 Now, no due process problem, I have to 2   assume that away.  No punishment, bad punishment 3   problem, none of those.  But it's a power, all right? 4 Why not?    No, but it's the military -- look, it's the military that they are mostly -- that they're relying on.    So they say -- I mean, the famous statement -- I looked it up -- "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and Proper Clause." All right?  The end is to protect the communities from those individuals in respect to those matters that they became dangerous with when they were 24   forbidden? 25               Well, we're not supposed to consider that ￼￼ ￼ ￼￼￼￼Page 46 1 part, but -- so leave that out. But the -- the others, 2   they say is okay.  So that's the basic. 3               Do you think maybe we should send this back 4   to the -- to the Fifth Circuit?  The government suggests 5 that --    I just want to know what to do if I end up thinking they are right.

Jones' whole job is to supervise Smith and be certain that Smith, a well-known racist, has kept his racism under control.  He didn't. Smith -- they fired someone -- Smith did -- did some terrible thing and got rid of somebody for racist reasons.  He tells his boss.  His boss knows it.  His boss does nothing about it.  All right? Is the boss violating Section VII?  He -- he had no reason for doing nothing about it.  He, himself, wasn't a racist.  It was just his job.  But he didn't. Is he -- is he violating Section VII?    The immediate supervisor    All right.  Now --    Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  So, there, what we have is somebody is guilty under Section VII, even though that individual did not, himself, discriminate on the basis of race, it was 25  ￼ 1 circumstances where the subordinate discriminated on the 2 basis of race. All right? 3 And, yet, the -- there's no doubt that (m) 4 applies to that. (M) applies to that, I imagine, unless 5 you're going to start distinguishing, within Title VII, 6 are you going to say (m) doesn't apply to that? 7 My question's going to be, if (m) applies to 8 that, then why doesn't it also apply here? Because you 9 see, here, what you have is -- it's at one removed. It 10 is the individual who is retaliating -- been retaliated 11 against. That individual did not discriminate on the 12 basis of race, nor did the individual in Farr read into 13 it, but the whole thing is based on race. 14 And if, sometimes, under Section VII, 15 simpliciter, people are guilty, although the race 16 motive -- the race involvement is one level down, why 17 wouldn't you -- that, perhaps, is too complicated a 18 question, and if -- you only have five minutes left, so 19 I will take your answer as being, Judge, you better 20 think this out on your own. 21 (Laughter.)    So you for race is race?  Yes.    Now -- have to say  1 can't do it any more than if you have a statute that 2 refers to carrots and you try to put in a beet. You 3 just can't do it. Now, that's the answer -- I -- I 4 would like to hear an answer.
12-547 +++$+++     I take it the answer is zero, right?  I mean, I --    -- I looked at your brief, and then I looked at their brief, and they say the answer is zero.    All right.  And the -- the holding is that -- the pure holding would be, if the trial court judge says no, you cannot raise it, okay? The defendant is convicted and appeals.    And then he says to the appellate court, they wouldn't let me raise it.  And the appellate court says, you have a right to raise it.    Okay.  And so all this 1973 until 1995 or whatever --    Carpenter.    2001.  All right.    And -- and was there any    Well, Mangiapane was a -- a words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that    Okay.    So we've got one. -- I'm trying to find out what the state of the    There is exactly one case on point which does favor you, and there are zero cases that favor them; is that right?    The state of the art is one for you, zero for them.    Yes.    There were no others, so, now, I've reduced your one to nothing to like .01 to nothing because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Justice --  Chief Justice just pointed out, and, now, you've already said there were no other cases.    All right.  But that's because -- everybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you on this anyway.  I agree the bar puts it in the instructions, and, if the bar puts it in the instructions, people tend to follow it.  That's true. So it's not surprising that a lot of people tended to follow it. But, as far as court decisions are concerned, we have no -- what I'm trying to think of is 37  ￼ 1 a pre-statute. I give you a little credit on that. 2 That's Lynch. Pre-statute -- and we have what I might 3 sort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner. 4 We've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong, 5 and -- and, here, even though there are judicial 6 mentioners, they get something. 7 I don't know how much in the scale to -- to 8 give them.    Can you think of a Federal case where -- I see what we have.  I'm now adding up the something for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is a -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that some courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to follow it, and there were others that mentioned it favorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.    Alright, it did mention it favorably.  Okay.  So -- so we've got that.  Now, actually, 38  ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that Kentucky case, was it?  Tennessee?    Yeah, Rogers.  That went against you.    Alright.  Alright.  But can you think of any Federal precedent on this issue that's come even close to that being sufficient?  What's your best?
