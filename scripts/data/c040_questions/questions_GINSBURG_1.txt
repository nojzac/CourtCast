The overt act may be an additional requirement.    But you will -- you will concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy crimes, in which an overt act is not required.  The 8 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 Shabani case requires you to recognize that.    You have given a few examples 15 amendment would have looked like, virtually language to 1956(h).

I know that Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter what kind of operation this is, but the operation that we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what percentage of its passengers are from the USA?    And does it normally start the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?    And how much of its advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?    Well, this is the anomaly. You're asking us to buy an interpretation.  An enterprise is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is 36 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to 2 customers, passengers, and employment.    Do you agree with Mr. Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?  I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit discrimination.
03-1395 +++$+++    May I --    Can -- can we go back to the -- another threshold question?  You did press below and Judge Tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in the district court in California, or wherever, is it has to be in the Federal Circuit.  This is a contract claim against the Government.  Are you abandoning that position?    But you're not making that with respect to anything that's classified. something in your brief, reply brief, at 18 and 10 are you saying then in all of civil litigation if 11 information is classified, then it's just out of the case?    Attached to what?  I mean, you can -- a fair procedure leading nowhere is not a claim.  You have a right to a fair procedure because it's attached to some substantive right.   You still have --    That create a property right?    But the property right is the contract with the United States.  I mean, you can't get away from the contract by calling it a property right.   How would the court -- a court go about monitoring this fair procedure --    And then you -- you said that -- suppose you knew what it was on paper and then you wanted to complain to a court, that's not what they gave 41  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 us.

But the -- the -- I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called -- that the warrant covered weapons that were there. weapons.    That they were looking for    They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?    Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?    Well, this was a -- this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.   Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the --    Well, wasn't -- I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not -- not any house where one might find Romero.    Well, was the other house his mother's house?   Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother -- nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew 33  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.    But there was no -- there was no objection to that question going to the jury, was the duration unreasonable.   But the jury --   But the jury answered the -- just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.    Yes.    So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case?  In other words, 55  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district 2 judge that behaved -- gave a proper charge, then the Ninth 3 Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with 4 what the district court and the jury decided.

There is not the requisite actual 3 malice. And so it's our position that the injunction 4 itself is unconstitutional.   Well, if -- if this under -- the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this -- your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another 15  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 from engaging in blackmail?

03-184 +++$+++     Would the -- the Tax Court rule -- now, this 183(c) -- says -- it describes the special trial judge's report, which is submitted to the chief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Court judge, and then it says that -- that the Tax Court judge may modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or may reject it in whole or in part.  Does the Tax Court ever modify a special trial judge's report?  Does it ever reject it in whole or in part?    But that's one thing that they can do.  They can adopt it, but my question is, do they always adopt and never use -- never use the term modify or reject?

It's hard to believe.   But everything becomes -- but every -- every time -- my crop was stunted.  Okay.  You have to change the label so you can't bring that suit.    He says their claim is -- is very simple.  You didn't tell us that using this in our kind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the weeds.    But you're saying that kind of claim can't be brought anymore.    I've described a set of facts which your position I think you have to say affects the 47  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 label.

03-892 +++$+++    How does it work?    There were cases -- we don't have to deal in hypotheticals.  There were cases where this happened, where people ended up liable for a tax greater than what they took in.  What happened in those cases?    I mean, there was one that was $99,000, if I remember right.    Was there a private bill?    Or what happened?  What actually happened in that case, do you know?    Take an investment advisor and the client is not at all -- doesn't know anything about the market, and he's got this whiz-bang advisor who makes millions for him that he never could have made on his own.    The Government says on that branch of it, well, the fees -- the lodestar fee, that's one thing.  A court awards it, but that's quite different from the one-third/one-half even contingent fee.

I mean, this was an 3 extraordinary situation where a judge said, my goodness, I 4 wrote an opinion that assumed this person was mentally 5 okay, and now I discovered in the file things I never saw 6 before. This is a death case. I have reason to suspect 7 that this person may not have been competent when he 8 committed the crime, may not have been competent when he 9 -- when he stood trial, may not be competent at this very 10 moment. 11 A judge in that situation -- he finds something 12 that looks like it's the -- it's -- it's the key piece of 13 evidence in favor of the defendant. Somehow it never got 14 submitted. A judge, knowing that he has written an 15 opinion saying this man, as far as the Federal courts are 16 concerned, goes to the State and they can set their date 17 of execution and all that -- that was an -- this case is 18 so idiosyncratic that I'm concerned about dealing with 19 41(b) and mandates for this really unusual situation.    At two different points in 15 16 time, wasn't it?
04-563 +++$+++     -- I right?    Okay.  So if that's the about the other part of specific about it, it The system is, "Habeas ￼1 lawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more." 2 And that's quite protective. 3 But suppose you said that to Congress. They 4 passed this thing. And you say, "You know, your year 5 here, it doesn't really mean a year. It means a year for 6 this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is, 7 they'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the 8 interest of justice, but, really, it always, almost 9 always, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that 10 fooled, and, really, it's not a problem for them, and" -- 11 what would that Congress have said? That's -- that is 12 very much disturbing me.
04-593 +++$+++     Did you say there is or --
04-597 +++$+++    But --   -- you haven't asked for it, but the appellate court said, "We don't want to affirm a judgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are going to" -- there was -- the judge was tipped off by the -- by the directed-verdict motion, that the -- who turned out to be -- the one who turned out to be the verdict loser thinks the evidence is insufficient.  That's enough at least to say that the Court of Appeals could grant a new trial.   No, I'm not --   -- talking about "against the weight," because a trial judge would rarely be -- if it -- if a trial judge said, "It's against the weight of the 7  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 evidence," it would go back for a new trial, and you 2 couldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through 3 the whole second trial. But why isn't it like -- I think 4 there are decisions that say there was a judgment, but 5 the Court of Appeals determines there was never a claim 6 for relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made 7 to that effect. The idea of a court affirming a judgment 8 that is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.   Well, couldn't one regard a 9  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 new trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for 2 judgment as a matter of law? That is, that's the larger 3 thing, but at least a new trial. Don't let -- the 4 judgment as a matter of law says, "Don't let this verdict 5 stand." So, one could say, "We won't give you a judgment, 6 but we will order a new trial."   I don't understand your response to me about vastly different standards of review. I would think it would be harder for a verdict loser to get judgment as a matter of law than to get a new trial.   Yes.   That's why --   -- that one is kind of a lesser included.   That's --   I don't think any appellate court has claimed that authority.  We're talking about a new trial in lieu of J- -- a judgment as a matter of law. And the -- one of the whole rationales in Cone and Globe and all of the others were saying you should make the post-verdict motion -- is that then the trial judge would have the option.  The trial judge might think, "Well, technically, you deserve JMOL, but maybe there was a 13  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 witness who was out to sea, so I want to exercise my 2 discretion to grant a new trial." Those two are closely 3 linked. I mean, lawyers usually, as a -- just a matter of 4 -- just automatically ask for JNOV or, in the alternative, 5 a new trial.   But --    But under this Federal Circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not been the post-verdict motion.    The Federal Circuit is borrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the Tenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has -- is the position that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart. That is, if you don't make what used to be called the JNOV, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't raise the sufficiency on appeal.   Isn't --   -- that the Federal Circuit's own rule?  It -- it was, I thought, pretty clear what it told us in that footnote, that if we were ruling -- making the ruling -- the Federal Circuit law is, if you don't 29  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 make the 50(b) motion, you cannot get a reversal on appeal 2 for insufficient evidence.   It   -- to do with liability --   -- whether it was for newly 11 discovered evidence or something else. But you -- your 12 motion was limited to damages. And I really don't think 13 that you can get where you want to go from a motion that 14 is limited to damages, when you didn't need to. You could 15 have made a motion for a new trial on the whole case.   -- invoke.   How about a --    Well, it can't -- it can't be -- it would be interlocutory at that stage.  It couldn't be raised until final judgment is entered.

04-637 +++$+++     Well, the -- the evidence was Stumpf himself who said Wesley was the 9 Justice O'Connor's question. The -- the -- you -- as -- 10 if I understood you right, you said, well, there was a 11 motion that came before two of the three judges that were 12 part of the guilty plea and the sentencing. This was a 13 plea, so no jury trial. It was three judges. One of them 14 had died. The -- the two who remained -- one of them 15 said, but if we had not been satisfied that Stumpf was, in 16 fact, the triggerman, and we were satisfied that he was, 17 in fact, an aider or abetter, that may very well have had 18 an effect on the court's determination whether the death 19 penalty should follow. I'm not saying it would, but it's 20 possible. And then you said, but then he went ahead and 21 voted to deny the motion.    But the panel -- the panel that didn't reopen -- there was no reopening because they denied the motion.  But they didn't say one way or another.
04-698 +++$+++    May I ask you, before you get to your three reasons, to go back to your -- something that you said? I asked you, Are you dividing the burden of production and persuasion? And you said no, it's all on one side or the other. But it seems to me your description of this proceeding, you said the school district goes first. So --    -- the school district did come forward.  And is that the usual practice in these administrative hearings -- that the first one to go to defend the plan is the school district, not the parents who are attacking it?   But you said, in this case --   -- the school district went first.    So, now, as a result of the Fourth Circuit's decision, do the parents always go first --    -- and not the school district?  The school district has a plan that it has put forward.  And it seemed to me logical, well, it has a plan, so it should defend it.    So, you think the ALJ -- or the administrative hearing officer in this case told the State to go first -- the school district to go first because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?    -- that the -- that there has been a violation.  And then the question is, What remedy? And the employer proposes a remedy. Wouldn't the employer have the burden of showing the adequacy of the remedy that the employer --   Is there any --   Now we have a number of do put the burden on the school district. Is States that there any indication that the cost is higher in those States than in States that put the burden on the parents?   And do you have --    -- do you have any in -- to the question I asked earlier -- in ￼1 it's cited in both respondent's and petitioner's brief, 2 and it was relied on by Congress in the 2004 amendments. 3 And what it -- what it demonstrates is that 80 percent -- 4 nearly 80 percent of all due-process hearings nationwide 5 have occurred in just six jurisdictions, five States and 6 the District of Columbia, and that -- and that, in those 7 States -- it happens to be the case at all, but Maryland, 8 which is one of those states -- have clear rules that put 9 the burden of proof on the school districts, and that the 10 costs --
04-712 +++$+++     And because you the removing defendant, it is true, is it the removing defendant has the burden of 10 corporation, and in the remand notice, which 11 identified its principal place of business as Texas. 12 Even the court of appeals had no problem calling it 13 a "Texas parent," because the corporation documents, 14 which are part of the record, amply demonstrated 15 that Lincoln Property Company is, in fact, a Texas 16 corporation and satisfies those requisites under the 17 diversity jurisdiction provision. 18 The -- instead, what the Fourth Circuit 19 has done is to erect a standardless forum that will 20 increase litigation over jurisdiction by inviting 21 courts to make inquiry about parties and entities 22 that are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the 23 purpose of determining whether or not there are 24 jurisdictional spoilers.    Mr. Frederick, would you clarify one thing for me?  I don't know how we even get to the second question, about partnership. If you're right that Lincoln is a corporation -- it's a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business in Texas, end of case; it's the only named defendant -- so, how do we get to something about a partnership?    Well, I don't understand it.  We wouldn't vacate the judgment in part.  If we reversed, --    -- that's the end of 17  1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 ￼1 it.

Then there can be a setoff to the extent of the claim that's being made against the bankrupt estate. There can't be any affirmative recovery, as there could be with a permissive -- with a compulsory counterclaim. But you're saying that that section is unconstitutional -- 160(c) [sic]?    But if we're talking just about VMI, not about the other schools, then you -- if this claim is unrelated, so that it would be a permissive counterclaim, then you would say not even against VMI could you have the setoff.    But why shouldn't a setoff be a defense, even if it's unrelated?  I mean, there were such things in -- at common law, were there not, that you could set off an unrelated debt?   -- only -- MR.

That's the --    But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?    We don't know what it is. We haven't had the second case. 10 11 12 13 14   others, harm to nonparties problem.  The statute does 15   not require giving credit, only consideration.  Even if 16   it, even if it did, it operates as a one-way ratchet. 17   That is, you keep making awards until you've reached the 18   maximum that would be allowable for all the conduct even 19   though juries, properly instructed, might have awarded 20   substantially less and even though many juries might 21   exonerate the defendant totally, as many juries have in 22   tobacco cases.  So the Oregon regime is, is a formula 23 24 25 for having what amounts to excessive punishment or at least unfair punishment.

In this case, PACE 3   made not a two-step proposal, PACE proposed an outright 4   merger in which all assets and liabilities would be 5   transferred to the PACE union.  That's in the record. 6   It's Plaintiff's trial Exhibit 25.  And what's 7   significant about the merger proposal that PACE sent to 8   Crown is that this is PACE's merger proposal.  It had 9   Crown signing the merger in Crown's planned sponsor 10   capacity not as a, not as an administrator but as a plan 11   sponsor.  That's what PACE proposed, recognizing that 12 13 14 15   also the second stage issue here.  Even, even if this 16   was a two-stage transaction, which was not proposed, 17   each stage of that transaction is a plan sponsor 18   decision.  A plan sponsor has to make the decision 19   whether to transfer assets and then a plan sponsor has 20   to make the decision whether or not to then terminate 21   the plan.  Each separate stage is a plan sponsor 22   function. 23               In terms of the plan sponsor function 24   changing because the company is going out of business, 25   that simply cannot be.

If anything, because 4   it's going out of business, it's important to protect 5   the, the discretion of a plan sponsor. 6               In terms of the contextual argument it's 7   very important to note that nowhere -- that Section 1341 8   which governs standard termination does not 9   cross-reference mergers and the Section 1412 governing 10   mergers does not apply to terminations.  In fact the 11   only place in the statute where the two words appear 12   together is in Section 1058, in which the two procedures 13   are actually compared to each other. 14               There are some significant differences 15   between termination and merger.  In a termination, there 16   is a reversion to the company.  There is also reversion 17   to employees based upon their individual contributions. 18   There is no similar reversion in a merger.  That is why 19   a merger simply cannot be a method of termination.  The 20   two are different.  You might have a two-stage 21   transaction but they are two separate transactions each 22   of which is a plan sponsor function.

The -- the Seventh Circuit said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, despite the court's invitation that their suits allege mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation.  So is that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it in your briefs?    Then how could the Seventh Circuit have gotten it that wrong?    Of course, if the Federal district court says there is preclusion, therefore, case dismissed, that would be reviewable.    And a Nassau County court could say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive. They didn't have a fair chance to appeal.  And that would be all right.    But in any case, you said Easterbrook made only one mistake.    But he made another one when he said, it's now or never for appellate review. That preclusion question could come to this Court if it went -- the case went back and the Nassau County said, well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not going to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion 38 1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- ￼1 question would be open for this Court to review.

The listing itself 10   didn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the 11   instruction that you are not limited to the listed 12   mitigating factors. 13             So, the concern is that, because the last 14   reference was to the list, that the list included factor 15   (k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give 16   -- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest 17   emphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions 18   in response to questions.

Was there any opportunity for the defendant to say 6   anything at that hearing?    Right, and the actual lawyer didn't show up until later.    He didn't get -- he  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   need lawyers and then immediately -- and the public 2   defender service in this district is a contract service. 3   They're private attorneys who contract out to do it. 4   And then the legal assistant immediately calls, tells 5   the lawyers, well, here is who you are representing. 6               Now, in a case like this one, which is a 7   capital case, there was of course a great sense of 8   urgency.  There are only two lawyers in this district 9   who are qualified to represent capital defendants.  They 10   got called immediately.  Recall what happened here was 11   that this hearing took place in the morning and Mr. 12   Montejo gets taken back to the jail and very soon after 13   he arrives he gets checked back out by these officers 14   again and taken out in the squad car where he is kept 15   for six hours, and in the meantime essentially while 16   he's going out the back door, while he's being taken out 17   the back door with the police, his lawyer is coming in 18   the front door and raising holy heck about the fact that 19   his client's not --    But, Mr. Verrilli --    -- you just struck two  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   testifies.

Of course, it wasn't used for 6   impeachment purposes; it was used in fact as substantive 7   evidence, and there was no limiting instruction to let 8   the jury know that it could only be considered for that 9   limited purpose.  And I don't think that suffices even 10   remotely to overcome the harmless error problem here. 11               The second point of clarification, it does 12   seem to me clear, both from pages 14 and 15 of 13   Respondent's brief and Respondent's argument here today 14   and in particular the citation to the Montoya case in 15   the Fifth Circuit, they are not advocating a request 16   rule; they are advocating a request or assertion rule. 17   In fact, the very passage in Montoya to which 18   Respondent's counsel adverts -- it says there doesn't 19   have to be a request so long as there is an assertion. 20               And that's the principle they're advocating. 21   It just doesn't make any sense as a sensible dividing 22   line between categories of defendants who are protected 23   by Jackson and those who aren't for the reasons that we 24   have discussed.

It does make it quite similar to the 1897 case from the the Eighth Circuit, and I think it is quite telling that we haven't found another analogue.

The argument --    I thought the Court said  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12   We have gone through the history.  But I think there is 13   really only one change and in every respect it is 14   identical to what it was in 1938.  And, again, as I say, 15   it separates out the registration provision from the 16   jurisdictional provision. 17               If Congress had wanted to make registration 18   jurisdictional, it would have been extraordinarily easy 19   to do so.  All they would have had to add at the 20   beginning of 411(a) is "notwithstanding anything in 1338 21 and 1331." 22               We have -- we have included in our brief as 23   an appendix about 60-odd Federal statutes, which carved 24   out jurisdiction otherwise provided by 1331 or other 25   provisions, and 411(a) looks nothing like them.

Do they -- if they are just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they have to register before bringing an injunction suit? 10 11 12 13   do.  In order to bring any action -- if the injunction 14   is based on infringement.  So we're -- if the plaintiff 15   brings an action for infringement and the remedy they 16   seek is an injunction, then the copyright must be    The -- so mingle -- rule. 21 22 23 24   what Ms. Anders argued.  I disagree with that, because 25   the public interest that Congress has put forth here situation it would be appropriate for the judge to accept the waiver.    Then let's switch to the 10   plaintiff.  If the plaintiff is in it for money, for  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   jurisdictional, the defendant doesn't even have to 2   appear.  The district court can sua sponte dismiss the 3   complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  We cite I believe 4 5 6 7   then.  I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is 8   this:  let's take a group of people who want to make seven or eight cases in the brief where exactly that happened, including two different cases --

We have a very 21   ambiguous legislative history, where in the initial 22   version of this legislation the House report 23   accompanying it said lawyers were included and the 24   language was "debt relief counseling agency."  Then 25   Congress amended the statute -- Congress amended the 22  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   proposed legislation in 1999, and thereafter in the 2   2001, 2003, and 2005 House reports deleted all reference 3   to attorneys -- a very, very strange tale, which seems 4   to signal exactly the opposite of the Heintz case. 5               So we have a very ambiguous legislative 6   history that seems to give us a contrary signal.  That 7   in part is part of the ambiguity behind this statute, 8   which I think is one of the reasons why it's perfectly 9   -- the statute is readily susceptible to an 10   interpretation --    What about the provision that says the directors, employees, are not included?    Well, let's take some of 40  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and 2   she is at the end of the line on resources.

And 5   she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt -- 6   since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's 7   incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of 8   bankruptcy. 9               Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell 10   your -- the lawyer could say:  Sell your equipment. 11   That wouldn't be a problem.  But could the lawyer say, 12   incur the debt?    One thing that lawyers who render services for money want -- is to be sure that they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this 526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney for representing the debtor. So what can a lawyer say safely about the lawyer's getting paid?    You said that one of the aspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are not limited to saying, "We are debt relief agencies; we 18   administrator that a law firm can go to and say, "This 19   is what I think is substantially similar.

The Second Circuit put  - Subject to Final Review 1   that they may say, well, the label's changed, but 2   everything else stays the same.  What we particularly 3   thought might be instructive for this Court is to hear 4   what the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's 5   financial capital thought of a new fact, and that new 6   fact is that for the first time the Securities and 7   Exchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of 8   administrative deference the Court should defer to our 9   test in cases like that. 10               Sure, they have submitted amicus briefs in 11   the past.  They have done lots of things.  But this is 12   the first time they have said:  We as the agency 13   responsible for the statute have said this is how courts 14   should handle the case.  That's what's new and 15   different, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed 16   along that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on 17   the merits here today.    How could they come down on your side if they say there is no private right of action?    If all that were done and it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any violation.    And the communication was done in Australia by the Australian bank. 8    If we had only HomeSide's conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation of 10(b); is that right?    But nothing has happened. Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and they didn't act on it?

Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the 6   Democratic group and vice versa."  So unless you are 7   challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating, 8   as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see 9   how we can listen to your argument about the so-called 10   written policy.

The court of appeals remanded for consideration 2   of common law head of state and other immunities. 3   Suggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered 4   to the district court.  And the legislative history of 5   the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly 6   says that the official type immunities -- using the 7   word “official” immunity, head of state immunity, 8   diplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things 9   are not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 10 Act. 11               Section -- section 1602 shows that Congress 12   wanted to take the Executive away because the government 13   was being pressured by foreign governments with respect 14   to the restrictive theory with respect to commercial 15   activities.  And that's where the pressure was being 16   applied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of 17   that business, and agreed to.  If you read 1602, it 18   specifically refers to commercial activities. 19               There was no such conscious abrogation of 20   the Executive's critical role to make immunity 21   determinations on behalf of officials in the legislative 22   history.  And this Court should not strain to read the 23   rigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 24   Act, which were just not tailored to the immunities 25   that the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said 58 ￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 officials have immunity for their official acts exercising governmental authority.

For example, Zicherman is a 17   post-Miles case, and it's written and states the 18   principles very clearly:  The Jones Act provides, 19   permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary 20   losses.  And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA 21   case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation 22   only for pecuniary losses. 23               And so, again, if we look at the history on 24   the death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look 25   on the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the 12  ￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Iroquois -- Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine 2   times in expressing what remedies are available to 3   seamen.  And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act 4   cases, have been decided and have been a part of our 5   precedent for 60, 70, 80 years. 6               And, of course, it is important to note that 7   the Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no 8   tampering with this history.  It has amended the Jones 9   Act in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it 10   has amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change. 11   And that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's 12   in light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus 13   for the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide 14   whether they agree with those policy determinations.

Because 2   even that slightly less invasive search still implicates 3   legitimate and serious implications of privacy.

Because the 12   Fourth Amendment requires a balancing.  On one side you 13   have legitimate expectations of privacy, and on the 14   other side you have the governmental need to conduct 15   that search.

Now, there is different panels, but it is 10   different panel, allowed them to cure it.  And I can't 11   cure it now.  That is the height of arbitrary behavior 12   by the board, it seems to me.

And the party -- one party tried to 15   get a court to intervene on that question, because it 16   could have precluded the arbitration entirely.

And one thing that bears mention is that 2   reference is under the designation "Definitions," 3   because Respondent makes some hay out of the fact that 4   we complied with other requirements which are under a 5   different heading which says "Limitations of liability." 6               But what we also had was that we purchased 7   the ticket from Costa Cruise; it was sent by Costa 8   Cruise.  We had the pre-suit notice sent to Costa 9   Cruise, responded by the -- the gentleman under the 10   heading "Costa" that says "claims administrator for 11   Costa Cruise."  So there was certainly what I would call ￼12 13 14 15   definitions on page 1.  And if you are not going to read 16   all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you conflicting information at best about which was the name of the actual vessel operator.    So when the answer was filed it was too late for you to come within the statute of limitations.    And I thought that would be 13  - Subject to Final Review 1 the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, 2 because when you got the answer -- which was filed after 3 how many days?

So there was no interval for an objection? 12 13 14 15 16 17   difficult?

And so the Ninth Circuit 4 has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it 5 applies to all forms of relief. 6 And so that's the question we are confronted 7 with.

I didn't think the Ninth Circuit had 7   enjoined anything other than those questions.    But whatever he asks, we are reviewing a judgment.    And the judgment is not the universe; it's certain questions can be asked. 54  ￼ - Subject to Final Review    I don't see how that's so because, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the questions on that form but one.

10-1104 +++$+++     We go back to what you said initially; that is, if there's no alternative remedy, Bivens fills the gap. Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, only the State law allows survivor actions.  In Carlson, 3   ￼ 1   I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison 2   personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens 3   liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether 4   there could have been a State tort.    Is it -- and it might hold State prisoners as well.    It might hold -- some private facilities will take State prisoners as well as Federal prisoners.    And if they do have State prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to, not Bivens, but 1983.    So, you have two prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a Federal remedy and the other doesn't.    Did any of those courts address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going to get an affidavit?    Would you be taking the position that even if there is an alternative State remedy, tort remedy, even so there ought to be a parallel Bivens action?  Or would you say no Bivens action if all of the States have adequate tort remedies?    In Carlson, the Court was operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal employee, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no remedy at all.    Right.    And here, it is different from Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an individual.  So, we have the parallel remedies here which didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two cases different.    What about, if there is    -- allowing an amendment?

So -- and then in those cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily make this compensation available, then measuring -- the -- the pay would be measured by the time the employer makes -- makes the compensation available, 5     But there's no award.

And I thought that -- that Sosa 14   accepted that Filartiga would be a viable action under 15   the Tort Claims Act.  So, I thought what we were talking about today, the question was, is it only individual defendants or are corporate defendants also liable?    But this statute doesn't use the word "individual," and it doesn't use the word  29 ￼16 17 18 19 20 21 22   to me?  We would have to sue the person individually.    But there's no -- there  ￼1   exclude liability for corporations, even for the most 2   heinous offenses of the modern era.  They focus 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 liability, rather, on corporate officers. And, Justice Kagan, we don't dispute that corporate officers can be held to account for these offenses, assuming, Justice Alito, that we don't have concerns about extraterritoriality --     If you look --    If you look to the law of the place where the corporation is headquartered, well, suppose that has a typical respondeat superior liability that says corporations are liable for the acts of their  40 1   would be the amount of damages.

So -- and most -- correct me if I'm wrong, I 11   think most countries in the world have such a notion, 12   that corporate -- corporations are responsible for the 13   acts of their agents.  So, how does the -- looking to the 14   law where the corporation is headquartered, where does 15   that get you when that country has the very same law 16   that we do, that, yes, corporations are liable for the 17   acts of their agents?

What is the unanimity on the remedy?  Here, the court said that the writ shall be granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer the 51-to-85-month plea.  So, that doesn't bind the judge, but it does bind the prosecutor.    And it removes the possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have withdrawn that initial offer.

So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any 4   interferences with who is qualified to be a minister, 5   because the church was holding her out as being 6 qualified.    The tort claim could proceed, and then she would get damages, and that would be all right? 10 11 12 13   position.    Now, it was certainly for some purposes.

There is nothing that inhibits it from doing so.  There is no Federal court order.  So your third point, I think, is --    Now, I don't understand that.  The child is now in Scotland.    So how would these six months be satisfied?    When you say, "bring the 8   ￼ 1   child back," there's an impediment to that because now 2   this court in Scotland has told her don't -- the child 3   stays here.  There's an order that the child not be 4   removed from Scotland, and there is also -- doesn't the 5   mother have -- wasn't this mother deported?    How long has the child been -- now since -- since the return, pursuant to the Federal court's order, how long has the child been residing in Scotland? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   determination?    Is that done in a separate judgment?  The --    But in Scotland, it's -- it would be a custody proceeding.  Forget about the Hague.  The child is there.  The mother is bringing a custody proceeding.

But that was only for determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague Convention is out of it, then there is a custody proceeding.  The idea of the Hague Convention is just to get the case to a forum that's an appropriate forum to decide the custody question, right?    Was the child returned? Or was it just a decision that the appeal could not be avoided?  Was the child returned by Poland?

Why doesn't the FCC have the authority to interpret that term, within a reasonable time?    Mr. Goldstein, in following that, it seems to me you -- you are basing your argument on what is said in 7(a).  And that preserves the authority of the local governments.  But the provision that we are talking about is (b), and (b) says limitations, authority that the local governments do not have, and among those limitations is that they have to act within a reasonable time. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24   you. 25               The statute -- and so, Justice Ginsburg, I    I just don't understand how the FCC's general rule-making authority is removed as to a provision that limits what the State and local governments can do.

Let's assume there are 10 pieces of 12   evidence.  Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted. 13   Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so 14   prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at.  There 15   is a substantial likelihood of that. 16               I think this is your argument:  If the jury 17   was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which 18   was improperly admitted, what would happen if we 19   concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if 20   they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted? 21   What result?

11-262 +++$+++     What was the probable --    Explain that to me. That's a false statement to a government officer, but that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that 10 11   these officers had to arrest.  They -- there was a 12   question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think 13   that the charge that eventually was made in the State 14   court was harassment.  So, there's no indication that 15   these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds.    You're not suggesting absolute immunity? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17   from the Harlow type of qualified immunity.  It is an 18   immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent 19   upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a 20   protective capacity and having probable cause to make 21   the arrest.  But, certainly, once the immunity attaches, 22   it would be -- it would be full immunity from a claim. 23               The Court noted earlier this term, in 24   Ryburn v. Huff case, that judges should be cautious 25   about second-guessing a police officer's assessment made    But it's a different kind of qualified immunity?    But it's ambivalent.  I  56 ￼what jury trials are all about, Justice Ginsburg. And I'm not saying that I have to show  57 1   be considered by the jury.  I could lose this trial when 2   we go back, if we get a trial.  That's what -- that's 3 4 5 6   before I win this case.  The issue simply is, can we 7   sacrifice the First Amendment?  You know, does a evidence to this Court that I'm going to win the trial 8   litterbug lose their right to have First Amendment free 9   speech, does a jaywalker lose their right to have First 10   Amendment free speech because probable cause exists to 11   believe they've committed some offense?  And you'll have 12   officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws and jaywalking 13   laws and blocking-the-sidewalk laws, and First Amendment 14   is essentially evaded. 15               A hundred years of jurisprudence, courageous 16   jurisprudence, many times by this Court, goes by the 17   boards because somebody is a litterbug.  I just don't 18   see that as the solution to this problem, and I also 19   don't see that the Secret Service needs some enhanced 20   protection from this Court when this has never been and 21   is not now any kind of a serious problem. 22               The status quo is Mount Healthy.  It has 23   worked for decades, and it should continue to work.  And 24   if these agents get tagged in this case, maybe they 25   deserved to get tagged in this case, because the First  ￼ 58 1   Amendment is extremely important.  And I don't denigrate 2   the job of law enforcement or these agents in any way. 3               I'm simply saying that when the First 4   Amendment is at stake, I think -- and the law has been 5   working just fine throughout decades, to extend the no 6   probable cause in Hartman to on-street encounters where 7   there is no complex causation chain, where the main 8   actor in Hartman was immune completely from lawsuit -- 9   the prosecutor in Hartman could not be sued under any 10   circumstances, nor could the prosecutor in Hartman be 11   questioned in deposition under our traditions.  We don't 12   question prosecutors in depositions about why they made 13   decisions to go ahead and prosecute.  So, this Court 14   stepped back in Hartman and said that's a different 15   story. 16               But on-street encounters -- if you extend 17   the no-probable-cause requirement to on-street 18   encounters, any rogue police officer, or Secret Service 19   agent, who wants to can ostensibly enforce any number of 20   legal violations -- 1 mile an hour over the speed limit, 21   you're going to jail allegedly for going 1 mile an hour 22   over the speed limit; or under Atwater, for not wearing 23   a seat belt -- when the real reason is your bumper 24   sticker. 25               If you can prove that, they should go to  ￼ 1 trial. 2               Absent any further questions, I'll sit down. 3               Thank you very much.
11-345 +++$+++     Mr. Rein, before we get to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on its own, the question of -- of standing.  The injury -- if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas, 3   ￼ 1   and the answer is, no matter what, this person would not 2   have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the 3   affirmative action program?    Because of the 10 percent.    But is the -- the race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?    But you say, and that's okay because it's -- it's race-neutral.  But is it really?  The -- the only reason that they instituted the 10 percent plan was to increase minority enrollment.    And it -- and that -- the only way it works is if you have heavily separated schools.  And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you want to go to the University of Texas under the 10 percent plan, you go to the low-performing school, you don't take challenging courses, because that's how you'll get into the 10 percent. So maybe the University is concerned that that is an inadequate way to deal with it.    But that's the same -- the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in some cases it's going to make a difference.  The same would be true under Grutter.  The same would be true 64   ￼ 1   under the policies now in existence at the military 2   academies.

11-465 +++$+++     Ms. Brenan, we are straying pretty far from this case.  And correct me if 7   ￼ 1   I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was 2   made under State law, and then Williams said there was 3   an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the 4   Sixth Amendment was violated. 5               So there really isn't any 6   independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent 7   Sixth Amendment right.  It's State law was violated and 8   therefore the Constitution was violated. 9               So it seems to me if we just look at the 10   position that Williams was taking, that these two, the 11   State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together. 12   And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some 13   other case that might come before us some day would not 14 be wise.    May I ask you about the underlying claim here?  It is quite troublesome.  I think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen charge; is that right?    And the possibility of getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this way is -- is really troublesome.  ￼ 1               The judge can't give an Allen charge to urge 2   the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the 3   judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss 4   that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome.

Because, in the ordinary course, that's not uncommon to re -- re-jigger the -- the appropriation. JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it protects these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue?   My question is whether the cap was meaningless. And I think your answer is, yes, for anyone who sues, the cap is meaningless.

11-702 +++$+++     When you -- now, Mr. Goldstein, when you say, "this case," is there any proof in the record that there was a small amount and no -- no 10 11 12 13 14 15   remuneration? 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    Mr. Goldstein, it's because they are trying to mirror the Federal statute, which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes that like an affirmative defense.  The burden is on the defendant to show those two things, to get out from under the main statute.    So what the Government is suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can 16  ￼ 1   I do want to make -- just want to focus on what the 2   parties' positions are.  And they do have this 3   fact-found inquiry in every one, so I do want to turn to 4   what I think is probably their second best argument.  I 5   was talking about the underinclusiveness as the first 6 one. 7               Their second one is they want to draw an 8   analogy between this and what would happen in a criminal 9   case.  So they say, take the conviction and imagine that 10   the conviction is all the facts that you had in a 11   Federal criminal prosecution, and then you would have a 12   burden on the defendant to -- to prove that he was 13   subject to the misdemeanor. 14               We have several points about that.  The 15   first is this is not a Federal criminal prosecution. 16   The Federal statute involved is the Immigration and 17   Naturalization Act, and it tells you that you are 18   supposed to look at the conviction itself and determine 19   whether it corresponds to a Federal felony. 20               This further proceeding doesn't exist, and 21   it's exactly the argument that was rejected in 22   Carachuri-Rosendo.  And let me talk about why --    I don't follow --    -- your answer because I    -- for remuneration --    -- many of those people    So you have that --    -- a large underinclusiveness problem, which you haven't solved.

12-357 +++$+++     What about -- you said transfer, sell, but there's also exercise.  And the theory is that the defendant sought to take away the officer's right to make this recommendation, take it away from the officer, exercise it himself.  So why 22  ￼ 1 doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right 2 taken from one and exercised by another?

12-547 +++$+++     Well, what --    There was some law in effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973 till the year 2001.  There was no statute, and there was no ancient common law.  But what was it?  If I asked you 4  ￼ 1 the question, what was the law in Michigan on diminished 2 capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you respond?    The --    Your colleague said that there were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's the court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished capacity as a defense.    And so that court, several times, recognized diminished capacity as a  ￼ 1 of which would be contrary to the statutory language, 2 incidentally, not a single one of them did a conviction 3 or an acquittal or a finding of ineffective assistance 4 ever turn on that point. And so, in that sense, it's 5 also, again, very much like Rogers, where this Court 6 said that the year and a day rule had never been used 7 for an acquittal or a conviction in any Tennessee case. 8 And so the question is, again, through the 9 AEDPA deference lens, which is very high, was the 10 Carpenter decision defensible and expected? And we 11 would submit that any time that a State supreme court 12 applies the plain language of the statute in accord with 13 established principles of interpretation in that State, 14 it could almost never be indefensible or unexpected.    Why -- why was it --    Why was it the right 51   ￼ 1 case? The parties didn't even raise it, did they?
