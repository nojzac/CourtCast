Washington.          Mr. Fisher.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L.(10:02 a.m.) hear argument                         FISHERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Michelle McCottry's statements here weretestimonial for the simple reason that she knowinglytold a governmental agent associated with lawenforcement that someone had committed a crime.Prosecutions based on such ex parte statements in placeof live testimony strike at the very heart of the evilthe Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent:trials on the basis of out-of-court accusations.          Indeed, the trial here really can't bedescribed as anything other than inquisitorial innature.  The sole proof that Mr. Davis was at Ms.McCottry's house and assaulted her that day was the 4-minute, tape-recorded 911 police incident interviewthat the State played at Mr. Davis' trial and that ititself described as Ms. McCottry's testimony on the daythis happened.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Counsel, when you say --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How does the fact that it'ssole proof mean that it's testimonial?          MR. FISHER:  It --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- it -- it adds to thegeneral appeal of your case I -- I suppose, but whatdoes that have to do with whether or not it'stestimonial?          MR. FISHER:  It doesn't -- it doesn't answerone way or another whether it's testimonial.  What itdoes and what I'm trying to do for this Court is,first, draw back the lens for a moment and look at thekind of trial that we end up with when statements ofthe -- like fresh accusations in this case, are able tobe used in place of live testimony.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you did use the wordinquisitorial, and there's one large difference, itseems.  This is not a magistrate judge or a policeofficer coming to a person for an interview.  This isinitiated by the caller, by the victim, and it'sinitially a cry for help.          MR. FISHER:  Let -- let me address thatquestion in two parts.  The first part you'vementioned, Justice Ginsburg, is whether it matters thatthe -- that the operator is not a police officer, and41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 we submit 234no.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, I didn't say that.MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I said that the call wasby the victim.  It wasn't a -- a police5 initiated6 officer coming to interview her.7 MR. FISHER: I see. Well, we don't believe,8 under the proper conception of the Confrontation9 Clause, it matters who the accusatory statement is10 initiated by. Certainly we believe the Confrontation11 Clause should apply if Ms. McCottry had simply walked12 out of her house and walked down the street to the13 police station and voluntarily walked into the14 sheriff's office and said, I want to report what Mr.15 Davis just did. What we -- what we suggest here today16 is there's no difference if she simply calls on the17 telephone to a 911 operator, which the State itself in18 its brief calls a conduit to the police, and so when19 the -- when the police and when the State have set up a20 system for people to report calls more expeditiously --21 I'm sorry22 think the2324 things that I think go together. That is, this is not25 just a call. This is a cry for help.-- report crimes more expeditiously, we don'tanswer is any different.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're splitting up two51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. FISHER: Well, there -- in -- in a sense,2 of course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same3 time she's reporting a crime, but the -- the mere fact4 that the two are intertwined does not take us outside5 the Confrontation Clause. Of course, in the Indiana6 case that you're going to hear, you're going to hear7 the same thing, that the person is asking for help in8 the same way. So when somebody makes a call, which we9 might call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call, the10 question that we think this Court should ask is whether11 -- whether that's the kind of a statement, first of12 all, that historically would have been viewed as13 implicating the Confrontation Clause. And if you look14 at the hue -- the old hue and cry practice that we've15 referred to in our briefs, Sir Matthew Hale in his16 treatise explains that when somebody went and got the17 local constable, what they were doing is they were18 seeking help, first and foremost, to apprehend a felon,19 and more than that, they were also reporting the crime20 in the first instance.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it your argument that any22 statement made to law enforcement is testimonial?23 MR. FISHER: Well, you certainly don't have24 to go that far in this case, Your Honor, but -- but we25 believe --61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that's what you2 said in your argument when you started off.3 MR. FISHER: Certainly any statement4 describing criminal activity to a law enforcement5 officer would be testimonial.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you started out by7 saying that the purpose of the Confrontation Clause was8 to keep out the accusations made out of court, but I9 would have thought that was the purpose of the hearsay10 rule. And if that's the purpose of the hearsay rule,11 how does the Confrontation Clause differ?12 MR. FISHER: The purpose of the hearsay rule,13 Justice Breyer, is to police the reliability of out-of-14 court statements. What this Court said in Crawford is15 the Confrontation Clause is something much different.16 It regulates the manner of taking testimony in criminal17 trials.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it's not the purpose19 of the Confrontation Clause to keep out out-of-court20 accusations. Only some, and which, and what's the21 rule?22 MR. FISHER: Well, we believe the rule is, is23 that any accusatory statement to a law enforcement24 officer or to an agent of the law -- of law enforcement25 --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you do believe that,2 but I want to know why in terms of the purposes of not3 the hearsay --4 MR. FISHER: Well, the --5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- rather the confrontation.6 MR. FISHER: -- the history of the7 confrontation right, going back even prior to the8 framer, was to bring the accuser and the accused face9 to face so that the accuser made his or her accusation10 in the presence of the accused and subject to cross11 examination. And the very heart of the Confrontation12 Clause, which this Court has said itself over and over13 again is to require the accuser to -- to deliver the14 accusation in court, and so accusatory statements,15 those that say he did it, this is what happened, this16 is what I saw, are different than ordinary hearsay.17 And -- and I -- to take an example from -- that we18 talked about in the Crawford argument, Justice Breyer,19 when somebody says pass the -- pass the pewter urn from20 the mantle, that's where Bob keeps the drugs, that's21 the kind of a statement that is very different than22 pointing the finger at somebody to a law enforcement23 agent.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I point the finger25 in an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 know. I -- I don't want to get involved. I'm in a2 foreign country. I sign my name. I even do it under3 oath, and I send it right to the judge that's trying4 the case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the5 judge. You don't think the Confrontation Clause would6 cover that?7 MR. FISHER: Absolutely, Justice Scalia, I --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your thesis that9 it applies to just accusatory statements to a law10 enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.11 MR. FISHER: It does, and what I'm giving you12 is a -- a rule that I think is the kernel, the heart of13 the confrontation right. You don't have to say much14 more than that if it's --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about --16 what if you -- what if somebody runs out of the -- the17 house? There are two people standing in the yard, a18 law enforcement officer and the next-door neighbor.19 She yells at the next-door neighbor, he's trying to20 kill me, and then he comes out. Is that covered by21 your rule? It's not to a law enforcement officer.22 It's to the next-door neighbor, but the law enforcement23 officer overhears it.24 MR. FISHER: I think statements that law25 enforcement officer merely overhear may not be91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 testimonial, and one of the reasons for that is this2 Court's Bourjaily decision, which it cited with3 approval in Crawford, is if somebody make -- if4 somebody makes statements that tend out -- that turn5 out to be incriminating in a criminal case, the mere6 fact that they're overheard by law enforcement officers7 or even an undercover officer eliciting the statement8 is in a different scenario, Mr. Chief Justice, than9 somebody making a statement to law enforcement or even10 -- and I want to make sure I understand your11 hypothetical. If the person realized that a police12 officer was standing there and hearing what she was13 telling her neighbor, we may then have a testimonial14 situation.15 But in this case what we have is not simply a16 blurting out or a cry for help. In fact, Ms. McCottry17 never asked for help. She said she didn't need an aid18 car. What we have are a series of 26 questions that19 the 911 operator asked Ms. McCottry that established20 every element of the crime the court -- I'm sorry --21 that the State ultimately proved.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was she calling 911 for23 if she didn't want help?24 MR. FISHER: Well --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, she -- she wanted101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 something from 911. What did she -- what did she want?2 Did she want the police to come over and arrest her3 husband? Was that -- or --4 MR. FISHER: I think that's a fair inference,5 Justice Scalia. Of course, we don't know because she6 was never -- she's never herself submitted to cross7 examination. But there are mandatory arrest laws in8 the State of Washington. She had a no-contact order9 against Mr. Davis, both of which10 would understand that a call for11 tantamount to a call for arrest.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You13 don't know, but you -- that's slightly in conflict with14 what you said earlier. They asked 26 questions. How15 long was this telephone conversation between the 91116 operator and the victim?17 MR. FISHER: It's about 4 minutes, Justice18 Ginsburg. And it's not -- what we submit is -- of19 course, we've given you in the joint appendix the20 structured protocol that the 911 operator was following21 in this case, and we submit that it's not mere22 happenstance that the 911 call was able to establish23 every element of the crime, right down to Mr. Davis'24 birth date that the prosecutor referred to in her25 closing argument that the 911 operator elicited from111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOa reasonable person911 would besaid -- you said we￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Ms. McCottry.  And, indeed, the only question --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought thatwas -- I thought that was to determine if there wereoutstanding orders and warrants against the individual.          MR. FISHER:  It may be, and that may beanother example, Mr. Chief Justice, of a -- of a --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's related --that's related to sending people to prevent crime asopposed to gathering evidence to be used to convict.          MR. FISHER:  I don't want to dispute that 911operators in this situation, just like respondingofficers, are gathering information for dual purposes. They may well be trying to resolve an ongoing threatof a felon at large.  At the same time, of course, allof the information and training manuals that we'veprovided to you in the reply brief make it clear thatfrom the initial contact with the alleged victim, theyare gathering evidence all the while.          And in fact, the only thing you can think of-- at least, I can't think of a single question that aprosecutor might have asked at a trial that the 911operator didn't ask here.  The only questions thatreally immediately come to mind are ones that mighthave been asked in cross examination.  For example --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the only 121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 question -- what if a 911 caller says nothing more2 than, in a very excited way, someone is attacking me,3 send a police officer right away to make the person4 stop attacking me? Is that testimonial?5 MR. FISHER: To the extent that the person is6 saying someone is attacking me, that kernel may -- may7 well be testimonial, Justice Alito. However, if8 somebody calls 911 and says, please send help to 9119 Main -- or 3312 Main Street, that may well not be10 testimonial. And that -- a mere cry for help -- and11 this goes to Justice Ginsburg's question as well. A12 simple cry for help may -- may not be testimonial.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But a simple cry for help14 that doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an15 immediate response on the part of the police. This16 kind of call, I need help now, and the information that17 comes with it is likely to be given priority attention18 as this very call was.19 MR. FISHER: I think that's a fair inference,20 but the -- the priority attention, in terms of going21 and apprehending Mr. Davis, is exactly what triggers22 criminal justice system and exactly what makes the kind23 of a statement, the one that the -- one that the24 Confrontation Clause should care about.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have any --131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not2 sending someone -- they're not sending someone to3 apprehend Mr. Davis. They're sending someone to4 prevent him from attacking his wife.5 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure it's easy to6 separate one from the other, Mr. Chief Justice. The7 way that they are doing that is by arresting him. They8 have a mandatory arrest law in Washington that says9 that the way that the police must respond to a call10 like this is to arrest --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? I12 -- I guess in an awful lot of these cases there's a13 mixed motive: protection and enforcement. Is it14 your view that whenever there's a mixed motive, it15 becomes inadmissible?16 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Stevens. It's our17 view that you really ought not be looking or focusing18 on the police officer motive or on the governmental19 agent's motive for the very reason that you start to20 get into these knotty questions of what exactly were21 they trying to accomplish. And we believe a better22 -- a better default than -- if you can't simply answer23 it by looking at history and precedent, is to look more24 towards the declarant's reasonable expectation. And25 that's what this Court does in the Fifth Amendment when141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in doing that, do you3 distinguish, for example, between the -- the4 expectation that lies behind a merely excited5 utterance, on the one hand, and the expectation or lack6 of expectation that would qualify -- that would be the7 case in a -- in a true res gestae statement in the very8 strict sense? So that, you know, if -- if the attack9 had occurred 30 minutes beforehand and -- and the10 victim is saying on the telephone to the police, Adrian11 is trying to kill me, that would be -- that -- that12 wouldn't -- would not be admissible, I take it, on --13 on your view under the Confrontation Clause. And yet,14 if in the course of the 911 call, Adrian was battering15 the -- the -- you know, the victim over the head with16 something and she blurted out the same statement, he's17 trying to kill me, would the -- would the latter be18 admissible in your case --19 MR. FISHER: The20 JUSTICE SOUTER:21 MR. FISHER: I'm22 JUSTICE SOUTER:23 your theory.latter ---- under your theory?sorry.I'm sorry.  I misspoke.  On24 MR. FISHER: The25 Justice Souter. I think you're right insofar as it --latter is a very close case, 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it can be important to distinguish between a modern-day2 excited utterance and what would have been considered a3 res gestae type statement at common law.4 Certainly if you take away the 911 call from5 your hypothetical and she says, please don't hurt me,6 Adrian, that may well be the kind of a statement that7 would be inside the res gestae. Once somebody picks up8 the phone to call 911, that, by my reading of the9 historical cases, turns it into a report or a10 narrative.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that the answer to my12 question is there would be no distinction between13 merely excited utterance 30 seconds later and the14 utterance in the course of in -- in my hypo.the15 MR. FISHER: We believe16 making a report to a third party,17 distinction. Now, of course, you18 with that in this case because --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say according to your20 reading of the cases, but you really don't have a case21 like this. You -- you have a case where, after the22 fact, the -- the victim went to a constable or to some23 other official to report the event, and perhaps to seek24 help against the person who -- but you don't have25 anything where really, in the course -- in the course 161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOthat as long asthere ought notdon't have to wrestleit is be a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the attack or -- or while the person is still atleast under threat, a -- a constable is -- is called,do you?          MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Scalia, of course,we didn't have telephone technology, so --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You could have -- you couldhave somebody walking by -- a policeman walking byoutside.          MR. FISHER:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the victim shouting, youknow, please, somebody help me, Harry is beating me.You don't have a case like that.  So -- so I don't knowwhy we should flop one side rather than the other onthis -- on this case that -- that doesn't seem coveredby -- by the old jurisprudence.  Why should we go yourway on it and say that it -- it falls within theprohibition rather than say it falls outside theprohibition?          MR. FISHER:  Well, for two reasons, JusticeScalia.  One is we do have the hue and cry scenariothat we've talked about.case.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that's not thisMR. FISHER:  And we think the fair --JUSTICE SCALIA:  That --171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. FISHER: It's not exactly on all fours2 with this case, but we think the fair inference, when3 you read the treatises and the reasons why those kinds4 of statements were kept out, is that if they simply --5 if the police or their agents were able to get the6 statement7 have been89 people made fresh accusations or cry-outs to privatejust a little bit sooner, the answer wouldthe same.And we do have cases, Justice Scalia, where10 parties to -- to another -- to a witness who wasn't11 even associated with law enforcement, and we have a12 whole section of our brief pointing out that for13 decades after the founding, even those kinds of14 statements were kept out of evidence in criminal trials15 for the reason --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because of the -- because of17 the Confrontation Clause you think?18 MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I think it's a fair19 inference, Justice Scalia, from reading the historical20 precedent and the treatises that describe it. They --21 they describe these as, in -- in a sense, second-class22 testimony. They say the problem with statements like23 this, if they're made even seconds after the event in24 place, is that they're -- at that point they're nothing25 more than a narrative and require us to give credit to181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 a statement -- and this is the words the treatise2 writers used to use -- that was not given under the3 ordinary tests for determining the accuracy of4 testimony. And when they used the word like testimony5 and they talk about the usual tests and the customary6 way of testing out-of-court statements, I think the7 fair inference is they're referring to the right to8 confrontation.9 Perhaps another way to think about this is to10 take a step back and say, what if we decide that11 statements like this are not testimonial? The12 practical -- the practical impact of that is not simply13 that these statements won't -- will come in, but that14 prosecutors and -- prosecutors, Federal and State15 government, will have no incentive whatsoever to ever16 bring 911 callers into court. It -- it is -- across17 State hearsay law across the country, these are deemed18 excited utterances. So if this Court were to say --19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not --20 that's not true at all. I mean, if -- if the -- the21 witness may be a good witness and compelling on the22 stand, they may have every incentive to bring her in in23 person. This is only addressed to the situations where24 the witness is unwilling or unable to testify.25 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think you191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 got to the heart of the matter when you said that if2 it's a good witness, the prosecutor will put them on.3 The flip side of that is that if the witness isn't so4 good, the prosecutor would have every incentive at5 least not to put them on the stand. Why would somebody6 put on a stand -- put somebody on a stand that doesn't7 seem perhaps credible or maybe subject to impeachment8 when they have, in a sense, testimony in a sealed tape9 recorder already?10 JUSTICE11 could summon that12 witness' location13 MR. FISHER: Well, the defendant --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And could find out from the15 prosecution where that witness was, I assume.SCALIA:  Well, I assume the defendant-- that witness if -- if thatwas known.  No?16 MR. FISHER: The defendant might be able to17 do that. But, of course, that would -- treating the18 case this way would collapse the confrontation right19 into the Compulsory Process Clause. The confrontation20 right is a right not to be able to bring witnesses into21 court. It's to be confronted with the witnesses22 against --23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice Scalia's24 question raises the -- the point. The reason these25 witnesses are not there is not because of anything that201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the government has done.  It's -- it's the concern theyhave, the particular domestic abuse situation.  It'snot the government that is keeping these witnesses out. They're not relying on the 911 calls as a matter ofpreference.          MR. FISHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I thinkyour assumption may not be entirely correct.  There's a-- there's a portion from, for example, the San Diegoprosecutor's office decided, and I believe in the NACDLbrief, that says oftentimes they do prefer to -- toleave the witness off the stand because they have abetter case just using the -- the excited utterancetype statements.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there -- is there --suppose the defendant procured the witness' absence bya threat.          MR. FISHER:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then the 911 statementcould come in.  Right?          MR. FISHER:  That's right.  That's right.And perhaps -- and this gets back to the ChiefJustice's question as well.  It helps maybe to separatethese kinds of cases into three categories.          We first have the category that theprosecution would prefer not to put the person on the211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 stand. We think there the Confrontation Clause ought2 to require them to do so.3 We -- we next have the category where the4 defendant, as you say, procures the witness' absence.5 We don't dispute that in that scenario the forfeiture6 doctrine kicks in, which this Court reaffirmed in7 Crawford. We don't have any forfeiture question in8 this case.9 And then we have perhaps the gray area, where10 a witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's,11 and this Court has said over and over again that there12 the confrontation right puts the onus onto the13 prosecution.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those are -- those are15 three neat legal categories. The practical reality, is16 it not so, is that many women in these situations are17 scared to death of what will happen to them or they're18 so insecure financially that they think they have to19 put up with the battering? So your neat legal20 categories really don't conform to what happens in21 people's lives who are in this situation.22 MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't want23 to be insensitive to -- to witnesses in this situation.24 Of course, reluctant witnesses is nothing new, but --25 but in domestic violence, it's an acute problem.221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 However, we believe the proper way to deal2 with that situation is by this Court developing its3 forfeiture doctrine. The Sixth Amendment applies4 across the board to all criminal cases, Justice5 Ginsburg, and we've cited, for example, in the appendix6 to our reply brief about 30 cases from the last couple7 years that have been handled in a victimless fashion8 like this910 would you 111213 interested in that because I thought it sounded good.14 Then I thought about it. I thought to have forfeiture,15 you'd have to show that this defendant, in fact, forced16 the wife not to testify. It's a crime to do that. So17 you'd have to prove another crime against the defendant18 in order to prove the first crime. And I thought19 perhaps that doctrine is not very practical. You tell20 me why it is.21 MR. FISHER: Well, that's already what22 happens under the Federal Rules of Evidence and under23 the evidence of many States, that there is a rule of24 forfeiture by wrongdoing. And so --25 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. My point231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOthat are not domestic violence cases --JUSTICE BREYER:  How would you do that?  Howdo that forfeiture?MR. FISHER:  Pardon me?JUSTICE BREYER:  How would you do that?  I'm￼1 is that to prove the wrongdoing would probably be even2 harder than to prove the original crime. All we know3 is the wife isn't there.4 MR. FISHER: I'm not --5 JUSTICE BREYER: And we suspect that she's6 afraid of her husband. He may have offered to cut off7 financial aid, said goodbye, no money, or he may have8 done worse. I'm just saying you're telling us that9 because the prosecution can prove that in court and10 only then will it be able to introduce the testimony11 given beforehand by the missing wife.12 MR. FISHER: Well, I think --13 JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work?14 MR. FISHER: Well, I think we have -- Justice15 Breyer, like in lots of other scenarios, you have a16 pretrial hearing, and at that pretrial hearing, of17 course, the rules of evidence don't strictly apply the18 way they would in the guilt phase. So in this very19 case, if you look at the joint appendix, when -- when20 on the eve of trial Ms. McCottry is no longer going to21 show up for trial, the prosecutor says, I want to22 subpoena the jail records and I want to talk to the23 victim's advocate to find out whether she's been24 intimidated or kept away. So the prosecutor herself25 tells the court how she's going to look for this241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425evidence.  If she had found anything, presumably shewould have presented it and she could have presented itthat way.  And it's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe we should just -- justsuspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse casesinstead of designing the entire application of theConfrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of whatseems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.          MR. FISHER:  Well, of course, Justice Scalia,the Sixth Amendment says all criminal prosecutions --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand.          MR. FISHER:  -- and domestic violence casesare criminal prosecutions.  So we don't think --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I suppose we could alsohave said that the Sixth Amendment, like some otheramendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions --          MR. FISHER:  That's right, but we've --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- or the ConfrontationClause portion of it, anyway --          MR. FISHER:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:   -- which would exempt spousalabuse cases, by and large, until we -- until we enact aFederal spousal abuse statute, which -- which may welloccur.  It seems to me there -- there are better ways to-- to solve this problem than to design the whole251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Confrontation Clause jurisprudence on the basis of what2 happens in spousal abuse cases.3 MR. FISHER: I think that's a fair comment.4 And let -- let me say there are two -- there5 are many ways that you can do that, Justice Scalia, and6 two of them were readily available to the State in this7 case. One is even when a witness goes missing or is8 unwilling to testify in a hard case, there may well be9 other ways to prove the case. Here, the caller said --1011 I thought 121314 relevant is just what you're about to address. They're15 evidentiary of the problem that exists when you bring16 something within the Confrontation Clause. Prior to17 Crawford, even though it was within the clause, if it18 fell within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay19 rule, it could come in. So you could bring in co-20 conspirators before the conspiracy ended. You could21 bring in, for sure, excited utterances. You could22 bring in all kinds of things that now, no matter how23 reliable, you24 MR.25 but --1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400have to keep them out.FISHER:  That's right, Justice Breyer,26Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE BREYER:  This is true, but the reasonspousal abuse cases are relevant --MR. FISHER:  Pardon me?JUSTICE BREYER:  A reason I thought they were￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: And so that is a problem2 that you have to address in respect to drawing a fairly3 narrow line, and I want to know what that narrow line4 is with spousal abuse and other cases in mind.5 MR. FISHER: Let me give you two ways this6 case, if -- if we assume the State's version of7 events is correct, could have easily been proved.8 One is that the caller said that a man named9 Mike was at her house during the entire event. When10 the police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later,11 they never even got Mike's last name. And, of course,12 Justice Breyer, the reason why is because they were13 probably thinking of the Roberts framework and that14 they wouldn't need this witness, but good old-fashioned15 police work would have presumably found a witness that16 witnessed the whole event that they could have put on17 the stand.1819 this case20 that they21 State says is correct that Ms. McCottry was cooperating22 up until the last minute, that's a classic scenario23 where, by way of having a preliminary hearing and24 subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary25 hearing, they could have preserved her testimony. This271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOThe second thing the State could have done inis they could have filed the case in a wayobtained a preliminary hearing.  If what the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court in California against Green and Roberts itselfsaid that those kinds of prior pretrial crossexamination scenarios are good enough to satisfy theConfrontation Clause.          And if the Court has no further questions,I'll reserve the remainder of my time.Fisher.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Mr. Whisman.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. WHISMAN     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. WHISMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may itplease the Court:          In this 911 call, the operator asked a shortseries of questions, nearly all phrased in the presenttense.  Each question was objectively and reasonablynecessary to respond to an apparent emergency.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Like what is his name?  Imean, that's the present tense.  Not what wasor what will be his name.  What is his name?that's the present tense.  So that shows thatall seeking help.his nameYou thinkthis is          MR. WHISMAN:  No, a number of otherquestions, Justice Scalia, were answered -- were askedin the present -- present tense too.  And, in fact, the281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 operator, shortly after asking the first questions, one2 of the first things that she said was help was on the3 way and then continued with a series of questions. But4 as the interview continued, of course, every single5 question and every single answer was captured on the6 tape for a jury or a judge to later hear. The call7 ended after the operator knew that Ms. McCottry had her8 door locked, that Davis had left, and that the9 officer's arrival was imminent.10 We ask -- respectfully ask this Court, under11 these circumstances, to hold that the use of this12 powerful evidence, without live testimony from the13 declarant, was constitutionally permissible.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, powerful is part15 of the problem. This -- this kind of telephone call16 evidence is even more powerful than -- than the kind of17 a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it18 was testimonial. I mean, to hear -- to hear the voice19 on the phone makes it, if it is -- if it is20 impermissible under the Confrontation Clause, it makes21 it even a22 violation23 Raleigh's2425 disagree,more damaging violation than the kind ofthat -- that occurred in -- in Sir Waltercase, for example.MR. WHISMAN:  Well, I'd respectfullyYour Honor, although I'd -- I'd first note 291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that -- that I think the if clause in Your Honor's2 question is telling. And I think if that -- that3 doesn't necessarily define whether it's testimonial or4 not. But to address --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -- would you6 rather put the woman on -- if you had a choice, would7 you rather put the woman on the stand?8 MR. WHISMAN: Absolutely, Your Honor, and --9 and --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Rather than have her -- her11 voice on the telephone call --12 MR. WHISMAN: Well, if I had to --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when she is -- she is in14 -- in -- supposedly in great fear of -- of her husband15 and -- and -- I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone16 call.17 MR. WHISMAN: If you're asking me which would18 I chose --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a prosecutor.20 MR. WHISMAN: Well, if I had to chose, that21 would be a difficult choice, obviously, but our plan,22 of course, was to --2324 choice. 25JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it would be an easyMR. WHISMAN: Our -- our plan was to do both, 301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 and it wasn't until the eve of trial that we learned2 that the complaining witness, Ms. McCottry, wasn't3 going to appear. And I think that the circumstances --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did you subpoena her5 at that point?6 MR. WHISMAN: She was already subpoenaed,7 Your Honor, and the prosecutor brought in the8 detective. The detective attempt -- made numerous9 attempts to get a hold of her, checked her last known10 address. The person there didn't know where she was.11 We had one phone number for her. She wasn't responding12 to the telephone calls pursuant13 number. So we made a number of14 documented in the record to get15 learned that -- that she didn't16 Now, at that point --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your -- your18 position is not that anything that she says or anything19 anyone says in a 911 call is -- is consistent with the20 Confrontation Clause.21 MR. WHISMAN: That's right, Your Honor. It's22 conceivable that you could have statements made in the23 course of a 911 call that wouldn't be testimonial.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is your --25 what is your test? We have your friend saying any311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto our calls to thatefforts that areher to court, once weappear.￼1 accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer.2 What -- what is your proposal?3 MR. WHISMAN: Our focus, Your Honor, is, as I4 think this Court focused in Crawford on whether or not5 the government's practice resembles the inquisitorial6 abuses. In other words, did you have -- in the modern7 sense, did you have a structured police interrogation8 such that the interrogator or the questioner might have9 in some way shaped the witness' testimony.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher tells us11 that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes12 through the elements of the crime in a very structured13 way.14 MR. WHISMAN: Well, I -- I think if you15 listen to the tape itself, you'll conclude that's not16 the case. I mean, in fact, each question that the --17 that the operator asked was reasonably and objectively18 designed to facilitate a quick response and to solve19 the emergency that was apparent.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's not overread21 Crawford. Crawford didn't say that the only thing the22 Confrontation Clause was directed at was the kind of23 abuse that -- that occurred in the case of Sir Walter24 Raleigh. It said that that was the principal abuse at25 which it was directed. I doubt very much, unless you321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 think otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation2 from the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the3 affidavit, and gave it to the police, I doubt whether4 that would have been allowed under the Confrontation5 Clause. Do you think it would have?6 MR. WHISMAN: Well, it may not have, Your7 Honor, but the -- under the test that we're proposing,8 the -- we're placing the focus on situations like this,9 situations roughly analogous -- situations that are10 distinguishable from what you had with Sylvia Crawford.11 And I think that although -- although our test may not12 cover every conceivable hypothetical, I think that, as13 this Court recognized in Crawford, defining testimonial14 was going15 time, and1617 example I 182021 should be22232425 but it should1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400to be a -- a task that was going to take some--JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your test wouldn't cover thejust gave.MR. WHISMAN: Yes, right -- that's right, Your 19 Honor. Our test would not --JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you think that thatadmissible in a criminal trial?MR. WHISMAN:  No, I don't.  I think it --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --MR.WHISMAN:  -- that should be inadmissible,be inadmissible because of the rules of33Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 hearsay. And I think in most States in the Union, it2 would be inadmissible. I can't think of a hearsay3 example that would permit it.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, now the person disappears5 afterwards, is unavailable.6 MR. WHISMAN: Fair enough. But it's not an7 excited utterance. It's not a present sense8 impression. I can't imagine a hearsay exception that9 would admit it, which is really what brings us back to10 the core of our theory, too, and that is that -- that11 under the Confrontation Clause, as defined in Crawford,12 we now have an absolute rule covering a finite --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't imagine that that14 wouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause15 --16 MR. WHISMAN: Well --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- such -- such an obvious18 violation of your right to confront your accuser, and19 just because it was presented to the police without --20 without an initial interrogation by the police, I don't21 think that would have made any difference at common22 law.23 MR. WHISMAN: And -- and, Your Honor, it may24 be that at some point the Court expands the definition25 in -- in Crawford of testimonial -- formalized341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 testimonial materials to include something like that,2 but I think that in situations where you have an3 encounter between police and citizen and statements4 result, then I think it's fair to focus on the5 interaction and whether or not the -- the person was6 trying to shape the testimony.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree that that's the8 extreme, but you're urging us to -- to adopt a test9 that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the10 hypothetical I just gave you. And you -- you can11 accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose12 this case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing13 is -- is really quite extreme.14 MR. WHISMAN: Well, Your Honor, as I say, the15 test we're proposing I think would cover the majority16 of cases. The hypothetical that Your Honor posed was17 -- is -- is itself I think somewhat unusual. We -- we18 do not get statements of that nature. We do not see19 them being offered into evidence. And as I say, I20 think that if -- if we saw cases like that, if we saw21 statements that were admitted, there may be other ways22 under the clause that the Court could interpret the23 Confrontation Clause to exclude them.24 I'm not arguing for the admissibility of that25 evidence. Quite frankly, I've never in my life even351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 seen a piece of evidence like that offered. All I'm2 saying is that I don't believe it falls under this3 narrow definition of the Confrontation Clause that you4 outlined in the Crawford case.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't you incorporate6 what the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you7 draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are8 calling for -- for immediate help?9 MR. WHISMAN: We certainly don't have any10 objections to the Solicitor General's approach, Your11 Honor, and -- and in fact, in some ways, because we're12 analyzing a case like this that arose in an emergency13 circumstance, I think that it's clear that -- that14 statements that are made in those circumstances, just15 by their very nature, aren't going to be testimonial.16 People don't testify in an emergency. We chose not to17 take that approach doctrinally just because we didn't18 think it was as closely tied to the approach the Court19 took in Crawford. But I think it's certainly20 consistent with the strategy outlined by the Solicitor21 General.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do we do about23 the -- about the fact, which I don't think you -- you24 deny and -- and the -- the other side points out in25 both of these cases that, in fact, police departments361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 have their responders to the 911 number intentionally2 ask a series of questions that gives them all the3 information they need to conduct a prosecution? In4 other words, they are using 911 as a -- as a5 prosecutorial device.6 MR. WHISMAN: Well, I think that overstates7 the empirical evidence, Your Honor. I think that if8 you look at the training manual in this case that we9 attached to our briefing in the Supreme Court and refer10 to our briefing, if you look at the way that this11 interview was conducted, it's clear that these12 operators are not, as a routine matter, using the 91113 process to develop evidence.14 In fact, in this case you'll note that --15 that after the short 4-minute period, the operator16 didn't say, well, stay on the line with me a little bit17 more and let's talk about the background situation18 here. And she didn't do that because her training, as19 documented in the training materials from the Valley20 Communications Center, said don't get caught up in the21 background information that led to this event because22 it can distract you in getting the information that23 needs to be transferred to the police department right24 away. And I think that that is a perfectly reasonable25 and really the -- the better approach for a 911371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 operator. So even though --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did -- did she wait until3 after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she --4 she have the police on the way after the first minute?5 MR. WHISMAN: It sounds as though that she6 dispatched them immediately, Your Honor, because --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: She -- she's just typed8 that out on the computer or something like that?9 MR. WHISMAN: That's right. And, in fact,10 there are some times when you can hear all three voices11 on the 911 tape, not in this instance. But as I said,12 almost immediately after the call began, she said, help13 is on the way, that's because you can dispatch but14 still obtain information, for example, the date of15 birth. And as Mr. Chief Justice indicated, date of16 birth of the defendant and name, et cetera are17 extremely important so that in those 4 minutes that it18 -- coincidentally, it was also 4 minutes before the19 police officer arrived -- they can be determining20 whether or not the defendant has criminal history.21 They can determine whether or not, from their records22 available to them in their police car, whether or not the23 defendant has a history of assaults against police24 officers, whether or not he has a -- a history of25 carrying weapons, et cetera. So that's all information381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that the operators are trained to -- to obtain and then2 to transfer to the police as soon as possible.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And she's -- she's in4 ongoing -- the operator is in ongoing contact with the5 people she's -- the operator has dispatched. Right?6 MR. WHISMAN: Correct, Your Honor, and that's7 why -- that's why ordinarily the operator doesn't8 terminate the call until the police have arrived on the9 scene. Here it appears that she terminated the call10 somewhat contemporaneously with their arrival. She --11 she indicates that the police are there and they'll12 look around for him quickly and then come and check13 her.14 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you have to say15 about the failure to inquire about Mike?16 MR. WHISMAN: Your Honor, I -- I don't think17 that's as significant as Petitioner suggests. If you18 look at the record, in the pretrial testimony of19 Officer Jones, he asked Ms. McCottry, upon arrival,20 repeatedly did she know who this other person was, and21 her answer was she didn't know the person's last name.22 The record isn't fully developed on that point, but it23 sounds like that -- that Mike was a friend of the24 defendant's. And we know for sure that Mike left with25 the defendant. I think it's reasonable to infer he391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 also came with the defendant, but we didn't have any2 particular contact or handle on this person Mike.3 And in fact, if it was a friend of the4 defendant, you'd think that the Compulsory Process5 Clause would have given the defendant some basis on6 which to bring him before the court. I don't think7 that that includes any of the -- that -- that doesn't8 somehow shift the burden on the defendant in the same9 way it might if were to force him to bring the10 declarant in. If he knew Mike, he -- he certainly had11 the ability to bring Mike in. So I don't think it's as12 significant as Petitioner suggests.13 Your Honor, I -- I do want to return for just14 one moment to this notion that we don't want witnesses15 to testify and that we are satisfied with proceeding16 just on -- on the basis of other pieces of evidence.17 At least in my practice and at least in our county,18 that's definitely not true. In fact, even if we have a19 recanting witness in, for example, the domestic20 violence abuse scenario -- situation, it is often just21 as effective for us to go ahead and put -- put the22 witness up on the stand, let her tell whatever story23 she's presently telling, and then play the 911 -- 91124 tape also in conjunction with the testimony of the25 officers who can describe what -- what condition she401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 was in when they arrived. And I think when you2 juxtapose the 911 tape, even with the recantation from3 the witness, frankly sometimes the jurors find it even4 more illuminating than -- than if she didn't appear.5 So we do not spend our time trying to put together6 cases purposely without the victim testifying. It just7 so happens that sometimes, at the last minute like this8 case, we're not able to bring the person in.9 But I think --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: How -- how often does this11 happen? In other words, are we being asked to, in12 effect, on your part to -- to recognize or to derive a13 special rule for cases which, at least numerically, are14 sports?15 MR. WHISMAN: Your Honor, I do -- I cannot16 answer in a percentage terms how often this happens.17 But, you know, that you have a reluctant witness in18 domestic violence cases is a -- is a not unusual19 occurrence in any event. But I don't think that --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but I'm talking about21 the witness who is not merely reluctant, but simply22 doesn't show up and you make reasonable efforts and you23 -- and you can't find the witness.

WHISMAN: Well, I -- I think the other16 factor that has to be considered, Your Honor, is as soon17 -- as soon as defendants realize that merely pressuring18 the victim into not appearing will put an end to the19 case, then it gives the defendant the increased20 incentive to put the pressure on the victim and cases21 that otherwise would have pled won't.

DREEBEN   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 8 please the Court:9 A panic-stricken call for help, which can10 occur on a 911 call, is not a form of bearing witness11 within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause that12 activates the rule in Crawford. Emergency statements,13 statements that are made to 911 operators and to14 officers at the scene investigating an urgent need to15 protect a person's safety, do not resemble the classic16 forms of testimonial evidence that were generated under17 the Marian statutes and the civil law practice that18 formed the impetus for the Confrontation Clause. In19 three significant respects, statements that are made in20 emergency questioning differ from the kind of testimony21 that prompted the rule in Crawford and the22 confrontation right that it rests on.23 First of all, in the classic examples of24 someone giving testimony, which this Court noted means25 a solemn declaration or affirmation for the purpose of431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 proving a fact, people who are on 911 calls or2 help at the scene of an -- an urgent situation3 making statements for the purpose of providing4 in a case. They are making statements for the5 of obtaining help, and that distinguishes them6 significantly from the kinds of subtle desires7 and influence their statements that occur --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe.9 it's easy to imagine a 911 call that doesn't fit your10 description. You know, the person is trying to get in11 the door. The call is -- you know, this is the fourth12 time. I keep calling and I've talked to you about13 this. You don't do anything. He's got to be locked up14 so this will stop. I mean, that's not -- that sounds15 more like testimony than an immediate call for help.16 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, we would17 distinguish between those kinds of 911 calls where18 someone is seeking protection from an imminent or19 present threat to their safety and a 911 call that's20 making a more generalized report of criminal activity21 or a desire for safety and maybe speaking in a22 narrative 2324 the house25 this callform about the past.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the husband had lefthere, as I understand it, when this -- whenoccurred.441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOseekingare notevidencepurposeto shapeI mean,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. DREEBEN:  Actually, Justice --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  She -- she wanted the manarrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?          MR. DREEBEN:  Actually, Justice Scalia, Ibelieve when the call begins, the caller is speaking inthe present tense and says, he's here jumping on meagain. And the 911 operator then begins to elicitinformation to find out what is the level of the threatto her safety and what actions need to be taken andsays, okay, I've got help started.  Help is on the way. Now, tell me what his name is, and she -- the -- thecaller tells what the name is of the defendant and, atthat point, says, he's running now.  And so, it's onlyafter critical information is imparted at the beginningof the call that the caller says that he's leaving.But even --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then what -- what's yourposition if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he'sleft, and he's running down the block?          MR. DREEBEN:  I think in that situation,Justice Kennedy, there is still an imminent threatenedpotential of a recurrence.  The person could come back. There's no protection on the scene.  The reason thatshe's callingcare provider911 and not a friend or -- or a healthis that she believes she needs protection45Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 right then. And the -- the nature of an emergency is2 such that it exerts a pressure both on the person who3 is seeking help, as well as the official responder from4 the government, to solve that urgent problem. Any5 evidentiary benefit that may come from that is really6 an incidental --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose8 it's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond9 necklace and he's running -- and he's running away. We10 know he's not going to come back.11 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that situation would12 not fall within the emergency rule that the Government13 is arguing for today. What we're arguing for is a rule14 that deals when people's safety is --1516 owner who17 911, that18 your view?19 MR. DREEBEN: No. I'm not saying that,20 Justice Kennedy. I'm saying that the Court isn't21 confronted in this case with a situation in which22 threats not to the person but to property or the need23 to obtain or try to apprehend a fleeing felon are24 present.25JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the -- the jewelry storereports to the -- the police is fleeing on a-- that's not -- that's not admissible underJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what about 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the -- my hypothetical?          MR. DREEBEN:  We would submit that that isnot testimonial within the meaning of Crawford for manyof the same reasons that -- that are present in thiscase.  But it is a different case from this.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you mean by seekinghelp?  I mean, it seems to me you're saying seekinghelp means trying to get somebody arrested, trying toget somebody who has harmed you arrested.  In thiscase, he was gone out of the house.  She had gone andlocked the door before she came back to the phone andgave most of this testimony.          MR. DREEBEN:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and in the -- in thejeweler case, the guy is running down the street.  Whatis the jeweler -- is the jeweler really worried aboutthe guy turning around and coming back to rob somemore?  He wants the man arrested.          MR. DREEBEN:  The urgency certainly in -- inthe jewelry thief hypothetical does deal withapprehending the person who has just stolen the goods. And that's why I say that it falls outside of the rulethat the Government is arguing for today.          But, Justice Scalia, I think --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm concerned about the471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 rule you're arguing today because it -- it seems to me2 there's a good case for allowing the -- the statement3 by the jewelry store operator.4 MR. DREEBEN: I think there is a good --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and I want to know6 what your position is so that you don't come back next7 week and say, well, now we want the jewelry store --8 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I'm not going to say that9 we wouldn't, depending on how the Court analyzes this10 case, argue for a submission that that's not --11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We'd rather you analyze12 the case now and then we'll analyze it later.13 (Laughter.)14 MR. DREEBEN: What the Court needs to analyze15 today is whether an emergency statement where somebody16 is seeking protection and there is a threat of imminent17 recurrence of the very violence that has triggered the18 call is testimony. And it's not testimony because the19 sort of risks of government shaping and the declarant20 focus on providing evidence for use in a criminal case21 are not present, and the information has, as Justice22 Scalia pointed out, a unique probative value that's23 very different from the kind of submission of an24 affidavit or submitting to a civil law deposition that25 prompted the confrontation right.481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 The Framers were thinking about things that2 we all would recognize as testimony, being deposed,3 submitting an affidavit, appearing before a -- a4 magistrate in a pretrial proceeding, and they used the5 word witness in the Confrontation Clause not only to6 refer to the kinds of statements that were covered, but7 in connection with knowledge that the same word appears8 in the Fifth Amendment and in the Sixth Amendment9 Compulsory Process Clause, where in all of those10 contexts, its most natural application is to the formal11 acquisition of evidence.12 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say in that13 respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th14 century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went15 out and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up,16 and that that evidence wasn't admissible?17 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think what's really18 striking, Justice Breyer, is that there is no 17th19 century case law that reflects that. There's really a20 virtual, complete absence on the other side of this21 case of an affirmative argument supported by decided22 cases that says that evidence of that character was23 even known to the Framers, let alone excluded.24 If you look closely at their constable cases,25 which is the closest cases that they -- they submit,491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 one of them is a report from the Old Bailey online2 source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in3 -- in England, and one of them, the Radbourne case, is4 right around the time of the framing, and there's a5 little line in the transcript where the constable says,6 well, I bent down and I asked the victim something and7 then the judge says, well, don't say that. There's no8 evidence that that was regarded as a -- a legal ruling9 under confrontation principles. There's no evidence10 that the Framers were aware of the Radbourne Old11 Bailey report, and there's additional statutory basis12 in the treason statute, which was applicable there,13 which said that all evidence had to be given face to14 face. So that's their primary authority.15 Their next authority --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- it's -- it may17 be not a lot, but it's something. You don't have18 anything to the contrary.19 MR. DREEBEN: What we have --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have anything21 which shows that these hue and cry reports were22 admitted, and there were a lot of them. They -- they23 were done regularly.24 MR. DREEBEN: The hue and cry reports,25 Justice Scalia, as I think your earlier questioning501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 suggested, do not necessarily involve the kind of2 emergency situation what -- that we have here where a3 person is reaching out from an ongoing present criminal4 act against them and seeking help. And the fact that5 we have very little evidence at all of how 17th century6 British law handled this is really, I think, persuasive7 evidence that the Court should not deem the8 confrontation right as a response to some sort of9 abuses in this area.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say that a hue and11 cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and12 -- and picking up the phone while the crime is in13 progress. But I think it's quite similar to the -- the14 jewelry hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you15 which you're unwilling to say is -- is not covered by16 the -- is covered by the Confrontation Clause, and I17 think it's quite similar to a woman, where the husband18 has left and she's locked the door and she wants the19 husband arrested. I think it's quite similar to that.20 But for the telephone, it's -- it's someone who's been21 the victim of a crime who goes to a public official, as22 soon as possible, and says, I've been -- I've been23 subject to a crime. I want to report the crime and24 have the person arrested. I think it's very similar.25 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, first of all,511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 there is evidence that the hue and cry practice2 existed. There is not evidence about how hue and cry3 reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law. It is4 very difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century5 English practice what we are dealing with now, in part6 because the system of public prosecutions that we have7 today where an official prosecutor representing the8 State carries the ball in a criminal case did not9 exist. The accuser had to appear in court as the10 private prosecutor. If the accuser did not appear,11 there was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were12 simply dismissed because there was no one official on13 the scene to carry the ball. So the -- the speculation14 that's required requires a number of inferential leaps15 that Petitioners have to make in order to draw an16 analogy.17 And at the same time, there really is an18 intuitive difference between the kinds of statements19 that people make in emergencies and the kind of core20 testimonial statements that we know prompted the21 confrontation right, the Sir Walter Raleigh case22 involving affidavits and letters, the Marian practice23 under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of24 a magistrate's rooming house rather than in the25 immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 ongoing.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, you say3 focus on the emergency nature. Very little of what4 took place in the 911 call is emergency. He's beating5 me. He's jumping on me. Yes. What's his name? I6 mean, it's not like they'll send help if his name is7 Joe but they won't if it's Mike. It doesn't matter.8 Which direction is he running? That's not related to9 the emergency nature of the -- of the call.10 MR. DREEBEN: It is, Mr. Chief Justice, in11 the sense that it's information that's needed to12 respond to and resolve the imminent threat to this13 woman's safety, which would certainly occur if the14 individual decided to come back and finish what he'd15 started. And if a law enforcement authority set up its16 911 calls so as not to gather adequate information and17 this individual had come back and actually beaten or18 killed the victim, it would certainly be regarded as an19 inadequate response to the emergency situation of an20 ongoing violent attack. And so for that reason, the21 rule that22 deal with23 imminent,24we're describing here for the Court wouldnot only the present emergency but also itsthreatened recurrence.JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, rather than build that25 into the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice 531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Kennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with,2 explaining it. So what is your full explanation of the3 diamond necklace?45 the kinds6 report of7 utterances that are much different from the kind of8 dispassionate testimony that occurs after the fact that9 prompted the confrontation right.10 Now, the Court could accept that line and say11 that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the12 meaning of the Confrontation Clause, or it could13 disagree and say that no, when there's not the14 immediate threatened, imminent potential for a15 recurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat16 that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat17 it as testimonial. Court could go either way on18 that without touching the core of what's at issue19 today, which is namely emergency situations that pose a20 threat to the safety of the person who's making the21 call or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer22 on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't say that24 every question asked in that context. Don't we have to25 do it question by question? I mean, what if one of the541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. DREEBEN:  My -- my view on that is thatof statements that are made in the immediatea crime are really in the form of excited￼1 questions was, you know, has he beaten you before? How2 many times before? You know, are you going to allow3 that in too --4 MR. DREEBEN: I think that --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as an excited utterance?6 MR. DREEBEN: -- the more that the -- the7 questioning begins to delve into a past narrative of8 past criminal activity, the more there is a reason to9 think that it serves, in addition to its protection10 purpose, an evidentiary purpose.11 I'd hasten to add, Justice Scalia, that that12 kind of information is very important for the officers13 to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get14 the kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to15 respond effectively. So it is reasonably necessary for16 those kinds of questions and that information to be17 elicited.18 But I also agree with Your Honor's suggestion19 that not everything that occurs in a 911 call should be20 regarded as per se non-testimonial. Not everything21 that happens at the scene of a crime should be regarded22 as per se non-testimonial. And naturally, the Court is23 going to have to apply a certain degree of analysis to24 the actual questions and answers that are given. But25 if you look at the protocol in this case for the 911551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 call, if you look at the kinds of questions that were2 asked and the information that was given, it is all3 reasonably necessary to resolve an emergency by a4 person who has really called in a state of extreme5 stress. Thank you.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.7 Dreeben.8 Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER11 MR. FISHER: Thank you.12 Let me say a word about the record and then13 two things about the emergency exception that we've14 been talking about.15 First, in the record it's always been16 accepted in this case that Mr. Davis had left the house17 when the 911 call started. In the joint appendix, page18 117, that's what the Washington Supreme Court said, and19 at page 30 of the evidentiary hearing in the trial20 court, the prosecutor submitted the case that way as21 well.22 Now let me address the history here because23 it's important. And Justice Scalia is exactly right.24 There's not a single case historically where a25 statement to a law enforcement agent accusing someone561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 of a crime was admitted in a criminal case. We're not2 aware of one.3 JUSTICE BREYER: That may be hearsay. That4 may all be hearsay.5 MR. FISHER: It -- it is what it is, Justice6 Breyer. The -- the oldest case that is in the briefs7 on the other side is White v. Illinois in 1992. So for8 some 500 years before that. And -- and perhaps when we9 have to draw an inference, we do have -- to a certain10 degree we acknowledge the dog that doesn't bark. We11 have evidence that was out there and simply wasn't12 used.13 Let's look at the history of the Marian14 statutes. And I'm -- and I want to refer the Court15 specifically to page 101 of Sir Matthew Hale's16 treatise. He talks about the -- both the problem with17 the hue and cry and then the reason we have the Marian18 statutes. The reason we have the Marian statutes was19 because for pretrial bail and committal hearings, the20 courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial21 reports. They wanted a formal examination of the22 witness to use at even the pretrial hearing, to detain23 the person pending trial. And Sir Matthew Hale at page24 101 says the problem with the fresh reports the hue25 and cry, is that -- is that they're not under oath.571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 They don't -- they don't even answer all the questions2 that we would want answered.34 accept is5 would not6 pretrial bail hearing -- rather, they wanted to have7 something more formal -- they would now accept to be8 used in the trial itself. And what we think is that9 this turns everything on its head. The reason theSo what the United States is asking you tothat the kind of evidence that the Framershave even been prepared to allow at a10 Marian statutes were abused is because, of course, in11 continental Europe that was an accepted form of12 evidence, and so there was some reason to believe these13 formal statements could be used. No one ever suggested14 the hue and cry could be used.15 Finally, let me say a word about police16 incentives. If you accept the rule that the -- that17 the United States and -- and the State is asking you to18 accept, think about the incentives you put on 91119 operators. They're not supposed to ask too many20 questions. They're not supposed to get too much21 information. The same would go for the responding22 officer. They don't want to ask too many questions,23 structured questions, make sure who did it, make sure24 they have the details because then somehow these25 statements become testimonial.581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 What our rule says is it frees the 9112 operators, it frees the police officers to do what3 they're supposed to do, which is immediately start4 responding and both help people and start gathering5 evidence from the moment that a crime is reported. And6 that's what we think the Confrontation Clause is all7 about. It's not -- it's about the way the case is8 proved at trial. The Confrontation Clause -- as9 opposed to other emergency doctrines this Court has in10 the Fourth Amendment area, for example, the11 Confrontation Clause has zero to say about the way12 police officers do their jobs or the way the 91113 operators do their jobs. If they go out and collect14 structured affidavits under oath, if the 911 operator15 put the caller under oath, there's nothing wrong with16 that. If the 911 operator says, I want to be sure I17 have this right, describe to me exactly what he looks18 like, and tell me more about him, that's what we would19 want somebody to do. And we shouldn't put a perverse20 incentive for these first responders that, all of a21 sudden, once they start gathering useful information22 for the criminal justice system, that some sort of new23 rule triggers.24 All25 of statements1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40059Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOwe're saying is that these are the kindsthat were -- that the Framers would have￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cared about and that they did care about, and thatnowadays if the State or other prosecutors want to usethem, they should be duty-bound to bring the witnessinto court as well to submit the witness to crossexamination.          If there are no further questions, I'llsubmit the case.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I have one last question.How do you think Professor Wigmore would have decidedthis case?(Laughter.)          MR. FISHER:  Well, this Court noticed thatProfessor Wigmore had the view that the ConfrontationClause applied only to witnesses that actually took thestand.  So he would have thought the ConfrontationClause didn't apply at all.  But he would haveacknowledged to you -- and this is interesting from histreatise -- that these were testimonial statements.  Hesaid as soon as somebody starts -- as soon as in acriminal trial we use a statement narrating a pastevent, it's testimonial.  However, Professor Wigmorejust didn't quite have the Confrontation Clause right.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 2345 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40061Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
