KNEEDLER           ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1164          MR. KNEEDLER:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          Congress enacted the Beef Promotion and ResearchAct in 1985 in the midst of a serious depression in thebeef industry.  The beef industry found itself unable torespond to that situation through the promotion of itsproducts.  Congress responded to that situation byestablishing a government program of promotion, research,and consumer information.  In the Beef Act, Congressprescribed the central message for advertising under theAct, Congress established a government body, the BeefBoard, to administer and implement the program, and itplaced the program under the control of a Cabinet officer,the Secretary of Agriculture.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr. Kneedler, will you tellus how this case differs, if it does, from what was beforethe Court in United Foods?  What meaningful distinctionsdo you find?4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the important distinction2 is that the two grounds that -- on which we are defending3 the statute here were not addressed in United Foods. In4 particular, the government speech argument, that what I've5 just said goes to, that the Court specifically did not6 address because it had not --78 -- 9JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  We've never addressed that inMR. KNEEDLER: In none of these cases, and -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in these cases --MR. KNEEDLER: Right.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- have we?10 11 12 1314 that that15 this case16 these are17 Congress,18 Congress established the government board, all of whose19 members are appointed by the Secretary, to administer it.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it remain governmentMR. KNEEDLER: The Court has not. And we think is -- the critical point about this -- about and these programs, these are government -- programs of government speech. As I said, itself, prescribed the central message.21 speech even if you don't say, "This is your government22 speaking"?23 MR. KNEEDLER: It --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you say, you know,25 "America's cattlemen are speaking," is it government 5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425speech?          MR. KNEEDLER:  It does -- for purposes of thisCourt's government speech doctrine, it does.  And I think--JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I mean --          MR. KNEEDLER:  And the Court -- the Court'sdecision in Rust, I think, is the best illustration ofthat.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but Rust did not -- Rustwas not a case in which the doctor was saying, "This is mypersonal opinion, not the government's."  And here, asJustice Scalia pointed out, there is an affirmative effortto say, "This is -- this is paid for by" whatever it'scalled, the cattlemen's group or the beef group, whichaffirmatively indicates that it's not government speech.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it -- all those statements say -- and there are advertisements in the record that say that the advertising is funded by America's beef producers, which is, of course, accurate, because they --JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's accurate --MR. KNEEDLER: -- they pay for it.JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but it also contains theimplication that who -- he who pays is the person whosespeech is being broadcasted.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but, again, in Rust, the 6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 doctor who spoke -- I think the patient who went to see2 the doctor for counseling would have -- would have assumed3 or believed that the doctor was -- in the immediate4 encounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the5 Court, in6 situation78 asked is that any concerns about the tag line in the9 advertising does not go to the constitutionality of the14 should be 151617some different identification --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but some people --MR. KNEEDLER: -- on the advertising, itself. JUSTICE SCALIA: -- may be more resistant to anits subsequent cases, has regarded Rust as aof government speech.But the important point about what you've just10 statute or the beef order. Neither the Act nor the order11 requires that in the advertising. And if the Court was to12 perceive that as a problem, the right remedy would not be13 to invalidate the Act, but to, instead, provide that there18 -- to an ad that says, "Your government wants to eat --19 wants you20 say, "The2122 some people would have been resistant to the idea that23 your government wants you to engage in family planning,24 but what the -- what the Court said about Rust was that25 the government had established a program with a centralto eat more meat," than they are to an ad whichmeat producers would like you to eat more meat."MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- and I think in Rust,7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425message about counseling.  That was then carried out byprivate individuals.  Here, this case is much strongerthan Rust.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but if you -- if you saythe Act can be -- say, because this is just an as-appliedchallenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on alabel that's not true, "This message is brought to you byyour friendly Department of Agriculture."  That isn'taccurate.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would be accurate --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you're having us save thestatute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, they're -- I'm sure that a label could be devised that would -- that would be accurate. The -- first of all, they are approved -- specifically approved by the Department of Agriculture. The -- certainly, the Act and regulations provide that the Secretary must approve every contract, every project for advertising. And, beyond that, the USDA approves all advertising, all copy --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler --          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- that is actually to be used,so there is specific approval by the Secretary.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is -- there'sanother tape put out by the government, on meat, and that8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- what is the government speech? Usually, the government2 has a position, and is presenting it. Here, we have3 America beef producers has a label on -- "Eat meat." But4 if you went to the Surgeon General, probably that message5 would be "Eat meat moderately." So what is the government6 speech? I don't know another case involving a claim of7 government speech where the message that you are saying is8 the government's is not the message that the government is9 putting10 health.1112 concern13 public health, doesn't say, "Don't eat meat." It -- there14 may be nutritional standards. And USDA does have15 nutritional standards that it advises people to adhere to.16 But what the government is doing here is facilitating a17 situation, facilitating promotion of a commodity.18 There is a structural defect in a market like --19 a market for a fungible commodity, and I think it's20 important to understand what Congress was responding to21 here. When you have a fungible commodity, when you have a22 lot of small producers, no one of those producers has an23 incentive to advertise --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, is meat25 fungible? Or -- I think there are some steak houses that9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005out when it's dealing with its concern for public  MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the government, in the-- in situations where it may be concerned about￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425might disagree with that.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, there are -- there are --there are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the -- but the basic --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I mean, even quality of meatwithin the -- some is tougher than others.MR. KNEEDLER: Well --JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not like milk or wheat. MR. KNEEDLER: But Congress could reasonablydetermine, under this statute, that there are -- that there are -- that beef has many things in common, that it is a generic problem -- or generic food or generic commodity, and the industry --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  At some level, it certainlyis, I suppose.  But, just as in wheat or corn, there aredifferent brands and different qualities.  But I supposeit's still fungible, in a broad sense.MR. KNEEDLER: It is fungible in --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  May I ask you whether, indeciding the government's speech doctrine, is it theSecretary's formal right to control, as set out in thestatute, that we look to, or do we look to the Secretary'sactual record of oversight and participation?          MR. KNEEDLER:  We think the -- we think theformal legal control is sufficient.  And it -- the10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Secretary has the responsibility to approve -- under the2 statute -- to approve budgets, to approve contracts, and3 to approve projects. And USDA does, in fact, go beyond4 that and determine whether particular advertisements will5 be -- will be issued. But we think it's only necessary to6 look what the statute requires. But the testimony in this7 case shows that, in any event, USDA is extensively8 involved in the development of the advertising under this9 statute, by extensive consultations with the Operating10 Committee and the Beef Board in the development of the11 project. So there -- this is an integrated effort within12 the Department of Agriculture.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it at all possible to do14 here what has been done in the union cases, where -- I15 mean, it's pretty hard for me to believe that there aren't16 -- that meat -- that cattle growers don't, by and large,17 like beef. I mean, maybe they have a ideological18 objection to people eating beef, but I doubt it. They19 probably object to some content. So can you segregate20 that? I mean, in the union cases, the bar cases, they try21 to segregate where there really is an ideological22 objection from the cases where really all that the23 objector wants is not to pay the money. And so they work24 out a system. You know, you pay so much for your dues25 anyway, you just don't pay that pro rata amount, where you11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425really have an ideological objection.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think that --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it possible to work thatout?MR. KNEEDLER: What has -- what has been proposed by the -- by the Respondents in this case, of course, is to make it voluntary, so that people --it --JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but, I mean, if you makeMR. KNEEDLER:  -- can opt out.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- totally voluntary, whatyou're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beefpeople, rather than write a check, will say, "Oh, youknow, I make -- I raise cattle, but I don't think peopleshould eat beef."MR. KNEEDLER: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: That saves them the money.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, and I --JUSTICE BREYER: And I tend to doubt that that'stheir view.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, and --JUSTICE BREYER: Some may view -- object to certain content. So I'm asking if it's feasible to work out --MR. KNEEDLER: I think it -- I think it would 12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not be feasible. It would -- it would enmesh the Department in difficult judgments and time-consuming --JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be -- in the union cases, it's hard enough. It's a -- the good-of-the-order exception is the way it works in the union. And in the bar thing, I think it would be hard to --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Absolutely.  And the Court made asimilar point in Southworth, where it specificallydeclined to impose, on the university, a requirement tomake judgments that would enable people to opt out inparticular cases.  And we think that the problem herewould be even greater.  But they would be particularlygreat under Respondents' proposal that individuals whodon't want to pay, without even having to express anobjection, because the whole system would collapse.  Thisis a classic collective-action, free-rider problem.JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler --MR. KNEEDLER: What the numbers --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- can I come back to Rustversus Sullivan?  You say that that was a governmentspeech case?  I had not recollected it as a governmentspeech case.MR. KNEEDLER: This Court --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is government subsidizingspeech by private organizations, and it chose to subsidize13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425one type of speech, but not another. MR. KNEEDLER: Yes --JUSTICE SCALIA: Did we say, in the opinion, that this was --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Not in Rust, but in the Court'ssubsequent cases, Rosenberger, Southworth -- inparticular, in Velazquez -- this Court said that Rust hascome to be understood by the Court as a government speechcase, because the government prescribed the message, andit's government speech whether or not the governmentspeaks for itself or enlists others to transmit themessage.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, for the precise purpose at issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference. You can fund private people for some things, and not fund them for others, and it doesn't make whatever they say government speech. I think that's a --MR. KNEEDLER: But --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think that's a really -- MR. KNEEDLER: -- but there's really no -- JUSTICE SCALIA: -- strong proposition, thatwhenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, thespeech of that private enterprise becomes public speech.          MR. KNEEDLER:  There's really no need to get tothat point here, because the Beef Board, which is the14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 entity that does the speaking, is, I think, unquestionably2 a government body. It's established by special statute3 under the Lebron test. All of its members are appointed4 by the --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. But what you were6 using Rust for was to establish the proposition that in7 order to be government speech, it -- you don't have to --8 you don't9 1011 that. 1213 has come to explain Rust, as being a species of government14 speech -- but, as I say, there is no need -- there is no15 need for the Court to get to that situation. And the fact16 that the government is the one in control of the speech17 here critically distinguished -- distinguishes this case18 from cases like Keller and Abood.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a question perhaps20 more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like21 your comment on it. Suppose the statute were changed and22 there was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just23 went into the general funds of the United States Treasury,24 and then they used part of that money -- they had more25 money for beef advertising, and the government did the15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005have to say, "This is the government speaking." MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think --JUSTICE SCALIA: And Rust doesn't stand forMR. KNEEDLER: -- Right -- I think, as this Court￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425advertising.  What would the Respondents say about that?          MR. KNEEDLER:  I think -- I think they would saythat that -- that there's something different aboutgeneral taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes.  But Idon't think there's any basis in this --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why can't --MR. KNEEDLER: -- in history or --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- why can't you just do that?Or is your answer to me, "Well, then, it's just formalism,and you might as well rule for me now?"          MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm sorry, do -- maybe Imisunderstood your question.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't the government -- MR. KNEEDLER: Were you asking why focus -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- why can't the governmentadopt my solution?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- and maybe Imisunderstood. Was it -- was it paying for it out of general taxes or taking this money and putting into the focus --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's put into the general fundof the -- of the Treasury.          MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- they may say that that's thesame thing, but I -- they were drawing a distinctionbetween paying for it out of general funds -- income tax16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 or something -- that we all would pay for. They say2 that's the solution, rather than having the industry, that3 benefits from the advertising, pay for it. Not only does4 the industry benefit --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you'd come within the6 protections of Frothingham versus Mellon, and7 Massachusetts versus Mellon, if you did it that way.8 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, there would be standing9 objection -- objections at that point, but we think, in10 terms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a11 person would have a First Amendment objection to paying an12 excise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes13 are being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis14 in cases like Abood and Keller, which have to do with15 private association -- an association with private speech16 --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you could --18 MR. KNEEDLER: -- no government speech.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- simply restructure this20 Act to get to the result you want.21 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. If that -- but the funds22 that are raised are public monies. They don't go in --23 they're not deposited in the Treasury. But in the Joint24 Appendix, there is a reproduced -- an AMS, Agricultural25 Marketing Service, circular that explains how these public17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 monies -- and calls them "public monies" -- are to be2 disposed of. And it describes the Beef Board, this3 governmental body that receives the money, as being the4 custodian for the Agricultural Marketing Service and5 handling these monies. And Congress and the Secretary6 have imposed strict limitations on how those funds can be7 deposited. So whether they go into the general Treasury8 or whether they're handled in this way is really a matter9 of fiscal and revenue and internal governmental policy10 that I don't think that --11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, this theory is12 one that wasn't brought up at all in Wileman, if I13 remember correctly. And in United Foods, it was brought14 up too late, so the government -- so the Court didn't15 entertain it. The argument that you're making today, I16 take it, would necessarily displace United Foods as17 having any kind of a continuing --1819 not reach20 reach the21 And, in fact, United Foods is back, on remand. That was a22 reversal of summary judgment for the government. It's23 back, on remand, and is being stayed, pending the outcome24 of this case on government speech.

KNEEDLER: Well --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is --MR. KNEEDLER: -- I think --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the public perception of -- it says, "Eat meat" -- it's quite differentthese adsfrom saying, "Your government wants you to buy meat."

GARRE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and maythe Court:The First Amendment does not prevent thegovernment from speaking out in order to revive and expandthe market for the nation's most important agriculturalproduct.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we can just continue on government speech, because that's where --          MR. GARRE:  Yes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- where we left off.  Itseems to me there is something offensive about making aparticular portion of the public pay for something thatthe government says.MR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy --JUSTICE KENNEDY: It ought to be out of the20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 general fund.2 MR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy, the assessments in3 this case are imposed on a class of people who sell4 particular commodity -- cattle. In that respect, they're5 no different than the types of assessments the Federal6 Government has been imposing for centuries on the same of7 commodities, from the first tax the Federal Government8 imposed on whiskey to the excise taxes on gasoline9 producers today. And Respondents concede you could do10 this out of general tax revenues. They concede that you11 could have a government speech program funded by excises12 on certain commodities, like cigarettes or alcohol. There13 is no basis under the First Amendment to carve out a14 different rule in the case of beef.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I'm saying, it seems to16 me that the government speech doesn't seem to me to17 advance your argument very much, because it has problems18 of its own.19 MR. GARRE: Well, we agree with the government20 speech doctrine, although we also think that the Court can21 uphold the statute under the intermediate-scrutiny22 analysis. It makes perfect sense for the government to be23 speaking out in order to correct the market problem that24 Congress identified in the midst of a two-decades-long25 depression in the beef industry.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Take the BSE incident last year. BSE imposes a2 potentially catastrophic and overnight impact on the beef3 industry. In response to that threat, because of the beef4 checkoff program, the government was able to respond5 immediately with the funds necessary to respond on a6 national scale, not only through promotion -- and this is7 an important part in which this case is different from8 United Food -- only about half of every checkoff dollar9 goes to promoting beef through commercial advertising,10 like the "Beef, it's what's for dinner" campaign. The11 rest of that dollar goes to things like producing12 information to consumers about the safety of U.S. meat,13 the -- addressing the health concerns imposed by BSE and14 other potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up15 foreign markets so that we can export beef -- beef exports16 have risen dramatically under this program -- and going17 for things like research in order to identify an early-18 detection system for BSE. In United Foods, this Court19 emphasized, at least three times throughout its opinion,20 that the only aspect of the program that was -- the dollar21 was being collected for was commercial advertising. And,22 Justice Stevens, I think you emphasized that in your23 concurrence, as well. And this program is much more24 holistic --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, I mean, that -- the22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425part that's good can't save the whole thing, any more than in the -- in the union case, the fact that some -- the union dues could be used for some permissible purposes, saved the dues that were being used for impermissible purposes. You --MR. GARRE: Well, the union --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want to just savehalf of this program, do you?MR. GARRE: Well, certainly saving half is better than scuttling the whole --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, all right.MR. GARRE: -- thing, Justice Scalia. But the union case is -- the speech that was -- that this Court held could not be funded -- and, after all, in those cases, the message was controlled by a non-government entity, the union or the state bar. But there, you're talking about political and ideological speech. Here, we're talking about beef production -- producing --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what's the objection to,whenever you have an ad, you put a little thing in thecorner, and it says, "This advertisement is paid for bythe beef industry under a regulation, X-23, of theDepartment of Agriculture"?MR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, the program would do that if this Court held it was necessary --23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: And it wouldn't --2 MR. GARRE: -- under the First Amendment.3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- tough, would it?4 MR. GARRE: But --5 JUSTICE BREYER: All you'd have to do is have a6 little thing -- and it would just say, "USDA requires7 this, under the program," and then the whole problem goes8 away.9 MR. GARRE: That's correct. But let me make a10 few additional --11 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.12 MR. GARRE: -- points. First, as Mr. Kneedler13 emphasized, nothing in the statute, the regulation,14 requires the ad to say that they're funded by America's15 beef --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- we realize that. I17 mean, we're getting into it because there's at least a18 potential constitutional problem here.19 MR. GARRE: And let me make another --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: As you respond to Justice21 Breyer's question, would you go the step further and say,22 Why isn't one possible solution to this difficulty we're23 having about government speech a requirement that if you24 want to justify it as government speech, you put in the25 advertisement, "This is the government's position, paid24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425for by the beef producers"?MR. GARRE: The government isn't hiding from -- JUSTICE SOUTER: No --MR. GARRE: -- the messages in its pro-beef ads.It -- Justice Souter, the government could do that, but it's not hiding from this message. We think that if the Court --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  It seems to be.  In fact, therewas an indication in the brief that the government had takenthe position that if the government came out front and said,"Hey, we're urging you to eat more meat," that, in fact,it would be very unsuccessful in doing it.  It seems towant to hide the ball here.MR. GARRE: Well, the government does do that, Justice Souter. Last year, during the height of BSE crisis, the President, from his ranch in Texas, urged Americans to eat more beef and told Americans that beef was safe. That's the same message that went out, supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture, through the Beef Board, to communicate --JUSTICE SOUTER: Did he --MR. GARRE: -- message.JUSTICE SOUTER: And who paid for that? Didthese people pay for that?          MR. GARRE:  The President's message was paid25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425through general tax dollars.  The message under thisprogram is paid through the assessment.  It's the samemessage.  The message under the Beef Board is carefullycontrolled and supervised by the United States Departmentof Agriculture.If I could make a point --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, let's be honest about it.Let's be totally accurate.  It's not going to say, "Thegovernment believes this."  The government may not believeit.  What it says is, "This message is brought to you bythe Beef Association under the -- under a programrequiring contributions to advertising of the Departmentof Agriculture."MR. GARRE: And --JUSTICE BREYER: Nobody will even know what that means, but it has the --          [Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it has --          MR. GARRE:  Well, that's good.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it has the virtue of beingtotally accurate.          MR. GARRE:  That's right.  Every single ad thatwe're aware of, has the beef check, which is the sign thatthe beef -- or the reasonable observer would know thatthis is a statute passed by Congress containing a message26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that Americans should eat more beef, that beef is2 nutritious, that's disseminated under a program that's3 carefully supervised and controlled by the Secretary of4 Agriculture.5 JUSTICE BREYER: The important thing is, you6 have no objection to doing that.7 MR. GARRE: We would not, but we also think --8 and if the Court made that clear in this case, it wouldn't9 be a basis for invalidating the statute; it might be a10 basis for sending it back or an as-applied challenge.11 Importantly, we --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what it -- what it would --13 what it would be a basis for, at least within the confines14 of this argument, would be a basis for your government15 speech claim in the sense that you wouldn't be basing a16 government speech claim on what is really a17 misrepresentation.18 MR. GARRE: It -- we don't think it's a19 misrepresentation. The speech is funded by America's beef20 producers. The Respondents in this case, the centerpiece21 of their First Amendment argument --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, including those who don't23 want to fund it and who don't agree with the message. I24 mean, the problem here is that by making that25 representation, you indicate that this is the message of27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the people who are paying for it.  And some of the peoplewho are paying for it do not wish to convey that message.MR. GARRE: We --JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the misrepresentation. MR. GARRE: With respect, we would disagree.There's no reason to believe that a reasonable observer would think that just because an ad says it's funded by the nation's beef producers, every single one of the 850,000 individual cattle producers in this country agrees with every single statement --JUSTICE SOUTER: But what they would --MR. GARRE: -- of the message.JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what they would, I think,assume is that, in the name, the beef producers do, infact, agree with this, and this is their message.  Whatthey would not assume from it is that it is what you andMr. Kneedler are claiming, the speech of the Government ofthe United States.  They certainly wouldn't infer that.          MR. GARRE:Court would under thefamiliar with the actas well as a program.We think it's fair to assume, as theestablishment clause, that they'reof Congress that makes it its message          A critical point on this attribution argument isthat it's not supported by any single piece of evidencethat Respondents, themselves, have put into the record in28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this case. Their First Amendment objection is to the content of the ads. There's not a single piece of evidence in the record purporting to make this attribution argument that the public would attribute to the ads to them. It's not in the complaint in this case, it's not in their own affidavits, it's not in the --JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --MR. GARRE: -- in the --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe it's not because theydidn't know you were going to be defending on the basis ofgovernment speech.  That's what's getting us into this.MR. GARRE: Well, I highly doubt that, Justice Souter, because the First Amendment claim was added in response to the United Foods case, and this case was developed, from the outset, on a government speech theory.JUSTICE SOUTER: Which wasn't a government speech case.MR. GARRE: But it -- the case was tried under the First Amendment, under a government speech argument. But -- so the fact that Respondents didn't put --JUSTICE GINSBURG: This case, not United Foods. Because United Foods, the Court said it -- it was not legitimately before us.MR. GARRE: That's correct. But my point is that the First Amendment case proceeded after United29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Foods. The government's central argument in the trial was2 government speech. The one time attribution came up --3 and this is at pages 46 and 47 of the trial record --4 Respondents' own witness testified that the public was not5 likely to attribute the message of the pro-beef ad to its6 organization of beef producers. So if the Court finds7 that attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no8 basis to bring down the act of Congress on the record in9 this case.10 The -- I want to emphasize, if I could, that the11 program in this case has been effective. The record12 establishes that the beef checkoff has had a statistically13 significant impact on increasing consumer demand for beef14 and an increase in prices. That's contained in the expert15 testimony of Professor Ward, at pages 100 and 173. The16 record also shows that for every checkoff dollar spent on17 the program, there's more than a 5.67 rate of return back18 to the beef producers in the form of increased prices for19 cattle. The Beef Board's 2003 report suggests -- finds20 that the price of a fed steer increased by more than $20021 in the past few years. This program has worked.22 Thank you very much.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.24 Mr. Tribe.25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425                 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS          MR. TRIBE:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          As I was listening to some of the questionsabout whether it would solve the problem to be more candidand say, "This is your government speaking," I thought Iwould begin with that question, rather than with anoverview of government speech.You'll recall Wooley v. Maynard, of course, in which the State of New Hampshire, without sensing the irony of its position, said, "We'll put you in jail if you do not say, 'Live Free or Die' on" --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was --MR. TRIBE: -- "your license plates." JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that was an individualattribution. You, yourself, had -- MR. TRIBE: Yes.Now, hereJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- had to carry this message. you want us to think of some cowboy --MR. TRIBE: Well --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- going into the bar, and hegets jeered by all his friends because he likes beef. MR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Kennedy, my --          [Laughter.]          MR. TRIBE:  -- my point -- my point was going to31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 be that a footnote on the license plate saying, "This is2 New Hampshire speaking," would not have helped. But one3 of the central holdings, as I understood it, of United4 Foods, independent of government speech, was that although5 there is a difference between having to say something6 yourself, having to put it on your car, and having to pay7 for it, that difference does not go to the existence of a8 First Amendment speech objection -- not an association9 objection, but a speech objection.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's first address the11 question you said -- you said you were going to address,12 whether in order to be government speech, within the13 meaning of our cases, it has to be identified as such. Is14 that really true? I mean, you know, in World War II, Bob15 Hope would appear in movie theaters and say, you know,16 "Buy war bonds?"17 MR. TRIBE: Yes, I don't --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: "This is Bob Hope. You people19 ought to go out now" --20 MR. TRIBE: Justice Scalia, I think, although21 it's an interesting digression about whether the22 government is being candid, the objection here has nothing23 to do with that.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, so it is --25 MR. TRIBE: But being the government --32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it is not essential --MR. TRIBE: It may be.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that government might -- inorder to be government speech, the government does nothave to identify itself as the speaker.MR. TRIBE: I --JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no? Yes or no?MR. TRIBE: I think the answer is yes, it mustidentify itself, but it doesn't help, because -- JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't --MR. TRIBE: -- the government --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- we understand that you have a First Amendment claim, which you're going to have even if we say, "This is not government speech." I think the whole point here is to decide whether this is even --MR. TRIBE: No, no, Justice --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- an issue that should bedisposed of on any grounds other than candor.MR. TRIBE: Justice Souter, I think that we're getting off track by assuming that it helps for it to be government speech. My point is that a central theme of this --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just indulge us. I mean, some of us think it makes --MR. TRIBE: Let me -- 33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a difference --2 MR. TRIBE: Well, but --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and I would --4 MR. TRIBE: -- but let me ask you whether --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I would like to know whether6 it is essential to its character as government speech that7 the government's say, "This your government speaking."8 MR. TRIBE: It depends on the purpose for which9 you are acting whether it's government speech. In Rust v.10 Sullivan, even though I think you're certainly right,11 Justice Scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called12 government speech, in order to rationalize it, in13 Rosenberger and Velazquez, it was so described. But the14 question there wasn't, "Can people be made to support it?"15 The question, rather, was, "Can the government insist on16 staying within the terms of its grants and saying you17 can't talk about abortion?" When the question is, "Can18 the government force you to support it," the "it," if it's19 government speech, doesn't help. The First Amendment20 makes it a harder case for them, not easier.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does it22 general taxes. Every --23 MR. TRIBE: Well --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- time we25 we're supporting government speech --34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOall the time inpay general taxes,Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. TRIBE: Of course.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- we may not agree with.3 MR. TRIBE: But the Court has said there is a4 fundamental difference between being singled out, as in5 Wooley, to have a license plate, as in Pruneyard, to have6 someone on your premises. In Pruneyard, the Court said7 that one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to8 allow a private speaker onto the premises is that he was9 not required to support a government slogan. When it is10 --11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but there it --12 MR. TRIBE: -- government speech --13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- there it is your car, your14 property. That's not this. This is a generic ad on15 behalf of 161718beef.MR. TRIBE: That was true of --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I think there is --MR. TRIBE: -- that was true of United Foods. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- there's a world of1920 difference between this and having something put on your21 license plate or in your --22 MR. TRIBE: Justice O'Connor, I would be much23 more offended by having to put it in my license plate.24 But if I were raising cattle, and I were told, as they25 were told in this case, "cattle equals beef; that's all35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it's worth, and that's why we won't let you, in these ads -- we won't let the ads, that you have to pay for, increase the demands for cattle; only beef" --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I don't even understand your argument. Would you still be if the --          MR. TRIBE:  I haven't made it.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, you're trying.          [Laughter.]          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Would you still be here ifthere were distinctions made on behalf of free-range beef or, you know, "Our cattle" --MR. TRIBE: Oh, yes.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- "never had a" --MR. TRIBE: The most important distinction -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- "medicine" or somethinglike that?  Would you still be here if those distinctions--MR. TRIBE: Well, if it --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- had been made?MR. TRIBE: -- wasn't generic -- there's no wayfor them to have an ad for every imaginable different kind of cattle in one set of advertisements. I just think --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm just -- MR. TRIBE: -- it's a --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- asking you if,36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 theoretically, some attention had been paid to the2 different kinds of producers --3 MR. TRIBE: Right.4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- would you still be5 objecting?6 MR. TRIBE: We would object, fundamentally, if7 they did not emphasize American beef. That was our first8 objection. They said that they don't want to emphasize9 American beef, because, in cross-examination, the officer10 of the Beef Board said, "Consumers might actually have a11 preference for American beef. That would be irrational.12 We don't want that." And so all of those cattle ranchers13 can say that, "We're proud of it being American." They14 can't get that in there.15 And the other principal thing is that they don't16 think of themselves as selling sides of beef. Some of17 them are selling dairy cattle, some of them are selling --18 even if it's going to, in the end, be in the19 slaughterhouse -- we all die someday -- their fundamental20 belief is that these are animals, and they're to be cared21 for. And the reason that that makes a difference -- the22 reason that it makes a difference that they can't even23 advertise -- try to make live cattle more attractive to24 buy -- is that the collective-action problem, if that were25 relevant here -- I think that was really resolved by37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 United Foods -- but the collective-action problem is2 really created, not solved, by what they're doing.3 Because the structure of the market is that there are a4 few concentrated meat-packers. Something like four5 slaughter 80 percent of the -- of the cattle in the United6 States. They have the bargaining power. And in the7 record, their support for the findings of the District8 Court, that when the demand for beef goes up through these9 generic ads saying, "Eat beef" -- although they certainly10 don't say, "Your government says you should eat beef,11 beef, beef" -- but when the demand for beef goes up, the12 profit is pocketed by the meat processor, the meat packer,13 the restaurant, the supermarket. And these guys still end14 up taking their cattle to market, and often having to pay15 a dollar checkoff, even though they can't even get the16 price of the -- of the cattle back. So --17 JUSTICE BREYER: But would it --18 MR. TRIBE: -- the free rides are now taken by19 the people who don't pay --20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- seems to --21 MR. TRIBE: -- the processors don't pay anything.22 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that a person23 could have an ideological objection to the content of the24 ad. But the ad, itself, is an effort by government, in25 this area, to regulate a commercial matter, not a license38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plate that says, "Free Speech, or Die," or "Freedom" -- MR.

TRIBE: They don't --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, my question is, does itmake a difference for the point of distinguishing, or notdistinguishing, "Live Free, or Die," and similarideological matters -- does it make a difference that thefundamental aim of the program, and 99 percent of the wayit's carried out, has to do with simple advertising,commercial advertising, the regulation of a commercialmatter, commerce --          MR. TRIBE:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- does that make a difference?          MR. TRIBE:  I think it makes an emotionaldifference.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But no legal difference.          MR.

In analyzing theprogram, there are some things for it, and there are somethings against it.  And in trying to make that weighing, Ido think it's different, because the basis of the programis commercial regulation.  And so I want to be certain, inyour view, that's either correct or incorrect.MR. TRIBE: I think it's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's incorrect, I want toknow why.          MR. TRIBE:  Well, I think it's -- if one werejust weighing and didn't have a structured set ofprinciples on the balance in favor of it, I think, you'reright, we can't -- they're not trying to induceideological conformity.  This is not a case where they'retrying to enforce what Justice Jackson calls "theunanimity of the graveyard."  It is a case where thespirit of the government is in the right place.

It follows that if you were -- if you were writing on a clean slate and were trying to create a wholly new doctrine, one of the things you would look at, I suppose, is that this is not a program designed to create ideological conformity in America. At least the spirit of the program is not that. But the road to hell is often paved with good intentions, and the means, in this case, that was chosen, was not to have the government spend some more money telling people, "Beef isn't all as bad for you as you think." The remedy that they are choosing is to pick a group of ranchers and say to them, "You are the ones who are going to pay, and you are going to pay for" --JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Tribe, would --MR.

It remains unconstitutional because14 these individuals are forced in a way that taxpayers are15 not -- forced to be part of a system in which, even if you16 have footnotes saying, "This is pursuant to the17 government," a system in which they will be generally18 understood in just the way Justice Breyer said, "Well, you19 know, we assume" --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose --21 MR.

TRIBE:  I would be happy to represent thecattlemen in that circumstance, saying, "You still havenot an associational right, but a right not to be singledout to support government speech."  But it would be adifferent and more difficult claim.  One.          Two, this Court doesn't have before it thepossibility of rewriting all of this.          Three, there was a severability provision in anearlier version of the law suggesting that maybe if youcould lop something off, it would be okay.  But that waseliminated in the current law.          And, finally, any attempts to analogize this tothe cases like Lehnert and Keller, in terms of remedy,that maybe we can create some scheme where only theobjectionable part is returned, is fundamentallyincoherent, because what is objectionable here is57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 homogenizing all of these people into some one message,2 and putting it out through this elaborate structure that3 purports to represent them.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to one of your5 reasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay6 for this? They're being singled out to pay for it in the7 excise tax situation. Do you come to different answers,8 depending whether it's excise tax or singled out without9 excise tax, based, essentially, on the ground that there10 is a point beyond which we simply cannot look behind the11 expenditure of tax revenue? Is that it?12 MR. TRIBE: I think that there's a point beyond13 which, for institutional reasons, it would be very14 problematic for a courts to say that you could trace the15 dollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons16 would be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a17 constitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional18 principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick,19 to get some people to support speech they don't believe20 in, that would be there. But the difficulty of having21 this Court enforce that principle, I think, would be very22 real. But no such difficulty, I think, is presented in a23 case like this one, because if this case came out their24 way because of government speech, of course, United Foods25 would be obliterated, but a good deal more would be58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 obliterated, because the theory would have to be that2 because it's not on your license plate, because you don't3 have to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's4 all the difference in the world. Because, otherwise, its5 being government speech would make it worse. But if it's6 all the difference in the world whether you have to carry7 or utter it, or merely support it, then all of the8 decisions of this Court carefully protecting the rights of9 dissenters in every imaginable kind of organization, from10 the powerful overriding theory that collective-action11 problems mean that we've really got to get more speech12 over here than you are willing, yourselves, to engage in13 --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but on the other hand --15 MR. TRIBE: -- you'd be --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you're running into the17 problem that the taxpayer can be compelled to pay taxes to18 support activities that he doesn't support at all. That's19 the other 202122 we --23 24 25--MR. TRIBE: Well, we do that all the time. JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the other extreme. I knowMR. TRIBE: We do that all --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- do it all the time. MR.

TRIBE: That's the --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the line?MR. TRIBE: -- that's why we have elections, inJUSTICE STEVENS:  Pardon me?MR. TRIBE: Right? We have elections, in part, because the only way -- there's no way to protect every individual's right to have the government's collective policy suit his or her fancy. I mean, that way --JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is --MR. TRIBE: -- would allow complete chaos. JUSTICE STEVENS: -- inconsistent with the basicprinciple on which you rely, that the individual should not be compelled to support speech --MR. TRIBE: Well --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with which he disagrees. MR. TRIBE: -- to support -- supporting speechis somewhat different from supporting activities that youdon't agree with.  I mean, the First Amendment makes afundamental difference in that respect.JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't --MR. TRIBE: If there were -- JUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't that -- MR.

Sure, when taxes are involved, there may bean under-inclusive enforcement of certain individualrights, but they have to be under-enforced, because,otherwise, you simply cannot administer a tax structure.          MR. TRIBE:  Or any structure.  I mean, Bowen v.Roy -- I mean, there's a sympathetic case of the man whodid not want Little Bird of the Snow to be given a SocialSecurity number.  But we could, when we, interactive withthe government, say to him, "You -- we can't make you givethe number to get the food for your little daughter," butif one person says, "I don't want numbers in yourcomputers," and the other says, "I don't want letters, Iwant only numbers," the fact that every individual who hasa potential claim on a collective choice could pull in adifferent direction means we can't run a system that way.But no such problem is presented in cases like this.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Tribe.          MR. TRIBE:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I think we understand yourposition.  Thank you.          Mr. Kneedler, you have about three -- three orfour minutes.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLERON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1164 61Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens.2 Mr. Tribe has conceded that if this program were3 financed by a system of excise taxes that went into the4 general Treasury, and Congress then paid -- provided the5 exact same amount of money to produce the exact same ads,6 that there would be no constitutional problem. And, in7 our view, the First Amendment simply does not regulate the8 details of government fundraising, the details of9 government accounting, and the details of government10 bookkeeping in that manner. The First Amendment is --11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that goes back to12 Frothingham and Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon,13 and United States versus Butler, where we could trace the14 amount.15 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's old stuff.17 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and the Court -- the Court18 superceded those decisions in cases like Carmichael Coal19 and Storaasli Company and cases like that, where the Court20 said excise taxes can be imposed. As long as there is a21 public welfare justification, they can be spent. And it22 would be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive23 the way the government arranges a system like this. After24 all -- and Professor Tribe said it would be different if25 the cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of. It62Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 actually -- the principal point here is the Secretary2 controls the speech. Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board3 does -- and that is a government entity -- the Secretary4 controls the speech. So that -- this is not some jury-5 rigged system; this is a system of governmental control.6 Congress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary7 carries it out.8 It's important to recall that many federal9 excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds -- for10 highways, for other functions like that. And out of that11 dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on12 highway safety. So the fact that it's dedicated really13 should not matter.14 And this case is completely different from cases15 like Keller. In Keller, the state bar was not appointed16 by the -- by the government, there was no governmental17 supervision of what it did, and the government certainly18 did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes,19 et cetera. This is different in all the critical ways20 that make 2122 down this23 are many,24 There are25 in existence since 1988. One billion dollars has beenthis a program of government speech.And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strikeprogram would have drastic consequences.  Theremany agricultural promotion programs like this.13 at the national level.  This program has been63Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 collected, and promotions have been conducted under it.2 These promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even3 -- and even earlier. And there are many programs on the4 state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in5 this case shows. This Court would be striking down a lot6 to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is7 unconstitutional.8 It's also important to recognize that the9 ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer.10 Yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. And11 the very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act12 is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a13 valuable part of the human diet. When the -- when the --14 because of the collective-action problem in this industry,15 that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message16 is not getting to consumers. So this -- the17 justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in18 terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the19 ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which20 is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising21 in order to get information to consumers.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. The23 case is submitted.24 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)64Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40065Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
