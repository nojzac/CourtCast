The United States.      Mr. O'Connor.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON P. O'CONNORON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. O'CONNOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The big issue that starts in this case iswhether, after completing the task related to a trafficstop, whether an officer without individualizedsuspicion can hold the driver for a dog sniff.  Thespecific question in this case is whether OfficerStruble was entitled to piggyback an already completedtraffic offense with probable cause on to that piggyback­­ on to that traffic offense for an investigation ofMr. Rodriguez involving nothing more than a hunch.  Thatis the question of the case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that remains ­­ that wasn't reached by the court of appeals. The district ­­ the district court, as you pointed out, rejected the argument that there was probable cause saying if nothing more than a hunch. But that was not reviewed by the3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 court of appeals. So that would still be open.2 MR. O'CONNOR: The ­­ the decision of the3 court of appeals, Your Honor, absolutely, that was a de4 minimis ruling. They did not reach the question as to5 whether there was reasonable suspicion, and left it just6 based on their ruling of ­­ of whether, in fact, this7 was a de minimis action.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you9 concede that this would be all right if the dog sniff10 took place during the traffic stop? In other words,11 let's say, there were, you know, two ­­ two policemen12 there already. One says, I'm going to go write you a13 ticket and while that's taking place, the other14 policeman walks around with the dog. No problem with15 that?16 MR. O'CONNOR: There'd be no problem,17 Mr. Chief Justice, if ­­ if, in fact, all of that was18 done before the traffic ticket was written. If, in19 fact, the dog was written ­­ taken around the car prior20 to the completion of the traffic stop and the ticket,21 then, of course, it would be ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. O'Connor ­­24 Mr. O'Connor, it's frequent that a policeman, when he25 stops somebody for a broken taillight or whatever, will4Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conduct some other inquiries, you know, where are yougoing?  Ask a lot of questions.  He will ­­ he willcheck whether the person is ­­ is driving a stolen car,whether ­­ whether the person is properly licensed.  Allof that has nothing to do with the broken taillight andyet, that's permitted, right?MR. O'CONNOR: Yes.

O'CONNOR: All ­­ all of those questions2 would be ­­ once the stop is finished, then he should be3 allowed to go no matter what the question was.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it ­­ is it your argument5 that ­­ that as soon as all of the steps that must be6 taken in connection with the traffic stop are completed,7 then the ­­ the stop must end? Or is it that nothing8 more can be done after the ticket is issued? In other9 words, is it the length of time or is it the formal act10 of giving the ticket or the warning that ­­ that cuts11 things off?12 MR. O'CONNOR: Your Honor, it is the formal13 act. Once the act of the traffic stop is done, which14 would be the reason, which would be the15 stop, once that is done, that is the ­­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

It seems to me that under your argument,21 those questions are impermissible because he's made his22 decision, he's not going to give a ticket.23 On the other hand, as Justice Alito24 indicated, suppose that he said, now, I finished your25 ticket, but before I give it to you, I'm going to go6Alderson Reporting Companypurpose for thethe ­­ thequestions.

It has to be theformal ­­ it has to be the acts related to the mission.When you finish those, that's when the stop ends.MR. O'CONNOR: Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly right.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, but you've tied it to just writing it ­­ handing over the ticket, but ­­ or you're not even doing that, you're ­­ you're saying just writing the ticket, which is crazy.MR.

O'CONNOR: Well ­­9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 you stop somebody is not just the broken taillight, but,3 you know, whether the car is stolen, whether you have4 drugs on the car, so let's bring in a dog and do the car5 sniff. I mean, you're willing to expand the mission to6 everything up to but not beyond the dog sniff. Why do7 you do that?8 MR. O'CONNOR: You expand the mission, Your9 Honor, for everything that comes within the tasks that10 are part of the traffic stop. The dog sniff ­­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a broken taillight.12 That's the only thing that comes within the traffic13 stop. All the rest is added on. And you let them add14 it on. Why do you let them add on the dog sniff? You15 do so long as it occurs before the ticket is delivered;16 is that right?17 MR. O'CONNOR: You do if it's done before18 the ­­ the traffic stop is done.

You're not arguing that, and that leaves us opento the question of why can't we include the dog sniff.MR. O'CONNOR: Well, the dog sniff ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a policy question. So answer ­­ answer it as a policy question. Don't tie it to the stop or not. Tie it to something else.MR.

The person has to be allowed to go. All right? Is that your argument or not?                           What it accomplishes isthe ­­ is the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.  Oncethe stop is done, once the purpose is done, thejustification is done, the person should be free to go.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, is this ­­ is this very ­­ the easiest thing to get around by simply saying, would the sequence in which I will do this, I won't think of issuing the ticket until I've had the dog sniff? So that's the problem. And what are you accomplishing? Say, we make ­­ we make the handing over the ticket the end of the legitimate stop.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then the police can just say, I'm going to defer that a few minutes until the dog sniff occurs. It just seems that you're not12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 going to accomplish any protection for individuals if2 that's your position, that ­­ that it was just a3 question of when you do it.

And you have the Johnson case.If, in fact, you go beyond the ­­ the ­­ the trafficstop even measurably beyond it, then you have violatedthe ­­ the ­­ the driver's rights, and it isunconstitutional.  The question in that case occurredduring the traffic stop.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. O'Connor, is this particular traffic violation, was that an arrestable offense?                               Because if it was anarrestable offense, they could arrest the driver andthen impound the car and do an inventory search. MR. O'CONNOR: If it was an arrestableoffense, yes, Your Honor, I think that's correct. JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say it's not anarrestable offense.MR. O'CONNOR: It is not. And regardless, I18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 mean, he was ­­ see, here's the ­­ here's the ­­ what we2 do know about this case: Not only do we know the3 mission is done because of the tasks that were4 completed, you have the officer that says, I've done the5 tasks, everything that needs to be done with this6 offense or with this ­­ with this traffic stop is7 finished. It's finished. There's no question about8 that.9 Then there's no more justification. In10 order for the driver to be continued to be detained,11 there must be new justification or consent, which you12 did not get in this case; but you must let the driver go13 because you are at the end, you are finished with the14 traffic stop, you are finished with the reason that he15 was detained in the first place, the purpose: Going16 across the fog line.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I just ask you a18 simple question?

He puts the license plate into the radio and waits for the report from the station as to whether or not the license is okay?MR. O'CONNOR: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that part of the mission and the dog sniff is not? That's the question.      If you're not going to have a formal rule,you have to explain why ­­ somebody's pulled over for abroken taillight, why the ­­ adding any time to the stopin order to do a records check is part of the missionbut the dog sniff is not.      I mean, I could understand the rule, youpull somebody over for a broken taillight, maybe you getthe registration to make sure you write out the ticketto the right person.  Then you give him the ticket, andthat's it.No ­­ no time for the records check. What21Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 does the records check have to do with pulling somebody2 over for a broken taillight? I can understand that, but3 is that your argument?4 MR. O'CONNOR: Well, if that is ­­ that is5 part of what the courts have accepted as part of the6 stop. You are looking at the vehicle itself.7 Now, the dog, Your Honor, is different. The8 dog is different because the dog is not a task9 related ­­ what the courts have accepted as related to a10 traffic stop. It is a collateral offense ­­ or a11 collateral event where you have the dog sniff and do12 nothing more than look for drugs, any nothing more than13 that.14 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, your answer is ­­ I15 don't want to interrupt. Your answer is that the courts16 have accepted that you can go ­­ you can prolong this a17 little bit to do a records check. But then you have to18 explain why the dog sniff is different.19 MR. O'CONNOR: You're not prolonging it,20 Your Honor, to do a records check. That is part of the21 stop. As long as the person, the officer, is diligently22 working towards the mission ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why ­­ why is it part?24 As the question he has suggested, it's unrelated to the25 traffic stop. You're looking to see if this person has22Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a record, committed other crimes, for example.  What hasthat got to do with whatever the traffic ­­MR. O'CONNOR: No.      JUSTICE GINSBURG:stopping at a stop sign, what has checking to see if thedefendant has a criminal record got to do with that?MR. O'CONNOR: That is something that the ­­ that the courts are looking at as to whether that is something that you should be able to do. The courts have generally accepted that.What I can come back, and this particular case is not something that happened in this case, because it is clear­cut. Now, that issue is extremely important, but is something that I don't think can be done today.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He can ­­ I mean, one reason I think they do the records check, the officer needs to know who he's dealing with. I think one of the higher incidences of when officers are shot or wounded is when they make a traffic stop.      And So if you run the registration, you seeit's a stolen car, you need to know that before you goback and deal with the driver and other occupants.      What if the police officer determines thathe's ­­ he's concerned about that, either as a general23Official￼Alderson Reporting Company­­ infraction is?  NotOfficial￼1 matter or as a specific matter. He takes the license2 and registration, but he's not going to go back to the3 car until he has backup. Okay?4 So he calls ahead and said, I would ­­ you5 know, I would like backup. And the person says, you6 know, it's going to take 25 minutes, and he says, fine.7 Is that a legitimate reason? The traffic8 stop isn't over, because he's ­­ he doesn't want to go9 back because he's alone and he doesn't know who these10 guys are.11 MR. O'CONNOR: That is a legitimate reason.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he can call back.13 Now ­­ now, okay, what if the backup is a canine unit?14 The canine unit gets there, you've told us it hasn't15 been prolonged, and as the officer goes up to give him16 the warning the dog walks around the car. Is that all17 right?18 MR. O'CONNOR: I think that that is all19 right. And the reason that it's all right is because20 you have the diligence of the officer. Officer safety21 is certainly a reason to ask for backup. Once the22 backup is there, the officer then completes the traffic23 offense, everything is done, and before that, the dog24 has run around, I don't think that there is a problem25 with that, because the delay was for a legitimate24Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reason, not putting the ticket in ­­ in your pocket.      If there are no further questions, I willrequest the remaining for rebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. Thankyou, counsel.      Ms. Anders.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS        ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      In order to avoid the arbitrary results thatPetitioner's bright­line rule would ­­ would impose ontraffic stops, a dog sniff conducted during a trafficstop should be subject to a reasonableness analysis.Whether the ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How long is reasonable? You keep saying in your ­­ in your papers you have to look at the totality of the circumstances, but I don't know what that means. I think that keeping me most of the time, and Chief, I've been stopped ­­ keeping me past ­­MS. ANDERS: So have I.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Keeping me past giving me the ticket is annoying as heck whether it's 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 45. But how do you define de25Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 minimis? What are the circumstances that would make any2 difference be ­­ in holding somebody 5 minutes or 45?3 It all has to do with your needs, not the passenger's4 needs.5 MS. ANDERS: Well, if I could explain what6 the reasonableness approach is. First of all, it's7 not ­­ it's not a strict de minimis approach that8 focuses just on the amount of time in isolation. It's9 a ­­ it's a question about the objective reasonableness10 of the length of the stop. And we think that ­­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To accomplish what?12 Break into ­­ go into their home and search their home?13 Is that okay?14 MS. ANDERS: The reasonable length of a stop15 is the amount of time that it ­­ a stop is reasonable,16 even if it includes a dog sniff, if its duration is17 within the amount of time ­­ the range of reasonably ­­18 reasonable, routine traffic stops that don't involve dog19 sniffs. So we're talking about a length of time that is20 still tethered to the traffic violation purpose of the21 stop.22 So in addition to not exceeding the sort of23 heartland of ­­ of routine traffic stop durations, the24 officer also has to be reasonably diligent which means25 that he needs to be focused overall.26Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      JUSTICE SCALIA:routine traffic stops?

There are three people in the car and he's stopped for a broken taillight.MS. ANDERS: Well, as we said in our brief, when that situation occurs, courts have upheld stops of up to, you know, 35 minutes, something like that.JUSTICE BREYER: The problem ­­ I have a great idea. Why don't we say, taking your test, that the stop, you can ­­ you can do it, you know, whatever is normal there, but it cannot be prolonged more than the time reasonably required to complete the mission, which happens to be giving a temporary ­­ a traffic ticket. Or we could say it cannot last longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.What an original idea I had. It happens to be language from two cases that we've already said. And are you saying anything different? I don't think so.If so, what? And if not ­­ since this is a case where28Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 apparently the lower courts have said it did last longer2 than was reasonably necessary because the policeman3 said, that's why I ­­ I mean, in effect said, according4 to the judge ­­ Hey, I called the dog after the stop was5 over, or something like that ­­ we cite those two cases,6 say those are the tests.

ANDERS: Well, I think there are two10 ways to understand the language in the two cases you're11 referring to in Caballas. One is, as I think you're12 suggesting, that the time reasonably required to13 complete the traffic violation means that time and14 nothing else, so that any delay attributable to a dog15 sniff as opposed to other ­­16 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I don't think you have17 to do that.

It is difficult sometimes ­­21 MS. ANDERS:22 JUSTICE BREYER:23 reasonably necessary.24 MS. ANDERS:25 that a stop can be incrementally prolonged for purposes32Well, the one ­­    ­­ to decide what isOne ­­ once we accept that ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of a dog sniff if that dog sniff occurs during the stop,2 so that the officer is doing nothing but that dog sniff,3 he's adding a 1­minute to a 10­minute dog sniff, then4 the question would be whether that 11­minute total stop5 is reasonable. Then that's the exact same intrusion6 that would occur if the officer decided to do all of the7 traffic­related tasks first, that took 10 minutes, and8 then he did a dog sniff immediately afterwards. That's9 an 11­minute traffic stop.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I just ­­11 MS. ANDERS: It's exactly the same intrusion12 and it should be subject to a reasonableness analysis.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I just get a little14 clarification on your argument? If I understand what15 you've been saying, you are accepting the idea, aren't16 you, that the dog sniff is something that's extraneous17 to the mission of the stop; is that correct?18 MS. ANDERS: We're not suggesting that it19 is ­­ it is an ordinary incident of the traffic stop20 that you'd have to take time to stop ­­21 JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not an ordinary22 incident.23 MS. ANDERS: But since the Court said in24 Caballas that a dog sniff is permissible to perform at25 stops sometimes, we think that the analysis as to when33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 it is permissible ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN:3 yet. I just want to understand ­­ because some of the4 questions are focused on, like, what is a stop? What's5 the mission of the stop? What's entailed in a normal6 stop? And you're not contesting that a dog sniff is not7 something that's entailed in a normal stop even though8 there might be occasions where you can do a dog sniff9 attendant to a stop.10 MS.

Or is it that the ­­ the sniff is part of8 the time for the stop so you're not prolonging it at9 all? You're including it, you're wrapping it up in the10 stop.1112 admit that the ­­ that the dog sniff can prolong the13 traffic stop, that it is not a routine part of every14 single traffic stop. We're not trying to make that15 argument. But I do think that just because a dog sniff16 prolongs the traffic stop by some, you know, incremental17 amount of time doesn't mean that the stop is per se18 unreasonable.19 JUSTICE SCALIA:20 bit.21 MS. ANDERS:22 amount of time ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG:24 else besides ­­ we have the extraneous dog sniff. It25 doesn't relate to the traffic violation. What else?37MS.

And it's6 not going to take ­­ it's only going to take eight7 minutes. But traffic stop, you've taken care of that.8 And now instead of having the dog come, the police9 officer says, I have a few questions I want to ask you.10 MS. ANDERS: Yes. The Court held ­­ the11 Court held in Arizona v. Johnson that that questioning12 about an unrelated matter is not ­­ like a dog sniff ­­13 it is not an independent Fourth Amendment intrusion.14 So, again, I think the only interest at stake from the15 individual's point of view is the interest against16 unreasonable delay. And since that is the case, I think17 that the officer can incrementally extend the stop so18 long as the ultimate duration of the stop is ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say that ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what21 about this? See, I see your problem is, you said, well,22 it can't prolong the stop, the traffic stop more than23 reasonably ­­ you know, it has to be ­­ take the time24 reasonably required to complete the mission. That's25 what it says, complete the mission. So we have the38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 intermission prolongation, which has to be reasonable,2 and we have complete the mission. So complete the3 mission. Once the mission's completed, it's over.4 That's language from the opinion, too. Complete,5 complete. Good­bye. Over. At that point it becomes a6 violation of the Fourth Amendment.7 MS. ANDERS: And that would lead to8 arbitrary results. And if I could just give you one9 scenario where that could occur and then tell you why10 practically officers often end up or need to do the dog11 sniff after the tickets.12 So the hypothetical that I propose is that13 if you imagine you have two officers conducting a stop14 and the first officer is explaining the ticket and15 what's happening with the ticket to the person, to the16 driver. While he's doing that, the second officer is17 performing the dog sniff around the car. If the officer18 who's explaining the ticket ends first and the dog sniff19 takes another 30 seconds, I don't think there's any20 reason to say that that stop, which maybe lasted a total21 of ten minutes has ­­ has gone on for longer than22 reasonably required to complete the traffic ticket.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I have a ­­ I have24 a real fundamental question, because this line drawing25 is only here because we've now created a Fourth39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Amendment entitlement to search for drugs by using dogs,2 whenever anybody's stopped. Because that's what you're3 proposing. And is that really what the Fourth Amendment4 should permit?5 MS. ANDERS: I don't think it's an6 entitlement, Justice Sotomayor. I think once the Court7 said in Caballes that ­­ that it is permissible in some8 circumstances to perform a dog sniff during a traffic9 stop, then ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in some11 circumstances. So why don't ­­ why don't we keep it12 cabin to Caballes, which is when it's being done13 simultaneous with writing the ticket. If it's not, then14 it's unlawful.15 MS. ANDERS: Well, because that leads to16 arbitrary results as I was explaining with17 Justice Breyer, I think in that hypothetical ­­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not arbitrary. The19 Fourth Amendment is arbitrary by its nature. It says20 you can't search unless you have probable cause to21 search.22 MS. ANDERS: Well, Petitioner's rule would23 say that the hypothetical I proposed is impermissible in24 every circumstance; that even a 30­second extension of a25 short traffic stop is always unreasonable even if that40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 stop falls within the amount of time it usually takes to2 do routine traffic stops ­­3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Anders ­­ I'm sorry.4 Please.5 MS. ANDERS: ­­ and the officer is6 reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I ­­ I think I8 read Caballes differently than you. Here's what I think9 Caballas agrees with you on and here's what I think10 Caballes doesn't. Caballes definitely agrees with you on11 that a dog sniff is not part of the traffic stop. So I12 think that you and Caballes are definitely in the same13 place there. And Caballes definitely says that even14 though a dog sniff is not part of the mission of the15 traffic stop, we're going to allow a dog sniff if the dog16 sniff doesn't extend the traffic stop. It's like, you17 know, there are two officers or there's some other reason18 why you're not being detained a moment longer because of19 the dog sniff and Caballes basically says, sure, no harm,20 no foul on that one, right?21 But then you're saying Caballes gives you22 this extra leeway to detain people even though it is23 longer than an ordinary traffic stop would take, and I24 think that's just not right. I mean, I think that25 reasonableness language in Caballes is all about ­­ it's41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 an extra limitation the Court says. It says, like,2 don't think just because this officer was really slow3 and it took a really long time to do the traffic stop,4 and he was able because of that to get another officer5 in and do a dog sniff and it was all with ­­ it's like6 an additional limitation that, no, you have to be7 diligent and you have to be reasonable in the way you8 conduct the traffic stop. And if you're not, the dog9 sniff can't come in even though it was conducted during10 the time the traffic stop occurred. But it ­­ that's ­­11 that's an additional constraint. It's not some kind of12 extra leeway for the police officers to do things13 outside the bounds of the traffic stop itself.14 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think that's one way to15 read Caballes's language. The reason we don't think16 that that's the right way is that we know after Caballes17 that a dog sniff is not an independent Fourth Amendment18 intrusion. It's not a search. We also know that it19 doesn't impose ­­ it doesn't violate any independent20 scope limitation on traffic stops.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: It is not a search, but22 the ­­ but the theory of Caballes and of all of our23 questions is that you can't ­­ and of all of our24 cases ­­ is that you really can't detain somebody if you25 don't have some kind of objective reasonable basis for42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 doing so. And that any detention ­­ and, you know, it2 might be ten minutes or it might be five minutes or it3 might be two minutes ­­ without that kind of basis is a4 Fourth Amendment violation.5 MS. ANDERS: But once the individual is6 already being detained for a traffic stop on probable7 cause, I think the implication of Caballes is that ­­8 that if the dog sniff takes any time, then the intrusion9 we're talking about is the incremental delay. It's a10 temporal intrusion. And so from the individual's11 perspective, her interest in ­­ it's the same in12 avoiding the dog sniff as it is in avoiding a warrant13 check or any other incident of a stop. It's the14 interest against unreasonable delay. And so because15 that's the case, we think the delays attributable to16 dog sniffs should be treated like delays attributable to17 a warrant check or anything else. They should be18 subject to ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say ­­ you've20 said several times the phrase "incremental." In My ­­ I21 sense that it being less than, right? I mean, if the22 actual traffic stop is 5 minutes, then you wouldn't say23 a 15­minute dog sniff is incremental. So doesn't the24 dog sniff have to be less than the traffic stop?25 MS. ANDERS: I think that ­­ I think that43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 one of the things that courts should look to is the2 relative proportion of time of the dog sniff to the rest3 of the stop. And I ­­ the reason I think that is4 relevant is that the officer ­­ this is the case in5 routine traffic stops as well ­­ the officer has to be6 reasonably diligent. And so, I think reasonably7 diligent can take into account whether the officer is8 predominantly working on resolving the traffic9 violation.10 reasonable11 exceed the12 stop, then13 CHIEF14 almost always the case, that the dog sniff is going to15 take longer than the traffic stop? I mean, I would assume16 so. The officer says license and registration, goes  But if he is able to a dog sniff within aamount of time and not have the traffic stopduration of a reasonable, routine traffiche ought to be able to do that.JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that – is that17 back, checks, comes back and gives you the ticket. The18 dog sniff is something else altogether. Assuming the19 dog is there, they've got to get ­­ you know, walk20 around the car. If you're ­­ if it really has to be21 incremental, I'm not sure ­­ it's hardly ever going to22 be reasonable.23 MS. ANDERS: Well, the dog sniff itself, I24 think, is a matter of seconds. I think in the cases it25 takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds to do a dog44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 sniff. So it is something that can2 delay as I ­­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:4 to be there, I guess.5 MS. ANDERS: Well, even6 the dog isn't there already, I mean, the officer calls7 for the dog early enough and the dog arrives. I mean,8 there are situations in cases ­­ we cited this in9 Footnote 20 of our brief where you have the dog arriving10 just as the officer is about to give the ticket. So11 that is a scenario ­­ that that can occur.12 And I do think there are several reasons why13 an officer may want to give the ticket first and then do14 the dog sniff immediately. And one of them is officer15 safety. I think everything that an officer does during16 a traffic stop, how he orders his tasks and how he17 performs them, is infused with officer safety18 considerations. And so it can be a safer thing to ask19 ­­ to use the ticket, to explain the ticket as a non­20 confrontational way of seeing about the car.21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I see that. What22 about ­­ another aspect is I was seeing it the way23 Justice Kagan described it. And one virtue of that,24 now, but you may not think it does work, is25 administrative. What do you tell the police department?45Alderson Reporting Companybe an incrementalIf the dog happensin a situation where78 It's9 thisNow, that seems pretty easy to explain.fairly bright­line. And as soon as you get into other ­­ you know, just leaving it totally open,Official￼1 Say, well, when you're in traffic stops can you use dogs2 to sniff? Yeah, you can. But remember, once it's over,3 the traffic stop, it's over, done, finished. And by the4 way, if it isn't over yet, you still well may get into5 trouble if you've unreasonably prolonged the stop just6 to get the sniff.10 there's no check, really, on the ­­ on the or not too11 much of one. What ­­ you ­­ now, I'm putting that to12 you to get your response.13 MS. ANDERS: So as I understand it you're14 saying that ­­ that, again, this is subject to a15 reasonableness analysis, that the officer can do the dog16 sniff and he can prolong the stop either before or after17 ­­18 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I was saying two parts.19 Part one, traffic stoppers, you can use a dog sniff when20 you stop, but not once the stop is over, period, unless21 you have cause or something. And during the stop,22 that's part two, you can't prolong it but for a reason.23 You have to do it all within a reasonable time, okay?24 You can't unreasonably prolong it to get your dog in.25 See? You tell them those two things. Once you've told46Alderson Reporting Company1 them2 When3 4the two things, they've got it in their heads. this is over, good­bye dog.MS. ANDERS: Well, so that ­­JUSTICE BREYER: When it's not over, theyOfficial￼5 better be careful not to unreasonably prolong it. Now,6 they'll understand that, and it will be both protecting7 what the Fourth Amendment protects and also, I think,8 giving them enough leeway to conduct a traffic stop.9 MS. ANDERS: Well, so that makes the10 officer's sequencing decision entirely dispositive of11 whether the dog sniff can occur. If it happens before12 the stop, then it's fine; and after the stop, not. I13 think that does create arbitrary results from the14 perspective of the intrusion on the individual. But15 from the officer's perspective, I think there's an16 interest in officers having some leeway to sequence the17 traffic stop.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the way Justice19 Breyer has said this ­­ what he's saying is you can't20 unreasonably prolong. You can't hold a person any ­­21 any measurable time that would allow to get the dog.22 And, yes, it has to do with the resources of the police23 department, but we can't keep bending the Fourth24 Amendment to the resources of law enforcement.25 Particularly when this stop is not ­­ is not incidental47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to the purpose of the stop. It's purely to help the2 police get more criminals, yes. But then the Fourth3 Amendment becomes a useless piece of paper.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand ­­5 JUSTICE BREYER: I think if I take what I6 said and take your answer, I have to say your answer is7 right. It's just a bad effect of my rule. And ­­ and8 the virtue of the, you know, the two­part rule is what9 we said was the virtue of it. And it's like in many10 cases; there just isn't much more to say. You have to11 say, am I willing to run this ­­ they might purposely12 change the sequence. They might, that's true. Somebody13 might. And I don't know what to do about that. The14 answer is I couldn't do anything about it.15 MS. ANDERS: Well, we think there is a law16 enforcement interest in officers having some leeway to17 sequence the stop as they see fit. As I was explaining18 the reasons that an officer might want to give a ticket19 contemporaneously with or before doing a dog sniff.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, he said ­­21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose, Ms. Anders, that ­­22 it's a hypothetical ­­ police pulls somebody over and23 starts the process and then the police officer says, you24 know, I'd like a cigarette break now? A cigarette25 probably takes about as long as the dog sniff took in48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 this ­­ and just, you know, smokes a cigarette and he2 goes back to work. All right? Would you say that that3 was unconstitutional prolongation of the stop.4 MS. ANDERS: Well, an officer always has to5 be reasonably diligent. So at a certain point if the6 officer takes breaks for no valid law enforcement7 reason, that is going to be dilatory and so the stop8 would become unreasonable.9 JUSTICE KAGAN:10 MS. ANDERS:11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 unreasonable because there he was, he wasn't doing13 anything related to the mission of the stop. That's14 true if he gave the ticket and then said, I want you to15 stay while I take a cigarette break, or it's true if he16 did it before he gave the ticket, either way.17 I guess what I'm saying to you is I kind of18 think it's the same thing, is that once you've19 acknowledge that the dog sniff is something that's20 extraneous to the stop itself ­­ it's obviously more21 helpful to the police than a cigarette break ­­ but it's22 extraneous to the stop itself ­­ then the same rules23 apply as if the police officer had just taken a24 moratorium on the stop in the middle in order to conduct25 his own business.49Alderson Reporting Company   Okay.But, so I ­­   So it would becomeOfficial￼1 MS. ANDERS: I think when a traffic stop is2 occurring, when an officer has someone stopped, we don't3 expect them to ignore potential evidence of criminal4 behavior. In fact, we think they'd be remiss if they5 did. And so we think that if the officer is able to do6 a dog sniff within a reasonable time, and is still7 reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic stop8 violation, it ought to be constitutionally permissible.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But then you really are10 saying because we have a reason to pull you over for a11 traffic stop, that gives us some extra time to start12 questioning you about other law enforcement­related13 things and to do other law enforcement­related business.14 And I never thought that that was the rule. I always15 thought is that once the objective basis ­­ you know,16 for the stop, dissipated, that was it.17 MS. ANDERS: Well, I ­­ I think if you take18 unrelated questioning, for instance, questioning about19 other ­­ you know, other crime, other criminal activity,20 I think there's a strong law enforcement interest in21 officers having some leeway to pursue this within a stop22 as long as it still is reasonable ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You told me the officer24 could do that. At least that's what I understood your25 answer to be.50Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MS. ANDERS: That's right, the officer can2 do that. And I think it's important that the officer3 have some leeway so long as the overall time remains4 reasonable. If you think about questioning ­­ if the5 officer starts questions about where the person is going6 and that kind of thing, you don't ­­ we don't want7 officers to have to make finely­tuned judgements in the8 moment about whether the next question he wants to ask9 is sufficiently related to the traffic mission or not.10 That's why we think there needs to be some leeway for the11 officers to take some time to pursue ­­ to pursue the12 things that they observe. As long as they can do that13 within the amount of time that would be reasonable in a14 routine traffic stop, then we think it should be15 constitutionally reasonably to do that. And I would say16 that I think the reasonableness analysis ­­ it allows17 courts to calibrate based on the nature and severity of18 the intrusion.19 Under Petitioner's view, even a 30­second20 extension of a traffic stop for a dog sniff would be21 unreasonable in every case. But if you have a22 reasonable analysis ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But what your ­­ where your24 rule is going to lead to, Ms. Anders, is something along25 the lines of, like, everybody will decide 30 minutes or51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 40 minutes, I think you say at one point in your brief,2 is reasonable for a traffic stop. And if you see a3 taillight violation, that's 40 minutes of free time for4 the police officers to investigate any crimes that they5 want, because they can do it all in the range of what6 you've decided is kind of the reasonable traffic stop.7 MS. ANDERS: I don't think that's how we8 envision the analysis going, because the ultimate length9 of time has to be within the duration of a routine10 traffic stop that doesn't involve a dog sniff. And11 that's going to vary based on the circumstances because12 routine traffic stops, what's reasonable varies based on13 the circumstances. So what we think courts can do is14 they can look at what the officer actually did and they15 can look to stops involving similar circumstances but16 not dog sniffs, and determine whether the officer was17 able to do the whole thing within a reasonable amount of18 time.19 I think that's essentially what the Court20 contemplated in Ornelas, that with these Fourth21 Amendment inquiries they're fact­specific, but, you22 know, the harder cases will be appealed and ­­ and there23 will start being guidelines, the courts can look to24 similar indications.25 We think the same thing can happen here, and52Alderson Reporting Companyit.  Mr. O'Connor, you have six minutes left.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON P. O'CONNORON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. O'CONNOR: Thank you.Justice Breyer was much better than I saidI think the point was well made.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, what do youOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425indeed it already has happened with respect to unrelated questioning. There, the vast majority of the courts of appeals have said that you can extend a traffic stop for unrelated questioning, and the courts have looked to how much time does the questioning take, how long is the overall stop, and was the officer reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.And we think the same thing should happenhere, whether the dog sniff is before or after the ticket. That's the only rule that avoids arbitrary results.     If there are no further questions ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Anders.think about her response? Because I thought it was ­­ I mean, she has an interesting point ­­ I mean, an important point. She said, you know, the trouble with what I said ­­ which of course you think is okay ­­ she53Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 said it's ­­ it's ­­ here's what's really going to2 happen, is that the police will ­­ will think: Gee, I3 just better be sure those dogs get here in time, and so4 what they'll do is tend to prolong the stops, and5 they'll want to be sure the dogs get there.6 And so if you really added all this up7 and thought about it, even experimentally, the class of8 stopped drivers where there are hunches is going to end9 up waiting longer and being in custody, in a sense,10 longer than if we follow her approach. And her approach11 is just to say: Hey, apply reasonableness across the12 board; a few extra minutes isn't that big a deal.13 I took her answer to be something like that14 and I thought it was, and it's a point. It's a ­­ it's15 a point. So what do you think?1617 look18 help19 community start to accept 40­minute stops? Will the law20 enforcement officer himself expect that, I'm going to21 stop being a police officer for 2, 3, 4 minutes when22 there's other things going on? I think that's very,23 very, very significant.24 Reasonableness ­­ reasonableness stops when25 you have the stop end. At that point in time,54MR. O'CONNOR: Well, we hope that if you at officers' diligence there are things that will enforce that. One is the community. Will theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 reasonableness has nothing more to do with it because2 the person should be released until there is another3 reason, another purpose for the stop, a reasonable4 articulable suspicion, or you have consent. Otherwise,5 it is done.6 Here's the problem with the reasonableness.7 There was the ­­ the statement that was made that it's8 not reasonable, doesn't give the officers enough time.9 We're not talking about the Fourth Amendment and the10 officers and open season on the officers and what the11 officers can do.

Is that part of ­­ of the mission? It is22 something that hasn't been ­­ that hasn't been23 challenged. It has been accepted as being part of the24 mission.

That's for the3 courts to ­­ to determine.4 My response, Your Honor ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, one of those courts is6 this Court and what ­­ that's what I don't understand7 about your position, is the definition of the mission.8 I don't understand ­­ I can understand a definition that9 says, just what you need to do to resolve the traffic10 violation, period. But if it includes other things like11 questioning about where are you going to buy a car and12 all of that or doing a records check, then I really13 don't see why. I want ­­ I want to know what the14 difference is between that and having a dog ­­ a dog15 sniff.16 MR. O'CONNOR: Well, the other ­­ the other17 things that are tasked in part of the traffic offense18 where there is no doubt ­­ and that could be19 questionable ­­ but there's no doubt that a dog sniff is20 not part of the offense. That's collateral and it's21 nothing but an ­­ an investigation.22 Now, the other ­­ the last thing that ­­23 that I would like to do, Justice Ginsburg, is an ­­24 answer your question as to the Eighth Circuit, and the25 Eighth Circuit did not make a decision as to the56Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 probable cause. But you do have a court that did. The2 trial level court did make that decision. It made the3 decision that it was probable cause.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was only a hunch, but5 that would ordinarily be reviewable by the court of6 appeals. The court of appeals didn't get to it, so it's7 an open question for the court of appeals.8 MR. O'CONNOR: If it can go to the court of9 appeals, but this is ­­ I mean, you have the question10 that it was based on a hunch, but you give the11 discretion to the magistrate who heard the evidence.12 And the magistrate had a question as to the credibility13 of this witness, and if you have a question as to the14 credibility of the witness then there is not sufficient15 facts to ­­ able to make a determination as to whether16 in fact there is probable cause.17 We would ask the Court to adopt the finding18 that there is no probable cause. That is something that19 you can do as a reviewing court, because the facts have20 been established. We know that the ­­ that the judge21 had problems with the credibility of the witness. The22 facts that are left is not enough to ­­ to establish any23 type of reasonable suspicion.24 What we do for judicial economy is you make25 the decision here, now, because the Eighth Circuit would57Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have to do the same thing. The Eighth Circuit would have to make a decision based on the magistrate's finding of lack of ­­ of credibility, and that's what I would ask the Court to do today.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
