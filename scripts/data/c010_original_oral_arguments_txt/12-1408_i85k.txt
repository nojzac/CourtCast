Quality Stores.      Mr. Feigin.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGINON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      The payments in this case fall squarelywithin FICA's definition of wages, which includes allremuneration for employment.  Consistent with thepurpose of FICA to fund the Social Security and Medicareprograms, this Court has construed the term "employment"broadly to encompass the entire employer­employeerelationship.      The payments here, which were paid only toRespondent's employees and were keyed to the employees'positions, salary levels, and length of service, clearlywere part of the employer­employee relationship.      Two particular features of the statute, Ithink, make especially clear that separation­relatedpayments like this are covered.  First, the basicdefinition of wages, both historically and currently,3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 has been subject to specific exclusions for certain2 types of separation­related pay such as retirement pay.3 Those exclusions would be unnecessary if the basic4 definition of wages didn't cover separation­related5 payments.6 Second, one of the historical exclusions,7 which was in the statute from 1939 to 1950, was for8 certain types of dismissal payments. When Congress9 eliminated the exception for certain types of dismissal10 payments in 1950, the accompanying House report made11 clear what would already have been in any event implicit12 in the repeal itself, which is that from that point13 forward, all dismissal payments, which were ­­ Congress14 understood in the House report to include any payment on15 account of an employee's involuntary separation, would16 be considered wages under FICA.17 Respondent's reliance in this case on18 Section 3402(o) is misplaced. Section 3402(o) is a19 substantive rule of income tax withholding, but is20 expressly limited in its effect to Chapter 24, which is21 the income tax withholding chapter, and related22 procedural provisions. It has no bearing on the23 definition of wages for purposes of FICA. In any24 event ­­25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:4Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, don't we have aOfficial￼1 decision that says that the ­­ the term "wages" should2 be interpreted the same way for FICA purposes and income3 tax?4 MR. FEIGIN: Well, two points about that,5 Your Honor. First of all, nothing in this Court's6 decision in Rowan suggests that this Court or any court7 needs to look to substantive rules of income tax8 withholding to determine the basic definition of wages9 for purposes of FICA.10 I think it's clear from the preamble to11 Section 3402(o) that Congress was focused on Chapter 2412 and was trying to solve a specific problem within13 Chapter 24, the income tax withholding chapter, and it14 didn't intend to send essentially shock waves through15 the Internal Revenue Code that would affect the16 definition of wages in other chapters.17 Second, Respondent's view, I think, would18 undercut the basic principle animating Rowan, which is19 the idea that the definitions of wages should be20 congruent for purposes of administrability.21 Respondent's reading, which would say that none of the22 payments specified in Section 3402(o)(2)(a) can possibly23 be considered wages for FICA purposes, but nevertheless24 must be treated as wages for withholding purposes, would25 require employers to keep separate track of wages for5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the two different purposes and report them separately2 when they do W­2 forms for the employees or their own3 941 tax returns.4 Now, Respondents have conceded that Section5 3402(o) did not modify the preexisting definition of6 "wages" under either FICA or the income tax withholding7 chapter. Instead, their argument seems to be that the8 definition of "wages" in FICA, even before Section9 3402(o) was enacted, contained a hole precisely the size10 and shape of the definition of supplemental unemployment11 compensation benefits that Congress later codified in12 Section 3402(o)(2)(a).13 Now, they haven't pointed to a single14 statutory provision, regulation, or revenue ruling that15 would have given Congress that view. There is simply no16 reason to believe that that hole existed before the17 enactment of Section 3402(o) and its common ground that18 it doesn't exist after Section 3402(o).19 It's also important to understand why20 Congress enacted Section 3402(o). Congress enacted21 Section 3402(o) in response to a suggestion by the22 Treasury Department in 1969 that there was a problem23 with supplemental unemployment benefit payments.24 "Supplemental unemployment benefit payments" was a term25 that the IRS itself had used in a series of revenue6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 rulings that considered certain payments by employers2 that were intended to supplement State unemployment3 compensation benefits, and the IRS in those rulings had4 determined that those benefits were not wages.5 Now, the IRS in 1969 informed Congress that6 because these benefits were considered non­wages, it was7 creating a problem, namely, that income taxes weren't8 being withheld and the recipients of the payments were9 receiving large income tax bills at the end of the year.10 Congress enacted Section 3402(o) to address11 that specific problem. It did not intend to modify the12 definition of wages. It ­­ nothing in the Section13 3402(o) can be taken as a commentary on the definition14 of wages that was enacted ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Either then or now, were16 the supplemental unemployment benefit payments subject17 to FICA withholding or are they now exempt under the18 present ­­19 MR. FEIGIN: So supplemental unemployment20 benefits, as defined by the IRS in its revenue rulings,21 were subject neither to withholding nor to taxation22 under FICA.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And after (o) was passed?24 MR. FEIGIN:25 wages ­­After (o) was passed, those7Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:Federal income tax withholding.

FEIGIN:current revenue ruling, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why ­­ I might have missed a step here. Why were they getting big tax bills if they're not wages?MR. FEIGIN: Well, they were still considered to be income under the revenue rulings. So the effect of that was that they were receiving pavements during the year that were considered income and as to which they would owe income tax, but the income tax wasn't being regularly withheld as ­­ as it is supposed to be on wages, and therefore at the end of the year, they'd receive a large income tax bill for those payments.      If the Court has no further questions, I'llreserve the balance ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: I have a question about the effect of the government's position.      In the States, if these ­­ if we say these8It's obviously subject toThey still were not subject to     Okay.  And is that stillThat's still true now under theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 benefits qualify as wages for FICA purposes, then what2 about the States that say we will supply unemployment3 compensation only if there is not another source of4 unemployment compensation?5 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, if the Court adopts6 the government's position in this case, there's not7 going to be any change in the States because the8 government's position is the status quo.9 Now, there are certain States that do look10 to the Federal definition of "wages" in order to11 determine whether an individual qualifies for12 unemployment benefits under State law. And if the Court13 were to reach some other conclusion in this case than14 the one the ­­ the government is urging, it is possible15 that there could be some effect in those States on16 qualification for State unemployment benefits.17 But since State unemployment benefit18 qualification is largely a matter of State law, the19 States could adjust to that however they saw fit.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it ever to the21 long­term advantage to the employee to have FICA22 withholding, so that the employee's account is greater23 and the benefits are greater?24 MR. FEIGIN: So for ­­ certain employees may25 want that ­­ certain payments to count as wages because9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the definition of "wages" for FICA purposes is identical2 to the definition of "wages" under the Social Security3 Act. And under the Social Security Act, the accrual of4 benefits is based on ­­ on wages. So some employees may5 want to have earned more wages.6 However, in this case, they're not making7 that argument. They're simply arguing that they8 shouldn't have to pay taxes on these payments which were9 made, again, only to employees, were keyed to the10 employees' positions, salaries and length of service and11 clearly meet FICA's definition of "wages."12 If the Court has no further questions,13 I'll ­­14 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the payments were15 not keyed to the length of service and to salary? It16 was just a flat severance payment.17 MR. FEIGIN: We still think that would meet18 the basic definition of "wages" under FICA, Your Honor,19 and would still count as wages and be taxable under20 FICA. I think this case is even easier than that21 because the payments were clearly keyed to critical22 aspects of the employment relationship.23 Indeed, in the case of the post­petition24 payments, the payments were expressly conditioned on the25 employee's willingness to remain performing services for10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Respondents during the pendency of the bankruptcy2 proceedings.3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in the Coffy case, the4 Court drew a distinction between compensation for5 services and payments that are contingent on the6 employee's being thrown out of work. But that ­­ why7 doesn't that apply here?8 MR. FEIGIN: So Coffy was addressing not9 FICA, but a statute that dealt with veterans' rights10 returning to work after a period of military service.11 As construed by this Court, that statute drew a12 distinction between a reward for length of service, to13 which the returning veteran was entitled, and short­term14 compensation for services rendered to which the15 returning benefit ­­ returning veteran ­­ excuse me ­­16 was not entitled.17 Now, that distinction doesn't exist under18 FICA. Even if a particular payment is considered a19 reward for length of service, as this Court held that20 the payments in Coffy were, it would still be21 remuneration for services under FICA's definition of22 wages.23 For example, if you were to give an employee24 an award after 20 years of service, that would clearly25 be a reward for length of service and would qualify as11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 such under Coffy, but would not be remuneration for2 employment.3 Now, the specific question you asked,4 Justice Alito, about the difference between payments5 that are part of the continuing employment and payments6 that occur at the end of the employment relationship, is7 also not a distinction that FICA draws.8 As I said earlier, there are a number of9 historical and current exclusions for certain types of10 payments that are triggered by the end of the employment11 relationship. For example, from 1954 to 1983 the12 statute expressly excluded retirement pay. I don't13 think there is a reasonable reading of the basic14 definition of "wages" under FICA that would include15 retirement pay but exclude severance payments.16 And again, I think it's very pertinent here,17 and probably the best piece of evidence we have in this18 case about congressional intent, that Congress from 193919 to 1950 excluded from the basic definition of "wages" in20 FICA certain types of dismissal payments, by which it21 meant payments on account of involuntary separation; and22 then it eliminated that exclusion in 1950, making clear23 both as a statutory matter and it's clear in the24 legislative history that such payments, that is payments25 on account of involuntary separation, would from that12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point forward be covered as wages under FICA.      If the Court has no further questions, Iwill reserve my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hertzberg.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. HERTZBERG      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. HERTZBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The Government ­­ the Government agrees thatsome SUB payments are not wages.  Where the dispute liesis what SUB payments are covered by FICA and which arenot.  If the payments meet the definition of SUB paymentunder the statute, then they are not wages and notsubject to FICA.  The Government's ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:payments"?      MR. HERTZBERG:benefits.      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR. HERTZBERG:now wages if they meet the definition as theyparticularly see it in a particular revenue ruling thatthey issue at some point in time; and that's where thedispute lies.13Alderson Reporting Company What are you saying, "SUBSupplemental unemployment I'm not hip.The Government says they areOfficial￼1 It is our position that SUB payments is not2 remuneration for services because it is contingent, as3 indicated previously on the Coffy case, upon losing your4 job.5 There is a problem on the public policy6 issue that the Government is telling the Court today,7 and the problem is if what they say is SUB pay is tied8 to State unemployment benefits, then it is not wages and9 subject to FICA. They say if it's ­­ if you receive10 supplemental unemployment benefits but you do not11 receive State unemployment, then it is subject to FICA12 taxes and is wages.13 So, what they are saying to the Court is if14 you have the ability to receive both the supplemental15 unemployment benefits and the State unemployment16 benefits, then we are not going to tax you with FICA17 taxes, but if you only receive less, being just the18 supplemental unemployment benefits, then it is going to19 be wages and then it's going to be subject to FICA20 taxes.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you win at all if I22 think their regulation is irrational and contrary to the23 statute?24 MR. HERTZBERG:25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14Alderson Reporting CompanyYes.    I know that's not before1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425us, but ­­MR. HERTZBERG: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ how do you win,assuming I just say I don't pay any attention to theregulation?MR. HERTZBERG: Your Honor, it's our position that the statute is clear. When you look at the definition of "wages" under the FICA statute and the withholding statute, they are almost identical. And if you look at the Rowan case, the Rowan case says that you should read the statutes consistently for ease of administration.

HERTZBERG: Your Honor ­­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What your are saying is5 on the income side they are treated as wages; on the6 FICA side they're not treated as wages.7 MR. HERTZBERG: Your Honor, supplemental8 unemployment benefits are provided to an individual to9 provide a safety net when they lose their job, to cover10 them during the period while they seek new employment.11 To then tax the individual with FICA taxes doesn't make12 sense, because you are taking away the money that the13 individual needs as a safety net; and to take money away14 in order to provide for the funding of Medicare or15 Social Security doesn't make sense.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why are they giving them17 the money, just out of love? I mean, they don't give it18 to me when I retire. They only give it to their19 employees when they retire. What ­­ what are they20 paying them for?

HERTZBERG: Why don't they do that forI don't know, Your Honor.   There are some severanceOfficial￼      JUSTICE GINSBURG:payments that do count for FICA purposes, isn't that so?MR. HERTZBERG: Your Honor, "severance" is a generic term, but payments such as dismissal payments, some are treated as wages for FICA purposes; but we believe the definition is different for supplemental unemployment benefits. Under ­­ dismissal payments are for involuntary termination.      It can be because of a firing or acancellation of an employment contract, wheresupplemental unemployment benefits are based upon a planand are given to an individual because of a plantclosing or a layoff.JUSTICE ALITO: What if Section 3402(o) did not exist? Would these severance payments fall within FICA's definition of wages then?MR. HERTZBERG:JUSTICE ALITO:MR. HERTZBERG:No.  And the ­­And why not?The reason is that because,17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 if you look at how they are treated, even the Government2 acknowledges that some supplemental unemployment3 benefits are not wages. And if you look as far back as4 1960, when 501(c)(17) was enacted dealing with trusts5 and their exemption from the taxes, the definition of6 "supplemental unemployment benefits" has always had its7 own definition.8 And it's always been treated ­­ in 1977, for9 example, the revenue ruling that the Government issued10 said that supplemental unemployment benefits of any kind11 are not ­­ are not ­­ wages and subject to FICA.12 In 1986 Congress reenacted the withholding13 statute and the FICA statute with the knowledge that14 1977 revenue ruling was in place; and therefore, it's15 presumed that FICA taxes are not ­­ or that supplemental16 unemployment benefits are not subject to FICA taxes.17 The Government has stipulated that the18 payments made in this case to the Quality Stores19 employees met the definition of supplemental20 unemployment benefits. And as I began to indicate, the21 Rowan case said that you should read statutes22 consistently and for ease of administration.23 When you look at 3121, being the FICA24 statute, along with 3401, the definition of "wages" is25 almost identical.18Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE BREYER:you have anything ­­ the definition is very broad.  Imean, it says "'wages' means all remuneration foremployment."  All remuneration ­­ wages means allremuneration for employment paid basically for anyservice of whatever nature performed by an employee.      Now, I agree with you that it's the samedefinition for the withholding.  But Congress, it passesthe withholding change with conflicting interpretations.So it wouldn't be the first time that Congress passed astatute to say:  We don't care what the conflictinginterpretations are; ignoring that, you are going towithhold this money, period.  And it said, whether it'sother than wages or not.      I grant you, they might have thought theyhad to pass it, but so?MR. HERTZBERG: Well, if SUB ­­JUSTICE BREYER: We could also look at it as they didn't have to pass it. It was subject to withholding anyway.MR. HERTZBERG: If SUB pay was wages, there would have been no need to pass 3402.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, there would have been a need, if different people think different things. So you want to be sure.19Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyIt is, but it ­­ really, if1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HERTZBERG: Well ­­JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, Congress does that quite a lot. It ­­ it ­­ on certain, different people tell them different things. They say, we don't care; do it anyway. And that's what this statute basically says: Withhold anyway.MR. HERTZBERG: Well ­­JUSTICE BREYER: And maybe ­­ could we say that? Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right. Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits. It's never come up in the other context since this because Congress wanted to be sure it was withheld.MR. HERTZBERG: I don't think you can, based upon when you look at what the statute says, 3402(o).It says that they should be treated as if they are wages.      If they were already wages, there would havebeen no necessity of treating them if they were wages.If you also look at the title of the section, it says"other than wages."  It's clear that if it was wages,they wouldn't use the word "other than wages."      And if you look at the legislative historyalso, it says in three different places that they're notwages and also indicates it's not remuneration forservices.20Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      So the reason that 3402(o) was enacted wasbecause of the 1968 Treasury regulation that had thereporting of supplemental unemployment benefits on a1099 form.  That's clearly not a wage form.  If it'swages, you report on a W­2.  So there would have been noneed for enactment of 3402(o) if they were alreadywages.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you review again, what is ­­ what is the relevant distinction between dismissal payments that are subject to FICA and payments that are not?MR. HERTZBERG: Your Honor, dismissal payments are involuntary termination.JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be involuntary?MR. HERTZBERG: Yes. And there ­­ and that also is the beginning part of when you look at SUB payments.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And SUB payments are all voluntary?MR. HERTZBERG: All involuntary terminations. But that's where they differ at that point.JUSTICE GINSBURG: You ­­ well, you told me that the dismissal payments are involuntary. How about the supplemental? Are they ever and always voluntary?21Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. HERTZBERG: No, they're ­­ they're2 involuntary payments, also, or based upon involuntary3 termination. The difference is supplemental4 unemployment benefits are paid pursuant to a plan, and5 they are also based upon a layoff or a plant closing.6 And a dismissal payment, for example, which7 is a separate category, and treated separately in the8 Treasury regulations, is an involuntary termination.9 And that's where it ends. And it can be based upon a10 loss of employment through a firing or a cancellation of11 a contract.12 JUSTICE BREYER: I'll take it that you're13 right, that the Congress that passed the withholding statute14 thought it fell outside of the definition of wages, but15 they were wrong.16 Now, that wouldn't be the first time either.17 So ­­ but Congress did think it. So what weight am I18 supposed to give to what Congress thought then about19 what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that20 passed the wage definition in the withholding statute21 thought?22 MR. HERTZBERG: You should give it, Your23 Honor, a lot of weight. And the reason you should is24 because in 1986, the withholding and the FICA statutes25 were reenacted in full, including 3402(o). And at that22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 point in time, there was a revenue ruling in place that2 said that all supplemental unemployment benefits are not3 wages and not subject to FICA.4 And under the legislative reenactment,5 Congress would have been presumed to have been aware of6 that revenue ruling that was in place.7 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes. But that was so8 much the more so, you see? They had authority saying it9 wasn't wages. That doesn't mean that authority was10 correct. And ­­ and so that's why they passed the11 statute.12 MR. HERTZBERG: But what the important13 aspect is, is that it's not remuneration for services.14 In the Coffy case, which was not directly dealing with15 whether it was remuneration or not, indicated that16 supplemental unemployment benefits are given to an17 individual because of the loss of a job.18 And as I indicated in the ­­ even the19 government has indicated that some supplemental20 unemployment benefits are not wages and subject to FICA.21 Where we differ is, is that we say all of22 them are not wages and not subject to FICA. What the23 government says is, no, we'll issue a revenue ruling and24 we flip flopped our position several times on the25 different revenue rulings, but whatever revenue ruling23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 we happen to issue at this point in time will determine2 whether the supplemental unemployment benefits qualify3 as wages for FICA purposes or are not wages.4 It's our position that the statute is clear.5 When you look at it, especially in light of 3402(o),6 and ­­ because there would have been no reason for7 enactment of that section if supplemental unemployment8 benefits were wages already, because they would have9 been subject to FICA.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the government11 explains 3402(o) on the ground that there had been prior12 admin ­­ IRS administrative decisions exempting certain13 types of SUB payments from the definition of wages. And14 that ­­ that can explain that language. The language15 that they are ­­ that SUB payments are to be treated as16 if they were wages doesn't necessarily mean that all of17 those SUB payments are not wages.18 It does necessarily mean that at least some19 of them ­­ or suggests at least some of them are not20 wages. So what's wrong with the government's21 explanation of the language along those lines.22 MR. HERTZBERG: Because I think the language23 is clear. And the language is clear because it says ­­24 in the title, it says "other than wages." If any of25 them were wages, they wouldn't have used the word "other24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 than wages." But looking at the statute itself and2 using the traditional tools of statutory interpretation,3 it says in the statute that they are to be treated as if4 they were wages. If they were already wages, there'd5 have been no need for the statute.6 And the legislative history shows us what7 Congress was thinking at that point in time, because it8 says in three different places, these are not wages and9 also it indicates it's not remuneration for services.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the earlier statute11 definition of wages for tax purposes, was that reenacted12 at the same time?13 MR. HERTZBERG: Yes, in 1986.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you really have ­­ you15 call into play the principle that you should interpret a16 statute to make sense and not interpret any provision to17 be superfluous, right?18 MR. HERTZBERG: Correct, Your Honor.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that the20 government's interpretation renders (o) superfluous.21 MR. HERTZBERG:22 JUSTICE SCALIA:23 MR. HERTZBERG:24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:25 Mr. Feigin, 18 minutes.25Alderson Reporting CompanyAbsolutely, Your Honor. We'll ask him about that.Thank you.        Thank you, counsel.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I first want to address Justice Sotomayor'squestion.  Justice Sotomayor, if you believe that therevenue rulings that the IRS has issued are irrationalor invalid, the only colorable reason for believing thatis because the payments that those revenue rulingsclassify as non­wages are clearly wages under FICA'sbasic definition.      And if you believe the revenue rulings areinvalid for that reason, then that is all the morereason to rule for the government here, becauseRespondent's position would create an even bigger holein the statute that would classify even more payments asnon­wages and is even less consistent with the statute.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You were touching at what I was thinking. Why don't you answerJustice Scalia's point. Why is (o) not superfluous?MR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, we acknowledge that the revenue rulings are not consistent with the statutory text of FICA. The revenue rulings accept certain payments from classification as wages that the plain text of FICA unambiguously classify as wages. The26Official￼Alderson Reporting Company14 of the statute together,15 unnecessary.16 MR. FEIGIN:17 Your Honor.­­ if you read the two sectionsthe one seems to beWell, a couple points on that,Official￼1 revenue rulings are a continuation of a practice that2 began in the 1950s and '60s, which was a somewhat more3 freewheeling time in the history of statutory4 interpretation.5 And to the extent the IRS would defend these6 in a case in which they're challenged in court, it would7 not be because they're consistent with the text of the8 statute, but simply because Congress has taken the9 revenue rulings as a given and passed statutes that10 effectively assumed that the11 effective, as Justice Breyer12 JUSTICE SCALIA:13 though, that if you readrevenue rulings are beingpointed out.You have to acknowledge,18 JUSTICE SCALIA:19 remuneration, including cash value of all remuneration,20 including benefits. And then (o) says "extension of21 withholding of certain payments other than wages. For22 purposes of this chapter, any supplemental and23 unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual24 shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages,"25 suggesting that it really isn't.27Alderson Reporting Company"Wages" means all1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FEIGIN: Well, first, just to pick up on the textual point ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there would have been a way to fix the revenue rulings without doing it this way. Couldn't they have done it some other way without enacting a statute that contradicted itself?MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor, just to pick up on the textual point that Justice Alito, I think, was adverting to earlier. Saying that particular types of payments shall be treated as if they were wages made during a payroll period doesn't mean that it's categorically impossible for such payments to have qualified as wages to begin with.      As Judge Bryson pointed out in the ­­ hisopinion to the Federal Circuit in the CSX case, which iscited in our briefs, if you were to say to treat all menas if they were 6 feet tall, that wouldn't mean that noman could possibly be 6 feet tall.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, unless it was in a section that said how to treat men who are not 6 feet tall. The title of this section (o), "extension of withholding to certain payments other than wages."MR. FEIGIN: Well, your Honor, it says ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it ­­ it clearly suggests that these are not wages.28Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor,2 it says, "certain payments other than wages." Second, I3 would point you to the part where it says, "treated as4 wages for a payroll period."5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.6 MR. FEIGIN: And that actually has some7 significance in that it allows the employer to treat8 these as wages paid during the employer's normal payroll9 period, so the withholding can be performed in the same10 way that the employee would have withheld for normal11 payroll period payment and avoids the need to apply the12 rules that would govern in circumstances where payments13 are made outside of a payroll period.14 And these are payments that could well have15 been made outside a normal payroll period, but this16 directs that they be treated as payments within a17 payroll period.18 I would again point the Court back to the19 historical reason why 3402(o) exists. It was enacted,20 as I discussed earlier, following a suggestion by the21 Treasury Department that there was a particular problem22 with withholding that needed to be solved.23 Now, Justice Scalia, I suppose Congress24 might have solved that problem in different ways, but I25 think what Congress did here is it simply tried to solve29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the problem once and for all. It just declared that2 these payments should be treated as if they were wages3 so that withholding would occur, thereby solving the4 problem that the IRS identified.5 And it enacted a definition of supplemental6 unemployment compensation benefits that everyone agrees7 is broader than the set of payments that the revenue8 rulings up to that point had accepted. And there are a9 couple of very good reasons Congress would have done it10 that way.11 One is that, because of the IRS's12 case­specific approach to each of its revenue rulings,13 it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for14 Congress to craft statutory language that precisely15 captured the contours of the payments that the IRS16 either was treating or might later treat as non­wages.17 Second, again, the supplemental unemployment18 benefit plans that had evolved in the 1950s continued to19 evolve and take different forms. And I think the IRS20 just wanted to hedge against the possibility ­­ excuse21 me. Congress wanted to hedge against the possibility22 that the IRS might later decide that a plan structured23 slightly differently from any plan that it had24 considered before should also be considered nonwages.25 And there was absolutely no downside to30Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Congress writing the definition in 3402(o)(ii)(a) more2 broadly than the IRS rulings had thus far had an3 opportunity to construe.4 That's because, again as the Federal Circuit5 pointed out, there is no practical harm done if you6 treat ­­ if you are instructed to treat a particular7 payment as wages and that payment already is wages.8 Now, Your Honor, to your point about9 surplusage, first of all, I don't think the canon10 against surplusage would help you construe FICA here11 because I think FICA is unambiguous.12 I do not think there is any way to read the13 definition, "remuneration for employment," considering14 that it clearly includes separation­related payments, as15 somehow again having a hole that is precisely the size16 and shape of Section 3402(o)(2)(a).17 In any event, the only way this would be18 superfluous is if some court were to hold, on an issue19 that is not presented to the Court in this case, that20 the IRS has absolutely no administrative authority to21 craft administrative exceptions to the definition of22 wages for policy reasons, as it did in the revenue23 rulings that underlie the enactment of Section 3402(o)24 here.25If a court were to reach that conclusion,31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 then Section 3402(o) might not have any operative2 effect. But Congress in 1969 clearly could not have3 believed that the revenue rulings were ineffective or it4 never would have enacted Section 3402(o) in the first5 place. There's no other reason Congress could have6 thought that certain types of supplemental unemployment7 benefits were excepted from the definition of "wages."8 My friend on the other side mentioned these9 1968 regulations. Those regulations only applied to10 payments from trusts. They didn't apply to payments,11 like the payments at issue in this case, that come12 directly from the employer. Those regulations did not13 purport to construe the definition of "wages"14 FICA or the income tax withholding statutes.15 fact, since 1957 there has been an income tax16 withholding regulation that specifically says17 payment on account of an employee's involuntary18 separation does constitute wages for withholding19 purposes. And Congress was presumably aware of that20 regulation.21 And again, I would just like to address one22 final point. I think opposing counsel's argument about23 this 1986 reenactment doesn't make a great deal of24 sense. I think the argument is that when Congress25 reenacted the statute in 1986 it was somehow adopting32Alderson Reporting Companyin eitherAnd inthat anyOfficial￼1 the then­current interpretation of the IRS in a 19772 revenue ruling.3 I don't think that the enactment of Section4 3402(o) originally in 1969 can be taken to have left the5 IRS with sufficient flexibility to change its practices6 during the 1970s, but that the reenactment of that very7 same language in 1986 would be taken to freeze for all8 time and ­­ the current IRS practices and foreclose the9 IRS from ever modifying those practices in the future.10 Finally, Respondents point to the11 legislative history of 3402(o), which does contain some12 statements that supplemental unemployment compensation13 benefits aren't wages. I think some of the reason for14 that legislative history is confusion about the15 nomenclature.16 There were "supplemental unemployment17 compensation benefits," which was a statutory term, and18 "supplemental unemployment benefits," which was the term19 the IRS used. I think it is clear that Congress must20 have been looking at the IRS revenue rulings, again21 because there is simply nothing else that could have22 possibly given the IRS the impression that any of these23 types of payments weren't wages to begin with.24 And I think it's very important that the25 Court not just look at the legislative history33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 piecemeal, but look at the entire historical backdrop if2 it decides to get into any of that at all. But we think3 this case is very easily resolved on the plain text of4 FICA, which clearly includes these payments.5 We don't even think there is a need to look6 at Section 3402(o), which is limited in effect to the7 income tax withholding provisions and was enacted to8 solve a specific income tax withholding­related problem9 and not to affect FICA's basic definition of wages.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about that we should11 just ignore their revenue rulings, including the current12 one, and just deal with the statute? Is that what you13 are suggesting?14 MR. FEIGIN: Well, the revenue rulings15 aren't directly at issue in this case, Your Honor,16 because all the revenue rulings do is specify that17 certain payments ­­ not the type of payments that are18 issued in this case ­­ are not wages.19 And nobody contends that the revenue rulings20 have any effect or any special bearing on this case,21 because this is a case about payments that both the IRS22 in its revenue rulings and Congress under the plain text23 of FICA would classify as wages.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think part25 of the ­­ the point is that the broad, capacious34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 definition of "wages" at least doesn't seem as broad to2 the IRS since they are carving things out, maybe not3 willy­nilly, but at least they don't seem that it's as4 broad as you do ­­ they don't seem to think that it's as5 broad as you do.6 MR. FEIGIN: Well, two points to that, Your7 Honor. First, again, these exceptions first came into8 existence in the 1950s and 1960s, and I quite candidly9 don't think the IRS was as careful about fidelity to10 text as a modern legal observer would be.11 Second, if this Court were to believe that,12 notwithstanding the fact that the IRS's revenue rulings13 aren’t directly at issue in this case for the reasons I14 said to Justice Ginsburg, if this Court believes that it15 cannot rule for the Government in this case on the16 statutory question without concluding that the revenue17 rulings are invalid, we still think the Court should18 rule for the Government on the statutory question.19 We think the statutory text is clear, and20 that is the IRS's position notwithstanding the revenue21 rulings.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then what happens to23 the State compensation schemes which the revenue rulings24 seem to have been trying to accommodate?25 MR. FEIGIN: So if this Court were to35Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conclude that the Government is correct on a ­­ as astatutory matter, but we're to make clear thatrevenue ­­ the current revenue ruling, Revenue Ruling90­72 was invalid, that might have some effect onindividuals' eligibility for unemployment benefits underState law in those States that incorporate the Federaldefinition of wages as part of the calculation foreligibility for State unemployment benefits.      If that creates any bad results, States willbe able to fix them, and I don't think that it shouldpreclude this Court from holding what the plain text ofFICA I think in this case requires.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
