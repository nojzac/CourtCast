GOSSETT                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. GOSSETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Using the ordinary tools of statutoryconstruction, it is clear that Congress intended the1996 reinstatement provision to apply onlyprospectively.  But even if Congress had no specificintent as to the retroactive applicability of thatprovision, under Landgraf it would, nonetheless, notapply in this case.          Applying it to aliens who reentered beforeIIRIRA's effective date would give the statute animpermissibly retroactive effect.  Before IIRIRA, suchaliens were entitled to seek, and eligible to receive,discretionary relief from deportation.  Now if theprovision is applied to them, they are not.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Wouldn't it be thesame result if Congress decided, for example, to takeaway one of the available methods of seeking31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425discretionary review, just saying, "We're not going tohave that available anymore"?          MR. GOSSETT:  Congress might change thespecific types of review that are available, and thenthis Court would have to -- but would either have to --would have to engage in a Landgraf analysis of whether--          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that would be --          MR. GOSSETT:  -- that would be --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- a pretty easycase, wouldn't it?  I mean, if you have a mechanismsaying some -- an alien in this position can apply for,you know, this type of relief, this type of relief, oranother, and they say, "Well, we're not going to allowthis typethose" --Landgraf,of relief anymore.  We're going to changewas -- that's a pretty easy case, underisn't it?MR. GOSSETT:  The -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice. And the transition from suspension of deportation tocancellation of removal would fall into that category. However, the reinstatement provision talks in terms --in categorical terms of any forms of relief fromdeportation.  It doesn't specify the particular typesof relief that would be available --JUSTICE SCALIA: But why should that -- 41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. GOSSETT: -- and, therefore --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why should that make a3 difference as to whether it's retroactive or not? I4 mean, if it -- it seems to me you look to the activity5 that it governs. And the activity that it governs is6 the deportation or removal from now on.7 Now, you could argue that -- if you want,8 that there are some due process violations in making9 that prospective law affect past activities as they do.10 I mean, let's -- one of the examples given in11 Landgraf, or at least in my concurrence in Landgraf,12 was a change of the law procedure so that expert13 testimony, which previously was not admissible, is now14 admissible. Now, the person who committed the crime15 that's involved in the next case that comes up when16 that new procedural rule is applied, he can say, "Well,17 you know, you've changed -- you've changed the rules on18 me. When I committed the crime, the expert testimony19 wasn't admissible. Now it is admissible. That's not20 fair." Well, whether it's fair or not is something we21 can inquire into under the due process clause, but22 nobody would say that that procedural change is23 retroactive. And it --24 MR. GOSSETT: Two --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- seems to me that's what's51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 going on here.2 MR. GOSSETT: Two responses, Justice Scalia.3 The first is, I think it's unfair to say that this4 provision merely regulates the procedure of removal.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't my point. My6 point --7 MR. GOSSETT: The --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- was, you look to the --9 to the activity which is governed by the new law. In10 the case of the -- of the expert testimony, the11 activity governed is the trial, so that law applies12 prospectively to all future trials. So, also, in this13 case, this law applies prospectively to all future14 removals, QED. It is not retroactive. Now, you may15 have an argument, although I don't think it's a very16 good one, that there are due process problems involved17 in this prospective law. But I don't see how you can18 call the law retroactive.19 MR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, the portions of20 the reinstatement provision, besides for the provision21 barring other forms of relief, I would agree, are22 simply procedural provisions. And, again, there might23 be due process challenges to those, but I -- we're not24 raising those here. It's the provision that says that25 merely because you illegally reentered the country at61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 some prior date, you will -- because you illegally2 reenter the country, you will be ineligible, that I3 think can only fairly be categorized as regulating the4 process of reentry, not the process of removal. It's -5- 678910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't affect --MR. GOSSETT:  -- the fact that you --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- doesn't affect hisreentry at all.  His reentry occurred.  It -- how couldit possibly have anything to do with his reentry?          MR. GOSSETT:  Under Your Honor's analysis, astatute that said that if the Attorney General findsthat an alien has reentered in the past, the alien maybe sentenced to 15 years in prison, would also merelybe procedural and governing the sentencing rather thanthe underlying act of reentry.  I think that parallelhypothetical, which obviously would -- would violatethe ex post facto clause --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would apply newpenalties to the reentry.  This law does not apply anynew penalties to the reentry, it just -- it justestablishes a new regime for removing the person whohas reentered.          MR.right to seekGOSSETT:  But the act of removing theadjustment of status, suspension of7Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 deportation, voluntary departure, that is a new2 penalty. In the Landon v. Placencia case, in fact,3 this Court called those "substantive rights." It4 called, specifically, voluntary departure and5 suspension of deportation "substantive rights." That's6 at 459 U.S. 26 to 27. Therefore, I think it's unfair7 to say that the removal of those substantive rights is8 merely a procedural change. Of course, we don't even9 get into the question of whether there's a procedural10 change here, or a substantive change, unless we get to11 stage two of the Landgraf analysis under the -- under,12 I would say, either the majority's approach in Landgraf13 or your approach, Justice Scalia, because the first14 stage of Landgraf is about this Court's deferring to15 Congress's specific intent as to the applicability of a16 statute, because if Congress has decided whether a17 statute should apply prospectively or retroactively,18 this Court defers to that, outside of the ex post facto19 context. And I think here it's clear that, in fact,20 Congress intended the 1996 reinstatement provision to21 apply only prospectively.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has any -- a number of23 courts have considered this question -- have any of24 them accepted your first -- your argument that the25 statute is clear that it is nonretroactive?81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼12 Sixth and3 argument.4 form than5 Government's brief in this case, no one has laid out6 the history of the 1950 and 1952 statutes as carefully7 as the Solicitor General's Office now has. But both8 the Sixth and Ninth Circuit have held that this statute9 is exclusively prospective by a comparison between the10 1952 Act and the 1996 Act.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd -- I'll have to look12 at those decisions. It was my impression that they13 did, indeed, hold that it was retroactive, but not on14 the ground that Congress had clearly spoken to the15 point, so that you didn't need any further inquiry.16 MR. GOSSETT: Both -- they didn't use the17 term "clearly," because, of course, as we explained in18 our brief, there's an asymmetry in retroactivity19 analysis, and using the ordinary tools of statutory20 construction, one can demonstrate a prospective intent21 on the part of Congress. But both the Sixth and the22 Ninth Circuit, in the Bejjani case and the Castro-23 Cortez case, did stop their retroactivity analysis at24 stage one of the Landgraf inquiry --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. GOSSETT:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, both thethe Ninth Circuits have accepted that They've accepted it in a slightly differentwe are currently raising, because before the￼1 MR. GOSSETT: -- decided that.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think that's because3 they were using the version of stage one that you are4 using, which includes, in the consideration of whether5 Congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the --6 whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I7 understand it, should be left to stage two,8 exclusively.9 MR. GOSSETT: I --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your analysis in your brief11 mingles the two. It says one of the factors that you12 can take into account in stage one is whether it's13 retroactive. And as I -- I don't understand Landgraf14 to speak that way. I thought you were supposed to use15 all other indicia of legislative intent, other than the16 normal rule against retroactivity, in deciding17 congressional intent, and then you go to stage two,18 which is where retroactivity comes in.19 MR. GOSSETT: In both the St. Cyr's case and20 the Lindh case, this Court did invoke the presumption21 against retroactivity in its stage one analysis. But,22 more generally, I don't think we need a presumption to23 win this case. I think that -- under stage one, under24 an inquiry into congressional intent -- what we have in25 this case is a history of Congress providing for the101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reinstatement of deportation that goes back to 1950.2 In 1950, Congress passed a reinstatement provision that3 said that for the specified aliens -- and it was only a4 subgroup -- if they were deported and reentered, they5 would be -- that their previous deportation order would6 be reinstated. The INS -- and that statute's quoted7 at page 2 of the Government's brief -- the INS8 interpreted that statute as applying only9 prospectively, and only applying to an alien who was10 deported, and, therefore, obviously reinstated --11 reentering after the effective date of that statute.12 Now, in 1952, Congress, evidently13 dissatisfied with an interpretation -- with a14 reinstatement provision that was only prospective,15 added the "before or after" language to the16 reinstatement provision. They said, under this 195217 Act, "If you were deported, either before or after the18 effective date of the INA, your deportation order can19 be reinstated." But in 1996, Congress removed that20 "before or after" clause. Congress expanded the scope21 of reinstatement and provided that a much broader22 category of reentrants could be subject to23 reinstatement.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but as the Government25 points out, that "either before or after" applied to111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 when you had been deported --2 MR. GOSSETT: Yes, Justice Scalia.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not to when you4 reentered. And what we're -- what you're arguing for5 here is a rule that goes from the time of reentry, not6 from the time of deportation. So, it's not really a7 parallel.89 our stageMR. GOSSETT:  Actually, Justice Scalia, underone argument, we are now arguing that, inGovernment is right, that the 1952 Act was10 fact, the11 tied to the date of deportation. What we don't12 understand is how the Government thinks that helps its13 case, because the obvious and necessary consequence of14 that is that the removal of the "before or after"15 clause in 1996 must imply that the 1996 provision only16 is triggered by post-enactment deportations.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's an --18 MR. GOSSETT: And --19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that may be a20 reasonable inference, but I think it's a real stretch21 to say that it "clearly establishes." When you're22 talking about a statute, and you say something's23 "clear," you want to be able to point to actual words.24 And, on the other side, the Government points out25 that, elsewhere in IIRIRA, Congress specifically121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 delineates when it wants the statute to apply2 prospectively only. And they did not do that in this3 case.4 MR. GOSSETT: They also specifically5 delineated, in some context, Mr. Chief Justice, that it6 would be retroactive. The Government's primary7 comparison -- and I think it's an important one for8 this Court to focus on -- is to the criminal9 reinstatement provision, which is section 1326 -- 810 U.S.C. at 1326.11 Now, the Government asserts that that12 provision is exclusively prospective, and, therefore,13 that the comparison should be that, in this context,14 the reinstatement provision must be retroactive. But,15 in so arguing, the Government hides, in ellipses in its16 brief, on page 14, the actual text of the provision of17 the criminal -- the temporal applicability of the18 criminal reentry provision. What Congress actually19 said was that deportations that predate IIRIRA could20 trigger reinstatement, but reentries post- -- only21 reentries post-dating IIRIRA could trigger it. So, in22 fact, what Congress was doing in the criminal context23 was reaching back and saying, "We're changing the24 consequences of pre-enactment deportations, but not25 pre-enactment reentry." So, the comparison, if131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 anything, 23 lost -- 45 6 7 8 910 - 111213I think, strengthens our case.  I'd say --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, I -- youMR. GOSSETT:  The --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- me there.MR. GOSSETT:  I'm sorry.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can you --MR. GOSSETT:  That's on --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm looking at page -MR. GOSSETT:  -- page --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm --MR. GOSSETT:  It's quoted on page 27, note14 15, of our opening brief. It's section 324(c) of15 IIRIRA. I can read it, exactly, "The amendment made by16 subsection (a) expanding the criminal reentrant17 provision shall apply to departures that occurred18 before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act,19 but only with respect to entries and attempted entries20 occurring on or after such date." The Government omits21 the fact that it applies to deportations pre-IIRIRA.22 So, I think that there are two cases that23 this Court has --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't how --25 MR. GOSSETT: -- decided --141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how that2 undermines their point that when Congress wants to3 specify that something "shall apply prospectively4 only," as they quote, "only with respect to entries5 occurring on or after a date," they spell it out. And6 they did not similarly spell it out in the provision on7 -- that you suggest is prospective only.8 MR. GOSSETT: No, Justice -- Mr. Chief9 Justice. I agree that this doesn't explicitly spell it10 out in the criminal provision, but I don't think we11 need to explicitly spell it out -- or we -- that this12 Court needs to find that Congress explicitly spelled13 out the prospective applicability. I think that the14 Lindh case and the American National Red Cross case15 both demonstrate that when Congress changes text over16 time, it matters. In the Lindh case, of course, there17 were two provisions, one of which had retroactivity18 language, the other which had none, and -- and this19 Court intuited that, "Therefore, Congress must have20 meant that the -- the section without retroactivity21 language would be exclusively" --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish we could get some new23 vocabulary. Terminology is destiny, and I really don't24 follow the discussion of speaking about whether it was25 prospective or retroactive. I don't think, whichever151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 way it applied, it is retroactive. But the issue still2 remains, Did Congress intend pre-IIRIRA reentries to be3 covered or not? I --4 MR. GOSSETT: Was it triggered?5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I would consider that6 still prospective, but just note my --7 8 91011 you force12 intended it to be retroactive. As I see it, the issue13 is whether Congress intended it to apply to reentries14 that occurred before IIRIRA was enacted. I would not15 consider that retroactive, but it's still an open16 question what Congress intended.17 MR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, I agree -- I18 agree that that's for purposes -- that terminology is19 better for stage one. It's -- whether it was triggered20 by a pre-enactment deportation or reentry.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Aren't there several possible22 explanations for why Congress would leave the "before23 or after" language out of the -- out of the new24 provision? They might have wanted it just to be25 decided under the Landgraf framework. Isn't that one161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. GOSSETT:  I --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that I don't --MR. GOSSETT:  -- I think, actually --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- go along with you whenthis terminology on me, whether Congress￼1 possibility? Or they might have thought that "before2 or after" referred to the enactment of the INA, which3 would be 1952, and, therefore, irrelevant by the time4 this was passed.5 MR. GOSSETT: I don't think either of those6 possibilities is plausible, Justice Alito. The first7 is implausible because we know that the INS had already8 interpreted the 1950 Act, which was silent as to9 applicability, to be exclusively prospective. And the10 second is implausible because the -- the "before or11 after" provision in the 1952 Act, which would12 presumably have been brought forward, the 1996 Act, had13 they wanted to, specified the date of enactment of this14 Act. It would have been about this Act. And, in fact,15 the Senate proposal to modify the first -- the16 provision also would have left it in terms of this Act,17 not of a specific date of 1952, which would have been18 the INA date.19 More generally, I think that with this20 history of the 1950 Act, the 1952 Act, and the 199621 Act, any interpretation of the 1996 Act as being22 retroactive, or as being ambiguously retroactive,23 doesn't pay adequate deference to Congress's choice24 over time that this Act should apply prospectively in25 1996.171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would -- I find it2 difficult to understand why Congress wouldn't have3 wanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come4 in before IIRIRA. Bear in mind, these are people who5 have been deported once, already deported once, and6 then, in violation of the law, come back in again. And7 there was a regime for deporting them, which allowed8 certain variations, which are eliminated by IIRIRA,9 permission for them to stay. You really think Congress10 wanted to keep faith with the people who had, already11 have -- having been deported once for illegal reentry -12 - illegal entry -- come in again -- and you think13 Congress says, "Oh, well, you know, we have to keep14 faith with these people who are violating our law, and15 not -- and not deport them except under the conditions16 that existed when they broke the law to reenter"? I17 find that 181920 have.2122 Congress was attempting to change -- or to increase the23 disincentives to reentry. At the same time that they24 modified the reinstatement provision, they extended the25 criminal reentry provisions.181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOa very -- what should I say? -- touching --[Laughter.]JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- attitude for Congress toMR. GOSSETT:  Justice Scalia, clearly￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not only the --2 MR. GOSSETT: So, the question isn't --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- disincentives.4 MR. GOSSETT: -- whether --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: They were trying to get out6 of the country people who were here illegally, two-time7 losers who were here illegally for the second time.8 MR. GOSSETT: The question, however, though,9 is not whether they were trying to change that10 consequence. The question is whether they did so11 retroactively, because this Court presumes that if12 Congress is trying to change the consequences of an13 action that has occurred in the past in substantive14 ways, Congress should say so explicitly, because, as15 your -- you have said in previous decisions, it is a16 foundational principle of Western law that primary --17 the consequences of primary conduct are judged as --18 JUSTICE BREYER: But is that --19 MR. GOSSETT: -- of the time of that conduct.20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- so here? I want to know,21 if your client had known about this law or gone to a22 lawyer and said, "What do I do now?" wouldn't the23 lawyer have said, or would he have said, "Just leave.24 Leave the country, quick, before you're caught. Now,25 when you get back to Mexico, you can apply and point191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 out you've married an American citizen, and then you'll2 be able to come in, in all likelihood." And if I'm3 right about that, the Act does not attach new4 consequences to old behavior, it attaches new5 consequences to new behavior; namely, the act of6 staying within the United States, when you could leave.7 MR. GOSSETT: I presume, Justice Breyer, you8 mean at the time that Congress enacted IIRIRA?910 -- 111213MR. GOSSETT:  Was --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- provision was passed --MR. GOSSETT:  That --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- a week later, he goes toand the lawyer says, "You'd better get out ofJUSTICE BREYER:  I mean when this particular1415 a lawyer,16 here fast, because if you're caught while you're here,17 you're married now, and you won't be able to take18 advantage of that. It would be terrible. So, go to19 Mexico. Then there is no problem." And if, in fact,20 I'm right, you see what I'm -- I find your argument21 excellent on the first part, but so is the22 Government's. So, I think there's a kind of wash23 there, so I'm looking to the second part. And there,24 you're just said, it attaches new consequences to old25 behavior. So, I'm asking you, if it doesn't attach the201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425new consequences to old, but, necessarily, plus newbehavior -- namely, remaining.          MR. GOSSETT:  No, Justice Breyer, it doesnot, because had he left in 1996, upon enactment ofIIRIRA, he would have been inadmissible for 5 years --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well --          MR.

GOSSETT:  But, of course, at the time --pre-IIRIRA, the choice was: stay in the country andseek  -- and seek American citizenship through theseother routes.  And so, the forcing of him to leave isitself a retroactive effect of the enactment of thisAct --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in this --          MR. GOSSETT:  -- because --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in this case, he wasmarried after the effective date of the new statute.          MR. GOSSETT:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did Judge McConnell, in theTenth Circuit, suggest -- because he discussed this --suggest that the result might have been different ifthe marriage had been before?          MR. GOSSETT:  Yes, he did suggest that.  Andseveral courts have --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why would that beconsistent with his -- with his analysis?MR. GOSSETT: Justice -- Judge McConnell and 231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 several other courts have focused on the types of2 relief that an alien was eligible for as of the3 effective date of IIRIRA. We think that's the wrong4 first inquiry. We think that the way to approach the5 stage two analysis is on a categorical basis, because6 Congress, in the statute, said that, at the time of7 reentry, the mere act of reentry wouldn't categorically8 preclude you from seeking any forms of relief from9 deportation. And so, had Congress wanted to change10 that, it would have -- it would have had to do so11 retroactively on a categorical basis. But even if one12 accepts Judge McConnell's analysis of the forms of13 relief you're entitled to as of that date, at the very14 least, at that point, my client would be eligible to15 seek both voluntary departure and cancellation of16 removal. We think he'd -- also should be eligible to17 seek adjustment of status, because, although it's true18 that he is not -- he was not, at that point, married to19 his now-wife, adjustment of status was a -- is a20 defense from deportation, and he would have been able21 to get married even if put into deportation22 proceedings. And given that, at that point, he and his23 now-wife had -- already had a 8-year-old son --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --25 MR. GOSSETT: -- there would be no question241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that it was a real marriage.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- it does point out thatyour argument is a difficult one, because thisexpectation that you argue for is that, number one, hehas an expectation that he'd be able to adjust hisstatus even after Congress has changed the lawrespecting reinstatement.          MR. GOSSETT:  I don't think that's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is --          MR. GOSSETT:  -- a difficult analysis.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- this is a far-reachingexpectation on his part.          MR. GOSSETT:  The only expectation, JusticeKennedy, that we are proposing is that my client -- andaliens, generally, because this is an analysis thatmust be done on a categorical basis -- reasonablyexpected that Congress wouldn't change the consequencesof their reentries far in the past without doing soexplicitly.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Am I wrong in thinkingthat readjustment based on his marriage was not one ofthe modes of relief that he could have had in '82 or --that that didn't come in until much later, is that so?          MR. GOSSETT:  That is true, Justice Ginsburg.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, any -- so, that was a251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 consequence that certainly wasn't taken away from him,2 because it wasn't there in '82.3 MR. GOSSETT: In 1982, Justice Ginsburg, my4 client reasonably presumed that the act of reentry,5 while itself a crime and while itself rendering him6 deportable, wouldn't categorically preclude him from7 seeking relief from deportation if, at a future date,8 he might become eligible to adjust in some way, either9 through suspension of deportation by having been here10 for 7 years, or by marrying an American citizen, or by11 having a reasonable claim for asylum. All of these12 were routes to stay, despite illegal entry or reentry.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though what --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would he think that?15 Why wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is16 subject to being deported under such rules as the17 country has for deporting people who are here18 illegally, whatever they may be, from time to time?19 That would be my expectation if I came in illegally, in20 violation of the law. I'm saying, "I'm here at the21 sufferance of the country. I shouldn't be here. And22 whatever rules they have for kicking me out are the23 rules that I'll have to abide by."24 MR. GOSSETT: The implications of your --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: "I'm lucky not to be in261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 jail."2 MR. GOSSETT: Justice Scalia, the implication3 of your argument is that a wrongdoer has no reasonable4 expectation in the law staying constant. But, of5 course, both the Hughes Aircraft and the Landgraf6 decisions are cases in which a conduct was clearly7 illegal or unlawful at the time it was done, but,8 nonetheless, a change in the law would retroactively9 change the implications of that unlawful conduct. And10 this Court, in both those cases, held that it was --11 that such 121314change cannot be effected retroactively.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, in St. Cyr --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Under the --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- was -- in St. Cyr, I15 think it was he pled guilty under one set of16 expectations, and that's what the Court fastened on.17 Isn't that so?18 MR. GOSSETT: That's true, Justice Ginsburg.19 However, the parallel in St. Cyr is that at the time20 the immigrant in St. Cyr pled guilty, he was21 presumptively deportable as a result of having pled22 guilty to a crime. He was eligible to seek23 discretionary relief from deportation, which this Court24 called "a matter of grace" in the St. Cyr decision.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he --271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GOSSETT:  Similarly, here --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- might not have pledguilty if there was a different set of rules.  Ithought that was what drove the Court's opinion.          MR. GOSSETT:  It's unclear to me whether ornot the St. Cyr case would also generalize to someonewho simply was convicted of a crime at that date.  Andthere's a debate in the lower courts about that.  But,more generally, in my client's context, at the veryleast his decision to stay in the United States for 7years, and thus become eligible for suspension ofdeportation, and then not to leave thereafter, was,itself, a very similar choice to that of the alien inSt. Cyr.  It's a conscious decision to remain here,rather than to leave.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  If he had left voluntarilyunder the pre-'96 law, would he still have been subjectto criminal prosecution for his prior illegal entry ifhe had later come back into the United States?          MR. GOSSETT:  I'm not sure, Your Honor.  Idon't know.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. GOSSETT:  If there are no furtherquestions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my timefor rebuttal.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Gossett.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Mr. Srinivasan.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN      ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice, and may it please the Court:          Section 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline theremoval of aliens who were already removed but havesince illegally reentered.  The Congress that enactedIIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision andexempt those aliens who are already in the countryillegally.  Rather, the focus on streamlining the rulesfor getting illegal reentrants out of the country isfully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicableto illegal reentrants who were already in the countryat the time of IIRIRA's enactment.          Three considerations, I think, point to theconclusion that section 1231(a)(5) is addressed toremoving illegal reentrants from the country, includingaliens who are already in the country, and that theprovision is not so much addressed to the antecedentact of illegal reentry, as such.          The first consideration I would point to isthe operation of the provision.  And it's useful to291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 bear in mind the following possible scenario in which a2 person, who's been removed, illegally reenters the3 country, but then returns to his home country. Now, in4 that situation the individual would have engaged in the5 act of illegal reentry, but section 1231(a)(5) simply6 would have no relevance to him whatsoever, because what7 section 1231(a)(5) seeks to do is to remove someone8 who's found in the country on the basis of their9 previous removal order. Now, if they have engaged in10 the act of illegal reentry, but then have gone back,11 section 1231(a)(5) simply is not relevant. And I think12 that goes to show that what the statute is focused on13 is not the act of illegal reentry, as such, but,14 rather, removing someone who's found in the country and15 who's determined to be an illegal reentrant.16 Now, that operation stands in significant17 contrast to the criminal prohibition against illegal18 reentry, which is at 8 U.S.C. 1326, and the prohibition19 against illegal entry, which is 8 U.S.C. 1325. With20 respect to both of those provisions, the act of illegal21 reentry, or the act of illegal entry, necessarily22 triggers the operation of the criminal prohibition, and23 there's nothing that the alien can do after the fact to24 take himself outside of the -- of the purview of that25 criminal --301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And those --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Should --3 MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And those provisions are5 specifically recited to apply only to reentrants after6 the effective date.7 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Congress8 specifically indicated, in the text of IIRIRA, that9 it's -- it understood the distinction between the way10 in which those provisions operate and the way that11 1231(a)(5) operates. The IIRIRA expanded the scope of12 the criminal prohibition on an illegal reentry, and it13 also, for the first time, imposed civil monetary14 penalties on the act of illegal entry. There were15 civil fines, and then -- I think, $50 to $250 per16 episode. But what's critical is that with respect to17 both of those changes, Congress specified, in the terms18 of IIRIRA, that they would only apply, on a prospective19 basis, to acts of illegal entry or reentry that post-20 dated IIRIRA. Now, Congress made no such specification21 with respect to 1231(a)(5), and I think that's22 significant, because what that indicates is that23 Congress understood that that provision, unlike the two24 criminal -- unlike the two criminal provisions, focuses25 not on the act of illegal reentry, as such, but rather311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me go back to the3 criminal provision for a second. I take it your answer4 to the question I asked your brother a moment ago is5 that if the individual reenters, and, hence, has6 committed a criminal offense, and later voluntarily7 returns to -- in this case, to Mexico, that the8 criminal violation, in effect, would not, in any sense,9 be canceled out.10 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that if he returned, he12 could be prosecuted for the prior reentry. And I13 suppose, in theory -- I don't know what the extradition14 treaty is -- in theory, he might be subject to15 extradition for it.1617181920212223 completed24 completed, and nothing that he does afterwards can take25 --MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right.JUSTICE SOUTER:  The odd way to --MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, Justice --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- Souter.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. SRINIVASAN:  The criminal act isat the moment that the criminal reentry is321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: There's no forgiveness --2 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- provision.4 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. Which is5 different, obviously, from the operation of section6 1231(a)(5).7 Now, another consideration that I think8 indicates that section 1231(a)(5) is focused on the9 timing of the removal, as opposed to the timing of10 reentry, is to take into account section 1231(a)(5) in11 the context of Section 1231 as a whole. Section 123112 was a new provision that was enacted by IIRIRA, and13 Congress entitled it, quote, "Detention and Removal of14 Aliens Ordered Removed," close quote. And, as its15 title indicates, the provisions in section 1231, like16 1231(a)(5), all pertain to executing an order of17 removal against an alien who's been ordered removed.18 For example, those provisions concern the time period19 within which somebody is to be removed. They address20 the travel of somebody to the removal destination, the21 identification of the countries to which they may be22 removed, the payment of expenses. But all of them23 address the execution of an order of removal in the24 same way that section 1231(a)(5) does. Section25 1231(a)(5) speaks to the execution of the pre-existing331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 order of removal, the one that the alien had in place2 when he illegally reentered the country, but it's of a3 piece with those other provisions, in the sense that4 it, like them, addresses the timing of removal rather5 than speaking to the act of illegal reentry, as such.6 The third consideration, I think, that points7 to the same conclusion, which is that Congress was8 focused prospectively on removals that postdated9 IIRIRA, rather than retrospectively, in some sense, on10 acts of illegal reentry that predated IIRIRA, is that11 at the time of illegal reentry, as we explain in -- at12 length in our brief, an alien would have had no13 eligibility, as a categorical matter, and at least as a14 practical matter, for the three types of relief that15 Petitioner invokes. And those three types of relief16 are adjustment of status, suspension of deportation,17 and voluntary departure.18 Now, with respect to adjustment of status, as19 the colloquy earlier indicated, at the time that20 Petitioner illegally reentered the country in 1981, up21 until 1994, which was just 2 years before IIRIRA,22 adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to23 illegal entrants and illegal reentrants. In that24 light, it's -- one would be hard-pressed to assert that25 an illegal reentrant would have performed that act in341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reasonable reliance on the availability of adjustmentof status.  It was simply --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want to --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- unavailable.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want us to decideit on that ground, do you, so that all future casesyou'll have to decide whether he came in before '94 orafter '94, right?          MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, JusticeScalia.  I think a virtue of focusing on the fact thatthis statute is addressed to the removal, rather thanthe act of illegal reentry, is that it decides, onceand for all, what the temporal reach of the statute is.And --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but your point,though -- I mean, someone illegally reentering at thattime might not have had a reasonable expectation of theavailability of discretionary relief.  On the otherhand, someone in the -- a petitioner's position, afterall that had happened, did have a fairly good caseunder those provisions that were no longer available.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, that might be, Mr.Chief Justice, but his claim is that section 1231(a)(5)should be construed not to apply to anyone whoillegally reentered before IIRIRA.  And so, I think the351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 proper frame of reference is to look, ex ante, at what2 someone would be thinking, had they illegally reentered3 before IIRIRA, because he seeks to treat everyone who4 illegally reentered before IIRIRA as a uniform5 category.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and someone7 entering says, "Well, obviously, if I'm detained the8 day after I enter, I'm not going to have a very good9 case. On the other hand, if I'm not, and I happen to10 make a life here, and I'm here for 20 years, and I get11 married and I have a child, I'm going to have a strong12 case," and he's going to -- he's willing to take his13 chances.14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, two responses. First15 of all, that's not true with respect to adjustment of16 status, because someone who reentered before IIRIRA, at17 least if they reentered before 1984, couldn't have18 imagined that their marriage to a United States citizen19 would have given them a basis for adjustment, because20 adjustment simply was categorically unavailable to21 illegal entrants.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you say '84 or '94? I23 couldn't --24 MR. SRINIVASAN: 1994, I'm sorry --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- I didn't -- I -- in '81,when he illegally reentered, through 1994, adjustmentof status was categorically unavailable to people whoillegally reentered, so he couldn't --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- have relied on theavailability of that form of relief.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the executive couldn'tweigh that.  You say, categorically, it -- there's no --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  It simply wasn't provided --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- no possibility fordiscretion.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  It simply wasn't providedfor by statute.  A precondition of eligibility foradjustment, until 1994, was that the person was not anillegal entrant.  So --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, could the -- couldthe INS have just stayed its hand for -- in --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  I mean, I suppose they couldhave stayed their hand, in the sense that they wouldn'thave applied the immigration laws to begin with, but Idon't think there --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- would have been any basis371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to stay their hand, in the sense of granting --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can't imagine that.          MR.

I guess I don't.  Forget the'94/'96 periods.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose it stayed thesame throughout.  Would you say, then, that someone whocame illegally into the country, and he's caught, andhe's married to an American, there's no possibility hecan stay, no matter what, no matter how appealing?  Isthat the answer?          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Not with respect toadjustment of status.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm -- yes, but you'retalking technically.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, I'm speaking --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe there's --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- technically, but --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- some other way you couldstay. What's the other way? 381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. SRINIVASAN: There is -- there's another2 form of relief that --3 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.4 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- conceivably could give5 them a claim --6 JUSTICE BREYER: Which was what?7 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- and that's suspension of8 deportation --9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well --10 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- which is the same --11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then it comes to the --12 MR. SRINIVASAN: But --13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- same thing. So, that --14 what I'm thinking is that a person who is here, and15 they marry an American -- all right? -- they marry a16 citizen. Now, before this Act was passed, there was a17 way that if they're really good -- let's assume they're18 the best human beings around, and the Attorney General19 finds all that out, and everybody knows this is like a20 saint, and they say, "Okay, you behave well enough.21 You can stay." Now, after the Act is passed, all those22 relevant actions have taken place in '86, long before.23 Now, there's absolutely nothing they can do. All they24 can do is go home. And now I've learned that when they25 go home, they will be told, "You cannot come back, no391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 matter what, for 5 years." Now, that's a pretty harsh2 consequence, to separate yourself from your family or3 have your family come to a foreign country. So, if I4 think the first part of this is a wash, you have a5 great argument, they have a great argument, and I look6 to the second part, does it attach new consequences to7 old and unchangeable behavior? I say, yes, it sure8 does. Now, why doesn't it?9 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there's a lot in that10 question. Let me just try to address it one step at a11 time.12 With respect to whether it attaches new legal13 consequences, I think you were right, Justice Breyer,14 earlier, in asking about what would happen if he had15 gone back voluntarily. Now, it's true that if he had16 been removed, then there would have been the17 consequence, in the sense that there would be18 of inadmissibility, at least presumptive19 inadmissibility, a period, which, by the way,20 subject to waiver, which he could apply for.21 had just gone back voluntarily after IIRIRA's22 enactment, or, indeed, in the 6-month window between23 IIRIRA's enactment and IIRIRA's effective date, my24 understanding is that there would have been no25 presumptive period of inadmissibility. 401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOa periodisBut if he￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. So, then, you're saying2 the answer I got before was wrong --3 4 5 67 he's come8 "I've heard about this in IIRIRA, and what in heaven's9 name am I supposed to do?" And the lawyer says, "GetMR. SRINIVASAN:  I think --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that, in fact --MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think that's correct.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I now have my client in,after IIRIRA has been enacted, and he says,10 out fast, next train. Go back. And if you get across11 that border, you're safe. Because at that point, you12 can apply; and you're a saint, and you've been married,13 they'll let you right in, because they'll find out."14 That's what your view of the law is.15 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's my understanding of16 the law.17 JUSTICE BREYER: It must be the one way or18 the other.19 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the five -- the 5-year20 period that Petitioners -- Mr. Gossett was referring21 to, I think, relates to the period after the point in22 time at which somebody's deported or removed. And so,23 his initial deportation --24 JUSTICE BREYER: No, in -- and this is not --25 I was saying the question --411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. SRINIVASAN: He would --2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- would be, is this Act3 attaching consequences to old things that you couldn't4 do anything about? And you're saying, "Not entirely.5 You can. You can leave. In which case, you'll be no6 worse off, except for the train fare."7 8 9MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right.JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's my --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That --MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- understanding.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That person has notreentered the United States?  He's gone back,10 11 1213 illegally14 but he did illegally reenter the United States. He15 wouldn't be covered by the same provision that we're16 talking about?17 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, he -- you're right, Mr.18 Chief Justice, that it's -- that he's illegally19 reentered. But he wouldn't be covered by this20 provision, because all this provision seeks to do is to21 remove him. And then, once he's gone back, this22 provision simply ceases to have any relevance to him at23 all, because he's, in some sense, self-removed. And24 so, he -- any25 provision, it1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400ineligibility wouldn't stem from thiswould come from somewhere else.  And, as42Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 far as I'm aware, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't be subject2 to the 5-year period of inadmissibility that's imposed3 by a separate provision and that would attach if he4 were removed, because, by hypothesis, he wouldn't have5 removed, he would have gone back on his own accord.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And even if he was, that was7 waivable.8 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. That's9 subject to waiver, which is another --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just as he doesn't11 automatically get admitted because he's married, does12 he?13 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. That's --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's discretionary, as15 well.16 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's discretionary --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's --18 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- at the end of the day --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- one discretion --20 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- as well.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and another discretion.22 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And we lay this out23 in some detail in a -- in a footnote in our brief. And24 that's at -- that's at pages 39 to 40. But that25 footnote, I should point out, doesn't deal with your431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 hypothetical, Justice Breyer, which is that he goes2 back of -- on his own accord. And, I think, in that3 situation what he would do is what people ordinarily do4 when they're seeking to gain lawful admission to the5 country, which is to apply for admission on the basis6 of what would have been whatever relationships he could7 have asserted at that point. Now, he wasn't married at8 the time that IIRIRA was enacted, so he wouldn't have9 used his marriage as a basis for coming in, because he10 wasn't married as of yet. But I think that cuts more11 against him, rather than in his favor, because --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the instance --13 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- of course --14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of a child --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who had -- he had a17 relationship to a child in the United States. And18 couldn't that have counted for suspension of19 deportation or removal, whatever terms I use now? Did20 --21 MR. SRINIVASAN: It --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for a hardship claim, a23 parent-child relationship?24 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice25 Ginsburg, it would count for purposes of suspension of441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 deportation, which was renamed cancellation of removal.2 But that form of relief is available to somebody who's3 inside the United States, and I was meaning to address4 the situation where he has voluntarily removed himself5 from the United States and is seeking admission from,6 presumably, Mexico, in which case, suspension of7 deportation wouldn't really come into play, because8 deportation wouldn't be on the table.9 But, you're right that if he had stayed in10 the country, suspension of deportation is a form of11 relief that he would have been eligible for -- eligible12 for, pre-IIRIRA. But, with respect to suspension of13 deportation, I think it's important to understand that14 that form of relief required an -- a period of presence15 in the United States of 7 years before one could gain16 eligibility to seek that relief. And so --17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He was here -- he was here18 for 20 --19 MR. SRINIVASAN: He --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- 20 years, though.21 MR. SRINIVASAN: He was. So, he would have22 clearly met that eligibility criteria -- there is no23 question about that -- under the pre-existing law. But24 if you put yourself in the position of somebody who is25 entering, pre-IIRIRA, and is trying to determine451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 whether suspension of deportation is relief that would2 be realistically available to them, you'd have to think3 that they would act on -- in reliance on their ability4 to stay in the country for 7 years, and to remain5 undetected, only at which point they would qualify for6 suspension of deportation. And that not only seems to7 me, as a factual matter, somewhat farfetched, but it's8 not clear9 that sort1011 1213 of the history of now I- -- before INS, weren't there a14 great many people who got here and -- just as this15 Petitioner -- who just lived here for years and years,16 and were never disturbed?17 MR. SRINIVASAN: As an -- as an empirical18 matter, I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg, but I'm19 not sure that that necessarily means that that's a20 legitimate expectation or a reasonable reliance21 interest of the type that the Court would typically22 take into account in its retroactivity inquiry, becausethat the law should attach significance toof reliance --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it --MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- interest.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it farfetched, in view23 at the end of the day what it24 interest that's predicated on25 prosecutorial resources, or a461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOis, is a relianceessentially lack offavorable exercise of￼1 prosecutorial discretion in some sense. And the Court2 hasn't attached significance to that sort of reliance3 interest before. It's --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or, put more starkly, if I5 continue to violate the law for 7 years, I can count on6 this kind of treatment. That's an odd reliance7 interest.8 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, and --9 particularly taking into account the reasonable reliance10 -- the category "reasonable reliance" is designed to take11 -- is designed to --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --13 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- account for its fairness14 --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this elementary --16 MR. SRINIVASAN: -- interests.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- an elementary question,18 just to be sure we all agree on this? You do agree, do19 you not, that if, in 1997, Congress passed a statute20 that said you should get an extra $50 penalty for21 having come in, back in 1981, that would not be22 permissible?23 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. I think the24 presumption --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: And --471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SRINIVASAN:          JUSTICE STEVENS:irony in the fact that thegreat deal more serious.          MR. SRINIVASAN:removal is more serious --          JUSTICE STEVENS:-- against retroactive -- And there's sort of anactual consequence here is aWell, the consequence of Yes.-- than -- in some sense,          MR. SRINIVASAN:than a $50 penalty.  That's right.  But this is aperson --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which is constitutionallyprohibited.  But the consequences here are permitted.I understand the analysis.  It's like just saying wetake away one ground for staying that we didn't havebefore.  But looking at it in kind of a basic sense,that seems -- it's a fairly serious thing --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, but          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- that happens,effects an awful lot of people, doesn't it?-- and it          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.  I think itanyone who had illegally reentered, at least.  But it'simportant to bear in mind that this is somebody who wasalready subject to a removal order.  So, in some sense,sending them back out of the country puts them in thesame position that they would have been in under the481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOaffects￼1 old removal order. And so, insofar as it has that2 effect on them, I think it's different than a $503 penalty that attaches to the primary conduct of illegal4 reentry, as such.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you read the Tenth6 Circuit opinion as indicated it might have had a7 different8 enactment9result if he had been married before theof the statute?MR. SRINIVASAN:  There is that suggestion, IJudge McConnell's opinion, and that's --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How does that fit with the10 think, in1112 court's theory? 1314 Circuit's1516171819 what the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize was that20 adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to21 somebody who illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at22 least before 1994. And what Judge McConnell presumed23 was that it would have been available. And his point24 was that even25 farfetched to1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400if it would have been available, it'sthink that somebody would have thought49Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. SRINIVASAN:  With the -- with the Tenththeory or --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How does it --MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- the idea was -- I think￼1 not only about coming into the country, but coming into2 the country and then meeting a United States citizen,3 and become married to the United States citizen, and4 using that as sort of a reliance basis for not applying5 the law retroactively to somebody who had come in6 beforehand. But I think that was based on a7 misimpression about the availability of adjustment of8 status.9 Now, I'd like to address, briefly, if I10 could, the argument at step one of the Landgraf inquiry11 concerning the negative inference the Petitioner seeks12 to draw from the "before or after" clause -- so-called13 "before or after" clause. And the two provisions can14 be compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the15 Government's brief, and that's in the body of the16 Government's brief.17 The fundamental flaw with the argument at18 step one is that the "before or after" clause in the19 old provision, which is at the bottom of page 2,20 referred, by terms, to the date of the INA's enactment.21 Now, what we've reflected is the codified version,22 which refers specifically to the date of June 27 of23 1952. But even the INA itself referred to the date of24 the enactment of this Act, which can only be seen to25 refer to the INA itself. So, if this language had been501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 carried forward in section 1231(a)(5), it still would2 have been a reference to the date of the enactment of3 the INA. So, it would refer to somebody who was4 deported before or after 1952.5 Now, I think, as Justice Alito suggested, the6 probable reason that Congress decided not to carry7 forward this language is because the question of8 whether someone was deported before or after 19529 doesn't have a great deal of practical significance at10 this point in time. But whatever one might think was11 the actual reason for Congress's failing to carry12 forward the language, I don't think that you can draw13 any negative inference from Congress's failure to carry14 forward that language, at least certainly not the15 negative inference that Petitioner wants to draw. In16 fact, the negative inference that one would draw, if17 one were going to do so, is that the section 1231(a)(5)18 applies only to people who were deported initially19 after 1952. But that sort of negative inference20 wouldn't be of much assistance to Petitioner, or any21 other person, for that matter, that illegally reentered22 before IIRIRA, at least as a practical matter, because23 everybody, I think, in that category, would have24 illegally reentered -- or would have been deported25 after 1952, rather.511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that gives theother side the -- you know, the benefit of theirargument.  I think what they're arguing is not justthat it was deleted, but that it was not replaced by --whether "before or after," and then filling in the dateof IIRIRA, rather than the date of the INA.  I have --nobody thinks that they would leave in June 27, 1952,but why wouldn't they have substituted, for that, thedate of this new legislation, the date of IIRIRA?  Ithink that's the point he's making.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And isn't there something tothat?          MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- it's -- there'scertainly not enough there to make the argument thathe's making, I don't think, because what was -- whatCongress did was to replace that provision with uttersilence.  And from that utter silence, I don't thinkthere's any way to read into it that Congress meant forthe applicability of section 1231(a)(5) --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just getting rid of oldlanguage that was no longer --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- or intentionally notadding new language.521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right.  I don't thinkthere's any way to read into it the inference thatCongress meant to hinge the applicability of section1231(a)(5) on IIRIRA's enactment date.  There never wasa proposal on the table to hinge section 1231(a)(5)'sapplicability on IIRIRA's enactment date.  The onlypossibility was to keep the old provision in thestatute books unaffected, and the decision not do thatdoesn't have the negative inference that Petitionersuggests.          If the Court has no more questions --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          Mr. Gossett, you have 2 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GOSSETT                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. GOSSETT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.Only a few points I want to make.          The first is that illegal reentrants'reasonable expectation that they might grow intorelief, as Mr. -- the Chief Justice said, not only isreasonable, but has a statutory basis.  Suspension ofdeportation and cancellation of removal, by their veryterms, are only available to aliens who were illegallypresent in the United States for the relevant timeperiod, and, therefore, these forms of relief531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 specifically exist to -- for such aliens. That people2 have a reasonable reliance interest in unlawful acts3 over time is also demonstrated by such doctrines as the4 doctrine of adverse possession, statutes of5 limitations/laches, et cetera.6 Second, Justice Breyer, your -- it is the7 case that were he to have been -- have left after the8 enactment of this Act, he would be kept out for --9 inadmissible for 5 years. That's 8 U.S.C.10 1182(a)(6)(B). Because he had reentered the country11 within 5 years of his 1981 deportation, he -- under the12 Government's interpretation of that statute, he would13 be inadmissible for 5 years from -- even if he were to14 re-leave in 1996, he would have been ineligible to15 reenter for 5 years.16 JUSTICE BREYER: So, a person who just leaves17 voluntarily, having reentered illegally, cannot come18 back for 5 years, no matter what, under 1156(a)(6)(B).1920 --2122232425 of IIRIRA541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR.
