SMITH:  Mr. --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Smith.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA K. SMITH                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MS. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, andplease the Court:[11:07 a.m.] argument          The question presented in this case iswhether one occupant can give law enforcement validconsent to search the common areas of a premisesshared with another, even though another occupant ispresent and objects to the search.  The State ofGeorgia submits that the answer to this case is aresounding yes.  It is reasonable to recognize that aperson who satisfies Matlock's definition of commonauthority -- that is, a definition that is not basedupon property-law concepts, but one who has mutual useof property by virtue of having joint access orcontrol for most purposes -- can give consent for asearch of that premises, in his or her own right.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do we look to what issocially acceptable?  Is there some language to that3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005may it￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425effect in some of our cases?          MS. SMITH:  There has been some of that insome of the prior cases, Your Honor, that you do lookto social norms.  You've also said --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do you think it is thenorm that, if there are co-inhabitants of a house orapartment, that it's okay to let a stranger in,against the express wishes of your spouse or co-inhabitant?          MS. SMITH:  I think that is --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  You think that's sociallyacceptable?          MS. SMITH:  I think it is -- I think it iscommon, Your Honor.  As much as one would like tothink --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, it might be common,but I'm not sure that's an acceptable kind ofperformance.          MS. SMITH:  Well, I think, Your Honor, wehave what we have called either adduced expectation ofprivacy or a limited expectation of privacy or what wecalled a shared expectation of privacy, by making thedecision, long before police appear at the door, toshare this premises with someone.  And by --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What -- 4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. SMITH:  -- that decision --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- what if the spouse hadput a sign up, "No police allowed here"?          MS. SMITH:  I don't think that, even as --in -- one could ensure that the spouse would honor theother person's wishes.  I think this case is here togive some substance to the recognition in Matlock ofthe ability of the cotenant to consent, in his or herown right.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about the extent ofthe search?  Can the wife say, "It's okay for you tocome in, and you can look in my husband's top drawer"?          MS. SMITH:  I think, Your Honor, that wouldbe a question of fact, under the circumstances, to seewhether the husband has exhibited some exclusive useof that drawer or whether the facts would demonstratethat she puts socks in there for him, she puts ----JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, how does the --MS. SMITH:  -- notes in there --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- how does the policemanMS. SMITH:  -- for him --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- so, how is the5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 policeman supposed to know that?2 MS. SMITH: Well, I think -- looking -- we3 measure what is reasonable on the part of the police4 by looking to what they know. And Rodriguez made very5 clear, one does -- a policeman doesn't simply accept6 every invitation to enter. If there's some ambiguity7 or some uncertainty, the policeman has a duty to8 inquire. And, I think, looking into the facts of this9 particular case is a good example. You have police10 who were called to the marital home of Mr. and Mrs.11 Randolph. It arose out of a domestic dispute, because12 Mr. Randolph had absconded with the couple's child.13 The officer -- this was a small town -- the officer14 knew Mr. Randolph, because Mr. Randolph was a local15 attorney. The officer knew that Ms. -- who the wife16 was. And he knew this was the couple's home. When he17 got there, in talking with the wife -- Mr. Randolph18 was off with the child, hasn't returned to the19 residence -- he learned that they had been having some20 problems, but, in looking at the two conversations21 that ensued, the policeman learned that, despite the22 problems, she was back, she was living there. There23 was no separation.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought she said she25 came to collect her belongings. That didn't sound6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 like she's intending to stay very long.2 MS. SMITH: She did not -- she did not relay3 that to the officer. That came from Mr. Randolph, in4 his testimony at the suppression hearing. All --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it relevant6 what the status of the person is? Someone might not7 know -- the police might not know that someone on the8 premises is a temporary visitor.9 MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -- and I think10 that, looking at the tenor of the conversations, that11 is exactly what this officer ascertained. He knew12 that she was there, they had been living there, she13 was back, she had been on a visit. She did not tell14 him they were separated. She did not tell him she was15 --16171819 she? She 20JUSTICE GINSBURG:  She called --MS. SMITH:  -- only there --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the police, didn'tcalled the police to come.MS. SMITH: She called the police. And what 21 we have, more importantly, is a factfinding by the22 trial court that she, in fact, had common authority to23 give consent to search.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: And is that a -- is there25 any issue about that here?7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, I thought3 the issue was whether his statement, in effect, vetoed4 whatever -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, whatever5 permission might have been given. But, as I -- I6 understood that there was no question -- what is it? -7 - under Rodriguez, at least -- of her authority,8 facially to admit the police to the places that they9 went.10 MS. SMITH: That is our position, Your11 Honor. I think there has been some question raised by12 the Respondent, in his brief, trying to challenge both13 her authority over the actual bedroom, itself, which14 is an issue that wasn't raised below.151617 raised in 181920 abandoned 2122 getting pretty far from what I think is really the key23 question in the case. Matlock is decided. And24 Matlock said -- it referred to the risk that a joint25 occupant undertakes, the risk of inability to controlJUSTICE SOUTER:  That's what I thought.MS. SMITH:  And there had been an argumentthe appellate court --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we --MS. SMITH:  -- about whether she hadthe property.  But the trial --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But all of this is really8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425access during one's absence.  So, the scene in Matlockis: one occupant is there, the other is absent; andthe one who was absent assumes the risk that the onewho was there will exercise control.  Matlock doesn'tspeak to the two people who are in disagreementsituation.          MS. SMITH:  That is correct, Your Honor, asto not addressing the spectral situation.  But I woulddisagree that Matlock simply only spoke to an absentnonconsenting defendant.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what if we think itdoes?  Because that's how I read it, too, that Matlockgoverns where one of the people is absent.  And wehave a situation that's different here.  Now what ruledo we look to?          MS. SMITH:  I think you look to whether shehas common authority over the premises in his -- inher own right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Even when --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- even when the husbandis physically present and says no?          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor, because, firstof all, you said, in Rodriguez, the Constitution does 9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not guarantee that a search, only with the defendant'sconsent, will occur.  Your Honors said that --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But, do you --          MS. SMITH:  -- only a search that --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- do you --          MS. SMITH:  -- is unreasonable --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- think the officers hadsufficient grounds to get a warrant here for a search?          MS. SMITH:  They ultimately did, Your Honor,but that consideration of getting a warrant was alsoat play in Matlock and, I think, in Rodriguez.  Andthe point is, if one has valid consent, you don't haveto get a warrant.  They --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But that's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but that's the  --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- the issue.  Is itvalid consent when the co-owner, the husband, is thereand says, "No, you don't"?          MS. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, I think you --we come back to the fact that he does not have areasonable expectation of absolute or unequivocalcontrol --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I guess that --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?  I --10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that depends on what wesay.  I'm, frankly, still somewhat surprised at youranswer to Justice O'Connor, indicating that it happensall the time where there are two occupants, and oneexpressly says, "You can't come in," and they doanyway.  But leaving that aside, it seems to me thatmost of the considerations that would impel a decisionin your favor can be answered under other doctrines.If there's cocaine that's being used and may bedestroyed, there's exigent circumstances.  I don't seethe necessity for the rule that you propose.          MS. SMITH:  Well, I think, Your Honor, itsability -- if we're going to have consent, and ifwe're going to have a third-party-consent rule, thenthis is an issue that is going to have to be resolved.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're talking about --          MS. SMITH:  I'm --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- reasonable expectations,I suppose, here.          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you assume that it - - that it is the reasonable expectation of two people who have -- who are living together in -- on -- in common premises, that, where one of them wants somebody to come in, and the other one does not want11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 somebody to come in, the person may come in? I would2 think that the normal assumption is just the opposite,3 that, where one wants somebody excluded, that person4 will be excluded.5 MS. SMITH: Well, I think, in the Morning6 case that was cited in the brief, they realized one7 can always hope that the other will accede to one's8 wishes. But, this is the dynamics of personal9 behavior, and I think it comes from an almost10 subliminal assertion that the person who was saying no11 does, in fact, have absolute authority over --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: In --13 MS. SMITH: -- that shared --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock --15 MS. SMITH: -- premises. And that's --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock --17 MS. SMITH: -- that's out of sync --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock, did the -- did19 the absent person say no?20 MS. SMITH: He was -- it -- he was silent.21 He had been arrested --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you --23 MS. SMITH: -- on the scene --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you don't even have, in25 Matlock, a situation where you know that one of the12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 parties didn't want entry. You don't know that. You2 -- there was one party there, and that party said,3 "Okay, come in." And the other party said, "Well, if4 I had been consulted, I would have said no," or5 whatever. But --6 MS. SMITH: Well, in -- and even in that7 situation, Matlock, the reference to the absent8 nonconsenting defendant was in a paragraph where the9 court had talked about how it had reserved, in Amos --10 the Amos case -- the question of whether a wife could11 waive her husband's rights. And then you had decided12 the Frazier case, and that was what was described as13 the nonconsenting absent codefendant in which two14 cousins had shared the use of a duffle bag, and the15 defendant had left the duffle bag with the cousin. The16 cousin and his mother gave consent for the search.17 And it simply was not that the defendant was not18 present, but this Court found there was mutual use of19 that bag that gave the cousin the authority to20 consent. And then, the Court readily rejected21 Frazier's arguments that, "Well, the cousin could only22 use one compartment of the duffle bag." And you said23 you wouldn't get into such metaphysical distinctions.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. --25 MS. SMITH: But --13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- Ms. Smith, may I -- your2 time is getting short, and I want to get clear on one3 thing. As I understand it, your argument is not an4 argument that the husband, in this case, lost an5 expectation of privacy. You are not arguing that he6 has no right to object. Am I correct on that?78 called it 910 1112 your whole argument rests on the fact that, although13 he has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy,14 that is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let15 people, including the police, come into an area which16 is under her control, as well as his. Is that it?17 MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.19 MS. SMITH: -- that is. And I think,20 looking at Justice Stevens' dissent in Rodriguez,21 there is that recognition of: When you make the22 decision to share premises with another, you have lost23 the expectation of exclusive or absolute control --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your expectation --25 this is what I'm trying to get at -- your expectation14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MS. SMITH:  I think, Your Honor, we hada --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, and let me --MS. SMITH:  -- a reduced --JUSTICE SOUTER:  If that is correct, then￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is not what governs.  You concede, as I understand it,that he still had an expectation, in the sense that hecould assert a right of privacy, he can litigate thiscase, he has standing --          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- but that his expectationis irrelevant to the fact that the wife, in this case,we assume, had the right to admit them to an areawhich was under her control, as well as his.  Is --have I got it correct?          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor, I think so.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MS. SMITH:  I think that his -- hisexpectation is unreasonable.  And we would urge theCourt not to adopt that and enshrine that as the rulefor fourth amendment, third-party searches.          If there are no further questions, I'll savethe remainder --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, you would distinguish-- in your answer to Justice Souter -- this is -- thisis a lawyer.  One room in the house is devoted -- ishis office.          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Her permission wouldn'textend to that room, would it?15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. SMITH:  I think it would -- it wouldhave presented a much closer question of -- andparticularly given the protection of papers and thefact that you may have business papers in there withattorney-client privilege -- I think her authority toconsent it would have presented a closer question,although it would still be something to look at undertotality of circumstances.  She might have operated asa paralegal.  She might have been his secretary.  Shemight have known where he stashed his cocaine under aparticular file.          But that's not the question we have in thiscase.  We're talking about common areas of a maritalhome over which both have equal access and control.And we would urge this Court to recognize that she,with common authority over those premises, has theability to admit police and give consent to a search,in her own right.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          Mr. Dreeben.         ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN,       FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The law of consent searches is governed by a2 determination of what is reasonable for the police to3 do in a particular circumstance, and it starts from4 the premise that consent is not a disfavored species5 in the law, that cooperation with law enforcement is a6 good thing and should be encouraged.7 The right of the cotenant, in this case, to8 consent stems from her common authority, which is9 independent of his and allows her to serve valuable10 social interests, as well as interests that represent11 her own personal interest. Many of these cases arise12 not among couples who are harmonious, but among13 couples in which there is some degree of tension, and14 the spouse who consents in these situations has an15 independent interest in ensuring that she can call16 upon the protection of the law.17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we --18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was --19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Go ahead.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was curious,21 though, which way that fact cut. I can see the22 argument that the closer the relationship, the more23 reasonable it is to say that the one party more or24 less recognizes that their privacy interests are held25 hostage to the views of the other. It's when you get17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the disrupted relationship, or their adverse2 interests, that maybe the expectations of privacy, or3 the reasonableness of one acting as an agent of the4 other, becomes a little more strained.5 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I6 don't think that the law in this area is founded on a7 notion of agency. It's founded on a notion of8 independent authority of each to grant access to the9 police, to cooperate with law enforcement with respect10 to premises over which authority is shared. And in a11 case like this, the wife has an independent interest12 in disassociating herself from criminal activity that13 is going on, on the premises.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But she can do that by15 advising the police, and then there's probable cause.16 Or, if the husband's there, there are probably17 exigent circumstances.18 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, there may19 well be other bases to allow law enforcement activity20 to go on, but that presupposes that her authority to21 consent is somehow qualified: If the police could22 obtain a warrant or some other doctrine, would it23 support the search? And this Court has twice rejected24 exactly that approach to the analysis of consent25 searches.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, does this2 authority to let someone in, over the objection of the3 cohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it -- is it4 also the case that -- I don't know, as a matter of,5 what, property law, or whatever? -- that when two6 people have common ownership of a piece of land or a7 house or whatever, and one of them says, "I don't want8 a certain party to come on," the tie always goes to9 the other party, who says, "I do want somebody to come10 on," is that -- is there any cases that establish that11 proposition? It seems to me an odd proposition. I12 would have thought the opposite.13 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the law of property,14 Justice Scalia, to the extent that it's relevant here,15 would allow any cotenant to license his or her16 interest --17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we have not decided18 Fourth Amendment issues on the basis of the law of19 property, 202122have we?MR. DREEBEN:  I quite agree, Justice --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Don't we --MR. DREEBEN:  -- O'Connor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- have to look at social2324 understanding on right to privacy? And how is it that25 you can construe, in every instance, a right of a19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 cotenant to override the express objections of the2 other cotenant, who's there, and says no? How can you3 say that's acceptable?4 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice O'Connor, I5 certainly do not think that there is any uniform6 social understanding that should drive the decision in7 this case, for two different reasons. First of all, I8 think, in many circumstances, two people who share9 property, and who disagree about whether a guest10 should be invited, will resolve it in a variety of11 different ways. Somebody might let in a commercial12 visitor, over the objection of a cotenant, or someone13 --14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's possible,15 but you have a case here where the wife says, "Come16 in," and the husband is right there and says, "No, you17 can't."18 MR. DREEBEN: And I think that the other19 factor that the Court needs to consider in evaluating20 this is not just social expectations with respect to21 non-law-enforcement events and visitors, but this22 positive, affirmative social interest in encouraging23 cooperation with the law, which is something that she24 has the ability to do with respect to property over25 which she has common authority.20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- well, you keep2 saying that, but that policy is -- can be vindicated3 by using doctrines other than consent. And you want4 us to -- I think you want us to say, I think we have5 to say, that there's a general social expectation that6 the person who wants entry overrides the person who7 doesn't.8 MR. DREEBEN: I --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I also agree with10 Justice Scalia, that social expectation may be, in11 part, measured by our cases on this subject. And I12 just don't see how, if it's against the interest of an13 occupant to allow entry, that that -- that that14 interest must, necessarily, be overridden.15 MR. DREEBEN: I think that what the Court16 needs to do is look at the consent-search doctrine in17 relation to third-party consents, generally. Matlock18 makes quite clear that if the objecting -- potentially19 objecting party, the target of the search, does not20 voice an objection, then the third party has full21 authority to allow the search, even if they're --22 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, yes, but there's23 kind of an assumption there that if the cotenant is24 not there, sure, you'll let the tenant who is there25 call the shots.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think that, on the2 facts of either Matlock or Rodriguez, that would be a3 particularly logical or reasonable assumption. In4 Matlock, you're dealing with a man who was arrested5 for bank robbery in the front lawn of his house, the6 police take him to a police car, put him in a police7 car, do not ask him for consent; instead, they go back8 and they ask the woman, with whom he is living at the9 house, for consent to search.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --11 MR. DREEBEN: Rodriguez is even more12 dramatic, because, in Rodriguez, the victim of a13 battery, Gail Fischer, seeks out the police and says,14 "I want you to arrest Rodriguez," and brings him to15 the -- to -- the police to the apartment, where they16 enter and arrest Rodriguez. Surely, if Rodriguez had17 been asked, or if Matlock had been asked, the18 presumption is, they would have objected.19 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two questions?20 Seems to me you're -- if we're using social analogies21 in what happens, I imagine that it would make a22 difference if the person who wants to -- who was23 invited in by the wife, is larger or smaller than the24 husband.2522[Laughter.]Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I think he probablywould not go in if he thought he was a -- could not doso --[Laughter.]          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- in his physicalencounter.  And the problem with your case here is,the police officer is always larger than thehomeowner, and he always has the power to override anyphysical objection.  So, I think that the -- theactual social situation will vary tremendously fromdifferent facts as to the fair -- and yet, we'relooking for a rule that applies equally across theboard --          MR. DREEBEN:  Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- in this case.          MR. DREEBEN:  At --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the second question Iwant you to address at the same time is, What if thiswas a suitcase that they both owned?  They stopped inthe airport.  The wife says, "I don't want you to openit," and her husband says, "Go ahead and open it," orvice versa.          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Stevens, thesecond one is the easier one.  The same rule applies.Anyone who has common authority over the suitcase 23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 should be able to cooperate with law enforcement to2 vindicate both the social interest in cooperating with3 a law enforcement request and the interests of the4 person's who's making it. And I think that that's5 what Matlock is all about.678 police -- 9Now, as for the attempt to mirror --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Matlock is the reasonablewell, go ahead.  I shouldn't interrupt.MR. DREEBEN:  The attempt to transpose10 ordinary social understandings from a myriad of11 infinitely varied settings that do not involve law12 enforcement, I submit, will not correctly allow this13 Court to calibrate what it should be doing, which is14 balancing the individual interests in privacy against15 the social interests that affirmatively encourage and16 validate the use of consent. And I think what Matlock17 does, to put this case in context, is to illustrate18 that if the police had waited until Respondent had19 left his house to go to work, or to go to court, or to20 do anything else, or if he had stayed there and gone21 to sleep at night, then Matlock tells us that she22 would have full authority to allow the police into the23 house to conduct a search of common areas. And, for24 this Court to announce a rule that says, no, when the25 person is there on the scene and vocalizes an24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 objection, which we can reasonably presume that he2 would have if he was given the opportunity to voice3 it, would mean that police simply have an incentive to4 find a different way to accomplish the same end. And5 I would submit that that does not give adequate --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: The "different way," of7 course, would be to get a warrant.8 MR. DREEBEN: An option would be to get a9 warrant in cases where the police do have probable10 cause, but, as this Court recognized in Schneckloth11 versus Bustamonte, the courts -- the officers will not12 always have probable cause.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they, on -- in --14 on these facts -- I thought not, but perhaps I was15 wrong -- the -- when the police come to the house,16 they don't suspect anything about cocaine. Wife then17 accuses husband of being a cocaine user. So, that's18 the first information the police have. Could they get19 a warrant, just on her say-so? In fact, they got the20 straw that had the cocaine residue on it. They went21 to the magistrate with that straw, and he gave them a22 warrant. But if they had23 accusation, "He -- he's a24 amount to probable cause?25 MR. DREEBEN: Inothing but the wife'scocaine user," would thatthink it clearly would, 25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Justice Ginsburg.  And the facts in this --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It would, or would not?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would?          MR. DREEBEN:  It would amount to probablecause if the wife, who has -- she's in a positionwhere she would know what's going on in the house,what kind of activity is going on in the house, she isa presumptively reliable citizen providing informationto the police, and the fact --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  All she said is, "He's acocaine user."  Does that -- does that -- does thatgive probable cause to believe that there are -- youknow, that there's contraband on the premises or --          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's not all she said,Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.          MR. DREEBEN:  What she said was that therewere items of drug evidence --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MR. DREEBEN:  -- in the house.  And if youlook at the warrant that the officers obtained, itmore clearly elaborates that she said there were drugsand paraphernalia.  But, for the Court's purposes,this case is virtually identical to Illinois versusMcArthur with respect to the probable cause.  You have26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 a wife and a husband who are in a domestic dispute,2 and the wife comes out, in Illinois versus McArthur,3 and tells the officers, you know, "He's got drugs4 inside there." And the Court was unanimous, I5 believe, on the point that that furnished probable6 cause. But what is different from Illinois versus7 McArthur, and this case, is that the police officers8 have the consent of someone who reasonably appears to9 them to have common authority, someone who's living in10 the marital home, someone who is in a position to know11 what's going on and exercise her own independent12 authority. And for this Court to say, "Well, there13 are alternatives" -- you know, the police could pull14 Respondent out of the house and quarantine it while15 they go get a warrant, or the police could do other16 investigation, or they could rely on exigent17 circumstances -- what that does is treats her consent18 as worth nothing. It reduces her --19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, not nothing,20 because we have cases that have said: If the co-21 inhabitant is not there, he relinquishes whatever22 right he had to object. But if the co-inhabitant is23 there, and says no, what's the matter with giving24 effect to that?25 MR. DREEBEN: I think it's very odd to say27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that, in Matlock, the right was relinquished, when2 Matlock was arrested and taken to a police car and was3 never asked for consent, or that Rodriguez4 relinquished his right by falling asleep in his own5 apartment. What really -- I would qualify my6 statement, though, in response to your comment,7 Justice O'Connor. It's not that it treats it as8 nothing. It would treat her consent as 100 percent9 valid when he's asleep or absent, no matter how much10 we know he would object, and it would treat it as zero11 when he's on the scene and vocalizes an objection.12 And I think that that would protect Fourth Amendment13 rights only by happenstance, or, worse, it would14 simply be an invitation to the --15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it's by16 happenstance that the police find the wife in the17 house. I mean, it's six of one, half a dozen of the18 other. It's a happenstance.19 MR. DREEBEN: Well, in this case, as in many20 other cases involving this kind of potential incident,21 the wife called the police to the scene. So, there22 was a reason for them to be on the scene. It was a23 perfectly valid investigatory step. And once they24 acquired the information relating to drugs on the25 premises, and had the authority of someone who's in28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 charge of the premises, I submit that the police2 should be able to conduct the search as a reasonable3 matter under the Fourth Amendment, just as they would4 if Respondent had been asleep or if Respondent had5 said, "Well, I have to go now. Am I free to go?" and6 the police said that, "You are."7 And I don't think that it always would be an8 advantage for the nonconsenting tenant, somebody like9 Mr. Randolph, to insist on the police getting a10 warrant or conducting a probable-cause arrest. If11 he's arrested, he's taken down to the station, he has12 a search incident to arrest, he may not get a hearing13 for 48 hours. If the police do have to get a warrant,14 they are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in15 the premises; whereas, in this case, one of16 Respondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible.17 Well, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the18 police upstairs, and the police had found nothing,19 that might have been the end of the whole incident.20 And I think that it's because of the socially valuable21 function of efficiently resolving accusations,22 potentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct23 that consent searches can facilitate, that this Court24 has said that consent searches are a positive social25 good and should be encouraged, rather than29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 discouraged.2 JUSTICE THOMAS: Mr. Dreeben, is it -- is3 this case materially different if she simply ran4 upstairs, grabbed the straw, brought it down, and5 handed it to the police officer? It's, in effect, the6 same thing, isn't it?7 MR. DREEBEN: It is, in effect, the same8 thing. And I think that, had that happened, there9 would have been no question that, assuming that the10 police reasonably believed that she had authority to11 do it, and possibly even if they didn't, the12 contraband would have come into the hands of law13 enforcement, and there is really no reason, or14 doctrine under the Fourth Amendment, to deny it.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take the16 position that there's no legal difference between, (a)17 entering a home and taking something, and, (b)18 receiving it on the outside?19 MR. DREEBEN: I think that the difference,20 when you receive something with the consent of someone21 who has the authority to exercise control over it, is22 a question of whether she leads the police upstairs,23 or whether she brings the item downstairs. And, for24 Fourth Amendment purposes, I don't see a difference.25 Thank you.30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Dreeben. Mr. Goldstein.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice, and may it please the Court:          The Court should hold that it is notreasonable for officers to conduct a consent searchwhen a person with an equivalent interest in thepremises expressly objects.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about thetelephone call between a husband and wife, and thewife tells the police, "Listen in on this call"?She's consented to the monitoring of the conversation,the husband has not.  Maybe he even begins the call bysaying, "I -- don't let anybody else listen to this." It's clear that that is admissible, isn't it?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is, Mr. Chief Justice,although not on the theory of third-party consent.The analog to your hypothetical, which is this Court'sdecision in Lopez, is Justice Thomas' reference toCoolidge versus New Hampshire -- to the New Hampshirecase.  And what happens there is, this -- Mrs.Randolph could take the cocaine and give it to the31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 officer. She was participating in giving an item to2 them. It is not the same, I think, when she3 authorizes the police to conduct a generalized search4 of the premises. It would be as if --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She's consenting.6 It's an intrusion, in the one case, on the7 conversation; in the other case, on the home. In the8 telephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the9 consent of one party subjects the other to having the10 conversation monitored. In this case, the consent of11 one party subjects the other party to the search.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: But -- yes, Mr. Chief13 Justice. I do think that Lopez and White, in that14 line of cases, established that other things that15 people do consent to can expose us to intrusions on16 our property. What I think, however, is, it doesn't17 follow that she can authorize the -- them to conduct a18 generalized search of the premises. It's as if she19 were saying, "You can listen in on" --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "all the phone calls" --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me.23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "in the house."24 JUSTICE SOUTER: It was -- it was the -- it25 was a search only of premises with respect to which32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425she had, supposedly, common rights.  I mean, we takethe case on that assumption.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You do --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  If --          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- Justice Souter.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  If she and her husband, youknow -- if she had a right to be in only two rooms,she couldn't authorize the search of the whole house,right?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- correct.  But, JusticeSouter, I think the thing that is important -- and Iwant to get to your line of questioning aboutwhat the nature of the State's argument is --he had a distinct individual right to privacycore of the home, as opposed to, for example,information privacy.exactlyis thatat the          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right, then he          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- if he --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- begs the question-- it begs the question to say "it's a distinctindividual right to privacy."  It's a little academicto talk about his individual right to privacy when33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005--￼1 he's sharing the home with someone else.2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's3 why I finished off on that. Let me just focus on the4 important part of my statement. And that is, we are5 talking about a search of the home, at the core of the6 Fourth Amendment. This Court's doctrines are quite7 different about situations in which you share8 information with third parties.9 Let me step back and do the case before10 Lopez, and then explain how it was extended to Lopez.11 Cases like White say, "If you give information to12 someone else, you -- they can give it to the police13 without conducting a search of you." This is a very14 different situation. The police are clearly15 conducting a search of a premises that I think,16 Justice Souter, it has to be agreed, he has a17 reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to.18 Now, Justice Souter, it is absolutely right19 that there are instances in which people have20 expectations of privacy, and yet searches occur,21 notwithstanding those. And there is an argument to be22 made here that says, "Look, he has a reasonable23 expectation of privacy, but the police came in for a24 different reason." That would be true, for example,25 if there was a warrant; they would come in,34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 notwithstanding his reasonable expectation. That2 would be true if there were exigent circumstances.3 But the theory of consent is very different.4 Schneckloth, Zap, all of the Court's precedents --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- let me make6 sure I understand where you're going. We agree that7 he had a reason -- everybody agrees, I guess, that he8 has a reasonable expectation. He can -- he can raise9 his Fourth Amendment claim. Your argument is that,10 even though we get past the reasonable expectation,11 there's a second reasonableness question, and that is,12 Is the search, itself, reasonable?13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Good guess.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the focus of15 your argument --16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- right.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: But I do think it's21 important, of course, this Court's precedents have22 often said that the degree of the expectation informs23 the reasonableness of the search. A consent --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- search is reasonable.35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Reasonableness, or course, is a balance --2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, I -- the3 words that keep going around in my mind -- it's her4 house, too, isn't it?5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, she wants the7 policeman in. So, why does he have more of a right to8 keep the policeman out than she has to have the9 policeman in?1011 their -- 12131415161718 makes some -- there are two things.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Everybody makes some20 sacrifices.21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's --22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right --23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- right.24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- let's think --25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And so, he --36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think everybody makesJUSTICE SCALIA:  And vice versa.MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  I think that --JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- that's the point --[Laughter.]MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- is that -- that everybody￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of the need for this,2 because it's the other thing that's on my mind. The3 two words that came into my mind are "spousal abuse."4 All right? I would say maybe there's a pretty good5 need for this. The husband's beating her up. And6 there isn't evidence of that, but she's sitting in the7 kitchen table, and the neighbors hear something odd,8 and they call the police. "We'd better look into it."9 They come to the door. She says, "Um, hmmm, oh, I'd10 like, Officer, for you to just come upstairs to my11 bedroom for a minute." Is there any neighbor, friend,12 or policeman, in those circumstances, who wouldn't go?13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, because14 she's not authorizing a search -- she wants them to15 come in and talk to her, wherever, in the house --16 that might be a different case. The two words --17 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It's the question18 of the rule. I haven't seen anything on your side19 that would advocate a rule that would not prevent the20 many, many, many, I believe -- I am not an expert --21 ambiguous cases of domestic spousal abuse from being22 investigated by the policeman. And maybe you can tell23 me you've looked into it empirically and I'm wrong,24 and that's why I'm bringing it up.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Okay. I have, and I37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 can. Since 1974, when this Court decided Matlock, the2 Federal and State courts, combined, have considered3 this question. And so, there was a finding of4 evidence, and it led to a suppression hearing.5 the best that I can do. Fifteen times, all the6 Federal and State courts, once every two years.7 the case that in that -- in -- last year alone,8 were 200,000 domestic disputes that were reported.9 But that's just the city of Chicago.10 What we're considering here is the situation11 in which there is no real need for the police to --12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but -- no, I'm not13 getting your answer. Are you telling me that it is14 the law in Chicago, for example, that if a policeman15 responds to a call, a call of -- it's ambiguous --16 what it says is, "An anonymous caller said there's an17 odd situation next door. Will you check out 235518 Maple Street?" He goes there. The wife looks a19 little oddly at him, but they're sitting at the table,20 and she says, "Officer, I'd like you to come upstairs21 with me." The husband says no. Are you saying that22 the law is clear in Chicago that the policeman can't23 do it?24 25MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  What I'm --JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Where --38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005That'sIt is there￼1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- saying is --2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is it clear that the3 policeman cannot do it?4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, the -- it5 is an unresolved question of --6 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- this Court. It's --8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what --9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- equally divided --10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I thought it was not11 clear. And, therefore, what I'm asking you for is --12 if your rule --13 14 15 1617 a year in18 many ambiguous cases. So, you relieve me of my19 concern that if you win this case, in those ambiguous20 situations, where the wife wants the policeman in, and21 she's afraid to tell him why, until she gets him up to22 the room -- she wants him in -- and he, now under your23 rule, as far as I can see, could not go in. And I'm24 telling you, quite frankly, that's what bothers me a25 lot.39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is the law --MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- there are 200,000 casesChicago, alone.  I think that there might be￼1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me answer2 this on several different levels. First, there is no3 serious argument that we interfere with investigating4 abuse claims. The conversation can happen. It may5 not happen, arguably, in a place that he has a right6 to privacy, but it can happen outside. It happens7 outside all the time. If there is any suggestion that8 a reasonable officer would believe that there was an9 ongoing crime, there was abuse going on right then,10 then it's11 authorize1213 circumstances. In the case I'm thinking of, I'm14 thinking of what I call "ambiguity," and there are15 many such cases, I believe, of spousal abuse, where16 the wife is intimidated. Now, maybe I'm wrong on my17 facts, but those are the cases I'm worried about.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I am not an19 expert in spousal abuse; and so, I'm not -- which I20 think is a very serious issue. I do know one thing21 about my rule, and that is that, under our rule, and22 under the rule that the Georgia Supreme Court23 articulated, they are allowed to speak with her,24 including speaking to her outside. It's true, there25 may be some sacrifice. And you have identified a40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005clear that exigent circumstances wouldthe --JUSTICE BREYER:  There aren't exigent￼1 sacrifice. And that is, she can't take them into a2 room in which he has a constitutional expectation of3 privacy. I will concede that if he says, "I don't4 want you in the bedroom," that will be a sacrifice.5 But what I am saying is that there is no serious6 argument that they can't have the conversation in a7 place where she feels secure. That's on the porch,8 that's in a police car.9 If she says, "I need you to come up," and10 there's been abuse, then what would have happened in11 this case -- let me explain what happened in this12 case. The officers asked Mr. Randolph first. He said13 no. They found out -- had found out from her that14 there was drug paraphernalia on the premises. What15 they had to do in order to conduct this search -- if16 they wanted to search, rather than having her bring17 the materials out -- is to pick up the phone and get a18 telephonic warrant, which would have taken less than 519 minutes.20 The real reason I bring to your attention21 the 200,000 domestic disturbances is that what you22 should be concerned about, I think, is not the 1523 cases, which is not a serious intrusion on law24 enforcement interests over 30 years, but it's the many25 times in which our family relationships ebb and flow.41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 We are concerned here with the person -- the Fourth2 Amendment is -- it's not the person who has the drugs3 or the abuser. Consent searches involve a situation4 in which the police come to the door, and they say,5 "Can we search?" Because they do as much as they are6 permitted to do. And the person just says, "Sure,"7 perhaps completely ignorant of her rights. There's no8 reason to believe anything is going on. And what the9 State's position is, is that, despite the fact that10 this is the home, and that the core of the11 constitutional right to privacy in the text of the12 Fourth Amendment is that the only thing he can do to13 be secure14 live with15 161718 - 192021 say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy. And22 when you do live with someone else, you compromise23 your individual privacy interest to that extent. We24 know that you compromise it to the extent that if you25 happen not to be there, and that person says, "Sure,42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005in the language of the Constitution is notsomeone else.  Remember, the theory --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, all --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you're --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reflects is the -JUSTICE SCALIA:  Go on.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just going to￼1 come on in and search," that's going to bind you, as2 well. Why is it -- why do you not compromise the3 expectation to the extent of giving the other person4 the right to consent?5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I do6 think you've put your finger on it.7 And I just want to say, Justice Souter, that8 I do think that the other side's argument inevitably9 does revolve around this notion of an expectation of10 privacy.11 And, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the12 expectation is -- and this is what the Court said in13 Minnesota versus Carter -- that, while it's14 technically possible that the people -- Minnesota15 versus Olson, I'm sorry -- the people that we live16 with will admit others over our objection, our17 expectation about what -- about what will happen, our18 reasonable expectation, is different. And I also want19 to take --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Olson was a21 standing case. Olson was not confronting this22 situation. In Olson, the police simply went in23 without a warrant. And the argument was made that24 this person was not the normal inhabitant of the --25 what was he? A houseguest or something of the sort.43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 And the only issue that Olson addressed was his right2 to raise a Fourth Amendment claim. It did not respond3 to the issue that you are raising, which is the4 reasonable extent of search.5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, that's why6 I, sort of, paused and came to you. And that is, I do7 think that the other side's argument -- I want8 two things. One is that it inevitably reducesto say to the9 idea that 10we have a lessened expectation of --JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't --MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- privacy --JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't see that --MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.11121314151617 expectation of privacy you've got to have for Fourth18 Amendment purposes in order to raise a claim is a19 minimal one -- they concede that the -- that this20 individual has an expectation of privacy sufficient to21 raise a Fourth Amendment claim.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- at all.MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well --JUSTICE SOUTER:  They concede -- theonly22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: But --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Their argument is that,24 although he can raise it, the rights, however they may25 be derived on the part of his wife, allowed her to44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 admit the police -- in effect, thwarting his2 expectations. Your argument, as I understand it, is3 that when the police search with that kind of4 permission, over his objection, it's not a reasonable5 search. Isn't that the way to structure the issue?6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I think it7 is. I will only say, in my defense, that their brief8 articulates it in the manner that I was describing it,9 I think, with the Chief Justice. But let me --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: That --11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- let me --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I -- I agree with you.13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. All right.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: There is this talk about15 lessened --16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- expectation, and I -- I18 think, ultimately, that's irrelevant.19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me look at20 it through the other lens. And that is from the21 perspective of a reasonable police officer. I think22 there are two points to make. The first is, I -- the23 common ground between the sides in the case is, you24 look at it from the perspective of the person who25 arrives at the house, and you ask what is reasonable.45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 And if someone arrives at the house, it is a2 different matter entirely if, as in Matlock or in3 Rodriguez, someone says, "Come on in," and they -- you4 believe they have authority over the premises, versus5 you come to the house and someone with authority over6 the premises says, "Come on in," and the other person7 says, "No, stay out."8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now what's your --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not a10 fair reading of Rodriguez. There, it was, "Come on11 in, he's asleep." It was quite clear that if he were12 awake, he was going to say, "Don't come in."13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the14 Government has argued successfully in this Court that15 we don't make any assumptions about whether people16 will consent or not. There are innumerable cases in17 the lower courts --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe we don't, but19 isn't there -- isn't the -- isn't Mr. Dreeben's20 argument fair that no one in his right mind would have21 expected Matlock to agree to this? It is clear that22 Matlock, had he known what was going on -- and he may23 have; I don't know -- would have objected? So that if24 we accept your argument that the presence of the25 person there expressing an objection is what makes the46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 difference, then Matlock and Rodriguez become almost2 silly cases. They are -- they are -- they're cases3 that rest upon an assumption that is clearly contrary4 to fact.5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Souter. And6 that is, the Government has argued, and this Court has7 accepted, again -- and this is a different point; and8 that is, you have to have a clear line for police9 officers that is administrable. And the line that is10 reflected in Matlock and Rodriguez is: If you get11 consent to come into the house from someone who has12 the common authority to do so, that will be13 sufficient, but that doesn't mean that if some -- and14 so, you don't have to go around and -- finding other15 people and asking other people. It's just as if you16 showed up at a house, and you were invited in. You17 wouldn't say, "Well, let me check with everybody else"18 --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but --20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "who lives here."21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- an equally clear line22 would simply be that, if the area to be searched is23 one of common tenancy or occupation or whatnot, the24 only consent that will suffice will be the consent of25 the person against whom you expect to use any evidence47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 found. Easy clear line.2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's true, Justice Souter,3 there are a lot of possible clear lines. What I'm4 describing to you is why the difference between5 Matlock and this case is one in kind, and that is that6 Matlock, I think, reflects an administrable rule, and7 that is, if you do have permission from someone who8 has the authority to admit you, you don't have to go9 ask anybody else.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: But that --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But an equally13 administrable rule here is that, even though the14 person you suspect objects, you can still go in, if a15 person with authority otherwise says you can. Equally16 clear rule, and it has one advantage: It does not17 turn Matlock and Rodriguez into silly cases.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I don't19 think they're silly cases. I think that it is an20 important rule that the police show up and they are21 able to rely -- if they only hear from one person,22 they're able to rely on that person. I don't -- the -23 - I'm not claiming that our rule has great24 administrative advantages over the other side's. What25 I'm saying is that it is not necessary to sacrifice48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the individual's privacy who lives in the house -- as2 you say, has an expectation of privacy. And so, let3 me return 45 I have a6 view on.7 problem.8 situation, frankly, where one person said, "Stay out,"9 and the other said, "Come in." So, I don't know what--JUSTICE BREYER:  An expectation of privacy.lingering question here I'd like to get yourI don't know what the expectation is, is myIf I think of social -- I've never been in a10 I'd do. If I imagine myself in a normal social11 situation, I think probably, if I am the typical12 person, which may or may not be, I --13 [Laughter.]14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I think I'd say, "Well,15 you know, I don't want to have anything to do with16 this." If it's a dinner party, forget it. But if I'm17 in a situation such as the police might be involved18 in, where I think there is some danger, there is19 something wrong in the house, there's something odd20 about it, I don't think the average person would just21 say, "I'm going away." I think the average person22 either would come in, or he'd say, "I'll come in for a23 while. I'm going to call the police," or they're --24 you just wouldn't have that reaction, "I want nothing25 to do with it." That's the reaction, you know --49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that's a bad reaction, when you want nothing to do2 with a dangerous situation. So, I think, in that3 situation, the normal reaction would be, "I'm going4 in," or, "I'm going to get some help," or, "I'm going5 to get a friend," or, "I'm going to call the police."6 So, I don't know you do have expectations of7 that kind, in those situations, though you might with8 a dinner party.9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I think10 that's why it's important that our rule is not that11 the police should go away. We call for a balance12 here, and --13 JUSTICE BREYER: But I want you to address14 the question of how the legal category of "reasonable15 expectation of privacy" fits in with what I just said,16 where I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do17 think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical18 situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly19 including, situations of danger where the police might20 be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you21 will be left alone. I want to know how those facts,22 if they are facts -- and you can say they were not --23 fit within the category called "reasonable expectation24 of privacy."25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, the Court50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 has precedent on this very point, and that is -- and,2 Justice Souter, he is asking about reasonable3 expectations of privacy -- Minnesota versus Olson.4 The Court considered this and said the very reason5 that person had standing and could -- had a Fourth6 Amendment right is because they did have a reasonable7 expectation of privacy in the premises, that, even8 though they had no property rights to keep any -- this9 is the overnight guest -- had no property rights to10 keep anybody out at all, their expectation -- their11 reasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment12 purposes -- is that if somebody wanted to come in, to13 which they objected, that objection would be honored.14 Now, I don't want to lose sight of the fact15 that our position is the balance; and that is, we16 don't tell the police to go away. We say, "Look, if17 she tells you that there's contraband in the house,18 she can bring it out." That's the Coolidge case.19 And I do think, Justice Thomas, that there20 is a difference in kind, not degree, in giving21 something to someone and then having -- versus having22 a uncabined search of a house. The complaint --23 JUSTICE THOMAS: The -- but this was not an24 uncabined search. That's my problem. What you're --25 what you're -- the bottom, you're saying to us, is51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that it's not unreasonable -- an unreasonable searchif she went upstairs and brought the straw down,right?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, because that's not asearch.          JUSTICE THOMAS:  Okay.  But you're saying itis an unreasonable search for her to lead the policeofficer to the straw.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice --          JUSTICE THOMAS:  Which is what she did.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Thomas, it's how itplayed out, because they stopped the search then,because she withdrew her consent.  But what sheauthorized was something very different.  She --          JUSTICE THOMAS:  But she withdrew it afterhe observed the straw.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Justice Thomas, that'sabsolutely correct.  My point, instead, is that whathappened here, in terms of the consent, and what theState's rule of law would authorize, and what Matlockand Rodriguez authorize if they're extended to thispoint, is not, "Take me to the drugs," which is aninteresting proposition, but, instead, "Go ahead andsearch the whole house."  So, our point, JusticeBreyer is, "Look, don't leave.  Get a telephonic52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 warrant. It takes 5 minutes. If you know there's2 something in the house, bring it out. If you have3 anything to -- any reason to believe there's ongoing4 criminality, seal the house."5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, any reason to believe6 --7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Of --8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but --9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you can't enter without11 probable cause.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's a -- with14 exigent circumstances.15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have17 suspicions of a domestic problem that's ongoing. It's18 short of probable cause, but you have reasonable19 suspicion. Does that alter the nonconsenting party's20 interest and elevate the consenting party's interest?21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I don't22 think that it does. Our view of the law is that the23 question is, When the property rights are -- and their24 -- their control over the property, I should say; I25 don't mean to invoke the common law -- when the53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 control over the property is equivalent, then, in that2 tie, if you will, the Fourth Amendment controls. If -3 - there are doctrines designed to protect against4 situations in which you have concerns about ongoing5 criminality and protecting people. But that's --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you talk about7 that tie, your approach applies in the case -- a8 dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms9 off of it, nine people say, "Sure, come on in and10 search," and the one person says, "No." That one11 person exercises a veto over a search of the common12 area?13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the14 straightforward rule that I have argued for today is15 that if you have an equivalent interest in the16 premises -- it is, of course, the State's rule that,17 if nine people object, Matlock says that any one of18 them can let them in, and an individual can override19 the objections of everybody else in the house. What20 I'm saying, I think, just to return to the basics, is,21 I do think --22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- well, what23 is your answer --24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to that case?54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Your case is that, if one out of ten who share the2 common room says to the police, "You may not come in,"3 that controls?4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that has to5 follow from our rule. It's true, we have articulated6 one broad rule that would allow the Fourth Amendment7 to control, but I think if we analogize to the social8 situation -- if you said to yourself, "What do you9 expect will happen if nine people that you live with10 want to let in someone and you're the only one who's11 going to object?" -- I think it would be perfectly12 reasonable to say to -- that individual expects the --13 them to come in.1415 make sure 1617 we got --18 bright line administrable rule, I guess.19 [Laughter.]20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I honestly21 don't think that's true. I think that Illinois versus22 Rodriguez, on this question, which is assessing the23 degree of the authority over the premises, does call24 for a "totality of the circumstances" inquiry.25 I also don't know that I fully answered your55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005Justice Souter, let me return -- I want toI --JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the -- I -- you assumethere goes the -- that -- there goes any￼1 point, that we look at this question from the2 perspective of the officer and the reasonableness of3 the search. And let me just say that, in Matlock and4 in Rodriguez, the Court's analysis was that it's5 reasonable, because the person whose privacy is6 intruded on has assumed some risk. The Court does7 look to the privacy interests of the person who is8 ultimately the defendant. That's a -- an element of9 the reasonableness inquiry. And our point,10 fundamentally, is that it cannot be the case that when11 the framers enacted the Fourth Amendment so that you12 could live with other people and have a private space13 away from the Government, that you, merely by living14 with your family, assume the risk that your privacy15 will be lost. That assumption of the risk --16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, can I just take17 the next step in my hypothetical? The wife and the18 two adult children who live in the home say, "Come on19 in," and the husband says, "No." What happens then?20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: On our broadest rule, the21 husband would control, although it doesn't follow,22 from our -- that, to affirm the judgment, you have to23 say that, because I think you could say that,24 reasonably, the person realizes they would be25 outvoted. But I do think the children is an important56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Reasonably, theperson realizes he would be outvoted?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, it does go tohis presumably objectively reasonable views of whatnature of privacy he has.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  And what --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if he thinks,"Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife.  Ithink she's going to consent and let the police in ifI'm not" -- then his objection shouldn't control?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, when -- Iagree with you objectively.  This Court didn't, forexample, in Matlock and Rodriguez, look at theparticular family dynamics at that time.  It looks tobroader social understandings.          I did want to return to your "children"point.  Remember -- and I think this is a vital point-- and that is, the Courts of Appeals uniformlyconclude, after Matlock and Rodriguez, that childrenare residents, which is the inquiry in Illinois versusRodriguez, and they can give consent to search a home. It necessarily follows that if you extend that rule,Matlock and Rodriguez, to this case, that children,57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 because they have the authority to admit the police --2 minor children, 12, 14, 15 -- can then authorize the3 search, notwithstanding the objection of the parents.4 Now, if everyone agrees, "That can't be right, it's5 the parents' home," that's because we are assessing --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the case that7 says that, that the child's invitation overrides the8 parents' objection?9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, that10 question hasn't been confronted by any court we've11 checked. But what I -- what the Courts of Appeals12 have confronted repeatedly, and uniformly agree -- and13 it's in our brief -- is that children satisfy the14 Matlock and Rodriguez --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So --16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- standard.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- would a mother-in-law.18 [Laughter.]19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't have21 the same -- they don't have the same property interest22 as a spouse does, as a tenant in common or whatever.23 The child doesn't have that interest in the home.24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's25 right, but, of course, that's not the inquiry under58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Matlock and Rodriguez. If we take your point, then we2 are definitely moving beyond Matlock and Rodriguez.3 We're going to have to look to more. And my point is4 that, if we do look to more than simply the fact that5 the officers have found someone, however ignorant, has6 the ability to consent in their own right, if we're7 going to assess the other factors, the rule should8 look -- the Court should look to what the ordinary9 social understandings and --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, your time11 is almost up, but I want to know if you place any12 weight at all on the fact that the husband was the13 target in this case. The target said, "No," and the14 one who wasn't under suspicion said, "Yes." Does that15 make any difference?16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- I do not believe, as17 a matter of doctrine, that it does. I do think,18 however, that it informs this Court's analysis of19 reasonableness, in the sense that the Court, in20 Schneckloth, said, "We are not going to allow consent21 to circumvent the requirements of getting a warrant."22 And it is the case -- we have to inescapably agree, I23 think, that this is simply a way of getting around the24 warrant requirement. They wanted to find out25 something about him. He had a privacy interest in the 59Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 premises. He said, "No." The Constitution says, "You2 have somebody who's cooperating with you. Let them3 tell you what's going on in the house." And Illinois4 versus McArthur says, "Seal off the premises." In5 fact, Illinois versus McArthur is -- the very point of6 the Court in that case was that it's much better to7 seal the premises and get a warrant, which will define8 --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anybody in that10 case who -- since I wrote it, I guess I'm supposed to11 know it in detail, but I don't --12 [Laughter.]13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and I thought, was --14 there was no one -- no consent there.

GOLDSTEIN:  But, inescapably, what'sgoing on, there are -- I think that this is not a casethat follows, necessarily, from Matlock and Rodriguez. And there is a bright line to be drawn, and that is,you are going to have to not live with your family,which is precisely what the Fourth Amendment is about,in order not to assume the risk of the police comingin.  The reasonableness determination is a balancingof law enforcement and privacy interests.  The privacyinterests are very high.  The police can easily get atelephonic warrant or have the materials brought outto them.  It is not necessary to take this case, whenso rarely has it been that the police have needed touse this authority.          If there are no further questions.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Goldstein.          Ms. Smith, you have a minute and a halfremaining.          MS. SMITH:  No rebuttal, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The case issubmitted.          [Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]61Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
