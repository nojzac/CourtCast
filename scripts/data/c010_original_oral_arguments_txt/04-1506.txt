Ahlborn.          Ms. Freno.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI FRENO               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MS. FRENO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The parties agree that Medicaid paid over$215,000 to cover the costs of medical care provided toMs. Ahlborn that resulted from an auto accident thatshe was involved in.  The parties also agree that thePetitioner, the Arkansas Department of Health and HumanServices, may place a lien on some portion of the thirdparty settlement proceeds that are at issue in thiscase.  They disagree, however, as to what extent thatlien may reach into the third party settlement proceedsin this case.          The Respondent, without notifying theDepartment of Health and Human Services, finalized asettlement with the remaining tortfeasor accepting$550,000 as a compromised settlement for a claim thatshe had originally valued at over $3 million.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me?  It's my-- excuse me.  My understanding was that Arkansas hadintervened in the suit.          MS. FRENO:  That is correct, Your Honor.Arkansas did intervene in the lawsuit.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So after the settlement, Itake it Arkansas would -- still would have had theright to -- to pursue its claim in the litigation, oram I wrong about that?          MS. FRENO:  Well, Your Honor, after -- at thepoint that Arkansas learned about the settlement, thecase had already been dismissed out of State court withprejudice, and the Respondent notified the departmentthat if it would not accept -- it would not compromiseits Medicaid claim, that they would be filing adeclaratory judgment action in Federal court to resolvethe anti-lien question.  And that is how we ended up inFederal court.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if Arkansas was a partyto the case, it didn't get notice of the dismissal?          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what I don'tunderstand.          MS. FRENO:  They -- it did not get notice ofthe dismissal.  No, it did not, Your Honor.  We do notknow what happened, but we did not get notice of the41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 dismissal 234 -- with a5 reason I ask is it seems to me that you still have the6 cause of action left. Maybe that would be my nextuntil after the case was dismissed.JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't understand --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How can they do that withparty?  I mean, the -- and the reason -- the7 question.8 Suppose there's a settlement and you don't9 get, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical10 specialists, plus general damages, and you're -- you're11 unsatisfied. Don't you still have the right under12 Arkansas law -- or do you -- to pursue the tortfeasor13 for the balance that's owed to you?14 MS. FRENO: Arguably Arkansas could have15 attempted to get the case reopened in State court, but16 the Petitioner -- I'm sorry -- the Respondent in this17 case selected the Federal forum to resolve the issue.18 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but that's not that issue.19 That is, I think the question is, why is it that this20 statute doesn't simply provide the following route?21 Party A and party B enter into a settlement, and they22 say $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and23 suffering. You, Arkansas, are out $50,000. Well,24 fine. You're in the case anyway. Sue the defendant25 for the remaining $40,000.51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. FRENO:  Well, Your Honor --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the end of it.          MS. FRENO:  I'm not familiar with the termsof the settlement agreement, but I would assume that ifArkansas would have sued the defendant for theremainder, that there would have been anindemnification clause in the settlement agreement,which means that the money would have ended up comingright out of Ms. Ahlborn's pocket in any event.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I have no idea aboutthat.  I'm interested in this nest of statutes, and thequestion I think that I would have is why doesn't thestatute propose the route for a State in your -- inyour position that I just said.  If they have a goodfaith settlement and they think that $10,000 of thisgood faith settlement is attributable to the medicalexpense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can suethe other party.  And if you're in the case, you justproceed with the suit.          MS. FRENO:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE BREYER:  They can't settle your claimout from under you.          MS. FRENO:  That is exactly what happened.They did settle the claim out from under thedepartment.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but the --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we're asking how that3 can be.4 MS. FRENO: We don't -- well, we don't know5 how that can be. We don't know why the -- we do not6 know why the State court dismissed the action.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're asking you as a8 matter of Arkansas law.9 MS. FRENO: As a matter of Arkansas law, a10 claim should not be dismissed until all parties are --11 the rights of all parties are determined.121314 claim for 151617 have a claim against counsel for being incompetent in18 letting a settlement be made without notice to the --19 to you. It seems to me hard to -- hard to understand20 how this could happen.21 MS. FRENO: Well, if -- in fact, there is an22 Arkansas statute that if monies that belong to the23 department are distributed in a -- in a manner that is24 inconsistent, you know, with the interests of the25 department, that it can pursue either the Medicaid71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SOUTER:  Why didn't Arkansas --JUSTICE STEVENS:  I wonder if you have aincompetent counsel representing you.MS. FRENO:  I'm sorry?JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm wondering you -- if you￼1 recipient, her guardian, her attorney, or anyone else2 for that money.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't we just send4 you back to do that?5 MS. FRENO: Because --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, why are we going7 through this -- this proceeding here?8 MS. FRENO: The reason we're going through9 the proceeding here, Your Honor, is because the issue10 of the anti-lien provision was raised. That was not11 raised in12 as a part1314 But at --15 and -- and I don't see why you can't get your money16 simply by going back into the State court. Maybe --17 maybe lapse of time bars you at this point. ButState court.  It was brought in Federal courtof the declaratory judgment action.JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  I -- I realize that.at the end of the day, you want your money,18 presumably you could have avoided all of this by simply19 saying, we didn't agree to the settlement. We're still20 here. We21 money.2223 proceeded24 course, has limited resources, and we learned that the25 --81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOwant our -- the -- the remainder of ourMS.

FRENO:  We never expected to get,frankly, to the Supreme Court of the United States.But we did understand that we would be --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You were thePetitioner.          MS. FRENO:  -- before the Federal district --I'm sorry?          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You were -- you werethe Petitioner.          MS. FRENO:  Yes.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you'refiling a petition, you have to have some expectationthat you might end up here.          MS. FRENO:  Oh, I thought you meant at thetime that the State court case was dismissed.  I'msorry.  I misunderstood the question.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to go back to theFederal statutes and the State statute.          MS. FRENO:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Why isn't this discussionjust suggest what the answer is to the legal questionraised?   The answer is, of course, you cannot get a91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 hold of this money in the hands of the victim. The2 money in the hands of the accident victim is not your3 money. It is not medical expense money. It was4 stipulated that it is not. That doesn't leave you5 without a remedy. The remedy is to go against the6 causer of the accident and get the extra money that you7 think is entitled to you. The statutes say that8 literally, and why not just follow them?9 MS. FRENO: Your Honor, the third party10 liability provisions of Federal Medicaid law is what11 governs this case, and those statutes require that the12 States seek -- seek reimbursement from liable third13 parties for medical costs for the full amount of that14 liability.15 Now, as a -- a condition of Ms. Ahlborn's16 eligibility -- or as a condition of eligibility for17 Medicaid, Ms. Ahlborn had to assign to the State her18 right to payment for medical costs -- her right to19 payment for medical costs. Consequently, when she20 assigned that right to the State, it was synonymous21 with what the State itself had to do, which was seek22 full reimbursement from liable third parties to the23 extent of the third parties' legal liability.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But could she -- after that25 assignment, could she bring a suit in her own right to101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 do that, to recover the medical costs?2 MS. FRENO: Yes, she could, Your Honor, and3 in fact, that is what the majority --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though she's assigned5 the cause of action to the State?6 MS. FRENO: Yes, Your Honor. And that is7 what the majority of the Medicaid recipients in our8 State choose to do. They prefer to pursue the action9 on their own and in the end just reimburse the Medicaid10 program.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it dismissed on12 the basis that they -- they don't have a cause of13 action because they've assigned it?14 MS. FRENO: Well, they -- she is basically --15 a recipient is pursuing the cause of action with the --16 the approval of the State. And also, in the third17 party liability provisions, it's important to recognize18 that they provide -- they include a duty of cooperation19 that the recipient has to cooperate with the State in20 seeking full Medicaid reimbursement. So the third --21 the Federal third party liability provisions basically22 consider the recipient and the State to be a team, a23 team that is out to get full reimbursement.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're -- you're talking25 without reference to the statute, and as I read the111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 statute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments2 made by a third party for health care items or3 services. So she has to turn over from her recovery4 what she got for health care, but we know that her tort5 claim consisted of a lot more. So if the Federal6 statute says she has to turn over what she received7 from the third party for health care services, well,8 she did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair9 allocation. So I don't see how you get from her the --10 a much larger share than what she got for health care.11 MS. FRENO: Your Honor, what the statute12 requires -- this is in the Petitioners' brief on pages13 2 and 3 -- at 42 U.S.C. 1396k(a)(1)(A), which is the14 section that talks about the scope of the assignment,15 she has to assign her rights to payment for medical16 care, not payments that she actually receives for17 medical care.18 And what are her rights to payment for19 medical care? If we would take this out of the20 Medicaid context and put it in a standard tort context,21 someone who's injured by a third party has a right to22 receive all the money that she is out due to the fact23 that she was injured by the third party.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't her response to25 that argument, look, I've -- I've assigned you my121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 rights? There's no question about that. I'm also2 willing to give you whatever the amount is that they3 allocated. If -- if you want the difference, you've4 got the assignment. Go ahead and sue for it.5 MS. FRENO: There is nothing, though, in the6 --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that would be8 consistent with the -- with the statute. Wouldn't it?9 MS. FRENO: The third party liability10 provisions do not require the State to ever seek11 reimbursement through the direct --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, but I -- I'm not13 saying that it -- it does. The State can do nothing if14 it wants to. But the statute that you just quoted15 requires her to assign to the State her right to16 recover for -- for her medical expenses. She says, I17 have done that. In fact, I've done that as a matter of18 law, under Arkansas law. You've got your assignment.19 Number two, I'm giving you the portion of the20 recovery that I got with respect to medical payments.21 You can have it.22 Now, there's a difference between what you23 paid and what I got attributable to medical payments,24 an amount, by the way, which you stipulated was25 correct. So if you want the difference, sue for it.131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Go ahead. It's fine with me. Why isn't that the2 answer?3 MS. FRENO: Ms. -- first of all, with regard4 to the stipulation, Your Honor, the parties have always5 agreed that Medicaid paid over $214,000 --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.7 MS. FRENO: -- for Ms. Ahlborn's damages.8 The State is in no way trying to take anything from the9 third party settlement proceeds that represents -- that10 represents payment for anything other than what is11 necessary to reimburse the State for that amount of12 money.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But14 your argument on this statute.15 MS. FRENO: Yes.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: And17 question. This statute simply18 assign her rights to recover for the medicals. She has19 done that. She has also given you the portion of the20 settlement which she and you agree is attributable to21 the medicals. Why isn't the statute satisfied if she22 simply says, you've got your assignment? If you want23 the difference between what I've given you and your24 out-of-pocket expense, sue. You have the assignment.25 You have the right. Go ahead and sue for it.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOyou're -- you're basinglet me come back to mysays that she will￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. FRENO:  Because she assigned, Your Honor,her right to recover -- or her right for payments fromthird parties, she no longer has the right tocompromise the State's claim.  Ms. -- the Respondentdoes not have --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it seems to me thatthat is an entirely different argument.  The questionis what does the statute require her to do and entitleyou to do.  And I don't see why, under the statute, thestatute is not satisfied if you simply sue for thedifference under -- under your assignment of herrights.          MS. FRENO:  There's -- under the statute, herassignment -- she has a duty of cooperation, first ofall, to cooperate with the State in receiving theserecoveries.  The assignment allows her to bring alawsuit.  It does not require her to bring a lawsuit.Primarily the obligation is on the State to sue --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Doesn't the assignment allowyou to bring a lawsuit?          MS. FRENO:  Yes, the assignment allows --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then why don't you bring it? I mean, the answer to the -- to the statutory point,it seems to me, is you've got your assignment.  Ifyou're not whole yet, sue.151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. FRENO:  But she -- she opted to bring the-- she opted to bring the lawsuit on her own.  And thepoint I was making earlier --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So what?  You can sue too.          MS. FRENO:  We could sue, but the State haslimited resources.  Every penny --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let methis question so far as the rightsthe assignor.  Suppose it's a verylitigant says I want to settle for-- let me ask youof the assignee andweak case and the20 cents on thedollar.  Are you saying that there's some kind of dutyto notify the State and -- and to consult with theState before this is done?          MS. FRENO:  Yes, Your Honor, and that isencompassed within State law.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  Suppose the -- theState says, well, we -- we don't -- we don't agree withyou.  Then -- then what happens?  Then they're atloggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position Isuppose.          MS. FRENO:  In that situation, then the --the case would just have to go forward to litigation.And yes, the State, if it wished to pursue --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would -- would it -- if --suppose in the instance I put they -- the -- the State161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425has -- has an objection, but the settlement is made,nonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar.  Do you stillthink you have the right to receive 100 percent of yourpayment from the proceeds in the case that I put?          MS. FRENO:  Would you repeat that?  I'msorry.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Assume that it's a veryweak case.  They settle for 20 cents on the dollar.  Doyou have the right, as you understand the law, toinsist that you receive 100 percent of your paymentsfrom the gross settlement?          MS. FRENO:  The -- the Medicaid recipient cannever compromise the claim of the State.it.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The answer is yes, I takeMS. FRENO:  Pardon me?          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The answer is yes, I takeit.  In the case I put, the answer is you would thinkthat you're entitled to 100 percent of your payments.So that eats into her general damages.          MS. FRENO:  Well, she -- in that situation,Your Honor, she can -- she can compromise her ownclaim.  She cannot compromise the State's.  If shewants --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you're 171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 -- you're entitled to 100 percent under Arkansas law,2 but -- and I take it, that would be without regard to3 what the Federal law required. The Arkansas law can go4 beyond -- just looking at the assignment provision,5 beyond what the Federal law requires you do as a6 condition of participation in Medicaid. Correct?7 MS. FRENO: No. State law cannot go, Your8 Honor, beyond Federal law, and Federal law allows the9 State to receive full reimbursement to the extent of10 the third party's liability.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we disagree12 with you on that -- in other words, you're saying we13 don't even have to reach the anti-lien provision14 question. If we think the Medicaid condition only goes15 to the extent payments for medical care, then you would16 lose without regard to the anti-lien provision?17 MS. FRENO: I'm sorry. Would you repeat18 that?19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Arkansas law, as you20 understand it --21 MS. FRENO: Yes.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- requires a -- a23 full -- full assignment of any expenses the State -- or24 full recovery of any expenses the State has incurred.25 It's not -- it's a debate whether Medicaid law requires181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that. And what you're saying is if we think the2 Medicaid law does not require it, you would lose3 without regard to any consideration of the anti-lien4 provision?5 MS. FRENO: If Medicaid -- Medicaid law does6 require full reimbursement. But if this Court7 determined that Medicaid law did not require full8 reimbursement from -- to the extent of a third party's9 liability, well, then there would not be an anti-lien10 -- there would not be an anti-lien provision question.11 But Federal law does require the State to seek full12 reimbursement to the extent of the third party's13 liability.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's one of15 the issues, and I'm trying to understand. The16 Respondent's position is that the Arkansas law goes17 beyond what the Medicaid assignment provisions require.18 And I want your position on whether or not, if that's19 right, again without regard to the anti-lien provision,20 that you would lose. It seems to me that you can --21 Arkansas can go beyond what the Medicaid law requires22 for reimbursement, if it wants.23 MS. FRENO: No, that is not true, Your Honor.24 Arkansas law must stay within the scope of the Federal25 law. Arkansas law cannot require a recipient to assign191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425--          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So if we readthe Medicaid statute to require something less thanwhat your position is here, then you lose.          MS. FRENO:  That would be correct.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  That's withoutregard to the anti-lien provision, or is it because ofthe anti-lien provision?          MS. FRENO:  It would be because of the anti-lien provision.  But because she assigned her right to paymentfor medical care, that -- the anti-lien provisiondoesn't operate with regard to that amount of moneythat is recovered from a third party in a -- in a thirdparty settlement.          If there are no further questions, I'd liketo reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.ASCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.MS. FRENO:  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS          MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Excuse me. The problem in this case -- and 201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it's a common one -- is when private parties,2 beneficiaries, sue first and run the well dry.3 There's no question in this case that the4 settlement includes the payment for medical care that5 she was entitled to and the one she assigned to the6 State. That is not in dispute. The question is the7 amount, and the amount is very much in dispute. The --8 the position of the beneficiary is that the amount that9 is medical payment is the amount that we unilaterally10 decide is the share of medical payments in the11 settlement.12 JUSTICE ALITO: What should have happened?13 If, suppose that Ms. Ahlborn had cooperated. Would there14 have to be an agreement among all of the parties as to15 the breakdown of the -- of the settlement?16 MS. MILLETT: No. There are two options.17 One would, of course, be to have an agreement on18 resolution of the medical claim, which would require19 notice and involvement of the State. The State could20 act here.21 The other option is if they're at22 loggerheads, for it to be clear up front amongst all23 the parties that the -- the settlement isn't resolving24 all the third party liability. It -- the -- the25 question of liability for medical care, or at least the211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 State's claim for medical care -- sometimes they have2 their own -- is still open, and there has to be enough3 money left in the well. There were two insurance4 policies here that were paid at their caps.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, why does6 there have to be enough money in the -- take -- take7 the -- the case that we -- we put to your co-counsel.8 Suppose it's a settlement for 20 cents on the dollar.9 Does the -- does the State have an absolute right to10 get reimbursement for 100 percent by invading the11 general damages portion of the settlement?12 MS. MILLETT: No. The State has -- and the13 Medicaid statute is quite clear. They have an14 entitlement to payments for medical care, but --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but in my -- can you16 answer the -- the question? You have the problem.17 They settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Does the State18 in that case have the absolute right to a lien or a19 claim or to a demand for the -- for the proceeds in --20 for the balance of the 80 -- for the 80 percent balance21 of the medical costs?22 MS. MILLETT: No, not straight out, but what23 they -- they have the right to make their own decision24 and compromise their own claim. The beneficiary may25 think it's 20 cents on the dollar. The State may think221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 -- the State can consider two things and two things2 only.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is -- that is as4 between the State and the third party tortfeasor, not5 between the State and -- and the Medicare recipient, I6 should think.7 MS. MILLETT: Not when -- not -- not when the8 settlement, as here, involves the complete claim.9 There's never been a claim by the beneficiaries here10 that there's something left under State law to do or11 something left in the well to go get on the part of the12 State.13 But let -- if I -- I think it's important to14 understand why these suits against the -- or a State15 could decide -- and the anti-lien decision does not16 compel the State to decide otherwise. A State, with17 its discretion under Medicaid, could decide that18 pursuing third parties is not viable. This is not an19 ordinary assignment. This is an assignment with strong20 duties of cooperation required on the part of the21 beneficiary.22 Now, what does the lawsuit look like when the23 State goes, after the settlement, against the third24 party tortfeasor here? The State has no control of25 evidence. It has a pile of bills, none of the relevant231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425evidence.          At the point of this lawsuit, thebeneficiary's interests are adverse to the State's.They're not in a cooperative mode.  They're interestedin --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the State -- the Statecould sue in the first instance.  In fact, if you justread the text of the statute, it seems like the Stateis the one envisioned to be suing for reimbursement ofthe medical expenses.          MS. MILLETT:  Two answers, Justice Ginsburg.          First, a lot of times, the plaintiffs havealready started these lawsuits of these claims longbefore -- when the State has just started getting upthe process of paying the medical bills.  And caraccidents and stuff can get taken care of prettyquickly.          And the -- the second point is, is that theState -- the State may -- needs the help of thebeneficiary to bring this suit.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the State was in thiscase.  The State intervened.  So it was party to thecase.          MS. MILLETT:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And when it -- it found241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 out about the dismissal, why didn't it go right into2 the Arkansas court and say, you forgot about us? We3 were a party to this lawsuit.4 MS. MILLETT: They -- they could have, and5 they'd be -- they'd be fighting the same anti-lien6 issue there that they ended up fighting in Federal7 court.8 But there's one other thing too. Keep in9 mind these third party liability provisions --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would they be fighting11 the same anti-lien provision? They would be --12 wouldn't they be saying we have a claim for all of the13 medical expenses? And no other party -- the injury14 victim didn't have authority from us to compromise our15 claim. It's for us to compromise it.16 MS. MILLETT: That's right. They would say17 that, and -- and the -- and where -- where the parties18 came at loggerheads here was -- their position is19 medical claim is in here. It's in this pot. That's20 not in dispute. It's in here. How much do you get?21 Do you get the amount that we unilaterally designate,22 or can the State have a default rule that says when you23 cut us out and we no longer have a means of litigating24 in cooperation with you to make a reasoned judgment as25 to what the fair medical payment is in this settlement,251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 can we insist upon 100 percent?2 Otherwise, there's two things happening. The3 -- the beneficiary should not be better off for having4 cut the State out of the process, but that's what's5 going to happen.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, if your rule7 is just one that you have to pay the 100 percent if8 there's non-cooperation and a non-notice, that's one9 thing. But the briefs, it seems to me, indicate that10 you have an absolute right to 100 percent. And those11 are two very different propositions.12 MS. MILLETT: Our position is the 100 percent13 claim -- the default -- as a default rule, when the14 State has been cut out and cannot make the reasoned15 judgment that the Medicaid statute charges the State16 with making on these claims, that's a 100 percent rule.17 Quite -- our position, quite18 straightforwardly, is if the State was involved or if19 there was a jury finding of 50/50, you know,20 comparative negligence, then the Medicaid claim gets21 cut in half because it -- the -- the State can consider22 two things, extent of liability and cost --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I know in the case of24 a jury. But our question is what happens if there's a25 settlement.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. MILLETT:  It's -- no.  And -- and ifthere's a settlement in which the State is not involvedbut the medical bill is compromised -- so it's not outthere to be recovered -- the medical bill --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this clarifyingquestion?  If it's 50/50 because of a jury verdict ofcomparative negligence, then you only get half themoney.  If it's 50/50 because of a settlement,believingrecovery,they only have a 50 percent chance ofwhat -- what is your answer?MS. MILLETT:  It depends on whether the Statewas involved in making that judgment.  If the State wascut out of making that judgment, the State can chooseto have a default rule.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the State wasinvolved but disagreed.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You're saying the Stateshould sue here.          MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You're saying here theState should therefore sue, if I understand you.          MS. MILLETT:  No.  The State -- the Stateshould be entitled to a 100 percent rule because -- fortwo reasons.  One, there is no way post hoc -- or no --a State can decide there's no reliable way post hoc to271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 figure out how much of this truly was a payment for2 medical care. I mean, stop and think. Medical --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: But here it's stipulated I4 thought.5 MS. MILLETT: No, no. What was stipulated --6 and I think you have to read the stipulation very7 carefully. There is no stipulation in there that the8 State agrees that $35,000 is an accurate assessment of9 medical liability. The stipulation says --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. It's a compromise.11 Just as my other example of a 50/50 chance of winning12 the lawsuit, you compromise for 50 percent. I don't13 see the difference.14 MS. MILLETT: No. The -- the difference is15 it's who makes the compromise decision. And the16 stipulation is -- from the beneficiary's view, they17 obviously made a compromise decision. They did an18 across-the-board sort of mathematical reduction of this19 claim, and they didn't sort of stop and think about20 what's more easily proven, medical claims or pain and21 suffering. What's more easily documented. They didn't22 do -- it's just a mathematical reduction.23 The State never said that's accurate. The24 State said, if you win, your statutory construction25 argument, which is the amount that you unilaterally281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 designate as medical care, is what we're stuck with.2 And if we try to take more, it violates the anti-lien3 provision. That's --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State --5 suppose the State is involved in the negotiations and6 they disagree. The -- the parties in good faith say,7 we've got to settle this for 20 percent. The State8 said, oh, your case is much better than that. Please9 don't settle. Then what?101112 involved, 1314 what should happen is there can be a -- the -- the15 beneficiary can go ahead and resolve her other claims.16 But everybody has to be on notice. Those third17 parties, in particular, have to be on notice that this18 is not the end of the game. You still -- this does not19 --20 21 2223 trying to24 have in bringing suit later.25 MS. MILLETT: Yes.291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMS. MILLETT:  That --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It has notice.  It'set cetera, et cetera.MS. MILLETT:  Right.  Then at that point,JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. --MS. MILLETT:  -- cover medical payments.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Millett, you've beentell us the difficulties that the State would￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are they?  I see yourwhite light is on.          MS. MILLETT:  Yes.  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'd like to hear what theyare.          MS. MILLETT:  The -- the first one,obviously, -- there's three.          The first one is evidence control.  The Statehas a pile of bills but no evidence about liability.Now, beforehand, if they're involved, their -- theirinterests and the beneficiary's are aligned to maximizerecovery.  After the fact, the State is going to go in,either at a post hoc hearing with the beneficiary ortry to sue some third party, and the beneficiary isgoing to say, oh, I fell asleep at the wheel, I was onmy cell phone, I had preexisting conditions, becauseher incentive is now to reduce your recovery.  This isthe exact opposite of the duty of cooperation thatFederal and State law envisioned for this process.The second --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why is it her incentive toreduce recovery?  She may not be getting anything more,but why does she have incentive to reduce it?          MS. MILLETT:  Because at this -- if -- ifwe're in a post hoc hearing to sort of allocate the301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425settlement, she wants to keep -- have as much of it putinto the pain and suffering and lost wages pile and aslittle in the medical liability pile because shedoesn't go home with that.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I thought she and the--          MS. MILLETT:  And then if -- I'm sorry.There's two -- there's two different post-hearings youcould have.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, yes.          MS. MILLETT:  One would be a fight with her. The other one would be they go in to sue thedefendants.  Now, at this point, she's not necessarilyadverse, but she has no interest to help.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.  Insofar as the suitagainst the defendant is concerned, she's not -- shedoes not have an interest in minimizing.          MS. MILLETT:  But she may if there's anindemnity agreement, which means if they have to pay tous, they will -- I'm sorry.  Can I finish?  That if --if the defendants have to pay more to us, then theywill get to go after her.  And that's the concern.Millett.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms.MS. MILLETT: Thank you. 311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Blair.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. DAVID BLAIR               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. BLAIR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The problem here, of course, is one where thefunds, the proceeds, to resolve a claim are less thanthe damages of all parties, including the medical billsthat have been paid by the State.          Now, the Court is correct that not only underthe Federal statute did the State have the option ofpursuing an independent cause of action, there is aState statute that provides that very thing, our code20-77-301.  And in fact, that statute, in effect,allows a splitting of the common law cause of actionfor personal injury, which otherwise would beprohibited.  But --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what incentive doesshe have to cooperate in that later action?  And isn'tit the fact that she would have a disincentive tocooperate if she's going to have to reimburse theinsurance companies for any additional compensationthat they pay?          MR. BLAIR:  She would not have a disincentiveto cooperate.  She might not have an incentive to321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cooperate because they're bringing their own lawsuit.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it -- but -- but don'tsome of the insurance policies require that if theinsurance company, which has settled the first claim,ends up paying -- paying additional money, that that --that that amount of money would be the -- theresponsibility of the -- of the claimant?          MR. BLAIR:  Correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's a disincentive onher part.  She doesn't want the insurance company tolose any more money.          MR. BLAIR:  That -- that is correct.  Had the--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it seems to me thatthat's a very strange system for the Federal Governmentto set up and to -- to -- I mean, to -- to subsidize --to reward the failure of the -- of the Medicaid benefit-- beneficiary to cooperate.  There's a statutoryresponsibility for her to cooperate, isn't there?          MR. BLAIR:  Correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And she didn't do that herebecause she just went ahead and settled without --without giving the State notice.          MR. BLAIR:  I disagree, Your Honor.  I do notthink that the duty to cooperate necessarily included331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the duty to include the State in the loop in the2 settlement process.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Really.4 MR. BLAIR: That is --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the State is a party6 to the proceeding, and she goes ahead and gets the7 proceeding dismissed without even telling the State,8 and that -- that isn't included in the -- the9 responsibility to cooperate?10 MR. BLAIR: The dismissal, of course,11 followed the settlement. What the complaint is, is12 that they were not consulted about the settlement13 process.14 And it would have been of no benefit had they15 been consulted about the settlement process. The16 defendants were only going to pay a certain amount of17 money. Had the State shown up at the settlement18 hearing if -- or the conference, if there was such a19 thing, no doubt it would have taken the position that20 it takes here, that it's entitled to be paid in full.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I suppose if the22 insurance company heard from the State that the State23 continued to -- would continue to pursue its claim, in24 the absence either of a more generous assignment or a25 more generous settlement, there might not have been a341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 settlement.2 MR. BLAIR: That's correct, Your Honor. Had3 --4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, so why -- why then is5 it unreasonable for the State to take this position,6 the one that the government took? They said, of7 course, we, the governments of State and Federal have8 only the right to attach the portion of that settlement9 that is representative of the medical expenditure. And10 where we're in on the deal, you'll all agree what that11 portion is, or there won't be a settlement and we'll12 proceed to trial. But where we're cut out of the deal13 -- and we shouldn't be because there's a duty to14 cooperate -- we will assume in that instance that it --15 every penny of that medical expense is included in the16 amount that was settled for. And they say, given the17 statutes, that's a reasonable way of enforcing their18 Federal obligation to recover the money.19 Now, whether we agree or disagree with it as20 a matter of policy, what is wrong with their saying as21 a matter of law, we choose to interpret the words this22 way and implement the statute that way and we have23 every right to do it? Why don't they?24 MR. BLAIR: Well, first of all, the -- the25 remedy that the Petitioner here proposes is one that351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Congress has not proposed, for openers. And secondly,2 the Petitioner acknowledges at page 33 of their brief3 that they had no veto power over the settlement. The4 settlement was a matter for --5 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's all consistent,6 of course, with their position. They say Congress7 delegated to us the authority to interpret the words8 this way. It is a reasonable interpretation of the9 words. We don't deny that you can settle for what you10 want. All we're saying is, where we're cut out, that11 that pile of money is deemed by us to include every12 penny of medical expense, and therefore we get it13 because we're not taking money that isn't medical14 expense. We are taking money that does represent15 medical expense according to our deeming rules.16 MR. BLAIR: Correct. According to their17 version, they're taking --18 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's legally wrong19 with that?20 MR. BLAIR: Because they're -- they're taking21 money beyond the claim for medical expense, Your Honor,22 because the claim for medical expense is not measured23 by the amount of the medical expenses in terms of its24 value. It is measured by the various factors that25 affect the value of a claim, of which the payout is 361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 only one of the factors. Had they appeared at the2 settlement proceeding, had we had --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did they have4 notice of the settlement proceeding?5 MR. BLAIR: No, Your Honor. The -- it was6 actually not a proceeding, and I'd have to go outside7 of the record to say this, but if the case was settled,8 as most cases are, by exchange of telephone calls and9 whether --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were -- and they11 were intervened in this lawsuit. Weren't they entitled12 to have notice that there was a settlement and that the13 case was going to be dismissed?14 MR. BLAIR: I do not -- strictly speaking,15 no, they were not entitled to notice because the -- the16 intervention, it was secondary to the plaintiff's claim.17 That is, they did not intervene and assert the18 independent cause of action that the statute gave them.19 They intervened and claimed a lien upon the20 settlement's recovery. So since their lien, whatever21 amount that lien is, was derivative of the plaintiff's22 claim, I do not agree that they had to be notified of23 the -- that the case had been settled and an order of24 dismissal was entered.25 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose, though, that were371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the rule.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The plaintiff had -- had3 no obligation to notify the State? There was some4 mention of a -- of a obligation to cooperate. Is there5 any statutory obligation under -- I don't see it in the6 Medicaid statute, but under Arkansas law for -- for the7 Medicaid recipient to cooperate with the State?8 MR. BLAIR: Yes, there -- there is -- there9 is a general provision in Arkansas law that -- that the10 Medicaid recipients assign their claim to notify the11 State of any potential liable parties, the date of the12 occurrence, the kind of injury they sustained, the13 information that would enable the State to pursue its14 claim should it decide to do so. And in this instance,15 the State decided to do it by asserting a lien upon the16 -- the common law action asserted in the State court.17 Now, if the -- if the State had brought an18 independent action and asserted its -- its right to19 recover, rather than riding in the wake of the20 plaintiffs, then the State would have been in control21 of that claim and been in control of settlements and22 whether it was dismissed or not, but --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: The complaint -- the -- the24 intervention by the State claimed only a lien? Is that25 what the --381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BLAIR:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- document claimed?Intervention --          MR. BLAIR:  The -- actually -- actually therewas never a formal complaint and intervention filed.There was a motion for leave to intervene.  It wasnever followed up on.  Again, I'm getting outside therecord when I say that.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Roughly speaking -- I -- I'm-- there may be a few dollars and cents that -- thataren't accounted for here.  But roughly speaking, is itfair to say that the amount that -- that you and --and, for that matter, the State attribute to themedicals out of the total settlement is the sameproportion that the claim for medicals bore to thetotal original claim?          MR. BLAIR:  It -- it is the same percentagethat the total medicals bore to what we agreed was afair valuation of the claim or what we agreed therewould be evidence to support.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. BLAIR:  In other words, the State --after this dispute broke out, the Respondent and thePetitioner reached an agreement as to the probablevalue of the claim, absent any considerations of391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425liability or financial responsibility.  And, of course,the amount of the medical expenses was a liquidatedsum, and that made it real easy to result in afraction.  And the $35,000 is that fraction times theState's payout.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but the -- the otherthing that you're -- you're dividing that against isnot liquidated.          MR. BLAIR:  Correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And nobody -- I mean, the --where there's room for -- for compromise is certainlyin the pain and suffering part of a settlement, not inthe medicals.  I mean, the medicals are a given in anysettlement I've ever heard of.  There it is, black onwhite.  This is how much was paid.          MR. BLAIR:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the compromise.Unless there's a -- you know, a compromise on whetherthere's liability or not, but -- but whether, if thereis liability, this amount is owing, that's -- that's agiven for the medicals.  Isn't it?          MR. BLAIR:  Your Honor has put his fingerexactly upon the problem in this case, and that is thatthere was a tremendous question of liability.  And as a401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 matter of fact, this was a high nuisance value2 settlement, as lawyers refer to it.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In a case like this,4 then it would be in the interest of someone like your5 client to make a claim not of $3 million but of $66 million. Then if you settle for exactly the same7 amount of money you settled for here, the percentage of8 the medicals -- the amount attributed to medicals would9 be exactly one-half of what it is here.10 MR. BLAIR: The claim was -- the $3 million11 claim was not the amount claimed in the original12 lawsuit, which never got to the point of a claim being13 made. It was for damages in excess of diversity14 limits, the -- for diversity of citizenship limits.15 There was not a $10 million lawsuit or a $20 million16 lawsuit or an $8 million lawsuit. The $3 million17 figure --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in the original State19 lawsuit, did you have to state an addendum?20 MR. BLAIR: No. Only -- the only requirement21 is that there be an allegation that it's in excess of22 diversity -- the diversity amount.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where did -- then -- then24 tell me again25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400where we got the $3 million figure.BLAIR:  By negotiation with the41Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Respondents, Your Honor, by -- by looking at the -- thedamages, the physical damages, the loss of earnings,impairment of earning capacity, all of those things.And -- and however it's phrased, we essentially agreedthat that was a fair value, and if their claim islimited to the medical expense component, they'reentitled to $35,000.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And is -- is that in -- isthat in writing, along with the allocation --          MR. BLAIR:  Only to the extent that it isrepresented by the terms of the stipulation enteredbefore the district court, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I mean, is that partof the stipulation?          MR. BLAIR:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. BLAIR:  The -- the numbers are in thestipulation.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is there a contention thatthe medical was under-valued in the settlement or -- Ithought it was understood that it was the sameproportion of the settlement.  I mean, if youdiscounted everything by 50 percent, medical wasdiscounted by the same percentage as everything else.Is that correct?421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. BLAIR: That's -- that's correct, Your2 Honor.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because there's some -- I4 -- I wasn't clear on whether the State had stipulated5 that this is what you agreed with the other side or6 that this is a fair calculation of the settlement.7 MR. BLAIR: There was no agreement with the8 Respondent and the tortfeasor about allocation9 whatsoever. The idea that we unilaterally came up with10 a number is -- is not correct. It was a lump sum11 amount, and when the State -- the Petitioner and12 Respondents couldn't reach an agreement, ultimately, in13 order to obviate the necessity for putting on evidence14 of damages before the district court, so the court15 would have a factual basis to make this allocation, we16 entered into a stipulation. And that's where we got to17 the number that we got to.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think under Arkansas19 law that the injured party as an assignor has a duty to20 cooperate with the assignee in pursuing the claim?21 MR. BLAIR: Has a duty to cooperate with the22 assignee to the extent that it does not impair the23 assignor's interest, that is --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that duty fulfilled by25 -- by entering settlement negotiations and not even431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 notifying 23 instance,4 negotiations resulted in $550,000 that the Petitioners,5 in all likelihood, would have never received --the assignee?MR. BLAIR:  In -- in this particularI think it was fulfilled because settlement6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but what you're7 saying is that there's no duty to notify the assignee8 if you think you might get a pretty good result for9 yourself. I don't understand that as much of -- much10 of a duty.11 MR. BLAIR: I think the duty to -- to notify12 the assignee would be true insofar as proceeding13 against the third party is concerned. And to the14 extent that the notification to the assignee would15 serve any purpose in maximizing the total recovery,16 there probably is a duty, but notice to the assignee17 here would have been absolutely of no value insofar as18 the common interests against the defendants were19 concerned.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it certainly would21 have avoided about 20 minutes of questions in this22 Court.23 (Laughter.)24 MR. BLAIR: In retrospect, Your Honor, they25 would have been plastered with notices.441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Just given your experience2 -- say, think of the generality of cases like this one3 -- would it be difficult for you, representing the4 victims, if the rule were that these statutes give the5 Government the authority that they want here, as I6 understand it -- the Federal Government -- which is to7 say you have an obligation to notify the State of the8 presence of settlement negotiations. Now, once you've9 done that, you've given them an opportunity to10 participate. If they have that opportunity, thereafter11 they cannot attach more than what are the real medical12 expenses, which could be a matter for argument in a13 settlement like this. But if you don't give them that14 opportunity, they have the right to presume that that15 settlement, which they knew nothing about, contains the16 full amount.17 MR. BLAIR: As a practical matter, yes, it18 would -- it would --19 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? What are the20 practicalities of that? Why would it hurt the lawyers21 representing victims?22 MR. BLAIR: It -- it would be a logistical23 problem, Your Honor, of --24 JUSTICE BREYER: It would just require a25 letter, certified.451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. BLAIR: But -- but the certified letter2 saying that I'm going to stipulate with -- I'm going to3 enter into settlement negotiations with XYZ4 corporation, would not really have served any purpose5 unless they were to be included in every step of the6 way, because these settlement negotiations sometimes7 extend over months and years and -- and some of them8 seem like they go forever. And to have the -- the9 State at the injured plaintiff's side throughout all of10 that step would be a logistical problem.11 And -- and in any event, it -- the plaintiff12 is in control of the litigation. The State has no13 right to say, you go to trial or you don't go to trial.14 We don't agree that you're getting enough. If -- if15 you go -- if you settle at this figure, we're going to16 be cut short.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't -- wouldn't the18 insurance company have to worry about the same problem?19 That is to say, even if it's not your problem by20 reason of our coming out the way you would like us to,21 wouldn't it remain a problem for the insurance company22 so they could not enter into any settlement until they23 knew that the State would go along with -- with the24 division between medicals and -- and other damages?25 That -- that's what I don't understand. Doesn't it461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425become a problem for the insurance company to somehowbring in the State in the process of the settlement?          MR. BLAIR:  The -- the insurance companypotentially would have double liability under Arkansaslaw if -- if the claim is settled and they know thesubrogation claim and --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          MR. BLAIR:  -- and if it's -- but that's thisunnamed defendant's particular problem.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay, but once -- once the-- once the -- the foolish insurance company figuresout that that is what is going to happen, futuresettlements will be very difficult I would gather.          MR. BLAIR:  I -- I cannot comment on that,Your Honor, since that has not been the -- the case --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but it's -- it'srelevant.  And I'm trying to think through thepracticalities of it, which you're more familiar with. Suppose that you win this.  If you win this, then thedefendant's insurance companies know that they'resubject to further liability for the medicals in everycase.  And why won't they sit there and tell you atthis settlement, hey, we're not going to enter intothis unless you get the State involved so they sign offon it too?  We're not going to just compromise some of471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 our liability.2 MR. BLAIR: That -- that may be the result,3 Your Honor. I -- I cannot foresee all of the4 ramifications either if we prevail or don't prevail.5 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it sounds as if6 we're going to get to the same place, that if -- if you7 prevail, probably the insurance companies will want the8 State to be involved or they haven't limited their9 liability, and if you lose, then we would have said10 that you have to get the -- the State involved.11 MR. BLAIR: Right. And -- and perhaps if we12 prevail and the State elects to pursue its own remedy13 on its own, we'll have another round of litigation.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And your argument is if it15 is six in one, half -- half a dozen in the other, we16 should do it your way because that's what the text of17 the statute says.18 MR. BLAIR: We ultimately rely upon the text19 of the statute, Your Honor, irrespective of all of the20 policy or the political arguments that have been made21 to the Court. We believe and have maintained22 throughout that the text of the statute requires --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: With respect to the text of24 the statute and whether the anti-lien provision25 applies, I'd be interested in your view, as a matter of481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     Arkansas law, as to who owned the chose in action first     and, secondly, who owned the proceeds of the settlement     recovery after the assignment had taken place.               MR. BLAIR:  First, I think there's no     question that Heidi Ahlborn owned the chose in action     because under Arkansas law her claim was complete by     the time the glass and the metal stopped falling to the     highway.               Secondly, as to the who owned the proceeds     depends upon the extent to which the State was allowed     to take an assignment.  If the State was allowed to     take an assignment from something other than the claim     for medical expenses, then they owned the proceeds.     Our contention is that the State was only allowed to     take an assignment under the language of the statute     for the claim for medical expenses, and in that case --               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're talking about the     Federal statute --               MR. BLAIR:  Yes.               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- not the State statute.               MR. BLAIR:  The Federal statute --               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The State statute clearly     goes beyond that and says --               MR. BLAIR:  We lose under the State statute.No question.491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the Federalstatute provides you, you think, with a defense to theState law claim.          MR. BLAIR:  That's correct, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why was thereFederal jurisdiction in this case in the first place?          MR. BLAIR:  Because the Federal questioninvolved the preemption issue as to whether the Statestatute had been preempted by the anti-lien statute.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so your view ofjurisdiction depends upon the Federal defense.          MR. BLAIR:  Correct.  That is, the -- thejurisdiction of the district court action we believewas a Federal --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that -- and whichof our cases say that a Federal defense supportsFederal jurisdiction?          MR. BLAIR:  A Federal defense does notsupport the Federal jurisdiction, but the declaratoryjudgment act gives jurisdiction over Federal questions.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Allows you to comeinto court if the claim that would have been broughtagainst you would have been brought in Federal court,and the claim that would have been brought against youwould have been under Arkansas law.501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. BLAIR: The claim that was -- that we2 were bringing was under Federal law in that we were3 claiming the Arkansas statute was invalid by reason of4 a anti-lien statute, and we believed that that5 presented a question of Federal law and therefore6 brought it --78 defense. 9CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sounds like aMR. BLAIR:  -- in district court.Which hadn't been raised, Your Honor, and I'mwing it.  But that's --(Laughter.)JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you still have a1011 having to 121314 declaration that the Arkansas statute was15 unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal16 statute?17 MR. BLAIR: That's correct. That was our --18 our claim before the district court that ultimately19 wound up in the Eighth Circuit.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It still sounds like21 a defense to me, counsel, and I think it may make a22 difference if your argument relies on the anti-lien23 provision as a defense or perhaps relies on the -- the24 assignment provisions in the Medicaid statute. That's25 why I'm just trying to focus on whether it's the511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425assignment provisions that limit what Arkansas can doas a matter of its own law, or if it's the anti-lienprovision as a defense.          MR. BLAIR:  I believe that it is both.  Ithink that the assignment provisions limit thepermissible assignment as a matter of Federal law byreason of the anti-lien statute.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But there's nothing in theassignment provision as such that limits it, is there?          MR. BLAIR:  Other than its language as towhat it's for.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it said -- I'm lookingat 1396k(a)(1)(A), which refers to assign to the Stateany rights to payment for medical care from any thirdparty.          MR. BLAIR:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  There's no limitation inthat.          MR. BLAIR:  Payments -- the right to paymentsfor medical care, which we believe is the language oflimitation in that the State is -- in effect, isseeking an assignment of the entire cause of action notjust that that is related to the right to payment formedical care,that may havewhich is simply a component of the claim5 cents on the dollar value or 100 cents,52Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 depending on what the facts of the case are.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any reason3 that the Federal law would have to act as a limitation4 on the State law? In other words, if we read the --5 the Federal law your way, is there any reason it would6 frustrate the Federal purposes for the State to say,7 well, we want to get all of the medical expenses? We8 don't just want to get the proportionate share of the9 recovery. That -- that's enough for the Feds, but we10 are also out State money and we want that State money.11 They can go further, can't they?12 MR. BLAIR: In the absence of the anti-lien13 statute.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the absence of the15 anti-lien.16 MR. BLAIR: In the absence of the anti-lien17 statute, the State statute would be, in my opinion --18 the State would be allowed to take a greater lien than19 provided by Federal law. But -- and a lien statute is20 there, and we say that that is the stopping point. The21 Federal anti-lien statute gives protection to the22 recipient's property as to which these assignment23 statutes are an implied exception, but the exception24 must be limited by the --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I assume the State --531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the State tries to get around that by saying it never2 -- never became the property of your client, that by3 reason of the assignment provision, all choses in4 action automatically vest in the State, causes of5 action arising out of transactions in which there's a6 claim for Medicaid compensation.7 MR. BLAIR: I -- I --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say they9 can't do that because, at the time the accident occurs,10 you don't even know that there's going to be a claim --11 MR. BLAIR: I say -- excuse me, Your Honor.12 I say that that is a fiction because what it attaches13 to is the cause of action that existed instantly at the14 time of the injury, and so say, no, you don't own that15 because it was assigned to us. Well, we had to have16 something to17 meaningless.18 We19 light is on,20 Respondent's21 have been discussing here are plain and unambiguous and22 that the case should be resolved upon the basis of the23 statutory language. And we -- it is further24 Respondent's position that if the case is resolved on25 the basis of the statutory language, the Eighth Circuit541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOassign, otherwise assignment was-- in -- in summation, as I see the whitewe believe that this case -- and it isposition that these three statutes that we￼1 reached a very correct analysis of the language and the2 results that that takes place.3 There is no ambiguity, and under the first4 step of the Chevron case, we submit to the Court that5 this is a case of statutory construction within the6 terms of the statutes which, read together, are7 unambiguous and plain. They get an assignment for the8 claim for medical care services. The anti-lien statute9 shields the rest.10 Thank you very much.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Blair.12 Ms. Freno, you have 2 minutes remaining.13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI FRENO14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS15 MS. FRENO: Thank you, Your Honor.16 First of all, the default rule, that rule17 being that unless the State is invited into the18 negotiations, that liability -- the extent of the19 liability of the third party can be considered to be20 100 -- the full amount that Medicaid had to pay -- that21 is a very important rule. And it makes sense because22 money that has to be spent -- there was a suggestion of23 post-settlement hearings to determine what portion of24 the money is for -- for medical costs and what is for25 something else. Such hearings would be incredibly551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 expensive, horribly inconvenient. The State would have2 to, you know, burden -- shoulder this burden, and this3 is money that could be going into the Medicaid program.4 Every dollar that's recovered from liable third5 parties is put back into the Medicaid program, and if6 the State has to keep hiring more lawyers and has to7 have administrative hearings or proceeding in judiciary8 proceedings to determine what part of a settlement9 constitutes a payment, then that -- that is just a very10 inefficient use of -- of very limited Federal -- or11 State funds.12 I heard a comment in Mr. Blair's argument13 that Arkansas law -- I think it was --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I really didn't15 understand that argument. Does the State deduct from16 its Medicaid funds the amount that it pays lawyers to17 conduct Medicaid litigation?18 MS. FRENO: No, it does not conduct --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then it doesn't matter20 as far as the Medicaid funds are concerned. It comes21 out of general State revenues. Right?22 MS. FRENO: It comes out of general State23 revenues, but the amount of general State revenues that24 are there are what is available to put back into the25 Medicaid fund.561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Also, Arkansas law does not require anassignment of a cause of action.  Arkansas law is veryclear on that point, and that's set forth in 20-77-301,which is at -- in -- at the cert petition appendix atpage 38.
