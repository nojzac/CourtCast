Michigan.Mr. Rothfeld.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELDON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:The issue in this case is a narrow one, but ithas considerable practical importance for the continuing flow of interstate commerce.In 1991, Congress enacted a statute that was designed to ease the burdens that State registration fees impose on trucks that travel interstate. To help accomplish that purpose, the statute provides that a State's registration fee may not exceed the fee that the State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.The question here before the Court is whether that Federal standard precludes a State from now imposing a fee on a category of trucks when the State waived the fee as to that category of trucks and therefore did not actually collect or charge it as of the controlling date.QUESTION: May I ask, did it waive the fee for3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 all carriers or just the carriers involved in this case?2 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it waived the fee for all3 carriers in the category that are involved in this case.4 The State had in place a reciprocity policy.5 QUESTION: But did it waive the fee for all6 carriers in the State?7 MR. ROTHFELD: I do not believe. There is8 actually nothing in the record, Justice Stevens, that9 indicates how many States paid fees -- how many trucks10 paid fees and how many did not. It's my -- our11 understanding that there were trucks that were not12 benefitting from the reciprocity policy and therefore they13 would have paid fees. So I think -- I think that the14 answer, although not reflected in the record, is that some15 trucks paid fees and some did not.16 QUESTION: Thank you.17 MR. ROTHFELD: As I say, the question is whether18 if there is a fee that is waived as to a category of￼19 trucks in20 to remain2122 trucks. Why do you add that qualification? Why shouldn't23 it be true, if you're right, that if a truck -- if a fee24 was waived as to any truck, it should remain in place?1991, whether or not that waiver must continue in place currently because of the -- QUESTION: You -- you say as to a category of25 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we think that the inquiry4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 that's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a2 particular type treated. And for example, imagine if a3 State had in place a sliding scale of fees as to different4 types of trucks at $10 for red trucks, $5 for white5 trucks, and nothing for blue trucks. The statute refers6 to in -- in terms -- it says that the State's fee must7 equal the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that the State8 collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Well,9 what in that -- in that circumstance, what is the fee that10 the State charged when there are these different11 categories of trucks?12 We think it has to be understood to mean the fee13 that the State charged to trucks of that type, and so, as14 I say, in 1991 in Michigan trucks of a particular type,15 trucks that were base-plated in the State of Illinois,16 were not subject to fees. We, therefore, think that under17 the plain language of the statute, the same policy has to18 apply to trucks in that category now.19 QUESTION: Now, was there some change as of 199220 in connection with the fee applicable here?￼2122 announced 2324 us--25MR. ROTHFELD: There was a change that was for the 1992 registration.QUESTION: Yes, and I guess that isn't beforeMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that --5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: -- in this case.MR. ROTHFELD: To elaborate on -- on Justice O'Connor's question, in 1991, the 1991 registration year, there is no question, and it is undisputed, that for the entitlement to operate in the State in 1991, on November 15th, 1991, the date identified as -- as crucial in the statute, trucks that were base-plated in States that had reciprocity understandings with -- with Illinois did not have to pay fees. And therefore, Yellow Transportation,the petitioner here, whose trucks were base-plated in Illinois did not pay fees.It is true, Justice O'Connor, that in --the end of 1991, prior to November 15th, the State announced a change for the 1992 registration year, Yellow, being a diligent taxpayer, actually paid for 1992 prior to November 15th.QUESTION: What does the term base-plated mean?MR. ROTHFELD: Base-plated means that plates, license plates, were issued by that State. So the State -- the title for the vehicles were in those States. Those --QUESTION: When you say base-plated in Illinois, then that means the title was issued in Illinois --MR. ROTHFELD: The title --QUESTION: -- and it had Illinois license plates6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005in -- towards and￼1 on its truck?2 MR. ROTHFELD: Either Illinois license plates or3 plates that were issued through Illinois. There -- this4 goes beyond any issue that's presented here, but there is5 a understanding between the States, the International6 Registration Plan, and there are international7 registration plates that can be provided by -- by any8 State, but it's provided through a single State. And so9 the license plates here for Yellow trucks, it is sort of10 undisputed, were provided by Illinois. So there is no11 question that within the understanding of -- of the12 Michigan scheme in 1991, the Yellow trucks were based in13 Illinois and therefore benefitted from the reciprocity14 policy in place in -- in Michigan.15 QUESTION: Your -- your test that you propose is16 that it's the type of truck. It -- I take it there's17 nothing in -- in the statute or in regulatory18 pronouncements that talk about types of trucks￼19 the number of axles or something. But type of20 seems to me, can be applied in the generic way21 Michigan argues. It's a type of truck because22 within the exemption or without the exemption.23 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me be clear24 what I mean by that, Justice Kennedy. I don't25 of truck in terms of the number of axles or --7unless it's truck, it thatit wasAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005what I -- mean type or the1 weight of the truck. I -- I mean the category -- the rule2 that the State applied in 1991 -- the State had in place a3 system of rules that applied, different -- as we know,4 different fees to different types of trucks. Let me give5 you an example.6 Imagine that the State had a scheme in place in7 which it charged $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks,8 nothing for blue trucks, as I suggested before. What is9 the -- what is the fee that the State applied? You have10 to say the fee the State applied to who and look at the11 rule that the State would have applied in 1991. And that12 means identifying the type of truck in the sense of how13 would the14 place, we15 the time.16rule categorize it. And Congress has frozen in believe, the rules that governed fee levels atIf that were not the approach one took and there 17 were these different --￼18 QUESTION: May I ask, under your hypothetical,19 would that rule have prevented the company from repainting20 its trucks, paint the blue trucks white or the white21 trucks red, to get in a different category, which is what22 happened here? They moved from one place of registration23 -- one rule where the trucks were licensed to a place of24 the home office or something like that. So could they25 have later repainted their trucks? Or in this case, could8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 they 2 years later have moved -- changed the -- the rule2 on -- on which -- whether it's a place of licensing or the3 home office?4 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if the question,5 Justice Stevens, is whether the -- the fee payer could6 avoid the fee by somehow modifying its trucks --7 QUESTION: No, no, no. Whether the State could8 changeits--its--asitdidhere. Itdiditinone9 year. Could it have done the same thing, say, 3 years10 later?11 MR. ROTHFELD: Our -- our understanding, Your12 Honor, is that that -- the State could not do that. We13 think that Congress has frozen in place expressly by the14 terms of the statute --15 QUESTION: Locked in permanently to 1991. So16 even if -- let's say, the reciprocity agreement persists17 in 1991, but Michigan wants to change it in 1993 and '94.18 It cannot. It's locked in forever to a reciprocity19 agreement that it made with its sister State only for the20 year 1991. Is that your reading?21 MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, and22 think that applies.23 First, the statute went24 although it was enacted in 1991.25 years, the State could have done whatever -- whatever it9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼let me explain how weinto effect in 1994, So in the intervening1 wished.2 We think that Congress has frozen the fee levels3 in place. Now, whether those fee levels were established4 by reciprocity rule or by unilateral State law or by5 administrative fiat, it wouldn't matter. The State had in6 place in 1991 a policy that said trucks of a certain7 character, trucks in this instance license plated in a --8 in Illinois, were not subject to fees. Fees were not9 demanded from those trucks. They weren't collected. They10 weren't charged. Those trucks did not have to pay a fee11 to entitle them to operate on the State's roads as of the12 relevant period. And that being the case, we think13 Congress, which said the State's fee must equal the fee,14 not to exceed $10 per vehicle --15 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Rothfeld, the problem I16 have with -- with your -- your argument is how does one go17 about identifying the category? Is the category Michigan18 trucks, or is the category trucks subject to a reciprocity19 agreement so that if a reciprocity agreement that used to20 exist with Michigan were canceled, or if -- if a -- for21 that matter, a reciprocity agreement that did -- that used22 to not exist with New York were adopted, you come into the23 category or go out of the category, depending upon whether24 you have a reciprocity agreement? What category are --25 are you urging, and why do you pick that category instead10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of -- instead of another one?2 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we are picking the category3 that we think is -- was selected by Congress because4 Congress said the fee in place in 1991 is frozen. And so5 if that --6 QUESTION: For -- for the particular truck, or7 for the particular State as to which there is a8 reciprocity agreement, or with respect to any State as to9 which there is a reciprocity agreement? It's hard to10 figure out which category they -- they were talking about.11 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it's not12 complex in practice. I think that what Congress was13 asking the State to do is look at how it would have14 treated a truck of this type in 1991.15 QUESTION: That's -- that's the key word,16 this type.17 MR. ROTHFELD: Well --18 QUESTION: But what type?19 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, of whatever --20 QUESTION: Owned by this company?21 MR. ROTHFELD: No, no.22 QUESTION: Or from this State, or subject23 from a State that has -- that currently has a reciprocity24 agreement?25 MR. ROTHFELD: I think one would consider the11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005of￼-- or1 rule that was in place in the State just as it did in 19912 and say here's a truck, this truck is base-plated in3 Illinois. That is a characteristic this truck has, which4 is relevant under our rule, because our rule says under5 our existing reciprocity policy, we will not impose a fee6 on a truck that has its license plate issued by Illinois.7 Therefore, this truck is not subject to a fee.8 If such a truck comes along in 1995, after the9 statute goes into effect -- and I should say the statute10 here is the refreshing acronym, ISTEA, the Intermodal11 Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. When the ISTEA12 statute went into effect, this same -- same truck goes13 into the State of Michigan. It has characteristics which14 waive the fee to -- as to it, had this truck been there in15 1991, those same characteristics make the State waive the16 fee as to it now, because Congress has -- has used the￼17 term the State may not charge fees that it was not18 charging in 1991. Again, the precise language is the19 State's fee must equal the fee that the State collected or20 charged.212223 a vehicle2425 in Illinois, that is the characteristic that is madeQUESTION: Well, Mr. --QUESTION: What about new vehicles? What about purchased, say, in 1995 base-plated in Illinois? MR. ROTHFELD: If such a vehicle is base-plated12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 relevant by the State's rule in place in 1991.2 QUESTION: So it's not only vehicles that3 existed in 1991, it's any vehicle thereafter acquired.4 So one -- one element of this is that Michigan5 could not, on your reading, go over to the principal place6 of business, which in this case is -- I take it, is Kansas7 with no -- no reciprocity with Michigan -- could not8 change that. Everything is frozen forever under ISTEA.9 Is that your view?10 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is our view, and we11 think --12 QUESTION: Well that's one of your views.13 And may -- may I ask you about the -- the answer14 you didn't give to Justice Scalia? Let's assume the15 statute isn't as clear as -- as you are arguing that it16 is. Isn't this the point at which you say, if it's not17 that clear, Chevron controls the answer?18 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely19 correct, Justice Souter. And if -- it is our view that20 the -- that the statutory language is -- is unambiguous,21 but if we are wrong about that and if there is any22 opportunity to find any sort of -- any wiggle room for the23 State in the statute, there is no doubt that the statute24 does not unambiguously require that reciprocity --25 requires States to -- to change their reciprocity rules13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 because the State -- the -- the statute refers, as I say,2 only to the fee that was charged. It certainly doesn't3 say that States may change rules, particular types of4 rules. And that being the case, Chevron deference is5 mandatory.6 Here, in fact, agency deference should be at its7 height. The agency here was expressly delegated by8 Congress the responsibility for promulgating9 interpretations of the ISTEA legislation. It conducted10 notice and comment rulemaking. It received dozens of11 comments from all interested parties, including the State12 of Michigan. It issued regulations. It issued formal13 interpretations of the statute. It published a closely14 reasoned explanation for its conclusion. And in those15 circumstances, I think every member of the Court has16 recognized that deference under Chevron principles is at17 its height, and because I think it -- it simply cannot be18 said that the statutory language is clearly inconsistent19 with the approach taken by the agency, the agency's20 approach must be dispositive.21 And here, what the agency found, unambiguously22 and expressly, dealing precisely with the question at23 issue before the Court now, is that if States had24 reciprocity policies in place in 1991, they may not amend,25 change, rescind, modify those policies in such a way --14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, but did they change their2 reciprocity policy? They just changed the way of3 identifying the State that's relevant for determining4 whether a particular truck has to pay or not.5 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that is, in6 our view, a change in the reciprocity policy. The7 reciprocity policy is determined by what -- by certain8 factors. The State -- it could be a principal place of9 business. It could be a different rule, place of license10 plating.11 QUESTION: Where in the regulations does it say12 that the State may not do what it did here?13 MR. ROTHFELD: The agency issued their14 interpretations of its regulations, which were published15 actually at two points. There -- there was a rulemaking16 proceeding, and along with rulemaking proceeding, it17 issued, as I said, formal interpretations of the statute18 and its rules. There it indicated expressly that in its19 view reciprocity agreements must be frozen and cannot be20 modified.21 A number of States indicated that they wanted to22 change their reciprocity rules, and the commission then23 held a second administrative proceeding --24 QUESTION: Well, but did they change their25 reciprocity -- did Michigan change its reciprocity15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 agreement with either Illinois or Arkansas in this case?2 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there is actually some3 question as to whether there were formal reciprocity4 agreements in place. There is no question Michigan had a5 policy of providing fee waivers to trucks that were based6 in States that in Michigan view provided equivalent7 waivers to trucks that were based in Michigan. Applying8 that policy in 1991, Michigan was of the view that9 Illinois provided such a waiver for Michigan trucks, and10 therefore, Michigan, under its policy announced by its11 public service commission, provided equivalent waiver for12 trucks that were based in Illinois. That was13 unquestionably the rule that was in place in Michigan at14 the relevant time, and because of that, we think, that was15 the fee that was collected or charged.16 To identify the fee that was collected or17 charged or can now be collected or charged from a18 particular truck that comes from the State, one has to19 look at the rule that was in place then and say, what was20 the fee that would have been applied then to this truck?21 Under that approach, Michigan cannot now change its -- its22 way of implementing reciprocity policies and therefore23 charge trucks that would not have been charged at that24 time.2516Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Rothfeld.Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICKON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Congress assigned responsibility for implementing the single State registration system to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The ICC determined that when States apply the statutory fee cap, they must consider the reciprocal fee reductions and reciprocal fee waivers that were in place as of November 15th, 1991. That interpretation serves the central purpose of the fee cap provision, which was to grandfather the fees that were in place as of 1991, but only those fees.The Michigan Supreme Court's generic fee rule, on the other hand, would convert Congress's grandfather provision into a provision that would allow new fees.The ICC's interpretation ensures that the capped registration fee is equal to the fee that the State actually collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Congress did not set the cap at the amount that the States could have charged. If Congress had wanted to do that,17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the obvious thing to have done would have been to set the2 cap at $10, which is the amount that the ICC allowed all3 carriers to charge as of November 15th, 1991.4 QUESTION: Well, isn't there at least an5 argument that Congress could have had that in mind by the6 distinction between charged and collected? I mean, if7 there is presumably a difference between them, then the --8 then the reference to charge would be to a fee that was9 not collected, which would get you to the point which you10 said Congress could have but did not provide for by the --11 by the flat $10.12 So, I mean, I -- I'm not -- I guess what I'm13 saying is, unless I'm missing something, I don't think14 your statutory argument compels the conclusion, but your15 Chevron argument is -- is -- perhaps takes care of your16 position.17 MR. SCHLICK: Certainly the Chevron argument is18 -- is essential to this case. We think that the most19 natural reading of charge or -- of collected or charged,20 though, is charged, demanded, collected, received.21 QUESTION: Even though that was not the22 commission's first view. The commission's first view of23 this case is that the States would not be bound by the24 reciprocity agreements and could charge -- whatever they25 charged anyone, they could charge everyone.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. SCHLICK: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.2 The ICC did, during the rulemaking proceeding, change its3 interpretation. As the D.C. Circuit said in NARUC v. ICC,4 that's what comment periods are for. And the -- the5 commission ultimately relied not only on the plain6 language of the statute, but also on the purposes7 underlying the statute.8 The conference report on ISTEA makes clear that9 there were two purposes in -- in Congress's mind when it10 drafted the statute. One was ensuring that -- ensuring11 benefit to carriers, ensuring that the overall costs of12 the -- of the State registration requirements were13 minimized. The second was preserving existing State14 revenues.15 Michigan's approach, on the other hand, would16 allow dramatic increases in the fee amounts, in this case17 an increase from 0 to $10 per truck, that would overwhelm18 the administrative savings that Congress intended to19 ensure through the single State approach.20 That -- that also would be a very odd policy to21 allow those increases since Congress would, in fact, have22 been authorizing increases that the States themselves23 chose not to implement as of 1991.24 QUESTION: Let me just be sure you agree with25 your colleague. You take the position that they could not19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 have changed the -- the State to which they give2 reciprocity by changing from licensing State to State of3 principal place of business, even if they had done it 2 or4 3 years later.5 MR. SCHLICK: As a general matter, that's6 correct, but let me explain, Justice Stevens, the7 particular problem presented here, which has not been8 addressed by the ICC or the Department of Transportation9 and that we think is preserved on -- on remand.10 As of November 15th, 1991, Michigan arguably had11 two different fee systems in place. The first was the fee12 system for 1991. If Yellow Transportation had come to the13 State of Michigan and said, we'd like to add an additional14 truck to -- to our registration for this year, effective15 immediately, Michigan would have -- it would have charged16 and Yellow would have paid under the old reciprocity17 arrangement, under which the fact that the truck was base-18 plated, had a license plate for Illinois would have been19 dispositive.20 However, simultaneously, Michigan -- Michigan21 was -- was demanding and Yellow paid fees under the 199222 reciprocity approach where the fact that the -- the truck23 had a license plate from Illinois would not be relevant24 and the fact that Yellow was headquartered in Kansas would25 be relevant. The ICC did not determine in its American20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Trucking Associations proceeding, which -- which is the2 relevant one on this question, whether the -- whether that3 sort of -- of conflict would be resolved in favor of the4 old rule or the new rule. And that's the question that we5 think should remain open on remand. As a matter of fact,6 right now the --7 QUESTION: I -- I don't understand. I thought8 -- I thought '91 is the -- is the -- is the base period9 that -- that's consulted. Why -- why would you use the10 new rule?11 MR. SCHLICK: The new rule would -- would be12 implemented as -- as a result of this unusual situation,13 unique in our -- in our experience, where there were two14 -- where there two fee systems in place at the same time.15 QUESTION: There was only one in '91. The16 second one came in after '91. If you allow a new fee17 system to -- to change things, you should -- you should18 allow a new reciprocity agreement to change things. I --19 I just don't see why this is a problem.20 MR. SCHLICK: Well, the unique feature here is21 that both were in place and operational as of November22 15th, 1991. And the -- that -- there's also a question of23 whether the move to the new fee system --24 QUESTION: They -- they were both operating in25 '91?21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

As of November 15th, 1991, both were in place.QUESTION: Okay. I -- I --MR. SCHLICK: And operational. Yellow might -- QUESTION: I thought the change occurred inJanuary 1, 1992, but that's okay.MR. SCHLICK: To answer your question, JusticeScalia, the -- the change -- the new system became effective for the 1992 registration year commencing January 1st, 1992, but the charges were assessed in the fall of 1991.QUESTION: So if Yellow Freight hadn't paid early, would this argument be off the board? In other words, this -- this fee was paid. The 1992 paid -- fee was paid before November 15th, '91. Suppose Yellow Freight had waited till after January 1.MR. SCHLICK: The significance of that, Justice Ginsburg, would be something for the Department of Transportation in a pending proceeding that's -- that is open now to consider. That -- that's -- that question has not been answered, the significance of -- of the date of payment.QUESTION: But you're suggesting there's a possibility that somebody would be penalized for early payment, for prompt payment.22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. SCHLICK: No. I think there would be much2 more to it than that. And again, this is -- this is a --3 a unique situation. There have not been problems with4 implementing this system, and the Department of5 Transportation has before it a request for declaratory6 ruling filed by Michigan, that was mooted by the Michigan7 Supreme Court's decision which adopted this generic view8 rule that moots out all these questions. And that9 proceeding could be reopened if this Court were to remand10 to the Michigan Supreme Court.11 But the -- the specific significance of the date12 on which Yellow made payment has not been addressed by the13 ICC or by the Department of Transportation.14 The -- the fee system here -- the actual fee15 rule of the ICC has been in place for almost 9 years now.16 There have not been serious problems of administration.17 It's a mechanical process where States simply fill out the18 -- carriers fill out a chart which has the applicable19 State, the number of trucks in the State. It's a matter20 of multiplication and then adding some -- the fee for --21 for each State.22 As I was explaining, the Michigan situation is23 unique and should be left to be resolved by the Michigan24 courts and by the Department of Transportation.25 The ICC --23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Do you say the same thing for the argument that there in fact was no reciprocity in place with Illinois in 1991?MR. SCHLICK: We do, Justice Ginsburg. That's a -- a subpart of -- of this State-specific question. The facts surrounding that have -- have really not been developed before the Michigan courts or even before the Department of Transportation at this point.The ICC's interpretation of the fee cap is a reasonable implementation of Congress's provision. It's consistent with the language of the statute and its purposes and we submit that it should be upheld. The decision of the Michigan Supreme Court should be reversed, and the case should be remanded.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick. Mr. Casey, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Before I begin my principal argument, I would like to spend just a moment on this -- this point of the changeover in Michigan from base-plating to principal place of business. We believe it is not present in the -- in this case at this point.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 This case was litigated on that point throughout2 the Michigan courts up until the Michigan Supreme Court3 decision.4 Michigan had in place a system called base-5 plating where we imposed fees based on the State in which6 the vehicle was licensed. In early 1991, the system7 changed from that base-plating system to a system that all8 the other States used based on the principal place of9 business of the truck carrier.10 QUESTION: That was what determined reciprocity.11 MR. CASEY: That's what determined reciprocity.12 That's correct.13 And Yellow Freight Company, at that time Yellow14 Transportation -- their trucks were licensed in Illinois,15 a State with which Michigan has reciprocity, but its16 principal place of business of the parent company is17 Kansas, a State with which Michigan does not have18 reciprocity. And so when Michigan made this change during19 1991, we then switched over and imposed fees for Yellow20 Freight for the registration year of 1992. But those21 fees, as normal industry and State practice, were sent out22 in September of 1991 for the next registration year. And23 Yellow Freight paid them in October of 1991. Again,24 that's typical industry practice. They're assessed and25 paid in advance of the registration year.25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The statute took effect here in December of2 1991. The statutory language that we're dealing with3 talks about a fee that such State collected or charged as4 of November 15th, 1991. Our argument on the -- the way it5 was litigated through the State courts is that Michigan6 charged Yellow Freight before November 15th, 1991 and we7 collected from Yellow Freight prior to 19 -- prior to8 November 15th, 1991.9 QUESTION: Albeit on a system that didn't go10 into effect until --11 MR. CASEY: For the registration year 1992, we12 charged and collected. Yellow Freight disputed that.13 That's the way it was litigated up to the Michigan Supreme14 Court. It didn't involve this question of whether15 reciprocity was relevant or irrelevant.16 The Michigan -- pardon me. The Michigan Supreme17 Court decided it on a -- a different basis than the other18 State court opinions had. And that raised the question19 which this Court granted certiorari.20 In its briefs, Yellow Transportation has implied21 that we've somehow waived that issue. We have not. We22 did not brief it in this Court because this Court limited23 the grant of certiorari to the issue that the supreme24 court did decide. So we -- we believe that the case25 should be affirmed on the basis that the Supreme Court of26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Michigan decided it. If it is not affirmed, however, we2 agree with the United States that the case should be3 remanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration4 of this other issue which is still viable.5 So turning now to our principal argument in6 defense of the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, the7 statute required the ICC to implement a fee system, to8 adopt a fee for the States, a fee system for a fee not to9 exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or10 charged as of November 15th, 1991.11 Beginning with the statutory language, under12 Chevron, if the intent of Congress is clear, that's the13 end of the matter.14 The precise question that needs to be addressed15 here is what did Congress intend. How do you determine16 the fee? We believe that Congress's intent is clear.17 Under the language of this statute --18 QUESTION: Well, if we think it isn't altogether19 clear and in fact could be read the other way, don't we20 have to consider Chevron deference? Because that's how21 the agency has interpreted it.22 MR. CASEY: If it -- yes, if -- if the statute23 is not clear, then you proceed to the second step of24 Chevron, which is whether the agency's interpretation is a25 permissible one. We believe we don't need to get to the27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425second step of Chevron because the text of the statute is unambiguous.QUESTION: But if you're wrong about the text being unambiguous -- and you do have an uphill argument there because didn't the two lower courts in Michigan reason the other way? Didn't they reject the argument that the Michigan Supreme Court embraced?MR. CASEY: The -- I agree the second step of Chevron is always an uphill argument, to overcome an agency interpretation. It's -- but on -- on the facts of this case, on the text of this statute, we believe that the agency interpretation is impermissible. What the -- what the agency did here was not just interpret the statute; they have, in fact, rewritten it. They have imposed conditions in the statute which are simply not there.QUESTION: But didn't the lower courts in Michigan say that was a proper reading, that the ICC's reading --MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: -- was a proper --MR. CASEY: Yes, they did.QUESTION: Which makes it harder for you toargue that there is a plain meaning the other way. MR. CASEY: Yes, it does make it harder. I28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 agree. But it -- it is still a burden that we believe we2 can overcome because we believe that, as this Court did in3 the Whitman v. ATA, it is possible to look at a statute,4 say a statute is ambiguous, and still say that an agency5 interpretation is unreasonable. We believe what the6 agency has done here is unreasonable.7 What the agency has done here is add language to8 the statute. They have imposed the requirement in the9 statute that you look at reciprocity agreements. There is10 nothing in the statute about looking at reciprocity11 agreements. There's nothing in the statute about looking12 at particular carriers or how particular carriers are13 treated. All this statute -- this subsection of the14 statute requires and permits is to look at what the State15 collected or charged as of 1991, November 15th.16 QUESTION: Is there anything in the record that17 indicates what percentage of revenue a State like Michigan18 gets on the basis of these reciprocity agreements or how19 much -- how much of its revenue from this kind of tax is20 not affected by reciprocity agreements?21 MR. CASEY: The record in this case is very22 scant. It was decided on summary disposition right after23 filing of the complaint. I do know that in the year 2000,24 which is 9 years after the enactment of the statute, total25 Michigan revenue from registration fees was $2.7 million.29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425There are 38 States participating in the single State registration system. We have reciprocity agreements with 21 of those States.QUESTION: Thank you.MR. CASEY: But I don't know how those individually break down. Michigan registers approximately 5,000 trucking carriers each year. About half of them are from Canada. But I don't know. That's intra- and interstate carriers. The fees for intrastate carriers are different. They're $100 instead of $10. But the record is very scant in this case because of the way it developed.QUESTION: Would you tell me again why you think the statute is -- is clear and unambiguous in your favor?MR. CASEY: There --QUESTION: I see -- I see the sense of a generic approach because of the trucks being painted a different color or reincorporation and so forth.MR. CASEY: There -- there --QUESTION: But I'm not sure that I can find that under the clear language of the statute. There's a common sense aspect to it.MR. CASEY: There are very few words which are at issue here. The fee that such State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. We believe that means30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 you look only to what the State collected or charged under2 its fee system. That is, what -- if -- if a State3 collected or charged its fee -- it's $10 in Michigan --4 from any carrier as of November 15th, that ends the5 matter.6 QUESTION: So you're reading in -- you're7 reading in from any carrier. And -- and, yes, that's8 reasonable to read that in, I suppose. But it's also9 reasonable to read in from a carrier of -- of this sort.10 Or you could read in from this particular truck. You11 could read in a lot of -- you have to read in something,12 it seems to me.13 MR. CASEY: Well, if -- under our14 interpretation, under -- under the plain text, we submit15 you don't have to read in anything. The -- the words,16 collected or charged, are in the disjunctive. They --17 they're verbs. They require something. Charged means18 sent out a bill or an invoice. Collected means we19 received something.20 QUESTION: Let me ask you this. Did -- does21 Michigan -- did Michigan at the relevant time have a￼22 scheme in23 et cetera2425 with --which every truck of every size, weight, class, was charged the same fee? No.MR. CASEY: These -- these fees deal only31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: No, but can you give me a yes or no answer to that? Did Michigan say, we have a law that says if you are a truck, you pay X dollars, no ifs or buts? Is -- was that the Michigan law?MR. CASEY: The statute in Michigan imposes a $10 fee but permits a waiver, meaning 0.QUESTION: So are you telling me that the answer to my question is yes? There is only one category known in Michigan and that is the category of a truck?MR. CASEY: No. There -- there -- there's a fee of $10 or 0. Some trucks were charged 10. Some were charged 0.QUESTION: So there are at least two categories. MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: And if there are at least twocategories, don't you have to do just what Justice Scalia said you have to do? You have to read something into the statute, or you would be reading it in such a way as to charge against a truck in category A what, under the Michigan law, you would have charged against a truck for category B. That can't be right. So that you've got to -- as Justice Scalia has suggested, you've got to read in some kind of a categorization in addition to the plain meaning of the statute. Isn't that right?MR. CASEY: I -- I disagree. The -- the words,32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425collected or charged, are in the disjunctive. So if the State either collected the fee as of November or charged it as of November --truck.QUESTION: No matter to whom. No matter to what MR. CASEY: No matter to whom. The fact --QUESTION: May I you look at those words in subparagraph (4), which is MR. CASEY: Yes.also suggest that the -- when the context of the wholethe part --QUESTION: -- which begins, shall establish a fee system, so you're talking about collected or charged as part of a system.MR. CASEY: That's correct, Your Honor. Well, it's -- it's true. And that -- that goes to another part of our argument. This -- this system or this section, subsection (3), is the section in which Congress implemented its goal of preserving State revenues. There -- there are two goals that Congress had in passing the single State registration system. One is to simplify the whole procedure for the trucking industry and for States, and two was to preserve State revenues.This subsection (3) that we're dealing with is a section that preserves State revenues. And when you look at it in that context, the text here deals only with fees33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that the State collects. There are other sections that2 talk about payments by trucks to States. There are3 sections that talk about carriers specifically. Congress4 didn't use the word carriers in this subsection. They5 didn't use the words, payments by trucks to -- or by6 carriers to States. They could have used those words, as7 they did in other subsections.8 QUESTION: Carrier in your view signifying the9 entity that owns the trucks?MR. CASEY: Yes.What -- you -- earlier you mentioned trucks of weights and things. We're talking only here power vehicle. We're not talking about the10 1112 different13 about the14 trailer part of the truck. This is just for proof of15 insurance. It's a $10 only. There are other fees that16 various interstate agreements have for different axle17 weights, and that kind of thing.18 QUESTION: I -- I guess our point is that for19 you to make the statute work, you are reading something20 into it that isn't there, which is this generic system and21 -- or this generic theory. And there's a certain amount￼22 of common23 having to24 ambiguous25sense to that, but it seems to me that by your do that, you in effect concede the statute is and then your clear argument case collapses. MR. CASEY: Well, I would -- I respectfully34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 disagree, Your Honor. I --2 QUESTION: The words, fee system, are in the3 statute itself. That's -- those are the first words in4 the subsection to which you're --5 MR. CASEY: This -- correct. This -- this6 subsection is part of a fee system, and this -- this7 subsection of that system is the section that deals with8 ensuring that States receive their revenue. And when you9 put it in that context and you look at the specific words10 of the statute here, when you look at the collected or11 charged in the disjunctive, the statute --12 QUESTION: I don't understand what you get out13 of the disjunctive.MR. CASEY: The statute --QUESTION: How -- how does that help you? MR. CASEY: The statute --QUESTION: It seems to me that for the trucks from reciprocity States, the fee was neither14 15 16 1718 that were19 charged nor collected. So how does the disjunctive help20 you?￼21 MR. CASEY: That's what the Michigan Supreme22 Court said, in essence, that if the -- if the State23 collected or charged the $10 fee, period, then the statute24 is satisfied.25 QUESTION: Did the State sponsor that --35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CASEY: Everything else is irrelevant. Pardon me.QUESTION: In Michigan you -- you helpfully began your argument by pointing out that the case had been decided on a different ground below.MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: And this question of plain meaning or not surfaced for the first time in the Michigan Supreme Court, and that was the basis for its decision.MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: Did you make that argument? Did the State of Michigan make that argument, or was it something that the Michigan Supreme Court brought up on its own?MR. CASEY: It was made in a few paragraphs as one alternative argument in a long brief, but the principal thrust of the argument -- it was -- it was mentioned in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion and rejected. It's in the appendix, I believe, on page 29 where they rejected it. But, yes, it was presented to the Michigan Court of Appeals. It is still active in the Michigan courts.QUESTION: You presented it but not as your main argument.￼argument,MR. CASEY: Our argument -- our principalthe way the case was framed in the State courts36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 was this timing issue. Did Michigan properly switch over2 from the base-plating to the principal place of business3 and could we, therefore, impose the fee and apply the4 statute to Yellow Freight?5 We also argued as one of our alternative6 arguments that it didn't matter or that the -- the statute7 didn't matter -- didn't apply to specific carriers, that8 it applied broadly to everyone. The supreme court at oral9 argument asked -- started asking questions about this10 theory that they ultimately decided it on. But the -- the11 theory that the Michigan Supreme Court decided the case on12 was, by no means, the -- the principal focus of the -- the13 case that was briefed and argued below.14 QUESTION: General Casey, you -- you say that15 the purpose of this section was to preserve State16 revenues, but -- but -- the consequence of the -- the17 theory that you're espousing is -- is not just to preserve18 State revenues, but to augment them. It -- it allows the19 States to -- to take in significantly more than they took20 in before. That is, all of those considerable States that21 had reciprocity and from whom they collected, from whose22 trucks they collected nothing, they can now collect $10.23 That -- that's -- it goes far beyond preserving State￼24 revenues. 25MR. CASEY: Well, the -- we -- we submit that37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 the fears that have been expressed in our opponents'2 briefs that these reciprocity agreements will3 automatically be abrogated is unfounded, for a couple of4 reasons, principally because those reciprocity agreements5 were originally entered into by States for economic6 reasons, totally apart from the -- the statute. It's not7 asthoughthe--theStateislookingatthisasa--asa8 giant money-making event --9 QUESTION: I understand that. I'm -- I'm not10 worried about the sky falling, but I'm addressing your11 argument from the purpose of the statute. And you say the12 purpose is to preserve State revenues, but you come up13 with a theory that goes far beyond preserving State14 revenues. It permits the States to augment their -- their15 revenues considerably. In -- in order to preserve State16 revenues, you need go no further than -- than your17 opponents' theory.18 MR. CASEY: Under their interpretation what has19 happened, in effect, is that State revenues are at best20 frozen, but in practical effect, they may really be21 ratcheted downward because of changing economic22 circumstances.23 QUESTION: Would you explain one thing to me24 that response -- it relates to Justice Scalia's question,25 too. In this particular case, it clearly augmented State38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

But it would seem to me that with respect to other carriers, it might diminish the revenue because some of them -- it might be just the reverse.

CASEY: Well, when Michigan changed from a base-plating to principal place of business, it resulted in, on balance, no economic benefit.QUESTION: With respect to some States, it would increase revenues; with respect to others, it would decrease revenues.MR.

CASEY: As far as Michigan is concerned.QUESTION: -- your argument is that you can charge everybody the full $10.MR. CASEY: That's correct.QUESTION: But Michigan has some interest in getting its own trucks -- having lower fees in other States I suppose.MR. CASEY: Of course. As we've indicated in our briefs, Michigan has committed that we are not going to abrogate our reciprocity agreements, but as I -- as I've indicated, there are economic reasons why States are not going to, in a wholesale, abrogate these -- or these reciprocity agreements. They're not going to cut their own throats by -- by doing that. They -- they have to live with these trucking companies. They have to live with these economic benefits that cause them to enter into these reciprocity agreements in the first place.And -- and there's another factor at work here too. The -- the 1994 ICC Termination Act required Congress -- or excuse me -- required the Department of Transportation to replace this entire regulatory scheme as of 1997, but it has not happened yet. Depending on the outcome of this case, it -- this may serve as an impetus40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

But the -- as -- as you indicated, the sky is very unlikely to fall regardless of what this Court does if -- if it affirms the supreme court or not.QUESTION: May I ask you a question? What -- how would you come out or how would the case come out if we decided that the statute required every State to maintain existing reciprocity agreements? It couldn't -- they couldn't charge higher fees and they couldn't cancel reciprocity agreements. Would you win or lose if we interpret it that way?MR. CASEY: Would Michigan win or lose?QUESTION: Yes, in this case. As I understand it, you haven't changed any reciprocity agreement. You've merely changed the method of deciding which State is relevant for the purposes of granting reciprocity to particular truckers.MR. CASEY: Michigan probably would not win or lose in that. It would probably be no change --QUESTION: You assert the right to terminate reciprocity agreements. You -- you --MR.

CASEY: We -- we have an agreement with Illinois, not Kansas. But we have not. We have -- Michigan has not terminated any reciprocity agreements. Michigan will not.

I thought there was lurking in this case as an issue, if there should be a remand, that there was no viable reciprocity agreement with Illinois, that that terminated in 1989. Are you -- are you --MR. CASEY: Well --QUESTION: -- abandoning that argument?MR. CASEY: No. There -- in the past, back inthe early 1980s, there were formal written contracts of reciprocity. When Michigan passed its statute in 1989 formalizing the $10 fee, the public service commission42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

Many States are not sure reciprocity because various State -- QUESTION: Is that a -- isthis case?MR. CASEY: Michigan has awith Illinois, we believe. We -- wethough we -- we give reciprocity to trucks licensed in Illinois, and it's our understanding that Illinois gives reciprocity to trucks licensed in Michigan.QUESTION: So there would be no point in saying that that's an issue open for a possible remand.MR. CASEY: That's -- I believe that's correct.QUESTION: But that's not right. You don't give reciprocity to trucks licensed in Illinois. You give reciprocity to trucks who are owned by companies who have principal place of business in Illinois.MR. CASEY: That's correct. I Your Honor. Thank you. For purposes of time we had the base-plating system, butmisspoke myself, this case, at the now it's -- if --if we ultimately lose on that other point and we are stuck with the base-plating method and could not -- and the Michigan court rules against us and we are stuck with the43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

If it is not affirmed, we urge the Court to remand the case back to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration of the other issues that were not considered by it.If there are no further questions. QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Casey.Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A couple of quick points.First, we think that the key issue in the case has been identified by questions from a number of members of the Court. Something has to be read into the statute. Now, we think what we would read into the statute is clearly the correct thing to read into it, but even if we are not absolutely right about that, petitioner should prevail because given the agency's determination here, the44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- the tie goes to this side of the table and we think2 that that should be dispositive on that issue in the case.3 Second, there's been some discussion about4 issues that are other issues in the case and -- and the5 proper disposition as to them. We think that there is no6 question about the existence of reciprocity agreements or7 policies that would require remand, in response to Justice8 Ginsburg's question. I think Mr. Casey has candidly9 acknowledged that there was clearly a reciprocity policy10 in place in Michigan, whether identified reciprocity11 agreement or simply unilateral policy. There was no12 question about the nature of that policy. There has been13 no dispute throughout the entire course of this litigation14 about whether there was such a policy and whether it was15 consistently enforced. And therefore, there -- I think16 there is no subject there to be considered further on17 remand.18 The question of whether Michigan's prospective19 change in its policy for the 1992 registration year and20 whether Yellow's diligence in paying that early should21 somehow affect the proper outcome here and require Yellow22 to pay in the future --23 QUESTION: I didn't understand the last clause24 that you just spoke.25 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the -- the question whether45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the fact that Yellow paid in advance of November 15th,2 1991 for a registration year that was not going to go into3 effect until sometime in 1992 --4 QUESTION: Well, the statute says collected or5 charged.6 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, as of 1991, and the7 question is collected or charged, in our view, for what?8 And we think it's for the entitlement to operate on9 Michigan's roads at the relevant time.10 I guess I would take a little bit of issue with11 what Mr. Schlick said. The -- the ICC we think expressly12 addressed that point in its declaratory order when States,13 including Michigan, said --14 QUESTION: Well, but it really hasn't been fully15 fleshed out here, that particular angle. I -- I think it16 would be perfectly consistent to agree with your basic17 position and still feel that was open on remand, as -- as18 the Solicitor General said.19 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, our view is that if that is20 -- if there's to be further litigation on that point, the21 proper forum for that is the administrative proceeding22 that -- that Mr. Schlick also mentioned. There is23 actually pending before the Department of Transportation a24 proceeding initiated by Michigan which takes issue with25 the ATA's -- with the -- the ICC's determination on that46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 point and asks for reconsideration by the agency. We2 think that that is the appropriate place to consider that3 where the agency can exercise its expertise. We then4 appeal to the D.C. Circuit if there's to be some -- some5 question about it. So that -- that's what we would6 suggest is the appropriate --7 QUESTION: But why should we get into an issue8 that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't resolve? It is an9 issue. You may be right or wrong on the merits of it, but10 at least we would not -- we are here reviewing a11 determination made by the Michigan Supreme Court. You are12 saying that we should, at the same time, strike at an13 issue that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't reach.14 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it is true the Michigan15 Supreme Court did not decide it. Our suggestion is that16 the more appropriate place for it to be subject to further17 litigation, if there is to be further litigation, is in18 this agency proceeding with an appeal to the Federal19 court. But -- but you are correct that it was not20 expressly addressed by the Michigan Supreme Court in this21 -- in this case.22 One final point quickly in response to Justice23 Stevens' question about whether the State terminated24 reciprocity agreements or -- or not, or simply changed its25 policy. We think it doesn't matter how you look at it.47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Either way, the State clearly changed the rule that it was2 applying. It had a clearly articulated rule consistently3 applied that trucks based in certain places would not be4 subject to fees. It is now changing that rule and it's5 therefore trying to collect and charge fees as to those6 trucks that it did not charge before or collect before,7 and we think that is clearly precluded by the statutory8 language and is certainly decided by the ICC adversely to9 Michigan.10 If there are no further questions, Mr.11 Justice --QUESTION: Could I ask on that question? The -- is should not exceed the fee that was charged. aggregate the change from the place of1213 the point14 If in the15 determining which State applies, if the aggregate were to16 decrease the collections, which theoretically it could be,17 then there would be no violation of the statute, as I18 understand it.19 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we think it can't be20 considered in the aggregate. First of all, the statutory21 language refers to the fee per vehicle.22 QUESTION: No, a fee system it refers to.23 MR. ROTHFELD: It does, but if I may, Mr. Chief24 Justice, just respond briefly. The particular provision25 which has the fee-freezing provision refers to the fee per￼48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 vehicle. 234So I think that would be precluded.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld.MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
