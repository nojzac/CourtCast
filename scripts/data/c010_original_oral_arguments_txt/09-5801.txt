United States.Mr. Hubachek.ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEKON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:In Nguyen, the Court approved the impositionof legitimation requirement only upon fathers of non-marital children born abroad. That was based on biological differences between men and women. It provided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity to make a relationship with the child that adhered in birth as to the mother.But here, the residential requirements that are at issue here have no biological basis. They set up barriers to the transmission of citizenship by younger fathers, but not younger mothers, and they are based upon gender stereotypes that women, not men, wouldcare -- would care for non-marital children.That scheme has been -- the Solicitor General has attempted to justify that scheme by claiming3Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that Congress was concerned about statelessness, but the2 record doesn't support that claim. Both the 1935 Law3 Review article -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: What separates a stereotype5 from a reality? Do you say it is not true that if there6 is a legitimate -- illegitimate child, it is much more7 likely that the woman will end up caring for it than8 that the father would?9 MR. HUBACHEK: What I was saying -­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not true?11 MR. HUBACHEK: I think it is more likely,12 but I think that empirical evidence has not carried the13 day in gender discrimination cases.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all cases, it is true15 in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold.16 So a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases.17 It just means that you say: This is the way women18 this is the way men are.19 MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, and this is20 actually beyond just an empirical stereotype. The21 congressional hearings, it was said that the woman22 the sole legal parent of this child, totally excluding23 the man, which basically dates back to the notion of24 coverture where men were completely out of the picture25 and women were the ones who were responsible.4￼Alderson Reporting Companyare,-- at isOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 So in addition to the fact that -- the2 empirical portion of it, there is also just the notion3 that the legal parent was the woman. And that was4 specifically -­5 JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't that said in relation6 to the principle that only -- that where paternity was7 not established, the child would be regarded as having8 the citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually9 every country, if not every country, at that time?10 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the law of many11 countries was that citizenship did go through the12 mother. But with respect to legitimation and this13 statute, Congress drew a distinction between all -- all14 parents of -- excuse me, all fathers of non-marital15 children and those who are legitimate. This statute16 applies only to those who are legitimate.17 The very Law Review article that Congress18 relied upon, according to the Solicitor General, says￼19 that in the20 through the21 very -- the22 one instance it goes through the mother, but in the23 instance of the people who are actually affected through24 this statute, those who legitimate, it goes through the25 father.case of legitimation, citizenship goes father. So the bottom line is that the very article they relied upon said that in5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 And there are also a number of situations2 under which mothers -­3 JUSTICE ALITO: Until there is legitimation,4 it goes through the mother. It went through the mother5 under the law in virtually every country, right?6 MR. HUBACHEK: I respectfully disagree. At7 the time, in 1940, when this statute was passed, there8 were a number of situations where it wouldn't go through9 the mother. In China and Japan, if the father was10 merely known it would not go through the mother.11 There were three dozen countries at this12 time, including the English countries and those who13 followed its law, in which if their female citizen gave14 birth to a child somewhere other than in their country,15 citizenship would not travel through that mother because16 of the laws of those particular countries. There are17 also stateless women.18 So in all those situations, the citizenship19 would not go through the mother. It would have to go20 through the father, and this statutory scheme doesn't in21 any way provide for that.22 The scheme also creates severe risks of23 statelessness, as is set out in the Statelessness24 Scholar's brief, for married fathers. If a married25 father who is married to an alien, the -- in those6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 situations, there are a number of countries that would2 not allow the woman to transmit citizenship. So if the3 father was precluded by laws such as they were in the4 United States, that child would end up stateless as5 well. So there is substantial risk of statelessness and6 it continues today.7 There are numerous countries that have8 basically reinstituted that rule, that if the father is9 merely known, citizenship would not transmit through the10 mother. And those are primarily in the Middle East and11 some of them in Africa, and those are detailed in the12 Statelessness Scholars' brief.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hubachek, how do you14 deal with the argument that, really, this is a15 classification where the unmarried woman is being16 favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed17 with the married couple? So it's kind of like18 Matthews v. Heckler: The woman is getting a special19 favor and the unwed father is treated like most people20 who married -- couples who have children.21 MR. HUBACHEK: This is not a case where22 Congress was seeking to remedy any sort of past23 discrimination against women, as was the case, say, in24 Schlesinger v. Ballard. There was no discrimination25 against women. Up until very shortly before this7￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 statute was passed, it was clear under the State2 Department practices that the non-marital children of3 women did get women's citizenship, and it was also true4 as to men. So there was no discrimination that was5 being remedied in that situation.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't answer,7 I don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is:8 This appears to be an exception to a generalized9 non-gender based requirement. Couples, male or female,10 and fathers, unmarried fathers, are subject to five11 years. Only unmarried mothers get the largesse of one12 year. Why isn't -- why shouldn't everybody just be put13 to the broader category rather than extending a largesse14 to a greater number of people?15 MR. HUBACHEK: The reason is, Justice16 Sotomayor, is that we are not talking about an exception17 here, the treatment that the non-marital mothers were18 getting. That was the standard prior to the 194019 litigation -- 1940 legislation. There was no20 significance residence requirement.21 Then Congress imposed new residence22 requirements because it was concerned about the foreign23 influence in mixed marriages, meaning someone who was24 married to an alien. In those situations, Congress25 specifically said in the record that they were concerned8￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that when those children were born abroad, that they2 would have foreign influence, that they would be more3 foreign then they were American. That's not -­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So doesn't the 5-year5 residency requirement address that? If we apply it6 generally, wouldn't the 5-year residency requirement7 honor Congress's concern about there being a substantial8 tie to the States?MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, it would. And -- that concern is not applicable when you about two U.S. citizen parents to whom the910 that -- for11 are talking12 extended residence requirement didn't apply.13 Non-marital14 going to be15 of an alien16mothers were assumed to be the ones who were raising the children without the influence father.The non-marital fathers are in the same those, too. Those non-marital fathers who children on their own, as Petitioner's￼17 category as18 raise their19 father did in this case, are not subject to that type of20 foreign influence, so they should be grouped together21 with the women and with the two-citizen families,22 because they have the lack of foreign influence.23 So it's only as to the mixed-marriage24 couples who are married where there is a foreign25 influence problem, and they're the ones to whom the9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 expanded residence required -- was applied.2 Now, with respect to the -- the Solicitor3 General has raised concerns about the plenary power4 doctrine. And I would argue that that doesn't apply5 here for a couple of reasons.6 First is, we are not talking about the7 admission of aliens.8 Second is that the Court in Chadha Zadvydas9 said -- made clear that even when exercising that power,10 that congressional -- excuse me -- Congress's power is11 limited by constitutional limitations.12 Now, with respect to the entry of aliens,13 Congress made it very clear in passing this very statute14 that they considered those people who gained citizenship15 as of birth to be differently situated than aliens.16 That was a tradition that dated back to 1350. In 1790,17 Congress passed a statute saying that children born18 abroad to citizens -­19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is this your -- are20 you taking this in the direction of an argument that21 Congress gets less deference in determining nationality22 than it does with admission to aliens?23 MR. HUBACHEK: What I'm saying, Your Honor,24 is that we are talking about the ability of a United25 States citizen, Petitioner's father, to transmit10￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425citizenship, and that that is a traditional interest. Citizenship is extremely important and it's a tradition that citizens have been able to do for years.So yes, constitutional limitations should apply when the -- when Congress is drawing distinctions between men and women -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you want us to write an opinion that says Congress has less deference when it considering -- when it determines who should be a national of this country than it -- than when it determines who should be admitted as an alien?MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there is no tradition dating back to 1350 for the admission of aliens.It's -- it's -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you asking us to writethat formulation in an opinion?MR. HUBACHEK: Your Honor, what I'm sayingis that the -- that the due process guarantee of equal protection is applicable in this context because the citizens of the United States -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I -- if I take that as a "yes" answer, what is your authority for that answer? It seems to me that it ought to be just the other way around.MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Your Honor, my11Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 authority for that answer is the tradition that I have2 been discussing. Congress itself, in 1940, considered3 people who gained citizenship by birth abroad as being4 differently situated from aliens, aliens who naturalize.5 In fact, they said that that was universally -­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, but it was7 Congress that made the distinction. But you are asking8 us to say that Congress has less authority over this9 essential issue as to who should be nationals in the10 United States.11 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think -- that's -­12 that's a -­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe there is some14 authority for that. Do you have any authority? Is15 there something I can read that tells me that?16 MR. HUBACHEK: Chadha Zadvydas says that17 even though Congress has plenary power over the18 immigration power. When it exercises that power, it has19 to apply with constitutional limitations. This is the20 first one of the Court's cases where -­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was an alien22 admissions case. You are talking about nationality.23 MR. HUBACHEK: I'm talking about citizenship24 being transmitted by a United States citizen. What we25 are saying is that Petitioner's father, as a United12￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425States citizen, has equal protection -- Equal Protection Clause, protection against the discrimination, here because a similarly-situated woman would be able to transmit citizenship.JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Finish.Are you finished?MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't quite follow this.As I understand it, on what -- say: On what remedy will there be if you're right? This is what I don't understand.A child is born abroad. One parent is American; the other is foreign. If the two are married, that child is American only if the father or themother -- one or the other -- has lived in the United States for now at least 2 years. It used to be more. Okay? Now it's 5 years after the age of 16.Now suppose they are not married, and suppose the American is the father. Same rule.Now suppose they are not married and the American is the mother. Now it's not 5 years or 2 years; you only have to have lived here for one year. Suppose I agree with you. I just don't see any sense to that whatsoever. I can't figure it out. They made a13Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 mistake about the immigration laws. Suppose I agree2 with you.3 Then why isn't the remedy, say: Okay,4 whether it is the father or the mother, the general rule5 applies. They have to have lived in the United States6 for 5 years or for 2 years? Now 2 years.7 MR. HUBACHEK: There are a couple of reasons8 at least for that, Your Honor. First is that there is a9 structural limitation here to imposing a levelling-down10 type remedy, because citizenship cannot be taken away11 once it's granted. So the Court can't remedy the12 problem here -­13 JUSTICE BREYER: Some people were lucky, and14 they are already citizens under this, and there we are,15 because their mother lived in the United States for one16 year. Those already are citizens. Nobody is going to17 take that away. We are just looking at a statute.18 And in the first part of the statute, they19 have in section (g) of 1401, the first rule I told you20 about. In 1409(a), the second rule, and in 1409(c), the21 third rule.22 Okay. If you are right about this, and it's23 totally unfair and there is no good reason whatsoever24 for distinguishing on the basis of gender, we strike25 (g). Okay?14￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Now, that would seem to be normal, but that isn't going to help your client. So how do you get to some other thing that instead of striking (g)? What we do is strike all of (a) and strike the whole thing before, and shove them all into (g), which isn't so easy to do with this language. How do you get there?MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the first thing is, is that this statute contains a severability clause. Very similar to -­JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So we strike (g). What I'm worried about is, you want me to strike (a) -­ sorry, we strike (c). And you want me to strike 1409(a) and 1401(g), and shove the people who are there into (g), which is a little tough to do in the English language. But I want to know how you get there.MR. HUBACHEK: By -- by extension, Your Honor. And -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: First, can we be clear about what you're saying? I thought your argument was, you are not touching married couples.MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that you are talking about equating the unmarried father to the unmarried mother. Do you have -- is there any notion of how many people we're talking about?15Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 I mean, in these extensions versus the2 normalization, where the Court generally extends when3 there is a small class to be covered, a small class was4 left out, and in a large class is already covered. And5 the reasoning has been: Well, my goodness, Congress6 wanted to take care of that larger class; it would be7 most destructive of the legislative will if we said you8 can't cover that larger class.9 So as a group of unmarried mothers as10 against unmarried fathers, do -- do you have any notion11 of what the numbers would be?12 MR. HUBACHEK: Justice Ginsberg, I don't13 have any statistics to provide the Court.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is -­15 maybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's16 question.17 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Justice Breyer. Anyway,18 the remedy we are requesting is extension. In Westcott19 and in Heckler, the Court looked at language in the20 severability clause that was similar to this, and also21 in Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Welsh, and22 said that type of language in a severability clause23 gives courts power to grant an extension remedy.24 So that's what we are requesting. We're25 requesting -­16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there's another slight2 problem with that, I would think. Reading this3 carefully, which I hope I have done, it seems to me it4 may also discriminate against fathers. And that's5 because (c) says that the woman has to have been6 physically present for a continuous period of one year.7 I read at least one article that says that word,8 "continuous," doesn't appear with the fathers, and that9 they really mean it. That is, if somebody is living10 down in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas11 their father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin12 or something who is across the border for 5 minutes,13 that they cannot take advantage of this clause (c).14 Is that true?15 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't know the answer to16 that, Justice Breyer.17 JUSTICE BREYER: I will ask the (g) that,18 butifitistrue--ifitistrue,then--thenIwould19 think that the fathers are really worse off. I don't20 know if that helps you. And maybe it could turn out21 that that's really a problem.22 If it is really a problem, then the fathers23 are worse off. Does that help you with the remedy?24 MR. HUBACHEK: Traditionally in immigration25 law when you have continuous requirements, if it's a17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 short trip,2 requirement34 hard time following the question.5 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is: I'm6 looking for a way -- I'm trying to be helpful in my7 question. I'm looking for a way that you can get to8 your result. Now I'm not saying I would do it, but I9 just want to know what the best way is of getting to10 that result, where you shove everyone into (c) instead11 of just cutting (c).12 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the -- the best way is13 to follow the Court's tradition in the benefits cases14 such as Wengler and Wiesenfeld, where the Court granted15 an extension remedy and basically treated -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: That would help you. Is17 there a reason for doing that?18 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the reason for doing19 that is, is that the language that's contained in the20 severability clause is similar to what the Court has21 already said allows an extension remedy. And the other22 problem is, is that if the Court doesn't grant an23 extension remedy, it leaves Petitioner basically without24 a remedy, that there will be individuals who have been25 able to have a -­18casual trip, you know, then those -- thatis not considered to have been violated. Ifthe--if--IhavetoadmitI'mhavinga￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, he would have a2 remedy. The remedy for an equal protection violation is3 to treat everybody the same. You can do that either by4 lowering the people who are given a benefit or by5 increasing the people who aren't. So he has a remedy.6 His objection is, we're not being -- my7 father and my mother are not being treated the same.8 That's all of the relief he is entitled to.9 MR. HUBACHEK: You are absolutely right,10 that that is -- that is the state of the law. And my11 point is that structurally, that remedy is unavailable12 here, because you can't take away the citizenship from13 the people who have already gotten it.14 And the notion that you can grant us15 prospective relief as discussed in the Solicitor16 General's brief doesn't make any sense, either, because17 number one, this statute, the one we are talking about18 today, doesn't apply past people who were born before19 1986.20 But the thing is that if somebody were to21 come into court after an opinion that said just that22 were issued -- someone were to come into court and say,23 I want to claim citizenship through my mother, that24 person would still be entitled to citizenship because25 it's as of the day of birth. So this is a retroactive19￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 provision.2 So the prospective relief notion really3 doesn't makes any sense in this context, because the4 equal protection violations have basically all already5 occurred at the time that the person who would make a6 citizenship claim was born, and we would still be left7 in a situation where Petitioner's father would say that8 I was unable to transmit citizenship to my son and a9 woman who was similarly situated was able to. So that10 type of remedy is unavailable.11 In the Court's decision in Iowa v. Bennett,12 the bank case, they actually ordered a refund of the13 taxes that were collected in a discriminatory manner14 dating back in time. So if you could factor out -- if15 you could make a relief that would take away the benefit16 that others had received, then I would agree that that17 is available, but that's not possible in this situation.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hubachek, I think the19 Chief asked you: If it's an equal protection violation,20 then the Court just says it violates equal protection,21 but whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a22 temporary solution, because the legislature can't be23 convened on the spot. And the Court actually did go24 through that exercise, extension versus invalidation,25 most conspicuously in Califano -- Westcott, in the20￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Westcott case. It says, yes, that's what we have been2 doing in all these cases.3 In Sarah Frontiero's case, we didn't say:4 You've been discriminated against; Congress, you fix it.5 We said: You get the quarters' allowance that up until6 now has been available only in male officers. And in7 Wiesenthal, the father got the same child and care8 benefits as the mother. So the Court was making a9 decision for extension; it recognized it had to do that.10 MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely. And in many of11 the benefits cases, the same -- the same analysis was12 available and that's the analysis that we are asking13 that the Court apply here. But we're also making -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hubacheck, you are15 asking, I think, that the Court pronounce your client to16 be a United States citizen. Isn't that the only17 pronouncement from -- form the Court that is going to do￼18 your client 192021 citizen.2223 technically24 judgment and opportunity to present this -­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: A reversal of the judgment21any good?MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless he's a United StatesMR. HUBACHEK: This is a criminal case, sowhat we are asking is for a reversal of theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 on the grounds that your client is a United States2 citizen, right?3 MR. HUBACHEK: That it would be possible for4 him, on these facts, to become a United States citizen,5 yes.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That he is a United7 States citizen.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That he is, not that -­9 that he is. That he is. Do you have any other case10 where a Court has conferred citizenship on someone who,11 under the statutes as written, does not have it?12 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, that was one of the13 issues that was debated, of course, in the Nguyen and14 Miller cases, and the Court has not said that yet but it15 can in this case.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Never done.17 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct. That's18 correct, but it can in this case, for a number of19 reasons. Number one is the fact that this severability20 clause is applicable to this claim. Congress actually21 passed a statute, 1421(d), in this same statutory22 scheme, that said when we are talking about23 naturalization -- the naturalization of aliens, then you24 cannot get naturalization under those circumstances any25 other way then what's set out in this statute. They22￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425didn't say that as to claims of citizenship as of birth. So there is a negative implication,basically, that they -- that they were not precluding this type of remedy as to a citizenship claim where we are claiming an equal protection violation.The second point is that if the Court is unable to grant that remedy, that would leave an equal protection violation in place, and as Justice Harlan made clear in Welsh -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless -- unless we -- we solve the violation the other way, by saying that the father gets the shorter period that the -- than the mother has.MR. HUBACHEK: Well, again -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, that the mother gets the longer period than the father has.MR. HUBACHEK: Right. And I think if theCourt -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You say we can't apply that retroactively. Well, okay; we don't apply itretroactively. The people that have citizenship cannot constitutionally be deprived of it, but for everybody else, it's okay.MR. HUBACHEK: Even -- even prospectively, Your Honor, because this statute says you have23Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 citizenship as of birth. So even if the Court were to2 render that decision and someone were to make a claim,3 they could still say: I had citizenship of as of birth;4 i.e., whenever I was born, which is before the Court's5 decision. So there really -- that would be no remedy at6 all. It's a remedy -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But any of -- of the8 remedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia9 involves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of10 the congressional power.11 Let me just ask you this as an analytic12 matter, or as matter of logical priorities. We usually13 talk about substance first, remedy second. Do you think14 it's permissible, logically, for us to say that because15 the remedies here are so intrusive, that bears on our16 choice of whether we or not we use intermediate or17 rational basis scrutiny, and because the remedies are so18 difficult, we are going to use rational basis scrutiny?19 Is that a logical way to proceed?20 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't think so. I think21 the Court has traditionally has said that the -- the22 questions of a right and whether or not there exists an23 opportunity to make a claim and the remedy for it are24 analytically distinct. So I don't believe -­25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it also said that the24￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 remedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set2 up to do that. I mean, that's what Westcott said. The3 court can go one way or another way; it can't do any4 fine-tuning, because it's there as a temporary5 legislature. The ball goes back to Congress to do what6 it will, but it's just, in the interim, we need a7 solution.8 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct, and certainly9 Congress could do that. And the Solicitor General's10 brief makes clear that what was being balanced here was11 concerns about -- according to them, anyway -- concerns12 about statelessness on the one hand and connection to13 the United States on the other.14 If Congress hadn't assumed based on gender15 stereotypes that men weren't caring for children, then16 it would have -- it would have been able to put them in17 the same category as women, because they would18 understand that both of them would be caring for19 children.20 And it's not just the -- the situation in21 1940. As time has gone on, I believe in the National22 Women's Center brief it points out that the number of23 men who are raising children in single-parent families24 is increasing over time. So the problem, if anything,25 is getting worse.25￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress did make at2 least some change, right? It -- this is -- it's no3 longer five years; it's only two years, right?4 MR. HUBACHEK: The current system is five5 years, two years after the -- the age of 16 -- I'm6 sorry, after the age of 14. And of course, that age7 requirement here completely precluded8 Mr. Flores-Villar's father from being able to transmit9 citizenship because of his age. That kind of complete10 preclusion would never apply to a woman who is similarly11 situated.12 If the Court doesn't have any questions, I13 will reserve my time.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.15 Mr. Kneedler.16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER17 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT18 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it19 please the Court:20 Congress in deciding who among the various21 people born abroad should be made citizens of the United22 States has to take into account myriad factors that may23 bear on that question and its judgment. They include24 importantly Congress's prediction in the case of25 conferring citizenship at birth, what would be that26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 person's likely connection to the United States.2 Congress also has to consider the interaction with the3 laws of other countries where these people may be born.4 It may take into account equities, potential5 statelessness or dual nationality. These are6 complicated questions to which the courts should defer.7 Now, in the particular -­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Intermediate scrutiny9 and -- is not without some deference.10 MR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless we apply strict12 scrutiny, which no one is arguing for, the question is,13 is it rational basis deference or is it some14 intermediate scrutiny, correct?15 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And we believe that16 under this Court's decisions, particularly in Fiallo v.￼17 Bell and the cases discussed in18 should be rational basis for -­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:20 really mean that because we can21 that is very simple and then you'll explain to me why a22 U.S. citizen should be burdened in this way and the23 hypothetical is, let's assume Congress determines that24 there are too many foreign-born children of U.S.25 citizens coming into the United States, and that those27Alderson Reporting Companythat case, that itWell, but you can't put up a hypotheticalOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 foreign-born children, those born of women are placing a2 greater burden on our economic system. They need more3 care for reasons that Congress determines analytically4 or statistically. They are spending more money -- more5 government money. And Congress passes a rule that says,6 only the foreign-born children of men can come into the7 country, not of women. Wouldn't that be a rational8 basis?9 MR. KNEEDLER: I think the answer to that10 question lies in the Court's formulation of the test11 that is applied in this particular context, and that is12 the formulation drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel that13 was articulated in Fiallo v. Bell, and that is that14 there has to be a facially legitimate and bona fide15 reason.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a facially17 legitimate bona fide reason.18 MR. KNEEDLER: I think the Court could have19 no trouble concluding that an arbitrary choice between20 men and women -­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's arbitrary about a22 government saying, I want to spend less money on a new23 citizen?24 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the ultimate reason25 may be legitimate, but I think the facial legitimate28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 test also encompasses means not just end, and if2 Congress is just arbitrarily choosing between men and3 women or people of a different race, I think given this4 Court's tradition it could conclude that those would be5 impermissible bases under the well-established test, but6 for the reasons we say in our brief we don't -­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What well established8 test?9 MR. KNEEDLER: Fiallo v. Bell for -- and the10 cases underlying it and we also think -­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that the rational12 basis plus test you are talking about?13 MR. KNEEDLER: You could call it that or you14 could call it a facially legitimate -­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we're going to16 just continue sort of tweaking the definitions and17 creating more variations on our review standard?18 MR. KNEEDLER: I think it is -- it is a test19 that this Court has articulated in Fiallo v. Bell and20 Kleindienst v. Mandel to address this very situation,21 including a situation where asserted constitutional22 rights of U.S. citizens in this country are being23 claimed. And we agree with Justice Kennedy that the24 standard should not be more demanding, but rather if25 anything it should be less demanding where the question29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is whether someone should be made a citizen.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's hard here because3 both the father -- this father, but many fathers and4 mothers are actually U.S. citizens who want to bring5 their children over as U.S. citizens. So, if the father6 was making the claim here, you would still argue it was7 a rational basis test even though he's a U.S. citizen8 and entitled to all the protections of the Constitution?9 MR. KNEEDLER: We would argue for the10 facially legitimate -- and that was the case in Fiallo,11 in which the plaintiffs included U.S. citizens, children12 and fathers, claiming that, in a very parallel situation13 claiming that that special privileges for illegitimate14 children to reunite with the mother worked an15 unconstitutional discrimination against the fathers of16 such children. And it was U.S. citizen fathers and17 children who were among the plaintiffs and the Court18 nonetheless said that this is -- there is no19 constitutional right to pass citizenship, this is a20 question of Congress's judgment about who it believes21 should be made citizens. And one of the important22 factors Congress has looked at is connection to a U.S.23 citizen that is in turn a proxy for what the likely24 connection to the United States will be.25 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that, but what30￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 you are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender2 discrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender3 discrimination. Now, is there any reason to do that? I4 think that was the thrust of the question.5 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that was the issue.6 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now fine.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Fiallo v. Bell.8 JUSTICE BREYER: If it's the government's9 position you do, does the same thing apply to racial10 discrimination? Do you also apply a lesser standard to11 racial discrimination?12 MR. KNEEDLER: I think the facially13 legitimate standard in Fiallo v. Bell would render a￼14 reliance on race.15 JUSTICE BREYER: This is suddenly is cutting16 a big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.17 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't think so because18 I think that same principle would be given effect in the19 way -­2021 dealing not22 resident --23 in a parent24 wasn't about who was the citizen at birth.25 MR. KNEEDLER: It wasn't, but in the eyes of31JUSTICE GINSBURG: First, in Fiallo we were with citizens, this is someone, acould be a resident alien wanting to bring or a child. So it wasn't -- that caseAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the Constitution, anyone born abroad is an alien unless2 and until Congress has passed a statute making them a3 citizen. So analytically, doctrinally it is the same4 question.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Congress has passed -­6 has passed a statute making certain people citizens and7 the question is, has it done so in a way that is8 compatible with equal protection. But remind me too,9 because it's not in the front of my head, I thought that10 classification that was dealt with in Fiallo, wasn't it11 unwed parentage rather than gender?12 MR. KNEEDLER: But there were claims based13 on both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal14 protection claims based on both. But if I could move on15 to the way that the statute operates because we think it16 satisfies either standard of review in this case. And17 if I could just step back for a moment. As I mentioned,18 there are a number of factors that Congress takes into19 account in crafting a statute like this. 1401 deals20 with married couples and where both parents are21 citizens, all that is required is that one of the22 parents have resided in the United States prior to the23 birth.24 Where you have mixed parentage, the25 background of the enactment of this in 1940 and32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 reenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day2 is Congress was concerned that such a child may not have3 the requisite connection to the United States. They4 have a connection to the parent, but may not have a5 connection to the United States such that Congress6 wanted to grant citizenship to that person. So what7 Congress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to8 require prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as9 the Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to10 the United States of ten years, five years after the age11 of 14. Congress has liberalized that, but that was the12 basic thought. Where you have unwed parents, in 1409(a)13 what Congress did was to follow general principles of14 the law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock,15 if a father legitimates a child then it's as if the16 child was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with17 respect to marriage applies. That is true whether both18 parents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation.19 If a father legitimates a child and both parents are20 citizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from21 the rule that if either parent was present in the United22 States before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to23 satisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement24 under 1409(c). If it's mixed parentage, and the father25 legitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 citizen and parents applies as if the child had been2 married at the outset. It's a perfectly sensible and3 provision or approach and consistent with the way this4 has been done. What Congress did with respect to the5 mother of the child born out of wedlock where there has6 not have been legitimation is to confer citizenship on7 the basis of a one year residency. Now, as counsel for8 the Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who9 at the moment of birth, as this Court understood in10 Nguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent11 or the only parent at the moment of birth with the12 requisite connection to the child to have an opportunity13 for this sort of connection at birth. So the mother in14 that circumstance is very much like the two citizen15 parent family, the only parents are parents with a16 connection to the United States.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, if -- if18 the classification then were that we want to encourage,19 because it's good for society, father/child20 relationships, so we are going to give that advantage,21 that is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the22 mothers together with the married couples, would that be23 compatible with equal protection?24 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think that would25 be -- that would depend upon a -- a -- a different34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 rationale. I mean here what Congress -­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I told you what the3 rationale was. The rationale was that we have lots of4 statutes like the Family Medical and Leave Act that5 attempt to encourage fathers to have a relationship with6 their children, to be a legal parent, so that's the7 rationale of this classification. They want to8 encourage the father/child relationship, therefore, they9 gave this 1 year is enough for the -- for the father.10 And everything else is the same, except it's the father11 who gets the 1 year, and the mother who gets the -- what12 is it, 10 years -­13 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be a more14 difficult question, because Congress would be -- would15 be responding based on the -- on the expected behaviors16 and talents maybe of men and women. What's different17 here is that's not what it's -- that's not the basis for18 this classification. This -­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would you, in20 fact, acting on the basis of what hasn't been the21 general pattern but what is becoming the new pattern.22 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And in that23 situation, Congress I think could be expected and maybe24 should be required to do that in a gender-neutral basis25 because it is premising it on the behavior, but -- but35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 what -­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there is, even though3 we are still dealing with citizenship, you recognize4 that there are categorizations that would run afoul of5 equal protection?6 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- and -- and the7 question would be whether that's a facially legitimate8 rationale. And -- and I would want to know -- I think I9 would want to know more about what the record for such a10 justification would be, et cetera. But I -- but I would11 like to -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The same as in the Family13 Medical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave14 instead as if it had been historically a maternity.15 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And in -- in that16 situation, I think it would be expanding on a17 gender-neutral basis rather than singling out one parent18 or the other. But I -- but I would like to finish the19 description, I have because it's incomplete and there is20 a critical piece left out, and that is that counsel for21 Petitioner says that if -- if a father legitimates an22 out-of-wedlock child, he is in the same position or that23 child is in the same position as a child in an24 out-of-wedlock mother, and that is not likely to be so,25 and it's not likely to be so at birth. And this is the36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 reason why, is when a child is legitimated, there are2 two parents who have the strong connection that was3 described in this Court's decision in Nguyen to that4 child, the U.S. citizen father, but also the mother, the5 alien mother in that country. So you have two parents6 whose interests have to be taken into account.7 Whereas in the situation Congress was8 addressing in 1409(c), the situation of a child born out9 of wedlock where there was no -- at the moment of birth,10 likely to be no recognized father, have you only the11 mother. If we -- if we think of this in -- in parallel12 to the illegitimacy -- the cases involving illegitimates13 that this Court has had in a domestic context, I think14 that is instructive. In a case like Lehr, where the15 question was whether the father of a child born out of16 wedlock should have received notice of a prospective17 adoption, the Court explained in that case that the18 father had not taken the steps necessary to form the19 relationship with the child, and therefore, be -- be a20 father in the eyes of the law, then the mother alone -­21 JUSTICE BREYER: You have -- we have the22 briefs that are filled with, you know, pros and cons23 about the statelessness business and whether it was24 real, and I've read those and I would like your comment25 on those, but I want to comment, too, on this very -­37￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what may be a very minor thing, but I did notice, prodded by an article, I have to say, that -- that for the women there is a sense in which its tougher -­MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: -- and that's because of the continuous period.Now, I guess it depends on how that is enforced, but there could be a class of people, say, living in the border, near Canada or near Mexico where they step across the border on Christmas day to say hello to my cousin, and -- and does that stop them from taking advantage of that? Is it -- in other words, how is this enforced? Is it enforced with that rigidity?MR. KNEEDLER: It does have to be continuous residency, you're correct -­JUSTICE BREYER: Which means that you can't stop with across the border? You can't -­MR. KNEEDLER: There might be minor exceptions where you go across the border in Christmas Eve. That I can't be -­JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there -­ well, is there or isn't there, to your knowledge? Is this enforced with total rigidity or is it enforced that maybe you could go once a month or you could go on your birthday, or what is the answer?38Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KNEEDLER: I think in that situation,2 no. And the example that I was -­3 JUSTICE BREYER: In that situation you4 cannot go across the border?5 MR. KNEEDLER: The example I was given when6 I asked this question was, if you have somebody who's7 on -- who lives in Mexico and commutes to the United8 States, you know, 5 days a week, you can under -- under9 -- under 1401, you can add up each day, and get to a10 total of 5 or 10 years of continuous -- excuse me -- of11 actual physical presence, that would not satisfy the12 continuous -­13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if it's14 tough then and really is meant to be tough, then there15 is a -- what is the rationale for treating women in this16 respect worse than treating men?17 MR. KNEEDLER: Congress -- the 1-year18 provision.19 JUSTICE BREYER: The 1 year, I grant you,20 the time 1 year is treating them better than the time 521 years. But the word "continuous," it's really tough is22 what your answer leads me to believe, and they really23 mean it. I mean, then that's treating them worse than24 treating the men. And I would like to know what is the25 rationale for treating them worse?39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KNEEDLER: Congress -- Congress2 selected, because while I said the mothers are like the3 two-citizen family or two-citizen parents in the sense4 that only U.S. citizens are the parent and you have some5 connection, Congress was balancing the duration of that6 connection or taking into account the duration of that7 connection and it chose to make it a little bit tougher.8 And I -- I think that is perfectly legitimate, because9 Congress -- because you only have one parent and10 Congress was deciding, well if somebody has been here11 for a continuous period of 1 year, then there -- then12 there is probably a greater likelihood that that person13 will -- will have roots here then, for example, the14 other situation where if you had a child born abroad and15 came home in the summers, that child may not think of16 himself or may not be regarded as an American in the17 same way.18 So, what Congress was focusing on a -- on a19 period of longer duration, which in its judgment20 could -- could give rise to, Congress believed, a21 greater connection to the United States.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if -­23 if the Court were to determine that this does violate24 the Equal Protection Clause, and the court were also to25 determine that this is not a case that should be the40￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 first one in history in which it grants naturalization,2 what do you think the Court ought to do?3 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think the Court ought4 to strike the eligibility of -- of anyone to get5 citizenship on the basis of 1 year. I think it could -­6 should constrict the -- the class to those specifically7 governed by89 it violates1011 a remedy -­ 1213 friend's point that that retroactively deprives people14 of citizenship that we would be saying they should have15 gotten if the Equal Protection Clause had been enforced.16 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- I think this Court17 could legitimately take into account the -- the18 conferral of citizenship and the reliance on that. I19 think it's parallel to -- to Heckler v. Matthews, where20 the Court upheld a statute in which Congress took21 account of reliance interest that had built up on22 your -­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But here, of24 course, under my scenario we don't have a situation25 where Congress has addressed -- addressed the problem.411401 -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the ground that equal protection.MR. KNEEDLER: And it is a solution -- it'sCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about your￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 So what do we do? If somebody under the theory that we2 say this person should not have been denied citizenship3 because of the unequal protection in the law, and he4 comes in and it's the same situation, he's going to be5 deported for not being an American citizen and he says6 I'm an American citizen.7 MR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does he get the9 benefit of that or not?10 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think he does not. I11 think -- I think the answer is that the -- and -- and12 partly for the reasons that you alluded to and13 Justice Scalia mentioned, we do not think that a court14 can properly grant U.S. citizenship, and that that￼15 should enforce -- excuse me -- inform the remedy, and16 it -- but for the people who have been granted17 citizenship, I think the solution would be to invalidate18 the 1-year residency requirement.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why would we20 grant that remedy when it doesn't do this Petitioner any21 good whatever. It's -- it's a remedy that doesn't22 remedy.2324 suppose -­ 2542MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I suppose -- I JUSTICE SCALIA: We are -- we aren'tAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 granting relief that doesn't provide relief.2 MR. KNEEDLER: I suppose -- I suppose the3 Court could -- could decide that at the outset, that it4 would not be appropriate to grant that relief and not5 go -- and not go any further.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason it7 doesn't grant that relief is somewhat unusual in this8 case. It only doesn't grant him relief because of the9 third-party standing. He doesn't care whether he's10 treated equally or not; he just wants to be -- claim the11 benefit of citizenship.12 The person where he would get relief is if13 it were the father, because the relief that he is￼14 entitled to is to be treated equally. That's it.15 The relief this person is asking for is not16 to be deported. And so the problem of the relief being17 granted is really complicated by the fact that it's a18 case of third-party standing.19 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I agree with20 that as well, which I think is all the more reason for21 the Court to be cautious about -- about entering into22 this. I think that -­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr.24 answering the question that way, I25 with the Wiesenfeld, case, and the43Alderson Reporting CompanyKneedler, inknow you are familiar question was, thisOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 was a father who was denied benefits to take care of a2 -- a child whose mother died at childbirth. And the3 Court came out a unanimous judgment but split three ways4 on why. And one of the members of the Court said, this5 is discrimination against the child, even though the6 classification was -- it's called a mother's benefit -­7 it's discrimination against the child because it should8 make no difference at all whether the missing parent is9 female or male, that that was utterly irrational.10 That was the Chief -- that was then Justice11 Rehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld. So he12 seemed to think that the discrimination was against the13 child and that that counted for equal protection14 purposes.15 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, here the only claim16 that has been raised is an equal protection violation of17 the parent's asserted rights.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's what --19 Steven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the20 Court -- at least one justice's rationale was that the21 discrimination is really against the child, but the22 father can raise him -­23 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, insofar as any claim of24 discrimination by the child, I think, since it's not25 based on the child's gender, I think that would clearly44￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 be a rational basis or facially legitimate standard; and2 Justice O'Connor's opinion in Miller v. Albright3 addressed the rational basis there.4 And here, this is not just based on the5 gender of the parent, it's based on the -- on the6 complexities in the legal history with respect to7 illegitimacy, and -- and how children born out of8 wedlock are dealt with, which again turns not on -- on9 stereotypes of behavior or talents, but on longstanding10 legal regimes not just in this country but in -- in11 other countries, that until the father does something to12 have a meaningful relationship, the mother is the -- is13 the only legal parent, or in the terminology of this14 Court's decision in Nguyen, the parent who is likely to15 have the meaningful relationship.16 Once the father comes forward in a case like17 Lehr, the result is not that the father gets a veto18 power or that that only the father's interests are taken19 into account; the answer is that you have two parents20 whose interests are taken into -­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a case where22 mother versus father. But here it's a single parent.23 This is not a case where the father is doing something24 that the mother regards as disadvantageous. That was in25 the Lehr case.45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KNEEDLER: No -­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you said something3 about -- this has nothing to do with stereotypes, this4 is the way the law was? But wasn't the law shaped5 because of the vision of the world of being divided into6 married couples, where the father is what counted, and7 unwed mothers, where she was -- they say both father and8 mother, because the law didn't regard him as having any9 kind of obligation?10 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, I think this is11 the issue the Court addressed in Nguyen, in which the12 Court -- the Court said that there is -- there is a13 difference at the moment of birth in the potential and14 therefore the likelihood of a -- of a connection of15 child to parent at the moment of birth that justified16 the requirement that -- that the father take a step to17 legitimate the child, in order to be able to -- to be on18 an equal footing with the mother with respect to -- to19 the rights.20 And here the residency requirement is what21 measures the connection of the parent to the United22 States, not the child to the parent; but we think the23 same point obtains, that at the moment of birth in24 another country, for example, another country might take25 a view that this Court did in Nguyen and Lehr and cases46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 like that, that the father doesn't have a meaningful2 connection to the child in the sense that one would3 predict citizenship on the basis of, until there had4 been some formal steps which would happen after birth to5 establish the relationship with the child. If it was6 constitutional for Congress to do that in Nguyen, it is7 constitutional for Congress to take into account that8 other countries might do the very same thing.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Nguyen, I thought that10 this Court relied on the biological factor, which is not11 so here. I mean, here there is no question that this is12 the -- the natural parent of the child.13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes, but in Nguyen the14 Court did not look at the circumstances of the15 particular case. It looked -- it looked generally to16 what would have justified Congress's acting17 categorically as we think Congress has to have the18 flexibility to do. And -- and I think the questions in19 these statutory provisions show that there are numerous20 competing equities and considerations that have to be21 taken into -- into account.22 And that -- that is what -- that is what23 Congress did here with respect to establishing a -- to24 requiring a close nexus to the United States. And if -­25 if in another country a father has -- has legitimated or47￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 done those steps, then you have a U.S. citizen mother2 and a father in another country that is directly3 parallel to the married mixed -- mixed parent marriage;4 and Congress was concerned about whether that child was5 going to be sufficiently affiliated with the United6 States to justify a conferral of citizenship.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we8 determine that the only remedy we can impose is to9 equalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the10 mother rather than relieving the father of it, do you11 have authority for the proposition that we can address12 that issue hypothetically? In other words, without13 making a decision on the equal protection question on14 the merits?15 MR. KNEEDLER: Um -­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, look17 ahead and if you say, look, the only remedy that we are18 going to be able to give this person is a remedy that19 isn't going to benefit him regardless of how the merits20 are decided, therefore we don't reach the merits.21 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't have -- I don't have22 authority from -- from a decision of this Court. I may23 -- I may be not recalling something, I don't.24 But I do believe in the special context -­25 context of citizenship, that there might a justification48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 for the -- for Court's doing that.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that would be in3 effect saying that we have no jurisdiction, because4 there is no standing. Because there -- there is no5 remediation that the Court can make.6 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose that would be7 one way of looking at it. I mean the Court8 traditionally has looked at -- at questions of9 severability as -- as a question of remedy, and not -­10 and not at the outset. But this is to be sure a very11 peculiar situation. And I should also point out -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, in answer13 to the Chief's question, you know -- I mean, there have14 been a number of cases raising this extension versus15 nullification, and in every one of them the Court did16 make a choice. It didn't say well, we can't make any17 choice. Even in the one, which is18 Matthews v. Heckler -­19 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Court did make a21 choice then. It was the rare case where the Court22 equalized down. But I don't know any one of them -­23 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think that is24 ordinarily the case. But I -- but this is -- this is a25 difficult context, and just to go back with a49￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 complication from the remedial approach that the Chief2 Justice suggested. If the Court declared an expansion3 of citizenship, and if that was held to apply to4 everybody similarly situated, rather than just the5 Petitioner in this case, it would raise questions about6 whether Congress would have the freedom after such a7 declaration of a perhaps dramatic expansion of8 citizenship under the prior law, to remedy that with9 respect to people who for the -- following this Court's10 decision, at least the logic of the Court's decision11 would suggest that they were citizens, too.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there13 anything that rings a bell in this in your mind, of -- I14 mean, the thing that goes the other way is the right of15 an American citizen to pass his American citizenship on16 to his children. And when we talk about -- when we talk17 about Congress's power over naturalization, is there18 anything that's drawn a distinction between the general19 power, which are people who are not citizens to become20 citizens, but what it seems to me intuitively is a21 different situation, of the right to pass your22 citizenship on? Does that ring any bell at all?23 MR. KNEEDLER: There is no such right.24 And Wong Kim Ark -­25 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying there is50￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425such a right. I just wonder if it rings any bell at all that this has ever been discussed in anything you've come across.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Court'sdecision in -- in -- the dissenters in -- in Nguyen discussed this. But we think it's clear that under this -- under Wong Kim Ark and Rogers v. Bellei that -­ that that is equally an exercise of Congress's naturalization power which is subject to the same plenary standards -­JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Just looking -­ in trying to get your memory -- well, does something come to mind the opposite way that -- where the Court did go into a long exegesis about the law, including constitutional law, and then says at the end, well, but you are not entitled to memory -- to a remedy because of some other -­MR. KNEEDLER: If this is going back to remedy, I don't specifically.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Hubachek, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEKON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HUBACHEK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The rationale that the Solicitor General's51Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 office offers today is that further assumptions can be2 made that even after men do the things that the Court3 said were legitimately required of them, that they4 legitimate, that they have an opportunity to form a5 relationship with their child, that further gender-based6 assumptions should be put into place and say that, well,7 but you are not going to be the real father or you're8 not going to be the real parent. Whereas in the case of9 women we are going to assume that when they had have the10 nonmarital child they are going to be in charge and that11 when a father legitimates and does whatever is required12 wherever the child is born, we are going to assume that13 the mother is involved still. But the very facts of14 this case demonstrate that that's not the case. That in15 this case Petitioner's father raised him and16 Petitioner's mother was not involved in his growing up17 and he brought him to the United States -- I'm sorry, if18 I was getting a question. So it's basically piling19 further gender-related inferences on top of the ones20 that are already in place in order to serve to justify21 this distinction.22 Now, with respect to the Fiallo case, there23 is a tradition of allowing citizens to transmit24 citizenship. Fiallo involved getting aliens into the25 United States. There is no tradition that dates back to52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 1350 where citizens enjoyed rights to bring aliens into2 the United States, but it does date back to 1350 that3 you've been able to confer citizenship on your4 foreign-born children. So it is differently situated5 and it is differently situated in the very structure of6 the statute that we are talking about today. Congress7 very specifically eliminated the ability of courts to8 change the rules of naturalization of aliens. It9 basically used language very similar to the courts10 decision in Ginsberg and said that you can be11 naturalized under this provision and no other way. It12 didn't say that as to citizens as of birth. Citizens as13 of birth are treated differently. There is a14 severability clause in the statute, so that would apply15 to them and that brings into play all the various16 remedies that the Court has granted with the respect to17 extension over the years.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You referred -- I'm19 sorry, you refer to the tradition of passing -- do you20 agree with Mr. Kneedler that there is no such right?21 MR. HUBACHEK: I agree that the Constitution22 doesn't guarantee that right. Our point is that it's a23 traditional right and that Congress has always provided24 for it even in the period between 1802 and 1855 where25 the statute was strangely drafted and didn't provide for53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 it. This Court made clear in Montana v. Kennedy that2 when Congress remedied that situation it made that3 remedy retroactive. So basically we have an unbroken4 tradition dating back to 1350, that's why I think that5 this right should be treated differently than the6 questions of admissions of aliens in Fiallo. And,7 again, there is also Chadha Zadvydas that made clear8 that the Constitution limits the Congress's power even9 in the context of naturalization. And then with respect10 to the third-party standing issue, the Court has granted11 third-party standing to criminal defendants whose are12 raising third-party constitutional issues in their13 criminal cases, and the same analysis should apply here.14 We can still look at the right from the perspective of15 the Petitioner's father and if the Court grants a16 levelling down remedy, that would not remedy the17 situation the Petitioner's father would be in because18 both before and after the Court's decision the children19 of women, similarly situated women, would be citizens20 and Petitioner's father's son would not.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the criminal22 cases where there was -- where the defendant was23 permitted to raise -­24 MR. HUBACHEK: Campbell & Powers. Those are25 both cases where the criminal defendant asserted rights54￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of -- in one case it's a petit juror and another in the other case it was a grand juror, and there were discriminatory preemptory challenges in those cases, and the court allowed those criminal defendants to assert those constitutional rights.Several members of the court also found there was standing in Miller. Kowalski pointed out in Craig v. Boren that there is a very forgiving standard when third-party rights are at issue in the case.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
