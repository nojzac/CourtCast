THOMPSON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MS. THOMPSON:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:1011121314151617   proceeding.At stake -­               MS. THOMPSON:  In this case -­               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and a generic burglary               MS. THOMPSON:  Well, a generic burglary statute,3Alderson Reporting CompanyThis case involves the proper application of the categorical method of analysis that this Court prescribed in Taylor against United States, and it involves the application of that categorical method to what is described as ambiguous burglary convictions obtained under nongeneric burglary statutes with boiler plate complaints and a general finding of guilty following a plea18192021222324   statute?25JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you mean by a -- just so we get our terms defined, what do you mean by a nongeneric burglary statute -­1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   as -- as defined in the Taylor case is one that2 criminalizes unlawful entry into a building or a structure 3   with intent to commit another crime.  Those are the three 4   elements of generic burglary.  Those apply if any -- if a5 State statute covers those three, it's considered generic 6   burglary and would then qualify as a predicate violent 7   felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. 8             A nongeneric -­ 9             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, do you -- do you agree10   that all the papers showing the arrest and the11   investigation and so forth show that this was in fact a12   building -­1314151617   vehicle?18             MS. THOMPSON:  It doesn't show that19   vehicle.20             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Or a boat?21             MS. THOMPSON:  It doesn't show that22 boat.23             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Or a motorcycle?24             MS. THOMPSON:  It doesn't show that25   motorcycle.4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MS. THOMPSON: No.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that was burglarized? MS. THOMPSON: I do not. I -- as this -­ JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it show it was aitwasaitwasaitwasa￼ 1             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It shows nothing?  None of 2   the supporting documentation shows what it was? 3             MS. THOMPSON:  Those supporting documents do not 4   play a role in the adjudication. 5             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, that isn't my question. 6   I asked you whether any of them show that it was, in fact, 7   a building or a car or a boat. 8             MS. THOMPSON:  None of them shows that it was 9   anything other than a building.10             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Thank you.11             MS. THOMPSON:  The police reports and the12   complaint applications, but the statute -­13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why -- why are you14   resisting that the -- that the police report gave an15 identified building? I mean, you're -- you're saying that16   one mustn't look behind, in the case of a guilty plea, to17   find the police report or even the police application for18   complaint.  But there isn't any question, is there, that19   the police reports in fact gave addresses of particular20   buildings?21             MS. THOMPSON:  There is no question of that.22   When you look at the police reports, if you read those23   police reports, some of which you can actually read, they24   do describe buildings and they describe addresses and25   hallways and things like that.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼123456   Ginsburg.7          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what -- what you're sayingis the conviction itself didn't show that, and so thequestion is whether you can look to documents that in factshowed it.               MS. THOMPSON:  That's -- that's correct, Justice               MS. THOMPSON:  Well, actually the district court     established that this was not on the record at the time of12   the plea.  The district court took evidence on this issue.13 The statutes to -- that are underlying these convictions,14 to get back to Justice Scalia's question, are nongeneric,15   and they are nongeneric in the sense that they make it16 unlawful to break into structures other than buildings or17   in addition to buildings.18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose in the19   earlier conviction, the police report is in the court.20   It's not part of the record, and then the court says, I've21   read the police report.  Is that accurate?  And the client22   -- or the defendant says, yes.  Then later, can we go back89 10 11          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So the rule you would have usfollow does result in a -- a super technicality in a senseof what -- what was on the record at the time of the plea.23 24 25and look at the police report even though it was notannexed as part of the record?          MS. THOMPSON:  Well, that calls into question6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   what kinds of documents can be examined in terms of making 2   a -- a determination as to whether this offense was 3   categorically a crime of violence, that is, that it was 4   generic burglary.  It's our position that there's a 5   limitation, and the limitation is imposed by Taylor 6   itself, that the question being answered be made a 7   question of law, that it is a question of law, that it's a 8   matter of law that you make the determination. 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if the defendant at the10   plea colloquy had said, yes, I entered X building or even11   in the plea bargain had said that, even though the charge12 just read the boiler plate, the whole statute, buildings,13   vessels, et cetera, if he had admitted it either in the14   plea colloquy or in the plea bargain, wouldn't that be15 enough?1617 record of18 an actual19   that that would satisfy a sort of modified Taylor20   categorical approach.21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I don't understand your22   reading of Taylor.  As I've read that case many times, it23   seemed to me that that was making a perfectly sensible24   point.  At the end of the opinion, Justice Blackmun says,25   you know, there are some States like Massachusetts, for7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MS. THOMPSON:  If we had a contemporaneousthe adjudication of this conviction that showedadmission to breaking into a building, I believe￼1 example, that instead of just saying burglary, they say2 burglaryofa--ofashiporacarorabuilding. And 3   that leads us to answer a more general question.  Well, in4 context, that more general question is whether you ought 5   to go look into how a particular burglary was committed to 6   see if there was really violence or not.  And he says no. 7   Just look to the definition of the crime.  That's what he 8   says.  That will end it. 9             Now, he says we agree, because I started here,10   that we have a couple of States with some weird statutes,11 and what you have to do in those States is you won't know12 ifit'saboatoracaror--sohesays,forexample,in13 a State like the one we have, if it shows it's charged us14   with a burglary and you have to find out, you know, here's15 what you do. It says you may have to go beyond the mere16   fact of conviction.  So he says go look to the indictment17   or information and jury instructions.  That isn't a18   limiting phrase.  That's for example.  He just thought19202122   are no jury instructions because he pled guilty.  So23   what's the harm of going looking to the documents that24   will show, in an uncontested way, just what the address on25   these pieces of paper show?  There are no boats, you know,8Alderson Reporting Companythat in those cases, that's what -- all you'll have tolook to, for example.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005We happen to have an unusual case where there￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9in Watertown.  It's not a dock, I don't think, or at leastnot in that part of it.  So -- so I mean, what's theproblem here?          MS. THOMPSON:  Well, the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is everyone so mixed up?  Imust be missing something.MS. THOMPSON: The example that's given, the charging document and jury instructions -- let's suppose that instead of -- of guilty pleas, Mr. Shepard was tried and he was tried on this nongeneric, boiler plate complaint, and there were no jury instructions available.10111213   you I could imagine a case that could be a problem.  Maybe14   it was a houseboat.  Okay?JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the problem?  I grant15             (Laughter.)16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Or maybe it's like a trailer.17   So if we run into that case, we'll deal with it.  You18   know, I'm perfectly capable of thinking that if this is a19   charge where there is a dispute on the contested point,20   fine, we won't take that dispute into account, maybe21   decide it in the favor of the defendant, maybe.  But this22   is not that case.23             And by the way, if he's going to say, how do you24   know?  I'd say, I know.  I know Boston and I also know25   that breaking into a boat at least is unusual.  So if he9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   thinks it wasn't that, let him say so. 2             MS. THOMPSON:  The district court did actually 3   entertain this issue, Justice Breyer, and what they -­ 4   what the district court found was there wasn't an 5   opportunity, there wasn't a reason for Mr. Shepard to 6   contest building or any other element of this offense. 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, of course, there wasn't.8 So all he has to do now is say, Judge, in my latest thing, 9   you know, they say 30 Bremer Street.  30 Bremer Street10   sounds like the address of a building, but by the way,11   unusually enough, it's the license plate of a car.12             Now, if in fact that's the case, he can come in13 and say it. There's no Fifth Amendment problem. We're 14 talking about sentencing and what a prior conviction was. 15 He doesn't even have to say it. You as his lawyer could16171819202122   in fact?  What is it?23             MS. THOMPSON:  Is it in law --24             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.25 MS. THOMPSON: -- or in fact that we are trying10Alderson Reporting Companytell us.          Now, you know why I think you don't say it?Because it isn't conceivably right.          MS. THOMPSON:  Well, and it also isn't in fact.And the question here is --1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you mean it isn't right￼to make this determination?          JUSTICE BREYER:  We look to facts about what theprior convictions were about. That's what Taylor says. That, of course, is a fact, but it's a legal fact, what was this conviction for.          MS. THOMPSON:  Taylor said you don't look atfacts -­          MS. THOMPSON:  Because your reading of it1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112   requires a look at the underlying conduct.  It actually13   requires.  And the document here that was selected to14   exhibit the underlying conduct is as far away as you can15   get from an adjudicatory document.16             JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  What -- is -- is17   your argument that we are likely, in effect, to -- to18   violate some constitutional standard if we do what the19   Government wants, or is your argument as follows?  That20   Taylor says this is an offense-based not a fact-based21   determination.  Taylor says that's what the statute is22   getting at.  And if you go as far as the Government wants23 here, you basically will have gone beyond offense-based.24   You will have gone -- become fact-based and you will be25   violating the statute.11Alderson Reporting Company          JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand your reading ofit.  What I want to know is what's wrong with my readingof it.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9So my question is, is there something constitutionally we have to worry about which is the basis for your argument, or is it a violation of the statute that you think we ought to be worried about?MS. THOMPSON: In this case it's the statute that was violated, but you are correct, Justice Souter -- JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I don't have a position.I can't -­MS. THOMPSON: -- that -- no. You are correct in representing that the Government's approach to this will take what is quintessentially a question of law, that is, a comparison of adjudicated elements of -- adjudicated elements of conviction against -- compared to the elements1011121314   of generic burglary.  That's a question of law.  Do they15   match?  Do they not match?          It becomes a question of fact then, as the FirstCircuit put it in Shepard and in the Harris case, todetermine what was actually in the mind of the defendantat the time he entered his plea.161718192021   question in -- in any case?  The question ultimately is,22 what did he mean when he said I am guilty? If you've got23   a plea colloquy, as you admitted a moment ago, it's easy24   to find out what he meant because they would have gone25   into the factual basis for the plea.  If there's a written1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, aren't we asking that12Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1   plea agreement, it's probably going to be easy to find out 2   because, again, there would be a basis for the plea set3 out. 4             Here, there isn't one of those documents.  So5 you're going one step further, but you're still asking the 6   question what did he mean when he stood in that courtroom 7   and said I am guilty.  And yes, in -- in one sense that's8 fact-based, but all of those questions are fact-based. 9   They're going to the same issue.  What did he mean?  What10   was pleading guilty to?  Isn't that correct?111213141516171819202122232425MS. THOMPSON: Well, because it's based on an examination of the underlying conduct, which is forbidden by the Taylor decision -­          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, maybe, maybe not.That's kind of the question we have, how -- what gloss toput on Taylor.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -­          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do you join the amici insaying Almendarez-Torres has to be overruled?looking -­MS. THOMPSON:  No, I do not.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  No.MS. THOMPSON:  I do not join -­JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  All right.  So we're13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- Taylor were not on the 2   books.  What -- what would be the basis of your argument? 3   You say that it's all right to look at a plea colloquy, 4   but it's not all right to look at an arrest report to 5   which the judge referred.  What's the basis for that 6   distinction?  What sense does it make? 7             MS. THOMPSON:  The sense it makes it this.  What 8   the Armed Career Criminal Act addresses and what this 9   Court discussed in Taylor was the applicable term is10   conviction, that is, a conviction for a categorical11   offense.  The categorical offense is a crime of violence12 specifically described as burglary, arson, but there are13 specifically described crimes. Those are things that you14   can determine as a matter of law.  Do the elements match15   the -- the generically violent crime, or do they not match16   the generically violent crime?  If they do not match the17   generically violent crime, you might still be able to18   figure out, you might be able to surmise what the19   defendant actually had in his mind, if he had anything in20   his mind, about this at the time of the guilty plea.21             Well, one of the unique things about the -­22 these nongeneric burglary statutes in Massachusetts is23   that they're really relatively petty offenses.24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but why can you look at25   what's in the plea colloquy that's in the record, but you14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   cannot look at a document that the judge referred to, if 2   that document isn't there?  What's -- what's the common 3   sense argument that you're making?  I -- I don't 4   understand it. 5             MS. THOMPSON:  Well, there is no evidence in 6   this case that the judge referred to a police report. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  This is my little 8   hypothetical case so that we can test your theory, just to 9   see the reasons that you're advancing for -- for us to10   rule in your favor.  And I -- I don't see any rationale11   that you've given us.12             MS. THOMPSON:  If you can look at the colloquy13 and the judge, without incorporating it, has the defendant14 explicitly admit the facts that constitute the elements of15   generic burglary, it is our position that that -- that16   conviction could be used to enhance.  But --1718192021   findings at the first sentencing?  Why?  I still haven't22   had a reason why.23             MS. THOMPSON:  I agree that whether or not that24   document is in the record, if there is an explicit finding25   or an admission by the court that enters the judgment,15Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE BREYER:  Let me try the same question.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but why can't you goone step further and refer to the document that was not inthe record but that the judge mentioned in his -- in his1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 that the defendant broke and entered a building, that that2 conviction should be able to qualify as a predicate under 3   the Armed Career Criminal Act.  It is not a requirement4 that the underlying document be incorporated into the 5   record, only that the admission be made or the facts be 6   found by the fact-finder, whoever is taking the plea. 7             JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you a question? 8   Assume the case had been tried and you could not tell from 9   either the indictment or the instructions to the jury10   whether it was a generic burglary or a nongeneric11   burglary.  Would the -- our decision permit us to look at12131415161718192021   not involved in the adjudication at all.  So it -­22             JUSTICE STEVENS:  So this is even farther23   removed.24 MS. THOMPSON: This is even farther removed than 25 a plea colloquy, farther removed than a trial transcript16Alderson Reporting Companythe transcript of the trial to answer that question?          MS. THOMPSON:  Certainly not under Taylor.  Thewhole idea of Taylor was partly dictated by the words ofthe statute.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your argument is that thisis comparable to using the transcript of the trial.MS. THOMPSON: This is -- it -- well, I don't think it's comparable because the district court finding was that the documents that the Government relies on were1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   looking into the evidence -­ 2             JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's what I don't3 understand. We're now talking about that part of Taylor 4   which deals with a narrow statute where our object is not 5   to find out what he's guilty of or anything.  We're just 6   trying to find out what was the crime he was charged with. 7   And there are two or three States which lump together in 8   one statute crimes that are violent and nonviolent. 9   Burglary of a structure is violent.  Burglary of a car or10 ashipisnot. Soallwewanttoknowiswhatwasthe11   charge at issue.12             Now, do you -- let me break the question into13   two parts.  The key sentence here, I think, is for14 example, in a State whose burglary statutes include entry15   of an automobile, as well as a building, if the indictment16   or information and jury instructions show that the17   defendant was charged only with burglary of a building,18   then it's going to be violent.19             Now, would you -- would you agree with me or not20   that he could have written -- Justice Blackmun -- that21   same sentence to say if, for example, the indictment or22   information and jury instructions show?  Would you be23 24 25willing to add those two words, for example?          MS. THOMPSON:  If, for example.          JUSTICE BREYER:  If, for example.  I want to17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   know how -- how absolute you're making this.  If, for2   example.3 4 5 6 7 8 9          And the next question I'd ask would be if youagree for example, what are the things you can look to andwhat are the things you can't?          MS. THOMPSON:  And I -- I do agree that that'sone of the questions presented by this case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but do you want add thefor example or do you want to take it just categorically?          MS. THOMPSON:  Well, I do believe that the best10111213141516171819   kinds of things not?  All we're interested in is what wasreading is the categorical reading.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.example -­MS. THOMPSON:  But I'm willing to accept for          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then what kinds ofthings would you -­MS. THOMPSON:  -- for purposes of argument.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- let us look to and what202122232425   later.  Let me deal with the charge.  If he was charged18Alderson Reporting Companyhe charged with, which of these three things.          MS. THOMPSON:  And all Taylor and the ArmedCareer Criminal Act are interested in is what was heconvicted of.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  I will get that￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9with breaking into a boat, that's the end of this.  Okay?          MS. THOMPSON:  True.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, fine.  So I want to knowwhat he was charged with.  Let me do that one.          Now, what will you let me look to to see what hewas charged with?          MS. THOMPSON:  You can look to the chargingdocument and the statute to see what he was charged with.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So what happens inthe case where -- Justice Blackmun let us go further than1011   that.  He says the indictment -- that's the charging12 document -- or information and jury instruction. He'll13   let us look to a jury instruction as if there's actually14   been a trial.  So he'll let us go further than you will.15             MS. THOMPSON:  Not to determine what he was16   charged with.  To determine what he was convicted of.17   Because the jury instructions are not going to be18 factually oriented. The jury instructions are going to19   tell you what the element of the crime was, elements that20   were adjudicated.  So that if you have the person charged21 with a nongeneric document here -- the nongeneric statute,22   a boat, a house, a whatever, and the jury instructions23   establish for you that he could not have been convicted by24   that jury without finding a house because that's the25   elements laid out in the jury instruction -­1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000519Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          JUSTICE BREYER:  And what's the differencebetween that and a police report that makes it quite clearthat in the circumstances there was no possibility of aboat or a car being involved?  What's the differencebetween that and the police report?          MS. THOMPSON:  The police report does not showyou what the results of the adjudication was.  It does notestablish -­          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  What shows us that -- whatshows us that is --1011121314   sufficient facts.  You know, that's a check mark or it's15   on the form.  It says plea, guilty.  I mean, you know, you16   could have different things checked.  So that's what17   established the guilt.18             And then the police report establishes whether19 -- what kind of a thing was at issue. And I will agree20   with you that if it's at all contested, we shouldn't get21   into it.  But if it's not contested, there's no question.22   There was no boat around there.  It's a city street.  Or23   there was no car.  It's plain it was a building.  Then24   that's just as good as the jury instruction.  Why not?25   Tell me why not.20Alderson Reporting CompanyMS. THOMPSON:  The elements.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is the check mark.  No.  Thecheck mark on the form that says, for example, plea, admit1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MS. THOMPSON:  Well, I suggest that it doesn't2 tell you anything about what's actually been adjudicated. 3   What it tells you, it's what's actually been charged. 4             And here's one of the things that came up in the 5   district court in front of Judge Gertner, and the 6   Government brought up this as well as Judge -- as the 7   district court judge.  What if Mr. Shepard went in and 8   said, yes, I broke into the property of another person 9   with intent to commit a crime?  That would be a factual10   basis that would be adequate for the -- for any sentence11   that could be imposed under that statute.  Because the -­12   because of the fact that the boat, the house, the car, and13   the vessel are all put on the same level, the operative14   fact is is it yours, Mr. Shepard.  Does that belong to15161718   shows:  admitted, assault, you know.  And -- and what the19 sheet says, it says: charge, assault; plea, guilty. It's20   possible, for all we know, that when the actual colloquy21   took place, he was talking about some other thing.  I22   don't know what he was talking about, but what you'd go23   upon is that there was a charge and he pleaded guilty to24   the charge.25             MS. THOMPSON:  Which brings me to Henderson21Alderson Reporting Companyyou, Mr. Shepard?          JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, but that's always true.You could have a -- you could have a -- a sheet that1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9against Morgan. One of the issues in Henderson against Morgan is whether or not you can infer guilt of an element that is not specifically charged even from overwhelming evidence, that that could be proved.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I don't -- good.  Are yougoing to explain this?  Because I thought what we weresupposed to do is just look to the sheet, charge; theplea, guilty.  And that is what we do and it disposes of98 percent of the cases.1011121314   percent that are nongeneric burglary.  And in those 215   percent that are nongeneric burglary, the issue that is16   raised, by the fact that it's nongeneric burglary, is you17   can't make a determination based on the face of the record18   of what was actually adjudicated, that this person was19 actually found guilty of each element of generic burglary.20   And when you cannot make that determination from record21   documents and contemporaneous documents with the22 adjudication, then you cannot make that determination23   under the Armed Career Criminal Act.24             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why can't you make the25   determination?  Isn't the -- the problem that your22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MS. THOMPSON:  It does.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- so are youtalking about those 98 percent now?MS. THOMPSON:  I'm talking about the -- the 2￼ 1   determination may not be as reliable? 2             And I thought ultimately your argument would 3   boil down to saying this.  The reason you will accept the 4   plea colloquy or the plea agreement, if it sets out the 5   facts, is that that is very reliable.  It is a reliable 6   indication of what he was pleading guilty to and what the 7   court was finding him guilty of.  But once you go beyond8 that and you start looking into police reports appended to9 complaints or whatnot, you're getting into an area of less10   reliability, and when we're dealing with sentence11 enhancements like this, we better be reliable. That's why12   the statute based it on -- on offense rather than facts.13 Don't get into a factual determination that is unreliable.14   I thought that was your argument ultimately.15             MS. THOMPSON:  That -- that is part of the16   argument, and I -- I think that we're just using different17   terms here.  You're using offense, and -- and the Taylor18   court and the -- and the Armed Career Criminal Act use19   conviction.202122232425   documents.JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I'll accept that, yes.MS. THOMPSON: Okay. And so when you're talking about a conviction, you're talking about something that has already been established, that you should be able to make a determination by looking at the contemporaneous1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000523Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you -- you still haven't2 given a reason, other than the one Justice Souter accepts. 3   Look it.  This is a case where we all know what the truth 4   is, but you want to argue that we shouldn't find that out.5 And it seems to me you have to give us a rationale for we 6   shouldn't know the truth here.  You -- you don't want us 7   to find it, and there must be some reasons for that.  And 8   the law does that once in a while.  We all know that9 something happened, but the law is supposed to pretend it10   didn't.  That's why Justice has a blindfold on.  I -- I11   know that.  But you haven't given me one reason yet why I12   should adopt your theory.13             MS. THOMPSON:  Well, the theory that I'm14   proposing is -- is I believe the theory that's already15   been adopted by this Court, which is the -- the one16 described in Taylor. It's the categorical approach that17 says you cannot make a determination of what elements were18   adjudicated by looking at the underlying conduct.19             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But why is a categorical20   determination important?  I threw you a -- a bone a second21222324   that it?  Is that your point?25             MS. THOMPSON:  It is reliable and it's also not24Alderson Reporting Companyago, and I said maybe it's because of -­          MS. THOMPSON:  It's -­1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- a reliability concern.  Is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9fact-based.  Once you start to -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but is -- is your pointthat once you get beyond the documents that you admit wecan look at, there is a higher -- an -- an unacceptablyhigh risk of unreliability?  Is that your argument?MS. THOMPSON: That is one of my arguments, Justice Souter, and the -- and there's something that goes hand in glove with that and did in this case. The burden shifts then to the defendant. The burden shifts to the defendant to prove that he was not convicted of generic burglary, and that -­10111213141516   follow from -- from looking at a police report.  It may17   well be that we would say the burden never shifts, and he18   is simply in the position of any other party to a case.19 If -- if the other side has put in evidence that is -- is20   against his interest and he does nothing, then he's in21   trouble.  But that isn't the same as shifting the burden.22             MS. THOMPSON:  Well, it -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, but that -- that doesn'tnecessarily follow.MS. THOMPSON:  -- assignment -­JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that doesn't necessarily23             JUSTICE SOUTER:  There's no -- I guess all I'm24   saying is it doesn't follow from the argument that the25 Government is making that a burden of persuasion shifts.25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9111213141516171819202122232425Isn't that correct?          MS. THOMPSON:  What shifts is the risk of beingwrong. The shifts -- the risk of being wrong right now is on the Government. If the Government cannot establish that the defendant was convicted of generic burglary, it bears that responsibility. If the defendant cannot establish that back when he entered his plea -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the Government -­               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Thompson, you know your10   white light is on.  So if you want to save time, youshould perhaps do so right now.          MS. THOMPSON:  I would.  Thank you very much.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Elwood.the Court:    ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. ELWOOD:  Justice Stevens, and may it please          When a defendant has been convicted under aState statute that prohibits both burglary of a buildingand burglary of a car or some other item, the Court canstill look to the conviction to determine whether it is anArmed Career Criminal Act predicate when, as here, thepolice report indicates the defendant was arrested forburglarizing a building rather than a ship or a car andthe other documents in the file corroborate that the basis26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9for the plea was the crime outlined in the police report.          Because two of the three elements of genericburglary -- that is, breaking and entering and intent tocommit a crime -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?Suppose the police report had been ambiguous and referredto both a boat and a house.  What would -- could -- wouldit be -- what would you do in that case?          MR. ELWOOD:  I think in a case where the policereport was ambiguous about what it is that the personbroke into, I think that you could not base theenhancement on that.  We are asking only when both thepolice report is unambiguous and the documents recordingthe guilty plea suggest -­          MR. ELWOOD:  I think you might be able to -­1011121314151617181920212223   Government?24             MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think that you could talk25   about introducing extrinsic evidence of -- of that sort.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But why -- why couldn't youuse it in the other case?  Couldn't you ask the policeofficer what he -- who conducted the investigation whatthe facts really were?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you'd start out with thepremise that 90 percent of these cases are really housesanyway, so there's a strong presumption in favor of the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000527Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   itself. 9             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, suppose that it was an10   assault and battery, for example, and you're trying to11   decide whether it was violent or not, and the police12 report was somewhat ambiguous. Could you -- you couldn't13   look at it then.14             MR. ELWOOD:  No, and I don't think you could for15   an additional reason, which is that I don't think assault16   and battery is necessarily a -- is a necessary element of17   the -- of -- of -- I'm sorry.18             JUSTICE STEVENS:  There's a distinction between19   violent assaults and -­We're not asking the Court to go that far, and I think inthe run-up cases -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So the -- the question in thiscase is whether a police report is extrinsic evidence,isn't it?          MR. ELWOOD:  I don't think so in this casebecause the police report is in -- in a police file2021222324   which one25   Everybody knows most burglaries are -- are of houses.  But28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. ELWOOD:  Right, violent and nonviolent.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- nonviolent assaults.MR. ELWOOD:  Exactly right.JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you might want to find outit was and -- and as here, it seems pretty easy.￼ 1   I'm just wondering if we're not trying to find out what 2   the categorical rule is that -- that is at stake here. 3             MR. ELWOOD:  The only rule we are advocating is 4   that when we are talking about a necessary element of the5 offense that can be satisfied in different ways, that you 6   can look to the police report to indicate which way it was 7   met in this case if the rest of the file, the State court8 file, indicates that the police report was the -- provided 9   the factual basis or provided the basis for the10   conviction.11             And I think if you look at the file in this12   case, for example, for four of the defendant's -­13             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, you say it provided the14   basis for the conviction.  Was it presented to the court15   in each of these cases?16             MR. ELWOOD:  We believe that the record17   indicates that it was.  For four of the defendant's18   convictions, if you look at the document that records the19   guilty plea, it -- it says -- in addition to the notation20   of guilty, and as Justice Breyer averred, a check of admit21   sufficient facts or that there are sufficient facts22   present, it lists the same date of the offense, the same23 street address, the same arresting officer, and the same24   victim.  And it is our submission that that implies25   certainly very strongly -- it supports a very strong29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   inference -- that the crime of conviction was the very 2   same crime that is described in the police report. 3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought Judge Gertner said 4   she didn't know whether anybody had seen this police 5   report.  It wasn't attached to the charge.  I thought that6 was her position, that these are untested documents. We 7   don't know one way or another whether the judge that 8   accepted the plea had seen them. 9             MR. ELWOOD:  To begin with, Judge Gertner looked10   only to -- she didn't draw any inference based on the11 document recording the guilty plea and what happened. She12   looked only to the direct evidence of what happened in the13   colloquy, i.e., the petitioner's affidavit.14             But even more than that, her only finding was15   that the police report, as a police report, was not16   introduced at the plea colloquy.  It wasn't marked as an17   exhibit.  It wasn't attached to anything.  It wasn't18   introduced as that.  I don't think that's inconsistent19   with the idea that as is often the case and is probably20 usually the case, that the police report was synopsized by21   the prosecutor and -- and read at court, which would22 explain why the offense of conviction has the same offense23 date, same street address, same victim, same arresting24   officer.25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we don't have any30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   colloquy.  We don't know what happened at the -- you're2 saying it's -- it's altogether likely that that happened, 3   but we don't know. 4             MR. ELWOOD:  But we do know that under5 Massachusetts State law, that there -- before a court can 6   accept a guilty plea, there has to be a factual basis in 7   the record.  There have to be facts in the record to 8   support every element of the offense. 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the defendant says,10   yes, I plead guilty to this crime and the crime is11 described as ship, vessel, car, building, and that's -- if12   that's all that happened is the boiler plate charge that13   just repeats the statute and the defendant says, yes, I14   did that, but nothing tells us did what, other than15   violate the statute.16             MR. ELWOOD:  The requirement -- the factual17 basis requirement requires a statement of the facts, not a18 statement of the legal conclusion, and simply reading the19   charging document as a legal conclusion about what it -­20   about a boat, building, et cetera was broken into.  What21 it requires is a narrative description of the underlying22   conduct so that the judge can satisfy him or herself to23   what the defendant is pleading guilty to is actually a24   crime.  If he just says, I agree with the charging25   document, if the underlying facts were he broke into a31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   grocery cart or a -- a refrigerator shipping box or2 something, it might not satisfy the elements of the crime. 3             JUSTICE STEVENS:  But couldn't the judge in that 4   colloquy have said to him, did you break into a building, 5   a car, or a boat?  And he would have said yes, and 6   wouldn't that have satisfied the element of the crime? 7             MR. ELWOOD:  I don't -- I don't think it would8 have satisfied the factual basis requirement in that there 9   has to be a narrative description of what the defendant10 did, like he showed up at that day and he broke into 25811   Norwell Street.  And I have yet to find a Massachusetts12131415   of the colloquy at the plea?  Is that it?23 24 25          MR. ELWOOD:  Yes, whether there's reliablerecord evidence that is reliable in describing what theoffense was that was the subject of the plea colloquy.32Alderson Reporting Companycase where a -- a guilty plea was accepted based onbasically just a recitation of the charging document -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, there's no record hereMR. ELWOOD: No. There's -- there's no facts -­ there's no -- as is the case often in guilty pleas, which are not challenged on appeal, no colloquy was ever prepared and apparently the tape recording was destroyed.161718192021   not there's reliable record evidence?  Is that -- that the22   test?1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your test is whether or￼ 1   And in this case, we believe it is met both because the2 police report is unambiguous, as several of the members of 3   the Court have averred to, and that the documents4 recording the guilty plea I think very clearly indicate 5   that the thing that was at issue was the crime described 6   in the police report. 7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does it -- does the plea refer 8   to the police report? 9             MR. ELWOOD:  No, it does not.  It doesn't in so10   many words refer to the police report, but it refers to -­11   it -- it, I think, unambiguously describes the crimes12   described in the police report and that it involves, as I13   said, the same date, the same street address, the same14   victim, and the same arresting officer.15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Where do you draw the line?16 Is there some -- I -- I take it that you say certainly if17   the plea colloquy or the -- or the judge's guilt18 determination refers to the police report, then the police19   report comes in.  Suppose there's no reference to the202122232425police report.          MR. ELWOOD:  I think that --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can we still go find thepolice report and then where do we stop?          MR. ELWOOD:  I think that if there's noreference to the police report and if the police report is33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   not in the State court file, which it was in this case -­2   the court indicated it was in the State court file -- I -­3   I think that you would probably have to have a stronger4   showing in order to say, well, he pleaded guilty to the5   police report such as a -- a reference to the police6   report or more of an indication on the guilty plea form, a7   notation of -- of what was entered or -­8JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you mentioned -­MR. ELWOOD:  -- something that unambiguouslythe police report provided the factual basis for910 indicated11 the plea.1213   file.  Is -- is the rule whatever is in the State file,14   even if there's no reference to it?  You had -- you had15   two variables:  one that there was reference to it; and16   two, that it was in State file.  Suppose there's no17   reference, but it is in the State file.  What -- I'm -­18   I'm not sure what rule you would draw?19 MR. ELWOOD: The -- if -- I -- I think that20   there has to be both an -- that the police report is21   unambiguous and that there is reason to believe or that it22   is more likely than not that the police report provided23   the factual basis for the plea, and if it's -- if there's24   no reference to it in so many words, I think the same25 could be said this -- that the same could be said here in34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you mentioned the State￼ 1   this case.  It doesn't say we look to the police report. 2   You just draw that inference from the fact that the crime 3   described looks like the crime described in the police4 report. 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is your -- what rule 6   would you have here?  The question is, was he convicted of 7   a crime of violence?  98 percent of the cases, all you 8   have to do is look to the crime charged, burglary, and the 9   fact that he was convicted.  He pleaded guilty or didn't.10             But there are these two -- three States I guess11   that lump together in one code provision for breaking and12 entering into a ship or a car or a house. So now we've13 got to know which of the three it is. If they go to14 trial, it's easy. Just look to the jury instructions. If 15 they plead guilty, I guess your opponents would say that's 16 the end of it. You can't use it because we don't ever17   know from the charge itself which of the three it was that18 was at issue. Was a house at issue? Was a car at issue?19 Was a boat at issue? Now, you're going to say, but do a20   little investigating to find out what was at issue.  Look21   at the police report.  Is your view look at anything aslong as it's uncontested and clear?          Their argument is no matter what you look into,22232425   find I think Justice Souter's point.  It's going to beonce you go beyond that charging document, you're going to1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000535Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ambiguous sometimes.  You get into facts of thingshappened years ago.  It's just not worth it.MR. ELWOOD: I think our argument -- or the -­ the proposition that we are arguing for today is that when the documents and the State court file indicate that the defendant was arrested for only burglary of a building and there's no question that it wasn't a ship or a vehicle, that it will support the ACCA -­          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but we're still going tohave to write something.          MR. ELWOOD:  Correct.  When -­          JUSTICE BREYER:  And what I want to know iswhat's your rule.          MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  When the other documents inthe file indicate that it is more likely than not that thepolice report or that that description of events served asthe basis for the guilty plea.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so we -- are we going to decide -- decide a lot of probate cases about incorporation by reference in wills and stuff?          MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think -­          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know what we'resupposed to do.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. ELWOOD: I think that36Alderson Reporting Companyin this case it just￼ 1   -- I don't think the Court really has to get to the outer 2   reaches of this because in many of these cases, it's 3   overwhelming -­ 4             JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if we don't get to the 5   outer reaches, the next case I suppose will involve a -­ 6   an application for a search warrant or an arrest warrant 7   which describes facts and pretty well tells you what 8   really happened.  Could you rely on that? 9             MR. ELWOOD:  No.  Because the -- the important10 thing is not just describing what actually happened, but11   what -- what happened on the day the guilty plea was12   taken.  And that is where the documents that record the13   plea I think come in to show -­14             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, the police report wasn't15   made on that date.  The police report was prepared16171819202122232425earlier, I assume.          MR. ELWOOD:  The police report was preparedearlier, but when the crime -- when they wrote downguilty, the offense he was guilty of is breaking into acertain address at a certain day, belonging to a certainvictim, and involving the same arresting officer.  And webelieve that -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if it's that -- if it'sthat explicit, I don't think you need the police report.          MR. ELWOOD:  Well, perhaps because you can refer37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   to the police report. 2             JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seems to me we're dealing3 with a case in which the court documents are sufficiently 4   ambiguous that you have to look to something else.  Then 5   the question is what other things may you look to, and you 6   say we can look to police reports.  I say why not look at7 warrant applications or maybe the prosecutor's notes, or8 there could be other equally reliable documents available, 9   it would seem to me, that would -- which establish the10 facts. 11          MR. ELWOOD:  I think that you really only haveto look at -- the -- the fact that these are present inthe court's files and the fact that -­121314151617   files.  The court said they were present in the court's18   files.  They just said they didn't become part of the plea19   colloquy because of --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I thought the police reportswere not present in the court -­MR. ELWOOD:  They are present in the court's20             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, the -- the warrant21   affidavit is going to be present in the files.  It's -­22   it's returned.  It's -- it's normally filed with -- with23 24 25the other papers in the case.          MR. ELWOOD:  I think, though, that there's -­there would be no particular reason to believe that the38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   warrant application had been -- had served as the basis2 for the guilty plea. I mean, if you had some sort of -­ 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why -- why not?  I -- I mean, 4   are we going to imagine an entirely different case out of 5   the blue from the one that's disclosed in -- in the 6   warrant application?  It seems to me that there's a -- a 7   relatively high degree of probability there.8 MR. ELWOOD: If -- I -- I think that if the9 documents recording the guilty plea indicate that the -­10   that the crime described is the crime described in the11 warrant application, you probably could look at that if -­12   to determine if it was a boat or a building or -­13             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, let's say the warrant14   application says, you know, we're looking for a stolen15   radio and the charge does indicate that he was -- that -­16   that the -- that the property taken in the burglary was a17   -- was -- was a radio.  Wouldn't that be a basis for18 saying, okay, the warrant application probably discloses19 whatwasgoingonhere? If--ifthe--ifitwasaradio20 on the warrant application, a radio in the burglary charge21   to which he did plead guilty, probably it's the radio at22 the address indicated in the warrant application. Isn't23   that a fair inference?24             MR. ELWOOD:  Perhaps.  The -- the whole thing25 about the warrant application, though, strikes me as -- as39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 a little bit more attenuated, though, also because it's 2   done in advance of the police arriving on the scene and3 discovering what's going on whereas the police report -­ 4             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it may be done in advance5 by--youknow,by--byacoupleofhoursfromthe--the 6   police going in -­ 7             MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  But still it's -- it's done 8   beforehand as opposed to done after the crime has been 9   investigated.10             JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what about the -- the11   police officer -- what -- what if we don't have a document12   of any sort but the -- the State calls the police officer13   who, in fact, made the application for the -- the issuance14   of the complaint and he says, when I appeared to ask for15   the issuance of the complaint, I testified to, I swore to16 the following facts? I.e, that it was a house at such and 17 such Shaw Street. That gives you your contemporaneity18 element. Why not accept that?19 MR. ELWOOD: I think that under a sort of a -­ 20 theoretically that's a -- that is a theoretical21 possibility, Justice Souter. I don't think that would22   happen a lot in actual practice because the sort of people23 who are prosecutional witnesses have a sufficient caseload24   that they're just never going to have in a -- a actual25   recollection of specific events.  And I can represent to40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the Court that -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  They have notes.  But thepolice all have little notebooks. That's what they use in trial day in and day out. So it seems to me that -- that if -- if contemporaneity is the -- is -- is -- or rough contemporaneity is -- is the criterion, then on your theory we ought to get into testimonial evidence.          MR. ELWOOD:  It's -- it's both contemporaneity,if I've said that correctly, but I think also a -- areason to infer that it provided the basis for the plea -­for the plea colloquy, which it is in this case because -­1011121314151617181920212223   basis before the court can accept a guilty plea.  And I24   think we can -- under the presumption of regularity that25 attaches to guilty pleas, you can presume that occurred.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, I guess you would becontent with just relying on whatever was disclosed at theplea colloquy in court.          MR. ELWOOD:  That's correct.  And -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you would take -- you would make the assumption, apparently, that on that occasion the elements, the factual basis for the plea would have been disclosed. But unfortunately, the record has been destroyed.          MR. ELWOOD:  It has been destroyed, butMassachusetts State law requires that there be a factual1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000541Alderson Reporting Company￼1             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  You can just presume that the2   proceeding was regular and it was disclosed.  Is that3   right?45 6 7 8 9          Is -- under Massachusetts law is there anydifference in the penalty at all for burglary of a houseversus a motorcycle versus a car versus a vessel?141516171819202122232425MR. ELWOOD:  I don't think it -­JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know what I'm supposed          MR. ELWOOD:  No, there isn't.  They're allpunished the same.  So it's not as though this was a -- alesser included or anything like that.10111213   trial court?  I -- I'd like to know what --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you want us to write theopinion that we can presume that what's in the Stateinvestigative files and records was likely before theto write.          MR. ELWOOD:  That when the -- basically when thepolice report is unambiguous and when the documents in theState court file indicate that the basis for the guiltyplea was the crime described in the police report, thatyou can infer that the factual basis for the plea, whichis required under Massachusetts law, was in fact thebreaking into a building as opposed to a ship or avehicle and so forth.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Elwood, can I tell you42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   what's troubling me about that?  Maybe the whole 2   categorical approach is unwise.  It may have been more 3   strict than it should be.  But it -- I'm puzzled by the 4   notion that in a case that's been tried to verdict, you 5   can only look at the indictment and the instructions, as I6 understand Justice Blackmun's opinion. You could not look 7   at the testimony in the record, even though there are nine 8   witnesses who described what happened.  It seems to me 9   that might be much more reliable than a police report.10   And I'm just wondering am I correct, do you think, on11   saying you cannot look at the testimony in the tried case?12 And if so, how do you -- how do you say that police13   reports are better than sworn witnesses?14 MR. ELWOOD: I think to me it's not 100 percent15   clear whether when Taylor referred to the jury16 instructions and the charging documents, that that was17   exhaustive of the jury trial conflict.18             JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's a for example thing.19             MR. ELWOOD:  Right.  It could be something else.20             But I think that if you were going -- it's still21   possible to draw the distinction based on an22 administrability factor, which is the way many courts have23 looked at it, which is you don't want to have to have the24   court look back to transcripts of the whole thing versus25   -- for the whole trial, whereas if they can look at a43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   discrete body of documents and say yes, this guy pleaded 2   guilty to burglary of a building, that you can reach that 3   conclusion.  It's a line of administrability, not a -- a 4   line of testimony with the documents. 5             JUSTICE STEVENS:  The thing I'm just questioning 6   is whether this rule that you -- you're advocating is7 really more administrable than one that just says it seems 8   crazy in this particular case.  But -- but in the interest9 of having a categorical administrative rule, we'll simply10 say whatever the public record shows and the proceedings11   themselves.12             MR. ELWOOD:  I think that it has proven13   administrable.  And it -- it -- I think that the majority14   of courts allow you to look at court documents in order to15   determine what was -- what sort of offense was at issue16   and -- and that --17             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  How should we interpret18   Taylor?  Do you -- do you agree with the interpretation19202122   literally, I mean, they only discussed jury trials.  But23 every court with criminal jurisdiction, every court of24 appeals with criminal jurisdiction, has concluded that it25   includes guilty pleas.  And so I think it -- it does make44Alderson Reporting Companysuggested this morning by Justice Breyer, for example?          MR. ELWOOD:  I think it's definitely should beinterpreted to include guilty pleas because taking Taylor1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   sense.  I don't think that the Court would have in such a2 short section of the opinion have exhaustively addressed3 the entire scope of factual situations, and I don't think4 it would have addressed the circumstance under which most5 guilty pleas -- or rather, under which most convictions 6   are obtained -­ 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then -- but reading it 8   that way, which is arguable, this case, but reading it 9   that way, you'd say you can look -- what we're interested10   in is not what happened.  We are interested in what kind11   of a crime was at issue.  And where it's difficult to12   decide what crime is at issue, you can look to whatever13   official documents are there at the time, any court14 records, to make that determination, but there -- if there15   is any indication that they're -- they're contested, if16   there's any dispute as to what was at issue, then you17   can't count it.  Then it doesn't count.  What about that18   as a rule?1920   rule.  I mean, basically our rule -­21             JUSTICE BREYER:  So you'd say there's -- you can22   look to what Justice Stevens says.  You can look to what23   is official in that record that seems to have indication24   of reliability, and if there is any indication at all that25   this was a matter in dispute, you can't count the45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think that is a sensible￼ 1   conviction.  That would be the rule. 2             MR. ELWOOD:  I -- I think that would be a 3   sensible rule.  And in this case, as -- as we indicated,4 not only are the police reports unambiguous, but there's a 5   very strong reason to believe that they were the basis for 6   the guilty plea as it was obtained on that day. 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Elwood, we had a case 8   last term involving a search warrant, Groh against 9   Ramirez, and it -- it was very clear that the application10 for the warrant identified specifically what the police11   were to search for, but the warrant itself didn't.  And12   this Court held you couldn't look behind that blank13   warrant for the particulars that were revealed in the14   warrant application.  And I suppose this is similar in the15   sense that we have the conviction and you're saying, but16   you can look behind that conviction to something that, we17   don't know, may or may not have been before the court.18             MR. ELWOOD:  As I recall Groh, that case19   specifically turned on the fact that the face of the20 Fourth Amendment requires that the warrant describe, not21   that the supporting documents describe, the place to be22   searched and the items to be seized.  And I think in this23   case we already know it's okay to look behind convictions24   because Taylor itself says so.  The only question is what25   items are acceptable, and -­46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Taylor -- Taylor2 doesn't quite have this full for example because there's3 another paragraph following the for example paragraph 4   which says we hold an offense constitutes burglary for5 purposes of 924(e) if either the statutory definition6 corresponds to generic burglary, which it doesn't here, or 7   the charging paper, which it doesn't here, and jury8 instructions, which the judge tells the jury you must find 9   this in order to convict.  Those are not for examples.10   That paragraph says you've got three things you can look11   to.  You can look to the statutory definition.  You can12   look to the charging paper, and you can look to the jury13   instruction.  And that's it.14             MR. ELWOOD:  I think, though, that in the15   context that -- that is, if you're going to include guilty16   pleas at all for these sort of straddle offenses that -­17   that some of the conduct is generic burglary and some18   isn't, that if Taylor is accepted on face value, where it19   isn't an example, then it -- it basically would mean that,20   sub silentio, the -- the Court had held that guilty pleas21   could not be used at all for this sort of inquiry under22   the Armed Career Criminal Act, which I think would be23   extraordinarily or -- or it would definitely limit at24   least the utility of the ACCA as an act punishing25 recidivism because the vast majority of convictions are47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9obtained through criminal -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but aren't the vastmajority of guilty pleas unambiguous?  This is a ratherrare case.MR. ELWOOD: But if the -- I don't think -- I think that whenever there is a straddle crime and that the charging document is -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, whenever straddle crimes,but -- but they're the exception rather than the rule.          MR. ELWOOD:  That is probably the case.  I knowthat there are something like 28 States that have them.101112131415161718192021222324 that that was one example that the Court meant. It is, 25 after all, a fairly abbreviated discussion that wasn't          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But even burglary I think inmost States would be clear.MR. ELWOOD: There -- there are many States that -- that have offenses that include both generic and nongeneric burglary, although I think that it's probably true that most -- most burglary statutes are either generic or nongeneric, not sort of straddled like that. But in any event, I think it would significantly limit the utility of the ACCA.          And in addition, every court of appeals withcriminal jurisdiction has held that that's not what itmeans, that it does mean, as Justice Breyer indicated,1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000548Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1   briefed by the parties in the case, and I don't think that 2   the Court should read it so expansively based on 3   relatively ambiguous language. 4             If there are no further questions from the 5   Court, we'll rely on our submission. 6             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Elwood. 7             Ms. Thompson, you have a little over 3 minutes. 8             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA J. THOMPSON 9                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER10             MS. THOMPSON:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.11             First, I would like to point out that the Armed12   Career Criminal Act does not punish all recidivism.  It is13 designed to punish the people who have prior convictions14   for those offenses falling -- falling within the15 categories. So it's not designed to punish all16 recidivism.17 Massachusetts does have generic burglary18 statutes. These statutes that are at issue here are not 19 among them. But for the serious forms of burglary, such 20 as home invasion, Massachusetts punishes those under21 generic burglary statutes. So those do exist.22232425   to the face of the complaint.  And as you look at the49Alderson Reporting Company          With regard to the record that the Court canlook at in making this determination, it was significantin the district court that Judge Gertner was not pointed1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   complaints that are shown in the third appendix in this 2   case, there is -- there are dates listed at the bottom.3 The entries in those docket sheets were made at different 4   times, not all made at the time of a guilty plea.  The5 Government did not present any evidence to help the court6 understand anything about the way the dockets were made 7   and the entries were made when a guilty plea was taken in 8   the district court. 9             The third thing of interest is, as Judge Gertner10 found, there was no reason for a contemporaneous contest11   of the evidence -- of the material in the police report12   because the police report was not part of the plea13 proceeding. So what happens is the district court that's14   faced with the sentencing issue now has to make the15   determination, can I now look and see whether there was16   some contest years ago when the guilty plea was entered17   without the aid of a contemporaneous record of18   adjudication.19202122   the ambit of the Armed Career Criminal Act.  Taylor was a23   guilty plea itself.  That case was a guilty plea -- is24   that where you have a nongeneric statute and you have a25   conviction by a guilty plea, that the court can look at a50Alderson Reporting Company          And what Mr. Shepard's position is, as to whatthe -- the rule should be, is that where -- and we don'tcontest even remotely that guilty pleas don't fall under1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425charging document and a contemporaneous formal record ofadjudication, not simply anything that's found in thecourt file, and that must establish, based on thatexamination, that the defendant was necessarily foundguilty of all the elements of generic burglary either byhis own admission or by a finding by the judge.          Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Ms. Thompson.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:54 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000551Alderson Reporting Company
