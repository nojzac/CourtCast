BENEDON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. BENEDON:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          The question -- excuse me.  The questionpresented should be answered with the following bright101112   line rule:  Imposition of vicarious liability under the13   FHA should be determined by application of established14   rules of corporate and agency law not criteria unique to15   the FHA.  Under these principles, corporate shareholders16   and officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of17   the other agents of the corporation.18             The Ninth Circuit held that a different rule19   should apply under the FHA, that vicarious liability could20   be based on control alone.  That is not, nor should it be,21 the law.22             While the starting -- the starting point for the23   analysis is necessarily the statute itself, while Congress24   has authority to expand the class of persons liable for25   violation of a Federal law, when it has done so, it has￼4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   done so expressly.  The FHA was never -- which neither 2   defines nor expands the class of persons liable under the 3   act, and as this Court stated in Bestfoods, this silence 4   is dispositive. 5             Specifically, Congress has spoken directly when 6   it has wished to impose a control test.  For example -- 7             QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose that I were to 8   agree with you and the Court were to agree with you as to 9   your criticism of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and -- and10   that it agreed with you too that general principles of11   agency and corporate liability apply.  Based on thisrecord, could we go on to say that under California lawand real estate law generally, the real estate salesman isthe agent of the broker, and therefore the broker isliable under agency law?12131415161718   have to remand before we did that?  Because this is19   discussed in the -- in the respondents' brief, and the20   respondent makes it quite clear.  And maybe you disagree,21   but the -- the law is cited on page 15 of the red brief,22   that under California law, the broker is the principal.23   And I take it the principal would be liable under￼MR. BENEDON:  The answer --QUESTION:  Or -- or would I have to -- would we24   respondeat superior in this case.25             MR. BENEDON:  Correct, Your Honor.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   a corporate broker and an individual broker.  Mr. Meyer in10   this case is a corporate officer who holds a broker's11   license solely as the officer of the corporation.  The12   corporation is the employer of the agent.  The agent13   operates under the license held by the corporation.14             QUESTION:  But isn't it fair to say that -- or15   isn't it?  Maybe you'll take issue with this, that the16   corporation operates as a broker only because it has the17   individual's broker license assigned to it.18             MR. BENEDON:  It has to, Your Honor.19   A corporation as a paper person needs human beings to20   fulfill the function that a corporation must do, as does21   any corporation.  There will always be supervising22   officers --23             QUESTION:  Is -- is there any California law24   saying that -- that the corporation is the principal in a25   situation like this and not the holder of the -- not6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  If -- if we find who the principalis, we know the principal is going to be liable.MR. BENEDON:  That's where --          QUESTION:  Under California law the broker isthe principal.          MR. BENEDON:  My -- Your Honor, my answer tothat is -- is several-fold.First, the distinction needs to be made between￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911             QUESTION:  Yes.  That's what I'm talking about.12             MR. BENEDON:  But not the designated13   officer/broker.               QUESTION:  So --the -- not the named broker?          MR. BENEDON:  The named broker, again -- toanswer your question, no, not that I'm aware of.          QUESTION:  This -- this is a --          QUESTION:  Let me ask the opposite.  Is thereany California case in which the named broker in thecorporation has been held liable as the principal solelybecause he's the named broker?               MR. BENEDON:  Not the designated officer, Your10   Honor.  The corporation has been held liable.1415161718192021   corporate name?  Are those different certificates?22             MR. BENEDON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  There are23   separate licenses issued by the Department of Real Estate24   in California:  one to individuals who act as brokers, and25   one to individuals who are brokers only in their capacity          QUESTION:  Is there a difference in thelicenses, the individual license that Justice Kennedy wasreferring to and that's mentioned on page 15 of the redbrief, the individual broker license and the statementthat the individual broker licensee is vicariouslyliable and the broker who holds the license under the￼7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   as officers of a corporation.  Those are separate 2   licenses. 3             The only license in this cases was held by 4   Mr. Meyer as an officer of the corporation.  He could not 5   step outside the corporation and act as a broker.  His 6   existence as a broker depended on the corporation.  He 7   could not transact -- 8             QUESTION:  May I ask you this question?  You 9   explained to Justice Scalia that there is no California10   case holding a corporate broker liable in this situation,11   as I understand.  Are there any California cases going the12   other way?  Has it ever -- has the issue ever been13   presented to the California courts?14             MR. BENEDON:  Yes, it has, Your Honor.  In two15   cases, there have been, one -- one State case and one16   district court case cited in our -- in our briefs, in17   the -- re Grabau case.  They've held that the California18   statutory scheme imposes only a disciplinary remedy for19   any violations of the scheme such that a broker -- a20   designated officer/broker who violates any of the21   provisions of the statute may be subject to discipline,22   but is not the basis of a civil action.23             QUESTION:  So in this case the individual could24   be subject to discipline, but not to liability.  Is25   that --8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼12345   like that.  What -- what are the other --6             MR. BENEDON:  The --9MR. BENEDON:  Correct.QUESTION:  Yes.QUESTION:  What were your other reasons.  Yousaid you -- you had a multi-faceted answer, or something 7             QUESTION:  -- prongs or the other facets of your 8   answer?               MR. BENEDON:  The other facets is that liability10   under the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law.11   There, the -- the agency under the FHA is determined on12   Federal rules of agency.  To determine Federal agency,13   this Court held in General Contractors, you look to the14   Restatement which has a two-prong test.  One is the rightof control, but the other is that the person controlled15161718   the corporation.  In this case when Mr. Crank went out and19   did real estate transactions, he was acting on behalf of20   Triad.  He was not acting on behalf of Meyer.21             The problem with looking at each State's22   structure is we're going to end up with a patchwork23   construction of a Federal statute.  The law may be24   different in Nevada than from Oregon than from Washington25   than from West Virginia.9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼has to be acting on behalf of the principal.          Here, the agent works -- is working on behalf of1234   salesman.  Would we follow that rule generally?QUESTION:  Is that --          QUESTION:  Suppose it were the majority rulethat a real estate broker is the principal for theMR. BENEDON:  Again, Your Honor, the -- 5 6 7 8   out.  You say there's a distinction because there's a 9   corporate broker and -- and an individual broker.10             MR. BENEDON:  Correct.11             QUESTION:  Now, we -- I -- we can explore that a12   little bit.  But suppose it were the -- the general rule13   in most of the States that had addressed the subject that14   the broker is the principal.15             MR. BENEDON:  To answer that question, I think16   you still need to make a distinction between individual17   brokers and corporate licensed brokers.  We do not disputethat --          QUESTION:  And again, I'm -- I'm referring tothe red brief at pages 14 and 15 which sets this -- this￼18192021   Federal law controls.  And if it's the general law in most22   States that the broker is the principal, then that would23   certainly be sufficient for the imposition of liability24   under this Federal scheme.  Would it not?          QUESTION:  Well, I -- I was simply addressingthe point of whether or not State law as opposed to25 MR. BENEDON: Again, I -- I disagree, Your 10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   Honor.  I would say that the rules still -- you need to 2   still look at the Federal law of agency rather than how 3   the State defines the relationship between the broker and 4   the agent.  You -- again, you look to the Federal rules of 5   agency to determine agency under the FHA. 6             QUESTION:  I thought you said those were general 7   common law principles that are -- presumably the States 8   would share. 9             MR. BENEDON:  The general law principles applied10   in the broker/agent context would establish that the11   agent -- the sales agent -- is the agent of the principal12   broker when the broker is acting in his individual13   capacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the14   principal, of the individual broker, and subject to that15   broker's control.  The situation is different when it's a16   officer/broker who is not -- the agent in that situation17   is not acting on behalf of the officer.  He's acting on18   behalf of the corporation.19             QUESTION:  Then if I understand your argument20   correctly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's21   California law or Federal common law, is in this case at22   least academic because under California law, if you were23   to apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that24   the only remedy where it's -- the license is held in the25   corporate name is a disciplinary sanction?11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. BENEDON:  To date, that is how Californiahas treated violations of the California statutory scheme.Correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Only -- only by these corporatebrokers or -- or by -- by individual brokers?          MR. BENEDON:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  Individualbrokers as well.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. BENEDON:  It's a statutory scheme thatapplies to brokers in general and salespersons in generalwho -- who allegedly violate the act.10111213141516   with Crank.  Is that not so?          QUESTION:  But I thought you said that if -- ifthis were a license to an individual broker, if this wereheld -- the license were held by Meyer as an individual --that he would then have a principal agent relationship￼          MR. BENEDON:  That is correct, Your Honor, ifit's an individual broker's license.171819202122   relationship with an individual broker.  If there is a23   violation of the act by the broker under California law,24   then he would be subject to disciplinary action.  That is25   separate and apart from vicarious liability under the FHA,12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          I think I may have caused some confusion.  Undergeneral principles of agency law, common law principles ofagency law, the sales agent is in an agent principal1   which would adhere based on the principal agent2   relationship.3             QUESTION:  Is there an issue in this case about4   piercing the corporate veil as a means of holding Meyer5   liable?678923 24 25summary judgment?          MR. BENEDON:  First a motion to dismiss, Your          MR. BENEDON:  Not in this case, Your Honor.  Wehold that the theory and doctrine of corporate veil-piercing is -- is available in the appropriate case as itwould be under any case under the general common law,although here it's been -- it wasn't raised and it's beenwaived, and it's never been proven.          QUESTION:  But they came --101112131415   Circuit?16          QUESTION:  Was there some reference toveil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth￼          MR. BENEDON:  On the last page of argument in afootnote, Your Honor, there's a reference arguing thatbased on sole ownership, that they could establish analter ego, but as a matter of law, that's insufficient toestablish alter ego.171819202122   recollection.  Doesn't this come up on a motion forHonor --QUESTION:  Well, didn't -- refresh my13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. BENEDON:  -- followed by a --          QUESTION:  Which was denied and then there was amotion for summary judgment.          MR. BENEDON:  The motion for dismiss was grantedin part, Your Honor, as to all the State law claims --          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. BENEDON:  -- the 1981 claim, and itproceeded just on the FHA claim.          QUESTION:  Right.  Now, so if it came up on amotion for summary judgment, then whatever -- whateverevidence the plaintiffs were going to rely on for theveil-piercing would have had to have been brought forward.Isn't that right?1011121314151617181920   dispute.  We maintain that ownership was, in fact,21   transferred, but we are assuming for the purpose of this22   proceeding that there is in fact ownership resided in23 Mr. Meyer.MR. BENEDON:  Absolutely.QUESTION:  And what did they bring forward?MR. BENEDON:  Nothing, except sole ownership.QUESTION:  Sole ownership is the only thing --MR. BENEDON:  Which is in dispute.  Which is in￼24             QUESTION:  I thought that if -- that a judgment25   winner, as the Holleys are at this stage, can defend the14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   judgment on another ground.  In other words, the Ninth 2   Circuit ruled in their favor and now they're saying, well, 3   here's another theory on which we could prevail.  I didn't 4   know -- certainly they can't get an immediate victory, but 5   if they attempt to defend the judgment on that basis, 6   aren't they then entitled to go back and make the case 7   rather than taking from them their victory and saying you 8   lose?  They say, but we have another theory that would be 9   viable.  Up till now, we won with this one.  Why isn't10   that altogether appropriate they should now be given a11   chance to air that other theory in support of the12   judgment?13             MR. BENEDON:  They -- the theory was never14   raised below.  An alter ego is in and of itself a fact-15   driven inquiry.  Where it's -- and so the fact that it16   wasn't raised below, it's -- it's now been waived.  It17   can't be raised for the first time in this Court.18             QUESTION:  Even if -- even if it had been19   raised, my understanding is in -- in order to have it sent20   back on the -- on the basis that although the court below21   relied on one theory, it could have relied on the other,22   the motion for summary judgment put the plaintiff to his23   proof to -- to at least come up with facts, the assertion24   of facts, not the demonstration of them, but the assertion25   of facts that would support the other theory.  And the15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   only fact contained here is control.  So if control is -- 2 3 4 5 6 7   things.  I mean, the Government in its brief lists a whole 8   bunch of things.  He was the sole shareholder.  He was the 9   president.  He did control it.  He paid the taxes in his10   own Social Security number.  He made various transactions11   that violated the terms under which it was supposed to be12   the corporate form, and he didn't train the person13   properly.  I mean, they have a list of things which I take14   it they didn't just make up, that they're there in the15 record.16             Then -- and then they say that, well, in the17   Ninth Circuit brief, what it says in the footnote is that18   evidence -- evidence will show that Meyer is the sole19   shareholder of Triad, and thus an argument to pierce the20   corporate veil would be meritorious.  Well, they don't21   list all those things in that footnote.  That's true.  Butdoes not suffice to pierce veils, that's the end of thecase, it seems to me.          MR. BENEDON:  That's correct.  That is correctand that is our position.QUESTION:  I thought there were a bunch of￼we should send it back and let the Ninth Circuit decide.          I guess that's basically their argument, and I22232425   as you have.  Maybe I've heard it already.think I want to hear as complete a response to that as --16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   insurance coverage.  Everything else is unsupported by the 8   record in terms of establishing that there was a failure 9   to adhere to corporate formalities, that there was under-10   capitalization.  All that is speculation.  And the11   argument boils down --12             QUESTION:  Was it not even asserted?  I mean --13             MR. BENEDON:  No.14             QUESTION:  -- to survive the motion for summary15   judgment, you don't have to prove it, but you have to say16   I -- you know, I will prove it.17             MR. BENEDON:  No, it wasn't --18             QUESTION:  It wasn't even asserted.19             MR. BENEDON:  It was not even asserted.  It's20   asserted for the first time in this Court.21             QUESTION:  Well, in the footnote -- they mention22   it in the footnote.          MR. BENEDON:  No.  You -- I would like toamplify on that, Your Honor.          The issue of -- of alter ego that's been nowraised for the first time in this -- in this Court by theSolicitor General is based on speculation beyond theshowing that there was sole ownership and that there is no￼2324   footnote.25MR. BENEDON:  They mention sole ownership in theQUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's -- you're17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   quite right.2             MR. BENEDON:  Yes.  And for example, the --3   Your -- Your Honor made reference to payment of taxes.4   While that was alleged, it was never proven at the summary5   judgment stage.  That's just an allegation in their --6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I don't know what that means.  Whileit was alleged, it was never proven at the summaryjudgment stage.          MR. BENEDON:  Right.  There's --          QUESTION:  There -- there was no evidencebrought in at all to establish it.10111213   under his ID?  None whatsoever.MR. BENEDON:  That he -- that taxes were paid          QUESTION:  Well, was -- was there an affidaviton their side claiming that?          MR. BENEDON:  On the other side claiming that?          QUESTION:  Yes.  How did it get raised?          MR. BENEDON:  It was raised solely as a -- as an141516171819   allegation in the complaint.  And then when it came time￼202122232425for them to put their proof on the table, it wasn't there.          QUESTION:  So at the summary judgment stage,they didn't rely on that is what you're saying.          MR. BENEDON:  Correct.          QUESTION:  They didn't.  Okay.          MR. BENEDON:  Correct.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000512345   record because it was never raised.  I'm denying it now.6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  And you said there was no genuineissue -- no triable issue at the summary judgment stage,that there were no facts?QUESTION:  And did you deny it?          MR. BENEDON:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Butagain, it was not raised as a disputed material fact onthe summary judgment, so there's no formal denial in the          MR. BENEDON:  That there was no issue regardingpayment of taxes under Mr. Meyer's personal ID number.10111213   stage, it's not a trial.  You don't prove your case at14   that point.  It's only if there's no genuine triable15   issue.          QUESTION:  Well, if the question is the -- theliability of Mr. Meyer -- and at the summary judgment￼16             MR. BENEDON:  Right.  The only issue on the17   summary judgment was whether or not Mr. Meyer was still18   the owner of Triad Corporation.  The district court found19   not.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that there20   was a disputed issue on sole ownership.21             QUESTION:  But what was the relevance of whether22   he was the owner or not?  I don't quite understand.23 24 25          MR. BENEDON:  They're claiming that that wassufficient to establish alter ego, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Alter ego, but not piercing the19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   corporate veil, is that --2             MR. BENEDON:  Well, I'm using those3   interchangeably.  I apologize.              MR. BENEDON:  I use those interchangeably.    They -- both alter ego as a basis for piercing theQUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand you.4567   corporate veil.  They were arguing -- and in fact, theNinth Circuit held -- that sole ownership of thecorporation was enough to pierce the corporate veil.          QUESTION:  They were arguing that.  So they werearguing the pierce the corporate veil theory then.89 10 11 1214             QUESTION:  But the -- but the purpose of15   investigating the sole ownership issue was to determine16   whether or not they could pierce the corporate veil.  Is               MR. BENEDON:  No.  They -- solely based on sole13   ownership.  Correct.￼171819202122232425that right?          MR. BENEDON:  Based --          QUESTION:  Which seems to me as though theirissue of whether they could pierce the corporate veil wasat least raised, and the question is whether their claimof sole ownership was sufficient to establish that point.Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.          MR. BENEDON:  Right.  Well, that -- that's theargument that's made in their footnote on the last page of20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   their brief is that sole ownership would establish an2   alter ego sufficient to pierce the corporate veil.  And as3456   district court.  Was there a debate on the -- in the7   district court as to whether your client was the sole8   owner or not?a matter of law, that's -- that is insufficient.          QUESTION:  But -- but now I'm just a littlepuzzled about the extent to which it was raised in the 9             MR. BENEDON:  Yes, there was.10             QUESTION:  And what was the purpose of that11   debate in the district court?  Wasn't it for the very same12   reason?13             MR. BENEDON:  They were trying to -- no, I14   disagree.  I think what they were trying to establish in15   the district court was the -- the control exerted by my16   client over the corporation as opposed to saying that he17   should be necessarily a veil-piercing --18             QUESTION:  Well, maybe I -- I don't remember the19   facts correctly.  But I thought that control was really20   not in dispute.  I thought that the -- the person to whom￼21 22 23 24 25he transferred stock didn't get all the stock, did he, ordid he get just some of the stock?          MR. BENEDON:  He got some of the stock, butownership --          QUESTION:  So he still would have had control.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051             MR. BENEDON:  He would have partial control as2   a -- as a shareholder.3             QUESTION:  I see.4             MR. BENEDON:  But the -- the Ninth Circuit held5   that that was enough.  The court -- the Ninth Circuit --              MR. BENEDON:  It was enough to impose personal          QUESTION:  Not -- not that it was enough forpiercing the veil, but that it was enough for what?6789   liability.          QUESTION:  On what basis?  Not onveil-piercing --1011121314151617181920   veil.21MR. BENEDON:  No.QUESTION:  -- basis.MR. BENEDON:  Solely on sole ownership.  They --the Ninth Circuit, taking a -- its lead from, I believe,￼the Seventh Circuit, said basically that in a situationlike this where you have sole ownership, under the FHAthat's enough to impose --QUESTION:  Okay.  You don't have to pierce the          MR. BENEDON:  Correct.  It's -- it's an almostper se piercing based on sole ownership.222324   to the broker problem.  I'm looking at Gipson versus Davis25   Realty, which is a case by Judge -- written by Judge22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  But just returning one -- once again 1   Molinari.  It's cited on page 15 of the respondents' 2   brief.  That was a standard respondeat superior case where 3   the broker -- pardon me -- where the salesman is in an 4   automobile accident and they seek to hold the principal 5   for the damages caused by the accident within the course 6   of his employment.  And this is the case where the 7   statement is made that the broker is liable for the 8   misconduct or -- or malfeasance of -- of the agent in the 9   course of -- of his employment.10             And it's a case much like this where there's a11   corporation that holds the license.  There -- there12   doesn't seem to be a -- a distinction between the13   corporate license and -- and the broker license that you14   made.  Is that -- was the law changed since the Gipson151617181920212223   was an individual broker.  But if it was a corporate24   broker and they're holding them individually liable for25   the torts of the --23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005case, or --￼MR. BENEDON:  Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor.          Again, I -- I don't have the facts of that caseat -- at the tip of my fingers.          QUESTION:  Well, it was relied on in therespondents' brief.          MR. BENEDON:  Right.  But again, in that case Idon't recall if it was a corporate broker or whether it1             QUESTION:  Well, as I understand the facts of2   the case, it was an individual who held the license and he3   operated through a corporation.  That's -- that's --4             MR. BENEDON:  Well, again, I would say that what5   California decides to do is not what needs -- can be what6   determines under the -- the Federal statute.  It's been7   argued by both sides and the case law is consistent that8   it's Federal rules of agency.  And under Federal rules of 91011121314151617181920212223agency, the salesperson is the agent of the corporation,not the individual broker.          If there are no further questions, I would justlike to conclude and save the rest -- the remainder of mytime for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well.          Mr. Schwemm.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. SCHWEMM               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. SCHWEMM:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          I'd like to begin by addressing theveil-piercing and the preserving issue, particularly withrespect to Justice Scalia's question because I disagreewith my learned friend on the procedural posture of this￼24   case.25             There was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  In the24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   complaint at that time, there were essentially two 2   theories.  The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be 3   liable as an individual because he owned the corporation, 4   and the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be 5   liable because he was the officer/broker. 6             The district court granted in part, even with 7   respect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion 8   and, in particular, held that the allegations of the 9   complaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances10   could lead to liability.  And the only thing that the11   district court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue12   with respect to liability based on officer/broker.13             That led to discovery.  The district court then14   granted summary judgment because it was the district15   court's theory on that issue that there could not be16   liability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's17   license as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is18   a license through Triad, or more properly, according to19   the California law, Triad holds the license through him.20             So with all respect, what the district court21   held in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that22   the plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing.23   We never got --24             QUESTION:  Well, could prove or -- or claimed25   they could prove in response to the motion.  I mean,25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   you -- you don't have to sit back and say, I wonder what 2   they might be able to prove.  You -- you have to have made 3   an offer of proof, and -- and what the court held was that 4   none of the facts that you claimed you could prove would 5   suffice.  Isn't that an accurate description of -- of 6   what -- what the holding of the court was? 7             MR. SCHWEMM:  And the facts that we alleged were 8   that Mr. Meyer was the sole owner of the corporation, 9   which they denied, and that that was sufficient to impose10   individual liability.  And when the district court granted12(b)(6) motion, my understanding of that is that he issaying, under no set of facts will you ever win.111213141516   sole owner of a corporation?  Otherwise a person couldn'tNow, what would --          QUESTION:  -- isn't that true that -- that youhave to have something more than simply a person being a￼171819202122232425create a corporation with himself as a 100 percent owner.          MR. SCHWEMM:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  All right.  So they're -- whatthey're saying is you didn't allege anything than that,and you certainly didn't support anything other than thatwith affidavits or other -- or other offers of proof.          MR. SCHWEMM:  That's -- that was my point --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. SCHWEMM:  -- with respect to the summary26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 judgment. 23 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  All right.  Well, if you -- if youdidn't, then you're out of luck, aren't you?          MR. SCHWEMM:  I don't think so because --          QUESTION:  Because?          MR. SCHWEMM:  -- at the 12(b)(6) motion stage,we are told that you can't even --          QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm not saying 12(b)(6).I mean on summary judgment.          MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes.  If my learned friend was101112   claim, I might agree.  But that's not right.right that this was a summary judgment dismissal of that          We were stopped at the very pleadings stage.  Wewere prepared to show both of the key factors with respectto veil-piercing, which is that the corporation is heavily13141516   underfunded.  In fact, in a colloquy with the district17   court, the defendant's counsel, after the 12(b)(6) motion,18   Your Honor, when the only thing left was the summary￼19   judgment with respect to the broker situation, the20   district court said, is there any money in the company?21   And the defendant's lawyer said, no, there is not.22             QUESTION:  Okay.  I have your complaint here on23   page 16 and 17 of the joint appendix.  First claim, Fair24   Housing Act.  I don't see anything there about -- about25   veil-piercing or anything like that.  Where -- where is it27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5   like that.  I mean, what it seems to say is that Mr. Meyer 6   himself did all these things, or through his agent.  Now, 7   that's -- that's what it says. 8             MR. SCHWEMM:  The allegation, if I could refer 9   Your Honor to page 4 of the joint appendix in paragraph 610   of the complaint, says that he owned the corporation and11   on that basis he's individually liable.  And then it goesin the complaint?          MR. SCHWEMM:  Correct, Your Honor.  The -- thephrase veil-piercing is not mentioned --          QUESTION:  No, no.  Or anything even vaguelyon and says he also was the officer/broker of thecorporation, which is the other theory --12131415   corporation.  What I don't see is something that says, and16   therefore he is liable because he owned it.  I mean, it17   just seems to be the part where you're describing the18   parties.19             MR. SCHWEMM:  There is another part, Your Honor.20   Page 7 of the joint appendix, paragraph 13, which carries21   over to page 8.  Essentially the same thing.  I'm not22   suggesting that there is additional material there, but23   there is the allegation of ownership leading to personal24   liability.25             QUESTION:  No.  I mean -- to be honest with you,28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Yes, I see where it says he owned the￼ 1   I'm not -- I'm just debating with myself whether you -- we 2   should send this back to the Ninth Circuit, tell them work 3   this out or not.  And district court judges are not 4   mind-readers.  They -- they can't make up what you're 5   saying in a complaint unless you say it and unless you 6   argue it.  So -- so that's why I'm pressing you on this. 7   I'm -- I'm trying to find the particular point where you 8   really made this point to the district court so the judge 9   would focus on it and make a decision.10             MR. SCHWEMM:  Well, I wish it was more detailed,11   Your Honor, but it seems to me it's sufficient for notice12   pleading.  The district court understood it.  Thedefendants understood it.          QUESTION:  Well, he didn't seem to, in his13141516   to veil-piercing seems in a footnote in a paragraph.  And17   what he seems to be saying there is referring to aopinion, understand it because the only reference he has￼18   different argument, the argument that there could be no19   veil-piercing because he didn't even own this corporation.20   And he says, that -- that's really wrong.  It's not true.21   Or maybe he said it was right, but he was wrong if he said22   it was right.23             MR. SCHWEMM:  And that's at the 12(b)(6) stage.24   And -- and my understanding of that is he is saying, I'm25   not going to get you -- let you go forward to your proof29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051234 stage? 56 7 8 9          MR. SCHWEMM:  No, sir.  On page 32, which is thedistrict court's order, page 32 to the joint appendix,which is the district court's order --because under no circumstances can there be veil-piercingunder the Fair Housing Act, which is just wrong.QUESTION:  This was at the summary judgmentQUESTION:  32 of the joint appendix.          MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes, Your Honor.  It actuallystarts as an opinion on page 25 of the joint appendix.This is the district court's order granting in part the101112   12(b)(6) motion.  He doesn't allow going forward at the13   12(b)(6) stage the claim based on ownership.  He allows14   going forward the claim based on corporate broker, and he15   specifically refers to a case -- this is the 12(b)(6)16   decision -- that talks about veil-piercing.  Page 32 of17   the joint appendix in the footnote.18             Now, our point is that that's enough for notice19   pleading.  The defendants understood what was going on.20   The judge understood what was going on.  We were21   prepared -- certainly at the summary judgment stage,22   Justice Scalia, we would -- we would have been happy to go23   forward with proof of underfunding, and there is24   substantial proof of underfunding.  We would have been25   happy to go forward with proof of lack of corporate￼30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   formalities.  This is a company --2             QUESTION:  Well, had you alleged any of these3   things?  I mean, opposing counsel referred in his argument4   to an allegation that the individual taxpayer ID number5   was being used.  Did you allege that in -- in thecomplaint somewhere?          MR. SCHWEMM:  That we did allege.6789   what we're fishing for.  Did you allege anything beyondQUESTION:  Okay.  Where is it?  I mean, this is10   the mere claim of sole ownership?11             MR. SCHWEMM:  Page 7 of the joint appendix, Your12   Honor, paragraph 13 toward the bottom of the page.  After13   it's been alleged that Triad was owned by Mr. Meyer --14             QUESTION:  Yes.  I got it.15             MR. SCHWEMM:  Got it?16             QUESTION:  Yes.17             Did you allege anything -- I mean, okay, we've18   got sole ownership.  We've got taxpayer ID.  Did you￼allege anything else that might be a basis for piercingthe veil?19202122   details of that.  That is to say, we did not allege23   underfunding, and we did not allege lack of corporate24   formalities.  But it seems to me that's not required under25   Conley versus Gibson.  There is notice pleading, and then31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. SCHWEMM:  We -- we did not allege the 1   we are put to our proof if that had been permitted to go 2   forward to the summary judgment stage. 3             QUESTION:  You're -- the point you're making is 4   that you are not certainly required under the Federal9 1011   veil-piercing is really not a new claim.  It is a theory12   of relief.  We have claimed Fair Housing Act liability in13   the complaint based on these --14             QUESTION:  Mr. Schwemm, can I ask you this15   question?  We really didn't grant certiorari to decide --16             MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes.17             QUESTION:  -- a California question as esoteric18   as this one is.  And I'm just wondering, do you defend the5   rules to set out your -- any theory of the pleadings.  You6   just have to state facts showing that there's a claim for7   relief.8          MR. SCHWEMM:  That's exactly right, Your Honor.And it seems to me in a case decided by this Court in themid-'90s -- I believe it was Peacock -- the Court said￼19202122232425rationale of the Ninth Circuit and do you defend the -- doyou abandon reliance on any Federal defense here?          MR. SCHWEMM:  Our position --          QUESTION:  Or Federal regulation.          MR. SCHWEMM:  -- is that the Ninth Circuit'sjudgment was correct, but it went too far when it reachedout and said under the Fair Housing Act we have to go32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   beyond traditional principles of agency.  We think the 2   standard should be, just as it is under Title VII, the 3   employment discrimination law, in Kolstad, Burlington 4   Industries, and Faragher, that the standard for vicarious 5   liability under the Federal statute should be a Federal 6   standard.  And that standard should be traditional agency 7   principles as informed by the policies of the Fair Housing 8   Act. 9             Now, the Ninth Circuit apparently felt that they10   had to go beyond traditional agency principles.  What11   we've tried to do in the brief in Roman numerals I, II,12   and III is point out three separate and independent13   alternative theories under traditional agency principles.14   And in that sense, we -- we think the Ninth Circuit just15   reached out and tried to do something that wasn't16   necessary.17             QUESTION:  Well, then is your piercing-of-18   corporate-veil theory a Federal theory or a State law19   theory?20             MR. SCHWEMM:  Our position on that is that it's21   probably Federal law, but as I read Bestfoods, the Court22   hasn't specifically determined, and if I may say that23   this -- this is something that I don't have a position on.24   But either way, we are entitled to a remand whether it's25   Federal or California law.  But the cause of action33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   clearly is the Fair Housing Act. 2             I believe the Government takes the position -- 3   and we certainly don't disagree with the Government -- 4   that it is a Federal question. 5             And if I may, I want to get into those parts I, 6   II, and III of our brief, and particularly the first part 7   and vicarious liability. 8             The problem we have with petitioner's argument 9   is that I believe it's based on two faulty assumptions.10   One is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the11   California corporation and real estate law that are12   advantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other13   part, which is the responsibility part.  It is literally14   true that in California, a corporation can be a broker,15   but it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual16   appointed who is an officer of the corporation and has17   qualified under the broker requirements, and that18   individual is required by California law to take19   responsibility for the supervision and control of the20 agency.21             QUESTION:  Yes, but your opponent says that22   the -- the results under California law is he can be23   disciplined if he fails to do so, but there are no24   California cases holding him personally liable if he fails25 to do so.34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. SCHWEMM:  Our position is that that may be2   right, it may be wrong.  We believe this is a Federal3   standard.4QUESTION:  Do you think it's right or wrong?          MR. SCHWEMM:  If we got a remand, Your Honor, wewould very much like the opportunity on this basis to567   argue that it's wrong.  There is a California case in 19788   that holds that, but a year later, California amends its9   licensing statute to add the very key provision in this10   case which is 10159.2 which says that the individual who's11   appointed by the corporation as the officer/broker has12   personal responsibility.  So our argument would be onthat --remand that that change.          But I want to -- I want to make the point1314151617   earlier point you made.  You said that California law says18   that the corporate broker, the -- the one who's designated19   for the corporation, has to exercise control over the --20   over the brokers in the corporation.  That may well be￼QUESTION:  Well, can -- can I go back to an21   true.22             The -- the issue is not whether he -- he has to23   exercise control.  It's whether he exercises control in24   his personal status or rather exercises control as an25   officer of the corporation.  If it's in the latter35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   capacity that he exercises control, he -- he should not2   have personal liability.  It's the corporation that has3   liability.MR. SCHWEMM:  Well -- 4 5 6 7   his own.  The only way he could use that license was as an 8   officer of the corporation.  Isn't that correct? 9             MR. SCHWEMM:  I would put it actually a little10   differently.  If you divide the corporation from11   Mr. Meyer, Mr. Meyer can then apply, because he's12   qualified, to become a broker.  Currently he would have to13   file a paper, but he would clearly get the status.  But14   Triad, Inc. would cease at that moment being able to be a15   broker.  And none of the acts in this case, none of the16   salesman's acts, could have been performed under the17   rubric of Triad.18             And the other point that I was going to make19   about the petitioner's argument that I think is faulty is20   it's the assumption that if Triad, Inc. is the principal21   of these agents, nobody else can be the principal of these22   agents.  And that's clearly inconsistent with longstanding23   agency principles as reflected in the Restatement,24   section 20, comment f, which says there can be joint25   principals.36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Now, as I understand the Californialaw, this broker could not operate under that license on￼1             QUESTION:  Well, yes, but -- sure, of course,2   there can.  But -- but it's not -- it's corporation lawthat -- that the officers of the corporation are not oneof those other principals.3456   this case.  I -- I repeat.  This company cannot be a7   broker if it doesn't have a broker-qualified individual8   who takes responsibility for the agents.  And so --MR. SCHWEMM:  Ordinarily, Your Honor, but not in          QUESTION:  Do you think the Gipson case that youcited in your brief is on all fours with your case?9 10 1113   operating as a sole proprietorship, as an individual, he14   clearly is vicariously liable.  That is, by the way, what15   86 percent of the brokers in California do.  They operate16   as sole proprietors, and they are clearly vicariously17   liable.  There is a -- an additional question.  What18   happens when you incorporate?  And -- and so it's not               MR. SCHWEMM:  No, Your Honor, it's not on all12   fours.  I believe what it says is if the broker is￼exactly on all fours.          And I think the -- the jury is out or the judges19202122232425   corporation.  If -- if you want to run a real estate37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005are out with -- with respect to what California would do.Some States say in addition to the corporation, theindividual is vicariously liable; some don't.QUESTION:  Well, so that means you can't have a1   corporation, you can't do it because there has to be a2   broker's license, and you're going to be personally3   liable.  What's the use of having a corporation then?          MR. SCHWEMM:  There are many uses, Your Honor,and I would like to address that. 4 5 6 7 8   licensed activities.  For example, if a broker went out on 9   the way to a meeting and negligently drove his car and10   caused an accident, that is not the kind of behavior11   that's subject to broker supervision.  And that would be12   no liability.13             QUESTION:  Well, but if he defrauds a client or,14   I mean, anything that's going to involve big money on the15   part of the corporation is going to come back on the head16   of the individual broker.  So you're saying if you want to17   be in the brokerage business, you cannot do it as a18   practical matter in the corporate form.          The only thing that we are arguing thatMr. Meyer was responsible for is what I would call the￼MR. SCHWEMM:  Only I'm not saying it, Your1920   Honor.21222324   make this point.  Every single State says this.  11 States25   say you can't even operate as a broker as a corporate38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  That's -- well, no.  That -- that'swhat you say the California law says.MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes.  And every State -- I want to1   form.  39 States, including California, said we will allow2   you to do this, but there has to be one human being that3   is responsible.4             And in this particular case, there came a point5   when Mr. Meyer was trying to get the Triad license6   extended.  California said you haven't satisfied that7 8 9because you personally, Meyer, haven't engaged in thecontinuing education requirements that an officer/brokeris required --          QUESTION:  That's even tougher than -- than whatmost States provide for lawyers.1011121314151617   liability there, does it?  I mean, my statute here says18   there's an officer who's designated by a corporate broker19   license, and that officer is responsible for supervision20   and control of activities conducted on behalf of the21   corporation.  So that suggests that he's conducting that22   supervision on behalf of the corporation, and so it's the23   corporation that would respond in -- in -- under the24   principle of respondeat superior.25 MR. SCHWEMM: Let me -- 39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. SCHWEMM:  It's very analogous to lawyers,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  No.  It isn't analogous at all.Lawyers -- lawyers can -- can avoid personal liability.￼QUESTION:  California doesn't give personal12345   requirements.          QUESTION:  Evidently that's what California hasheld, and given the wording, it seems reasonable.          MR. SCHWEMM:  Well, it held that and thenCalifornia's legislature came along and added -- added the          But let me -- let me make this observation:When Mr. Crank, the salesperson in this case, wanted toextend his salesperson's license, he was required to have6789   his broker authorize the forms.  This was done four times10   by Mr. Meyer.  If you look at the form -- joint appendix11   lodging 75 is the most recent example, but there are three12   other examples -- the California form says, list the13   company.  Triad.  And then requires the officer/broker,14   Meyer in this case, to sign a certification which15   specifically says, I certify this salesperson is employed16 by me.1718   appendix.  You said it was joint --19             MR. SCHWEMM:  I'm sorry.  I -- I misspoke.20   Joint appendix lodging, Your Honor.21             QUESTION:  Oh.22             MR. SCHWEMM:  It's the large tan one.23             QUESTION:  Got you.24             MR. SCHWEMM:  And this was done, by the way, for25   Mr. Crank on four different occasions.40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION:  I only have 74 pages in my joint 1             What I'm trying to -- to say is this is a 2   classic case of joint principal.  There aren't -- that 3   isn't true, Justice Scalia, in -- in every corporate 4   situation.  Of course, not.  We don't argue that.  We 5   argue that this is a responsible human being and that that 6   makes him liable -- 7             QUESTION:  On the major question that we took 8   the case to decide, what -- what's the general rule -- 9   well, we can ask the Government -- what the general rule10   for when we look to State law and when we look to Federal11   law.  Certainly State law informs what the Federal law12   ought to be.  That's -- that's Faragher and Burlington.13141516171819202122232425          MR. SCHWEMM:  That would be my response as well.We have a -- a Federal standard informed by State law.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schwemm.          MR. SCHWEMM:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,       AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS          MR. STEWART:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          As this case has been briefed in this Court,it's common ground among the parties and the United Statesthat questions of vicarious liability under the Fair41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   Housing Act are to be decided on the basis of generally 2   applicable principles of agency and corporate law rather 3   than by reference to a rule that's distinct to the FHA. 4   And obviously, it is a -- an important general principle 5   of corporate law. 6             QUESTION:  Well, do we look to general Federal 7   common law agency principles, or are we bound by State 8   agency law, Mr. Stewart? 9             MR. STEWART:  I think the Court -- I'm sorry.10   I think the task for the Court would to -- be to devise a11   uniform nationwide rule.  That's what the Court said --               But certainly the Court will look as -- as in     Faragher and in Ellerth, the Court looked to the     Restatement of Agency which for the most part is a12131415   compilation of decisions rendered by State courts.  So16   it's -- it's looking to the law of the States generally,17   but it's not looking to the law of a particular State.  So￼1819202122232425with respect to our veil-piercing argument, we would saythat the Court should devise a uniform Federal --          QUESTION:  Well, do you think it's fair to readthe complaint that was filed as putting anyone on noticethat it was a veil-piercing case?          MR. STEWART:  We think that the claim wasadequately raised in the district court.          QUESTION:  Where?42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1             MR. STEWART:  The -- 2             QUESTION:  Could you read it to us? 3             MR. STEWART:  The -- the plaintiffs -- 4             QUESTION:  Because it's not clear to me. 5             MR. STEWART:  The plaintiffs -- 6             QUESTION:  I don't think if I read that 7   complaint, I would read it as one that was proceeding on a 8   veil-piercing theory. 9             MR. STEWART:  Well, the --10             QUESTION:  I would have thought it was11   proceeding on the designated broker theory.12             MR. STEWART:  Well, the plaintiffs -- the13   plaintiffs didn't use the phrase, veil-piercing, but on14   page of the joint appendix, for instance, they alleged15   that Mr. Meyer is the designated officer/broker of Triad,16   the president of Triad.  They also alleged that17   Mr. Meyer -- they alleged that Mr. Meyer was the sole18   shareholder of Triad.  In addition, as Mr. Schwemm pointed￼19202122232425out --          QUESTION:  But that would be consistent with acorporation that's wholly adequately funded and -- andwhose -- which -- whose veil cannot be pierced.          MR. STEWART:  And it's true that they -- theydidn't allege in the complaint inadequate capitalization.However, as Mr. Schwemm pointed out, there was a colloquy43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   in the district court in which the petitioner's counsel 2   appeared to acknowledge that the corporation was without 3   assets.  And -- 4             QUESTION:  But it isn't -- I mean, look.  The 5   judge is sitting there on a motion to dismiss the 6   complaint, and he reads the complaint.  And when he reads 7   the complaint, he looks to claims, and he sees first 8   claim, Fair Housing Act, which doesn't have a word about 9   this theory.  And apparently in the brief, a different10   theory was produced, the one that's been produced today,11   that the reason they're liable is not because we want to12   pierce the veil, but because it's Mr. Meyer who's really13   the holder of the license in some sense, and that is14   sufficient.15             So not surprisingly, the district court says16   that.  He says any liability against Meyer as an officer17   of Triad would attach only to Triad in that plaintiffs18   have not urged theories that could justify reaching Meyer19   individually, with one exception.  And he then goes and20   discusses the exception.  Well, if I were a district21   judge, I would have thought I had done my job at that22   point unless somebody came in and petitioned for rehearing23   and said, judge, you missed something, which no one did.24             MR. STEWART:  I think you're right that the25   primary theory that the respondents advocated in the44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼123456789   of Mr. Meyer as the shareholder of Triad.  And the Ninth13141516171819202122232425raised in the district court.          QUESTION:  Of -- of course, what was raised iswe get Meyer because Meyer holds the license, and eventhough it's held in the name of the corporation, thatreally doesn't matter.          MR. STEWART:  No.  But the Ninth Circuit clearlyunderstood the claim against Meyer as shareholder to bedistinct from or at least in addition to the claim againstMeyer as designated officer/broker.          That is, what -- what seems to us to make this aparadigmatic case for veil-piercing, taking the facts --          QUESTION:  Well, maybe it is.          MR. STEWART:  -- in the light most favorable to45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005district court was based on Mr. Meyer's --          QUESTION:  No.  Sole.  Let's try sole theory.          MR. STEWART:  Well, this -- this was raised anddisputed in the Ninth Circuit; that is --          QUESTION:  In the footnote.          MR. STEWART:  Not just in the footnote.  In theNinth Circuit at page 7 and 8 of the petition appendix,the Ninth Circuit having turned to the possible liability10   Circuit said petitioner Meyer disputes that he was sued in11   that capacity.  However, the Ninth Circuit goes on to12   hold, we disagree.  We think that claim was adequately￼ 1   the respondent, is the combination of functions that 2   Mr. Meyer played. 3             Now, it's true that the respondent by and large 4   and the Ninth Circuit appeared to regard these distinct 5   functions as separate and independent bases for liability. 6   But in our view, it's only a short step to say even if no 7   one of the roles that Mr. Meyer played would be an 8   independently sufficient ground for imposing personal 9   liability, the combination of functions, together with the10   inadequate -- apparent inadequate capitalization --11             QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, as -- as I understand12   the theory of why the failure to bring forward affidavits13   or some -- some evidentiary proof of these matters at the14   summary judgment stage was not necessary, as I understand15   it, the plaintiffs' theory is it wasn't necessary because16   the piercing-the-veil portion of the complaint never made17   it to the summary judgment stage.  It had been dismissed18   on the face of the complaint.  Is that correct?￼19202122232425          MR. STEWART:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  Now, was there an appeal of thatdismissal on the face of the complaint?          MR. STEWART:  The -- the ultimate -- there wasnot a separate appeal, but the ultimate appeal that wentto the Ninth Circuit was an appeal both from the dismissalof certain portions of the complaint and from the grant of46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   summary judgment with respect to -- 2             QUESTION:  What portion?  Was -- it was an 3   appeal of the -- of the portion of the complaint that 4   dismissed -- dismissed a -- a veil-piercing -- 5             MR. STEWART:  It was not specific.  The -- the 6   appeal from the dismissal was with regard to Mr. Meyer's 7   potential liability as shareholder and the appeal from the 8   grant of summary judgment with regard to his potential 9   liability as designated officer/broker was based on the10   grant of summary judgment.11             QUESTION:  Well, so in addition to the complaint12   being very vague, the -- the appeal of the dismissal was13   pretty vague too.  I -- I don't understand what -- I mean,14   if you were objecting to the dismissal of the -- of -- of15   a veil-piercing theory, you -- you should have, it seems16   to me, come forward and say, I object to dismissal of that17 theory.18             MR. STEWART:  I would acknowledge that the19   theory that -- that we and the respondents have -- the20   veil-piercing theory that we have advanced in this Court21   is a refinement of what was said in the Ninth Circuit.22   But it's -- it's always been part of the case that23   Mr. Meyer's liability was alleged on the basis of his24   status as shareholder, his status as designated25   officer/broker, his status as president.  And again, the47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   claim in the Ninth Circuit tended -- tended to be more2   that these were independent bases for liability.  And our3   view is that no one of them would be sufficient in and of4   itself.  Taken together, they establish that Mr. Meyer5   exercised pervasive control over --6             QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, I'm -- I'm confused7   about one procedural point.  Was there not a final8 91011121314151617judgment in the district court --          MR. STEWART:  There -- there --          QUESTION:  -- at the end of the rope, one finaljudgment that says that defendant wins and then you --from that final judgment you can take up all the rulingsagainst the verdict -- the -- the judgment loser?          MR. STEWART:  That -- that's correct.  Thedistrict judge first threw out on 12(b)(6) everythingexcept the claim against Mr. Meyer as designatedofficer/broker, and subsequently entered summary judgment￼18   for the petitioner on that claim.  And then there was a19202122232425final judgment and that was taken up to the Ninth Circuit.          QUESTION:  And the final judgment would includeall the rulings on the way to that final judgmentdisposing of the entire case.          MR. STEWART:  That -- that's correct.          Now, in the course of doing discovery on thedesignated officer/broker question, they -- the plaintiffs48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   unearthed some facts that are potentially relevant to the 2   veil-piercing theory, but they've had no discovery on 3   veil-piercing as such. 4             And another important criterion in determining 5   whether veil-piercing is appropriate is whether the 6   individual bears some degree of personal fault for the 7   wrong alleged.  And here, the plaintiffs' allegation is 8   that Mr. Meyer negligently supervised Mr. Crank, that that 9   was a contributing factor in Crank's ultimate misconduct,10   and that would suffice to show that aspect of the11   veil-piercing analysis.12             I think it's also important to note that courts13   are typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort14   cases than in contract cases; that this Court has15   described the Fair Housing Act as -- as essentially16   defining a new type of tort.  The theory is that in17   contract cases, an individual who contracts with a18   corporation has his own opportunity to assess the -- the19   corporation's finances and decline to do business if the20   corporation seems likely not to be able to satisfy its21   obligations whereas in a tort case the -- the potential22   plaintiff has no opportunity to do that.23             Inadequate capitalization has always been an24   important factor in veil-piercing analysis, and really it25   goes to the question whether the incorporators have49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9adequately respected the independent status of thecorporate entity.          QUESTION:  You don't -- you don't rely in yoursubmission on the proposition that under California law,the broker is liable.          MR.

STEWART:  I think it's partly that.  I thinkit's partly just the general background rule is individualsupervisors are ordinarily not vicariously liable fortorts committed by the people they supervise.101112131415161718   salesperson.          QUESTION:  Suppose in a majority of the States,the broker is liable for the -- I forget the --intervening corporate -- suppose in a majority of theStates, the broker is liable for the acts of the￼MR.

BENEDON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. BENEDON:  Your Honors, I would submit atthis point unless there are any further questions.          QUESTION:  Thank you.what is your response to the -- to the assertion that itwas not necessary for the plaintiffs to bring forward anyaffidavits or evidence at the summary judgment stagebecause on the -- on the veil-piercing issue -- becausethat issue was no longer alive at the -- at the summaryQUESTION:  I --QUESTION:  Oh, excuse me.QUESTION:  I do have -- I'm still -- what is --1011121314151617   judgment stage.  It had been dismissed on the complaint.18             MR. BENEDON:  I would start from the premise19   that the veil-piercing theory was never born, not that it20   wasn't alive.  Okay?￼21 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  In other words, you -- you concedethat then and -- and you -- you fall back on -- on thesimple fact that the veil-piercing theory was never -- wasnever really contained in the complaint.          MR. BENEDON:  Never contained in the complaint,51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051234   Housing Act when his agent discriminated.  That's what it5   says in paragraph 41.never raised --          QUESTION:  But it is actually.  I mean, it saysthat -- that the -- the defendant violated the Fair 6             And then previously in paragraph 13, it lists a 7   whole lot of facts about the relationship of Mr. Meyer to 8   the company including the fact about the tax numbers and9 so forth.10             And so what they say is, you know, the complaint11   doesn't have to spell out every theory, but it does state12   some facts there from which this basis could be fairly13   inferred, and therefore it shouldn't have been dismissed.14   Rather, they should have had at least an opportunity to15   argue it.  I -- I take it something like that is their16 claim.17             MR. BENEDON:  But again, we have to look at what18   are the allegations in the complaint.19             QUESTION:  Well, the allegations are just what I20   had said, paragraph --21             MR. BENEDON:  There --22             QUESTION:  Yes.23             MR. BENEDON:  There are allegations of sole24   ownership, corporate -- that he was the sole owner, that25   he was the officer/broker, and that he was the president,52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   and that the taxes were paid under his ID number, an 2   allegation that's never been proven. 3             I think most telling to what was the issue in 4   this case is the holding of the Ninth Circuit itself, and 5   that's at page 67 of the joint appendix where the court of 6   appeals states where common ownership and management 7   exists, corporate formalities must not be rigidly adhered 8   to, a holding which is clearly erroneous, but which sets 9   out what was the issue in this case.  The issue was not10   under-capitalization.  The issue was not mismanagement of11   corporate formalities.  The issue is -- was could12   Mr. Meyer as an individual be held liable because he was13   the sole owner, president, and designated broker of14   Triad -- Triad Realty.  Excuse me.1516171819202122232425          And for that reason, the Ninth Circuit should bereversed and the judgment of the district court in favorof Mr. Meyer reinstated in full.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Benedon.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
