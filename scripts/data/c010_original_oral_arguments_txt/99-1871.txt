Klamath, the Klamath WaterUsers Protective Association.          Mr. Stewart.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This case involves the application of exemption5 of the Freedom of Information Act to seven documentsthat pertain to the Federal Government's exercise of itsresponsibility to act as trustee for the property andnatural resources of Indian tribes.  Six of the sevendocuments were submitted by the Klamath tribes to theDepartment of the Interior at the Government's request.The seventh document was prepared by a DOI official andwas provided to attorneys for the Klamath and --          QUESTION:  By DOI, Department of the Interior?          MR. STEWART:  That's correct.          The documents relate to the United States'representation of the tribes' interests in a pendingOregon stream adjudication as well as to the Bureau of31    Reclamation's management of the Klamath reclamation2    project during the period while that adjudication remains3    pending.45678910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Has that been abandoned?          MR. STEWART:  It has not been abandoned.  Thelong -- no draft long-term plan has yet been issued, butthe --          QUESTION:  Is it still under preparation?          MR. STEWART:  It is still under preparation.          QUESTION:  Is it ongoing?          MR. STEWART:  It is still ongoing on a year-by-year basis the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, manages theKlamath project based on water availability during thecourse of that year.          The idea behind the long-term operations plan,sometimes known as the Klamath project operations plan, orKPOP colloquially, was to devise a methodology whereby theDepartment would decide in advance how water would bedistributed in both wet and dry years, where current4          QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, there was some long-term plan for this water basin that was being considered?          MR. STEWART:  At the time that the documentssubmitted, the Department of Interior or Bureau ofReclamation more specifically was attempting to prepare along-term operations plan for the Klamath project. 1    practice has been at the beginning of the season to assess 2    the likely availability of water and make a determination 3    for that year. 4              The preparation of KPOP in a sense interacts 5    with the United States' representation of the tribes in 6    the Oregon general stream adjudication, because it's the 7    State of Oregon that will be making the final permanent 8    determination as to who has what water rights and in what 9    order of priority and, in connection with that10    adjudication, the United States has filed claims on behalf11    of the tribes, on behalf of the project, as well as on12    behalf of other Federal interests.13              QUESTION:  So in the Oregon litigation I take it14    that the United States is really acting as counsel for the15 tribes?16171819202122232425          MR. STEWART:  We are not technically acting astheir attorney.  That is, the tribes have their ownattorneys, but the United States acts as trustee.  It hasfiled claims in the Oregon adjudication --          QUESTION:  Well, are the claims that the tribes'lawyers are supporting the claims that the United Statesfiled, or are they separate claims?          MR. STEWART:  The United States has filed claimson behalf of the tribes.  With regard to virtually theentirety of the United States submission the tribes have51 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9filed a document that simply says, we accept andincorporate by reference the claims of the United States.          QUESTION:  So --          MR. STEWART:  With respect to a small fractionof the case the tribes have filed their own claim thatdiffers marginally from that of the United States on theirbehalf, but I think there is nearly a 100-percentalignment of interests in the Oregon --          QUESTION:  So your interests -- with that minorexception, your interests are identical.  Counsel,technically, is separate?10111213141516    interest?17              MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  The United States18    has also filed claims on behalf of the project and onMR. STEWART:  That's correct.QUESTION:  Okay.QUESTION:  But isn't it true the United Stateshas an interest other than just representing the tribes'19    behalf of other Federal interests.  For instance, there is20    a wildlife refuge in the area for which the United21 States --22              QUESTION:  If there were a separation of23    responsibility within the United States presentations and24    if these documents had been given to the right hand rather25    than the left hand of the United States, would you still6 1    say they were privileged? 2              MR. STEWART:  I think we would certainly say 3    that to the extent the submission were submitted -- to the 4    extent the documents were submitted to the United States 5    in its capacity as trustee, that is, with regard to the 6    preparation of the United States' claims on the tribes' 7    behalf, they would be privileged and confidential. 8              QUESTION:  But wasn't there some effort at the 9    time the FOIA was drafted or amended to put in an10    exemption for a trustee which Congress turned down?11              MR. STEWART:  In 1976 there was a legislative12    proposal that would have created a new FOIA exemption for13    all documents in the possession of a Government agency14    pertaining to the exercise of trust responsibilities, and15    that bill was never acted on.16              That bill would have accomplished an exemption17    from the FOIA that is significantly broader than the18    exemption we're asking for here.  That is, the19    applicability of that exemption would not have turned on20    whether the documents came from the tribes initially and,21    perhaps more important, it wouldn't have turned on whether22    particular documents would be privileged from discovery in23    civil litigation.24              That is, the focus of the court of appeals'25    concern -- perhaps I should turn to page 2 of our brief,7 1    which sets forth the language of exemption 5 of the 2    Freedom of Information Act.  Exemption 5 states that the 3    requirement of compelled disclosure does not apply to 4    matters that are, quote, interagency or intraagency 5    memorandums or letters which would not be available by law 6    to a party other than an agency in litigation with the 7    agency, and -- 8              QUESTION:  Certainly what you have here does not 9    literally fill that bill, does it?10              MR. STEWART:  It certainly doesn't fit within11    the most common conception of what an interagency or12    intraagency memorandum would be.  The courts of appeals13    have, over the past 30 years, devised a methodology for14    determining when documents that were created by persons15    outside the Government may nevertheless be regarded as16    sufficiently internal from a pragmatic point of view that17    they can qualify for the exemption.18              QUESTION:  Why would they go about that19    business -- why wouldn't they simply read what the statute20    says?2122232425          MR. STEWART:  I think because they have come tothe conclusion that some documents submitted by outsidepersons play a role in the agency's deliberations that isso similar to the role that a staff memorandum would play.QUESTION:  Did they call it a consultative                   81 privilege? 2              MR. STEWART:  They haven't referred to it as a 3    consultative privilege, but they have certainly said that 4    they have used outside consultants as an example of -- 5              QUESTION:  People that the agency hires to do 6    work that the agency would otherwise do? 7              MR. STEWART:  There are really two different 8    categories of cases in the courts of appeals, and one is 9    as you suggest.  That is, there are situations in which a10    person is consulted because he has preexisting expertise11    but no particular institutional perspective on the matter12    at issue, and there I think it is fair to say that the13    basis for the arrangement is that this person is serving14    in effect as a temporary employee, performing the role an15    employee would perform.  There are other cases in the --16              QUESTION:  Well, you don't assert that all17    tribal communications with the Federal Government18    concerning tribal resources are always exempt from19    disclosure under FOIA, do you?20              MR. STEWART:  No.  We would say that the21    document needs to be submitted to the Government in its22    capacity as trustee.  So, for example, if the Fish &23    Wildlife Service is making a determination as to whether a24    particular species should be listed as threatened or25    endangered under the Endangered Species Act it's possible                                   9 1    that the outcome of that listing decision might have a 2    practical effect on the way in which tribal land can be3 used. 4              QUESTION:  You say as a trustee.  Where do you 5    get that out of the statute? 6              MR. STEWART:  Oh, the statute refers to 7    interagency or intraagency memorandums and the courts of 8    appeals, in determining what can be properly regarded as 9    internal, have focused on the existence of a special10    relationship between the outside person and the government11    official, and in many instances the outside person, as I12    say, is one who fulfills the role of an agency employee.13              QUESTION:  But that --14              QUESTION:  But the tribe is not an agency.15              MR. STEWART:  The tribe is not an agency.16              QUESTION:  So it's literally not covered.17              MR. STEWART:  It is not covered under the most18    natural reading of that language.  I think there is a19    sense in which these submissions are properly20    characterized as interagency, and that is when the Federal21    Government actively solicits advice and assistance, when22    it identifies the person from whom advice is sought, when23    it constructs the decision -- when it constructs the24    consultative process in a way that is reasonably designed25    to further the Government's own interests, the resulting10 1    document can be said to be internal in the sense that the 2    circle begins and ends with the Government. 3              QUESTION:  Well, okay, but -- 4              QUESTION:  It isn't a matter of being -- it 5    seems to me all of -- almost all of the courts of appeals 6    cases you're referring to do deal with consultants who 7    have been hired by the Government to further the 8    Government's own interests.  This is really part of the 9    Government's operating.10              The tribe here was not seeking to further the11    Government's interests at all.  It was seeking to further12    its own interests.  I think it's a stretch beyond what13    most of these courts of appeals cases -- which I agreed14    with.  I mean, I've spoken to that in an earlier case, but15    this seems to take it a step further, and I can see how16    you can get to the conclusion that a consultant who you17    hire, any memorandum produced by that consultant who was18    hired is an intraagency memorandum.19              I do not see how you can leap to the conclusion20    that anything that is given to you by a trustee, by a21    trust, is an intraagency memorandum.  I mean, maybe it22    should be confidential, but I find it hard to call that an23    intraagency memorandum.24              MR. STEWART:  Well, with respect to the existing25    court of appeals case law, certainly the consultant11 1    temporary employee is the paradigmatic example, but the 2    D.C. Circuit has also applied this approach in cases such 3    as Ryan and Public Citizen to Members of the Senate, to a 4    former President who was advising the archivist regarding 5    the proper disposition of records created during his term 6    of office, where the idea was not that the person outside 7    the Government was stepping into the shoes of an agency 8    employee, or adopting an employee's perspective. 9              QUESTION:  No, but it was surely -- I mean, the10    Senate didn't have its own ax to grind when it was giving11    the Justice Department information about judicial12    nominees.  It was certainly trying to further the13    Government's interest, not its own interest.14              MR. STEWART:  But it was consulted precisely15    because it would have a distinct perspective on the proper16    manner of accomplishing the Government's objectives, and17    that's really --18              QUESTION:  In that view, if the Klamath Water19    Users' Association had submitted these documents, would20    they also be privileged from disclosure?21              MR. STEWART:  No, because the United States does22    not act as a trustee for the Water Users Association.23              QUESTION:  So then it's not the deliberative24    process privilege that we're talking about at all.  It's25    simply this trust relationship.121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021    issues.22              One of the statements made is that the United23    States has been routinely turning over what it gets from24    the water association to the tribes, so the information --25    the tribes get information from one side that has a stake13          MR. STEWART:  I think the trust relationship isthe thing that brings this case within a larger principle.          QUESTION:  No, but --          QUESTION:  And yet you concede that the trustrelationship in itself doesn't create any exemption underFOIA, and Mr. Stewart, this is the problem that I havewith the picture here.  It's the one-way-street aspect ofit.  I mean, you said the United States has made claims onbehalf of the water association, too.          MR. STEWART:  It has not made claims on behalfof the water association.  It has made claims on behalf ofthe project, but the association and --          QUESTION:  Where they have the same interest,where there's an identity of interest between -- theUnited States might agree with the users on some of thequestions, is that not so?          MR. STEWART:  There are certainly aspects of thecase on which we and the users are in agreement.          QUESTION:  What -- but, and the users and thetribes are in, at least in tension on some of these 1    in this venture, but that side doesn't get what the tribe 2    is giving to the Government, so it looks like it's not 3    evenhanded. 4              MR. STEWART:  I think to understand why, in our 5    view, it is evenhanded, it's essential to explain that 6    there are several component agencies within the Department 7    of Interior, but two that are particularly important here, 8    the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of 9    Reclamation.10              Now, both the tribes and the water users11    corresponded with the Bureau of Reclamation, or BOR, and12    BOR received a FOIA request from both the tribes and the13    users association asking for the documents that the others14    had submitted, and for better or worse BOR turned15    everything over.  BOR was absolutely evenhanded in16    divulging both tribal communications and the water users17    association communications.  It may be that under our18    theory BOR should not have been quite so forthcoming, but19    it was.  There was no disuniformity with respect to BOR.20              BIA was a different story.  BIA is set up with21    the special responsibility of exercising the Government's22    trust responsibilities to the Indian tribes.  It23    essentially corresponds with the Indian tribes, and it24    would be unusual for the water users to correspond with25    BIA at all.  BIA was the subagency within the Department14 1    of the Interior that refused to disclose some of these 2    documents, with one exception of the seven.  One of the 3    adjudication-related documents was addressed to the 4    Regional Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. 5              So primarily we are concerned with documents 6    that were submitted to a subagency within DOI whose 7    particular sphere of duty and expertise is the exercise of 8    trust responsibilities for the tribes, and this Court in 9    Nevada v. United States emphasized the BIA's unique10    mission, its separate juridical status --11              QUESTION:  No, but isn't the value of that12    emphasis, if it has any value at all, only proportional to13    the independence of BIA from the rest of the Department of14    Interior, because I think the questions of several of my15    colleagues here have raised the same point.  If the BIA is16    not independent of them, then your analogy between the17    tribes and the consultants fails.  If we accept the18    consultant situation as being inter- or intraagency, we19    can rationalize it by saying, as several have said, that20    the consultants really are doing something that the21    Department itself might be doing.  It's an extension of22    the Department.  It's reportable only to the Department.23              But if, in fact, the Indian tribes are24    consulting with an agency which is concerned not only with25    the Indian tribes' interests, but in adjusting those15 1    interests as against the interests of other claimants, 2    which seems to be the case here, then you don't have an 3    analogy with a situation in which the Department and the 4    consultant alone are involved, so it seems to me your 5    whole argument either stands or falls on the independence 6    of BIA, and we know that the BIA is not somehow totally 7    independent of the rest of the Department of the Interior, 8    whether it's preparing a KPOP or whether it's representing 9    the United States in Oregon litigation.10              MR. STEWART:  I mean, I guess I have two or11    three responses to that.  First, you're correct that the12    BIA is not an independent agency.  It is a subagency of13    DOI, and therefore is ultimately subject to DOI control.14    At the same time, the Government is attempting to deal in15    a pragmatic fashion with the sort of combination of16    responsibilities that no private party would ever be17 given.18              That is, things would certainly be cleaner from19    our point of view of DOI could either say, we will treat20    the tribes exactly like we treat everyone else, or it21    could say, we will treat the tribes exactly as a private22    trustee would treat the beneficiary, namely, show it a23    duty of undivided loyalty.24              It's clear, I think from first principles and25    from this Court's decision in Nevada v. United States,16 1    that the Department can't pursue either of those courses. 2    It must on the one hand fulfill its trust responsibilities 3    but on the other hand it has other responsibilities that 4    would be considered conflicting if they were imposed on a 5    private person, so giving BIA primary responsibility for 6    the carrying out of the Department's trust mission is a 7    pragmatic response to an admittedly messy situation. 8              The other thing I would say is, we don't contend 9    that the tribes are analogous to a consultant in the sense10    of stepping into the shoes of an agency employee or doing11    what an agency employee would otherwise do.  To the12    contrary, we think the input from the tribes is essential13    if the Department is to carry out its trust14    responsibilities, but that's precisely because the tribes15    have an expertise and a perspective that no agency16    employee would have.17              QUESTION:  Well, that's true, but I mean the18    problem comes because the Department has responsibilities19    to other people, too and it is -- in effect, on your view20    of the Freedom of Information Act, it is able to favor one21    side with information while denying an equal, in effect an22    equal access to another side, and --23              MR. STEWART:  Well, certainly --24              QUESTION:  -- that's the real rub in deciding25    whether we should stretch the Freedom of Information Act17 1    language broadly enough to in effect allow the United 2    States to grant privileges to one of the interest groups 3    it's supposed to favor, the Indians, as against the other 4    interest groups, water users, the general public, what- 5    not, and that's a great stretch. 6              MR. STEWART:  Well, again I would say, for 7    better or for worse, the BOR did not favor the tribes vis- 8    a-vis the water users.  It was equally responsive to both 9    FOIA requests.  The only --10              QUESTION:  But I think your position here today11    is, it didn't have to be, that it could claim an exemption12    with respect to whatever it gets from the tribes.13              MR. STEWART:  Not whatever it gets from the14    tribes, but whatever the tribes submit to it in its15    capacity as trustee, so yes, our position would be, if the16    tribes approach BOR and say, in order to fulfill the17    United States' duties as trustee, the BOR must take the18    following management steps.19              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Stewart, your argument20    would be very convincing if Congress had enacted that21    trustee thing, but it didn't.22              MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think it's -- obviously,23    one of the arguments advanced in favor of the legislation24    that was proposed in 1976 was that the legislation would25    clarify the ambiguity, would make it unnecessary to18 1    resolve difficult questions concerning the application of 2    existing FOIA exemptions, but I think the Court has long 3    taken the position that the FOIA should be implemented in 4    a practical way, that it should be implemented in a way 5    that doesn't interfere with the Government's performance 6    of its substantive -- 7              QUESTION:  But also that the exemption should be 8    narrowly construed.  The Court has said that repeatedly. 9    the main rule is, disclose unless you fit into one of10    these exemptions, and the exemptions are to be tightly11    construed.1213141516171819202122232425          MR. STEWART:  I mean, certainly, if we are ableto persuade the Court that the threshold language issatisfied here, that is that these documents are properlyregarded as interagency or intraagency memorandums orletters, we would still have to persuade presumably thecourt of appeals on remand that the documents would beprivileged --          QUESTION:  But the question is whether it fitswithin -- the words for the exemption are interagency.That's what has to be strictly construed.          MR. STEWART:  And in the past --          QUESTION:  Once you get past that, then there'san issue that isn't even before us now whether these aredeliberative and whatever else.19 1              MR. STEWART:  I mean, with respect, I think the 2    Court's general methodology has been to construe the 3    threshold language of the various exemptions in a way that 4    would protect the values that the body of the exemption is 5    intended to protect, and the Court has said, in a 6    shorthand formulation admittedly, that exemption 5 7    protects those documents, and only those documents that 8    would be privileged in civil discovery. 9              I mean, the point is, most of the work here is10    supposed to be done by the inquiry into whether there is11    actually an applicable privilege.  It maybe that the12    threshold language will screen out some things that would13    be privileged in discovery, but there's no indication,14    either in the legislative history or in this Court's15    decisions, that the threshold language is supposed to16    screen out a lot.17              To take another example --18              QUESTION:  No, but we can't construe the19    exemption as if it were an exemption only for privileged20    material, because we've got inter- or intraagency language21    that has somehow got to be satisfied before we get to the22    question of privilege.23              MR. STEWART:  But I think it's also worth24    emphasizing that the one alternative that I think is not25    clearly on the table is to give the threshold language an20 1    absolutely rigid literal interpretation.  That is to say, 2    nothing can be -- 3              QUESTION:  Okay, and we've been assuming in our 4    arguments, at least for the sake of argument, that we 5    wouldn't be so literal as to exclude the relationship 6    between the consultant and the agency, but the analogy 7    between the consultant and the agency fails here because 8    the agency here is in fact wearing more than one hat. 9    It's in the role of an advocate, or the role of an10    adjudicator, vis-a-vis the tribe, so that analogy doesn't11    work, and it seems to me the only way you can win is to12    say, well, come up with anew exception, or a new13    interpretation of inter- or intraagency, and I haven't14    heard what that is yet.15              If we don't accept the analogy with the16    consultant --17              MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think the --18              QUESTION:  -- and we don't have another model19    for a construction or an exception, then I think you're --20    then I think you have to lose.21              MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think the best analogy22    from the existing case law is to the Senators in Ryan and23    to the former President in Public Citizen.  That is, these24    are people who were not literally part of any FOIA agency,25    and who were consulted not because they were expected to21 1    perform exactly the same role as an agency employee. 2    Rather, they were consulted because they were believed to 3    have a distinct institutional perspective. 4              QUESTION:  Okay, was the United States in that 5    case in a position of, formally or informally of 6    adjudicating the interests, say of the President vis-a- 7    vis somebody else? 8              MR. STEWART:  I mean, certainly the archivist 9    was ultimately going to be making the determination10    whether particular documents would be made public or not,11    and in other private individuals such as Public --12              QUESTION:  But at the time the privilege was13    recognized, or the exemption was recognized, was the14    archivist in the situation of saying, well, I have the15    President telling me to do one -- or whoever it was --16    telling me to do one thing and a bunch of historians want17    me to do something else, so I'll consult with the18    President, and my consultation with him should be exempt.19    Was that the situation?20              MR. STEWART:  I don't know that it had21    progressed to quite that point, but certainly the point of22    the scheme was that private parties would like to have as23    much information as possible from the former President's24    records in order to do whatever type of research they25    wanted to do, and the former President was being consulted                                  22 1    because of his own distinct perspective, and -- 2              QUESTION:  Well, maybe the exemption shouldn't 3    have been recognized in that situation, then. 4              MR. STEWART:  Well, I think the -- certainly 5    Congress over the years has revisited, has amended the 6    FOIA in various respects.  It's not -- 7              QUESTION:  But you are asking for a stretch even 8    beyond that, because this -- the adversary nature of the 9    tribes' interests versus the water users' interests.10              MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think we are not -- I11    think we're not asking for a stretch, because the United12    States in its capacity as trustee, and in particular the13    Bureau of Indian Affairs, owes a duty of loyalty to the14    tribes, and certainly Federal policy for most of the 20th15    Century has been to exercise the trusteeship in a way that16    will promote values of tribal self-determination, so if17    the United States as trustee --18              QUESTION:  What I mean is, that's a new element19    that wasn't -- it's not like the paid consultant who's20    substituting for an employee, it's not like the Senate21    that's representing the U.S. Government, and it's not like22    the President.  You are asking for something that no other23    case is like.24              MR. STEWART:  I would agree that the tribes'25    potential financial interest in the income of the23 1    decision, the various decisionmaking processes is unlike 2    interests that have been recognized in the past, but the 3    United States is supposed to act as the trustee.  One of 4    the central duties of a trustee in virtually every context 5    is to preserve a duty of confidentiality to the 6    beneficiary, and so it would be strange to say that the 7    tribe's status as a beneficiary, the tribe's interest in 8    the trust corpus, is the very thing that causes its 9    submissions to lose the confidentiality that they might10    otherwise have.11              QUESTION:  It's not completely clear that that12    confidentiality is also a defense to discovery in13    litigation.14              MR. STEWART:  I mean, certainly in litigation15    the particular needs of an individual requestor would be16    relevant in a way that they would not be relevant under17    the FOIA, so I think your question -- the premise of your18    question is correct in two different respects.19              First, the fact that these are in our view20    interagency documents doesn't automatically mean that they21    would even satisfy the second part of the FOIA test.22    Second, even if they satisfied the second part of the FOIA23    test in the sense that they would not be routinely24    discoverable, that wouldn't by itself eliminate the25    possibility that they could be discovered by a litigant241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with a particular need.          If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder ofmy time.QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Stewart.Mr. Hitchings, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW M. HITCHINGS      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. HITCHINGS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          FOIA exemption 5 does not apply tocommunications between the Government and outsidenonagency parties when the communications concern theGovernment's allocation of a valuable right or benefitamong these nonagency parties.  This rule does not changedue to the existence of a trustee-beneficiary relationshipbetween the Government and the nonagency party, arelationship that itself does not give rise to a civildiscovery privilege.          As we heard in the discussion preceding this,this Court's decisions and Congress itself haveconsistently recognized that the dominant purpose of FOIAis disclosure, not secrecy, and that FOIA exemptions mustbe narrowly construed.          QUESTION:  If an ordinary person has atrustee -- in fact, any one of millions of Americans25 1    indeed do have a trustee they have to give confidential -- 2    they give confidential documents to, it would be 3    privileged in litigation, like attorney-client work 4    privilege.  There's no way for adversaries to get those 5    documents, is there? 6              MR. HITCHINGS:  In the context of civil 7    litigation there is not a recognized -- 8              QUESTION:  So if you're an Indian, however, a 9    member of an Indian tribe, you do exactly the same thing10    because your Government happens to be the trustee,11    opponents in litigation could get it, so the court12    privileges would be useless to them.  I mean, insofar as13    they have to give documents to the trustees, all the court14    privileges would be useless.  I'm not saying that means15    you'd lose, but I want to be sure that's the consequence.16              MR. HITCHINGS:  Well, the consequence should be17    looked at within the context of --18              QUESTION:  But that is the consequence.19              MR. HITCHINGS:  The consequence, yes.20              QUESTION:  All right.  If that's the21    consequence, then what I'm looking for is, it seems an22    undesirable consequence, and therefore I wonder if their23    status isn't unique enough to analogize them to24    consultants.25              That's basically -- I mean, it's like nothing26 1    else.  The Indian tribe relationship is totally  unique, 2    and there's a choice of analogies, and I agree with you 3    that it's a stretch of the language, but consultants is a 4    stretch of the language, so shouldn't we try to see if 5    that can't be done in order to prevent the consequence 6    that I just described? 7              MR. HITCHINGS:  Well, I think when you are in a 8    situation, granted the Indian tribes are unique, and 9    they've been recognized that way throughout history, but10    in the same instance, in Nevada v. U.S., this Court's11    decision in that case did recognize the unique nature that12    the Government has to deal with, competing interests13    within water rights adjudications, and while the14    relationship that the Government and Interior may have15    with project water, irrigation water users may not16    approach that of a trustee, certainly Nevada said that the17    Government is obligated to undertake substantial18    obligations on their behalf.19              And when you're talking about the Government20    making decisions regarding these competing interests, and21    it's not just the interests of the irrigation interests22    and of the tribes, it's also competing Federal interests23    for other federally reserved water rights, one thing24 that --25QUESTION:  It didn't seem to me that's what                  27 1    would be relevant to the questions that I'm asking, or 2    necessarily to the holding of the case.  That is, if we 3    held they're not within the agency exception, they are not 4    within it, and therefore whatever documents they give to 5    the trustee, whether it happened to be your situation or 6    any other situation in the world, would be absolutely -- 7    other people would get them. 8              The court privileges would be useless to the 9    Indians, and that would be not only true in your10    situation, it would be true in every situation, if they11    don't fall within this.  Now, that's what's worrying me.12              MR. HITCHINGS:  Well, I think that one of the13    potential off-ramps to that is that there may be other14    FOIA exemptions that would apply in other cases.  For the15    purpose of FOIA exemption 5 our position is that it does16    not where you have the Government allocating a valuable17    privilege amongst competing nonagency parties.18              QUESTION:  Mr. Hitchings, I guess you believe19    that the moral is you should never pick a trustee who20    enacts a Freedom of Information Act.21              (Laughter.)22              MR. HITCHINGS:  I don't know if that's quite the23    moral of the story, but it's -- certainly the --24              QUESTION:  But I'm not sure the Indians had a25    choice.  I mean, the Congress --28 1              QUESTION:  Alternative moral, if you are a 2    trustee you should not enact a Freedom of Information Act. 3              MR. HITCHINGS:  Well, I think one of the other 4    points regarding Your Honor's question was, what other 5    circumstances may apply.  I think in many circumstances it 6    is going to be the Government competing, or balancing, or 7    allocating amongst a n umber of competing interests, but 8    there certainly may be circumstances where Indian tribes 9    will communicate with BIA or Interior, and the Government10    is not in this position where they actually are11    balancing --12              QUESTION:  Is there any way to work with that,13    because I would normally think, you know, that people get14    sued, and tribes get sued like any other entity for15    millions of things, accidents, contracts, who knows?  I16    mean, there are 30 million lawsuits, or I don't know, 1017    million anyway, and in each of those lawsuits they would18    be unable to use the privileges that are given to every19    other litigant if they turned over documents, as they20    normally would in the course of business, to their21 trustee.22              Now, is -- you say, well this is a special23    situation as described.  Is there any way to work with24    that that would make a difference?25              MR. HITCHINGS:  I think the rule that I29 1    articulated in the first sentence here is that FOIA 2    exemption 5 does not apply to communications between the 3    Government and outside nonagency parties when the 4    communications concern the Government's allocation of a 5    valuable benefit or privilege amongst those interested 6    nonagency parties. 7              QUESTION:  Don't the tribes generally, in 8    matters of contract or tort, refer to -- they have their 9    own attorneys, don't they?10              MR. HITCHINGS:  They do, and they have their own11    attorneys in this circumstance too, both in the Klamath12    project operations plan as well as in the adjudication.13              QUESTION:  Mr. Hitchings, I think that14    Mr. Stewart said that this case, if we got past15    interagency, would be on the deliberative process.  Nobody16    is claiming in this case that the United States has an17    attorney-client relationship that would bring forth a18    privilege.  I think that Mr. Stewart agreed with that, so19    if we -- if exemption 5 applied at all, we would be20    looking to the deliberative process privilege but not to21    attorney-client or work product, is that right?22              MR. HITCHINGS:  Well, in this case the23    Government has asserted the deliberative process privilege24    protects all seven documents that remain in dispute.25              They have also asserted that the attorney work30 1    product privilege protects two of those seven, and that's 2    an additional basis for withholding those documents within 3    the rubric of FOIA exemption 5, and those two documents 4    for which the attorney-client privilege was claimed -- I'm 5    sorry, the attorney work product privilege was claimed, 6    one of them specifically discusses the Klamath project 7    operations plan, one of them specifically discusses the 8    adjudication. 9              So there is somewhat of a mix in the privileges10    that have been claimed here, but it is true that the11    primary thrust of the Government's argument in this case12    has been that all of the documents are protected by the13    deliberative process privilege within FOIA exemption 5.14              QUESTION:  If the Government cannot prevail15    under section 5, are there as to these two documents as to16    which work product was -- will the work product privilege17    protect those independently of section 5?18              MR. HITCHINGS:  Our position is that it does19    not, and it's because they do not -- for the same reasons20    that it does not work within the deliberative process21    analysis it does not work within the attorney work product22    analysis either.  They do not have a common goal, a common23    defense or prosecution against a common adversary here.24    The Government again, Interior itself has many obligations25    and many competing interests.31 1              QUESTION:  In fact, they may even be adverse to 2    each other in certain respects, I guess. 3              MR. HITCHINGS:  Correct and, in fact, as far as 4    the Klamath project operations plan, there are a number of 5    interests that the tribes are adverse to the Government 6    on, as well as adjudication, too, and the adjudication 7    contests were filed in May of this year, where the tribes 8    themselves have filed contests to claims filed on behalf 9    of the Fish & Wildlife Service for wildlife refuges up10    there.  That's within the Department of Interior.11              The same is the case for the Bureau of12    Reclamation's claims that have been filed.  The same is13    the case for the Klamath project operations claim.  The14    tribes contest the manner in which the project is operated15    if the Government is operating in a manner to benefit16    project irrigation users, perhaps wildlife refuges,17    whatever the other Federal interests may be in that case.18              One of the points that was brought up by the19    Solicitor General's argument was this alternative test of20    what the role of the document might play, and our position21    has been throughout this that that would pretty much bring22    within the purview of FOIA exemption 5 any document that23    is submitted to the Government.24              If the Government was able to withhold a25    document based upon its affidavit of the role that32 1    document played within its discussion, that would include 2    just about anything, and it would provide the opportunity 3    for Federal agencies to cloak all types of discussions 4    based upon that type of assertion. 5              QUESTION:  Well, now I don't understand that. I 6    thought that in order to work, 5, you have to satisfy two 7    things.  First, you don't even get there unless it's 8    interagency, and if you are there, it's still not 9    protected unless you can assert a privilege that you could10    assert in a litigation.  Am I wrong about that?11              MR. HITCHINGS:  That's correct, there are those12    two tests to that.13              QUESTION:  All right, so in other words, the14    only things that you -- the only -- if it applies, it only15    creates privacy in respect to the following things, those16    things that, independently, litigation privilege creates17    privacy for.  Now, am I right about that, or not?18              MR. HITCHINGS:  Correct.  You would need to19    satisfy that threshold test of whether it is inter or20    intraagency and then meet the secondary test, which is21    whether it is normally privileged within the civil22    discovery context.23              QUESTION:  That's -- you see, that's why I'm24    worried, because we're only talking about things that25    would otherwise be privileged, and now they lose that33 1    privilege.  I'm just repeating myself, but I'm explaining 2    why I'm worried to try to get from you something that will 3    make me less worried. 4              MR. HITCHINGS:  Well, I understand that, the 5    worry that is caused by that, but again, I think there may 6    be other circumstances where other FOIA exemptions may 7    apply.  It may be in other circumstances that FOIA 8    exemption 4 could apply, because it's a commercial 9    privilege that is -- or involves commercial information,10    or financial information that is otherwise privileged and11    confidential.          In fact, amici in support of the petitioner inthis case brought that very point up, so there may becircumstances where the Government could assert other12131415    privileges.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Medical records, are medical recordsprivileged under FOIA?          MR. HITCHINGS:  That would be within unwarrantedinvasion of personal privacy, perhaps, or one of the otherexemptions --          QUESTION:  I think they're specificallymentioned in that provision, medical records and other --whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasionof privacy, but that provision letters that would not beavailable, memorandums or letters that would not be34 1    available by law to a party other than an agency in 2    litigation, that isn't -- that goes well beyond just 3    attorney-client material, doesn't it? 4              I mean, I thought that was a fairly expansive 5    provision, and if it were not routinely available in 6    litigation, it benefits from that. 7              MR. HITCHINGS:  Correct.  There are other 8    examples, and it is the discovery privilege that have been 9    historically noted, and those would be attorney-client,10    attorney work product, deliberative process, if there are11    specific, maybe psycho -- psychiatrist-patient, doctor-12    patient, those types of discovery privileges, but in this13    case there is no recognized trustee-beneficiary privilege.14              There has not been recognized within -- there15    has not been one recognized within the civil discovery16    context, and FOIA is not a means to create a new civil17    discovery privilege.  This Court's decision in Weber18    Aircraft explicitly stated that, and that's cited in our19 brief.202122232425          QUESTION:  So you say that the petitioner wouldultimately lose, even though satisfying the interagencyrequirement, because of the routinely available ofdiscovery product.          MR. HITCHINGS:  Our position is that theGovernment simply cannot meet that threshold interagency35 1    test here, because you have a circumstance where they are 2    not serving as a neutral outside, objective consultant. 3    They are -- in this case the tribes are an interested 4    party.  The Government is allocating a valuable benefit or 5    privilege amongst not only that interested party but many 6    others, including other Federal interests, and our 7    position is that test just simply is not met here because 8    of those circumstances. 9              Now, granted, there are circumstances where you10    do have a paid outside consultant that is providing11    information to the agency because it may be outside of12    that agency's expertise, but the paid consultant has no13    direct interest in the decision that the Government is14    making for which those correspondence are provided, and15    that's clearly distinguishable from this case.16              QUESTION:  Suppose that we thought -- I may be17    taking it out of context, but Justice Scalia once wrote18    that that's exemption -- said something about including19    any agency document that is part of the deliberative20    process.  Just taking that phrase, suppose it was possible21    to read section 5 in that way, would your documents come22    into that, too, not the ones you want, but your own23    submissions?24              MR. HITCHINGS:  From the Klamath water users,25    members themselves?361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.          MR. HITCHINGS:  I don't think so.  We're notasking for that.   Granted, we would love to have theopportunity to have secret communications with Interior onthe decisions that we're making here, but we recognizethat FOIA exemption 5 just is not read that broadly, andshould not be read that broadly, and I think in JusticeScalia's dissent, I believe that was in the Julian case,he specifically stated that it talks about a consultant ina governmentally conferred capacity, and that seems toindicate that you're talking about the traditionalrelationship where you have a consultant that's paid bythe Government to give it expert advice.          QUESTION:  I wasn't dissenting on this point.  Ijust had to reach this point because of my dissent,whereas the majority didn't have to reach it, so --          MR. HITCHINGS:  Correct.  In that case --          QUESTION:  The Court hasn't really addressed --          MR. HITCHINGS:  Right, exactly.  In that case,the -- whether the documents were intraagency was notraised below and was not part of the majority's opinion.          If the Court has nothing further, that wouldconclude my statement.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hitchings.          Mr. Stewart, you have 2 minutes remaining.37 1              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 2                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 3              MR. STEWART:  I'd like to address the question 4    of the role of the Government in allocating a scarce 5    benefit, and particularly with regard to the Oregon 6    general stream adjudication. 7              I think as the Court is certainly aware, the way 8    that a priority system of water rights works is the most 9    senior water user gets whatever rights it's entitled to,10    and then if there's water remaining the next most senior,11    and so forth down the line, and the position of the United12    States in the Oregon adjudication, and a position which13    was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in Adair, is that the14    tribes have a priority date earlier than that of the15    Klamath project.16              And there are questions remaining as to the17    quantification of that right, but when the United States18    presents claims on behalf of the tribe, if the United19    States believed that the tribes was entitled to a certain20    amount of water but nevertheless asserted claims for a21    lesser amount in order that more should be left over for22    the project, we would be breaching our fiduciary duty to23    the tribes.24              QUESTION:  The more difficult question, if you25    want to take 30 seconds, is how do you get the tribe38 1    beneficiary into interagency even if you couldn't get 2    consultants in there? 3              MR. STEWART:  Again, we think that the ultimate 4    question should be whether the Government has solicited -- 5    in this case whether the Government has solicited input 6    from a person technically outside the four walls of the 7    Government based on a distinct perspective which is 8    particularly useful to the Government, and an analogy -- 9              QUESTION:  Why doesn't that cover the water10    users association, distinct perspective, technical, why11 not?          MR. STEWART:  It's not the same sort ofrelationship between the Government and the water usersthat exists between the Government and the tribe.  That12131415    is, the  --16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  You're arguing for a trusteeexception, basically, just --          MR. STEWART:  Certainly we are arguing that thetrust relationship is, we would say is one example of abroader principle.  Another analogy would be to ourrepresentation of current and former Federal employees inBivens suits, where the Federal employee obviously has apersonal stake in the outcome of the litigation.          QUESTION:  Attorney-client.          MR. STEWART:  But the attorney-client privilege391    would kick in only if the threshold language of2    interagency or intraagency were satisfied, so certainly3    with respect to former employees I think the necessary4    implication of the opponents' test is, no matter how5    privileged the communications were, they would6    nevertheless be disclosable under FOIA because they could7    not be characterized as interagency or intraagency8 documents. 910111213141516171819202122232425          Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,Mr. Stewart.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)40
