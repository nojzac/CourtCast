Marcus.            Mr. Miller.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Official￼10111213141516171819   actually affected the outcome of the case.  In20   particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error21   test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on22   the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial23   proceedings.  That test calls for a case-specific,            The court of appeals erred in holding thatreversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate onplain error review if there was any possibility, nomatter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was basedentirely on conduct predating the enactment of thestatute.            Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting aforfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing ata minimum a reasonable possibility that the error24   fact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy25   it if there is no reasonable possibility that the error3Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   affected the outcome. 2               The decision of the court of appeals is 3   inconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four 4   of the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most 5   recently Puckett from just last term.  Puckett 6   established that the prong four inquiry is case-specific 7   and fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four 8   is inappropriate.  And that's exactly what the court of 9   appeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if10   there’s any possibility of prejudice, reversal is11 required.12               In addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear13   that when the error is one that affects an issue on14   which the evidence is overwhelming or essentially15   uncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious16   effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation17   of judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that18   context on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't19   affect the outcome would undermine public confidence in20   the judicial system.21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are there errors that22   are -- that are so basic that they would call for an23   automatic new trial?  You say this -- this is not such24   a -- such an error.25               MR. MILLER:  This Court has reserved the4￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   question of whether, for example, a structural error 2   would automatically satisfy the "affects substantial 3   rights" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano4 test. 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean by 6   “structural”? 7               MR. MILLER:  Well, the sort of error that, 8   if properly preserved, would result in automatic 9   reversal without an assessment of harmlessness.10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but if you can be11   concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what12   else would be structural?13               MR. MILLER:  Well, I mean in Johnson, for14   example, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in15   Johnson it was unclear whether the omission of one16   element, the failure to instruct the jury on one element17   of the offense, was a structural error.  And in Johnson,18   the Court said, even assuming that that's a structural19   error and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has20   satisfied prong three, showing an effect on the21   substantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has22   to apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of23   the record and the facts in that particular case whether24   there was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and25   public reputation of judicial proceedings.5￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234   essentially uncontroverted.  And that's, in our view, the5   sort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment            And in that case, the Court said that therewasn't, because the evidence on the point that was thesubject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and 6   of the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken 7   in this case. 8               The effect of the decision below is 9   essentially to carve out a special rule of plain error10   review that’s applicable only to a particular kind of11   error; namely --12               JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this?  Prong13   three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right?  And14   then it's your position that prong four also looks to15   prejudice?  Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one￼16171819202122232425is more searching than the other, perhaps?            How do they fit together in that relation --in that regard?            MR. MILLER:  Well, that's -- that's right.We think that prong three in the case of aconstitutional error requires at least a reasonablepossibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demandsat least that much and, in some cases, may demand more.            One example of a case where a defendantcould satisfy prong three but not prong four would be,6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   for example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error.  If you had2   a drug possession case where the only evidence that the3   substance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a4   laboratory certificate admitted without confrontation,5   that would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and6   that would -- the defendant would be able to show an7   effect on his substantial rights, because if that was8   the only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled9   to a directed verdict without it.  Nonetheless --￼1011121314151617181920   searching, more demanding, under four.  It might also be21   the other way around.  I mean, if you satisfy -- if,22   under three, you find that it hasn't affected the23   outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.24               MR. MILLER:  If, under three, the defendant25   fails, then you don't need to apply prong four, because7JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under three.            MR. MILLER:  Under prong three.  But lookingat prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, forexample, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoenathe chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of thereport, there would be no basis for concluding on thosefacts that there was a serious effect on the fairness orintegrity or reputation of the proceedings.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You answered Justice Alitoby saying there are cases in which your inquiry is moreAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   rights.  So -- 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  There -- there is an9 overlap.10               MR. MILLER:  There is some overlap in the11   inquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court12   made clear in Puckett, rule four requires a13   fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry.14               JUSTICE ALITO:  So under -- under three, the15   court could conclude that the defendant has shown that16   it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a17   constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the18   outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but19   in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's20   fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that --21   is that -- that how it would work?22               MR. MILLER:  Or if, you know, as in the --23   my Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence24   in the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect25   on the defendant's rights of that particular error, that8prong four -- prong four is essentially animplementation of the discretion conferred by the word --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.             MR. MILLER:  -- "may" in Rule 52(b).  Inorder for the court to have any authority to correcta plain error, it must be one that affects substantial￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   error, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine 2   public confidence in the outcome. 3               What the court of appeals did here was to 4   create a special rule applicable only to those errors 5   involving the failure to instruct the jury that they may 6   not convict solely on pre-enactment evidence.  The court 7   didn't give any reason why those errors should be 8   treated differently from other kinds of errors. 9   Instead, it was simply applying a line of circuit10   precedent that went back to cases predating Olano.11               And there is no reason for creating a12   special rule in that context.  To the contrary, Johnson13   emphatically rejected the proposition that there are14   errors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis.  And15   the Court said that even errors implicating fundamental16   constitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth17   Amendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth18   Amendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also19   subject to the application --20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want us to do it,21   right?  You want us to remand it so that they can do it,22   right?  Is that --23               MR. MILLER:  This Court's usual practice24   when there's an issue that wasn't passed upon below is25   to leave it to be considered on remand.  We think that’s9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   particularly appropriate because of the fact- and 2   record-intensive nature of the argument in this case. 3               So, if the Court does reach that issue, we 4   would urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the 5   concurring judges below, who said that, with respect to 6   the forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the 7   pre-enactment and post-enactment periods were 8   essentially identical, such that there is no basis in 9   the record on which a rational jury could have concluded10   that he violated the statute in the pre-enactment11 period --12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The point may be13   tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date14   problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and15   the jury was later properly instructed, do you think16   that the government would find it important to introduce17   the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set18   forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury19 the story?20               MR. MILLER:  Indeed, it would.  In order to21   establish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the22   government had to show that Respondent had obtained23   labor services by threats of serious harm or by a24   scheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to25   believe that she would suffer serious harm.10￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4   brutally carrying out those threats.  And so the 5   pre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying 6   out the threats would certainly be relevant to show that 7   the post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats 8   and that the victim could take them seriously as 9   threats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide10   the labor or services.11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the argument12   that was made that in the pre-enactment period theAnd so, in this case, there was essentially auniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaininglabor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed,￼13   Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the14   really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to15 date?16                 MR. MILLER:  Well, there -- I mean, the17   statute refers to "labor or services."  And creating a18   Web site is a kind of labor or service, and maintaining a19   Web site is also a kind of labor or service.  And20   there's -- as the concurring judges in the court of21   appeals noted, there’s no basis on which the jury could22   have concluded that one satisfies the statute but the23   other does not.  They're both -- they both fall24   comfortably within the ordinary meaning --25               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Miller, can I ask you11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   this question?  We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not -- 2   as construed in Olano, which has developed the four3 factors. 4               In your view, does the character of the 5   violation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does 6   that ever make a difference?  Could a court ever think 7   that one kind of constitutional violation is a little 8   bit more serious than another, or are they all fungible? 9               MR. MILLER:  I think in Johnson the Court10   quite clearly said that even very serious constitutional11   errors are subject to the same analysis under12   Rule 52(b).  And certainly there's --13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -- well, but the same14   constitutional analysis includes step four, which is15   whether it undermines confidence in the result.  And16   don't you think that some constitutional violations more17   undermine confidence than others?18               MR. MILLER:  Absolutely.  And the test that19   would be applied would be the same, but the result of20   that test might be different.  For example, if the --￼21 22 23 24 25            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would it not also bepossible that some constitutional violations undermineconfidence a little more than others?            MR. MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, if the error were,for example, a biased judge -- I mean, that would be one12Alderson Reporting Company19202122232425Ex Post Facto Clause doesn't give it any extra weight orany lesser weight in the analysis?            MR. MILLER:  I think in the context of anerror like this, there isn't any reason to attach extraweight --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose if theinstruction told the jury in a criminal case that you13Official 1 2 3 4   Circuit so wrong to say:  We think ex post facto 5   violations are perhaps a little more serious than some6 others. 7               MR. MILLER:  Well, because the error, the 8   essential error in this case, was the failure to give 9   the jury an instruction telling them that they could not10   convict on the basis of pre-enactment conduct.  And that11   is essentially analogous to the error that you had in12   Johnson, where there was a failure to give the jury an13   instruction telling them that they had to find14   materiality.  And there --15               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are all omissions in jury16   instructions fungible, then?  I'm -- here we have an17   omission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post18   Facto Clause.  Does -- the fact that it relates to thethat would almost invariably undermine confidence inthe integrity of the proceedings.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then why is the Second￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   can find the defendant guilty if you think it more2   likely than not that he committed the crime, that might3   be different, don't you think?4               MR. MILLER:  Yes.  That very well might be5   different.  That's right.6 7 8 9            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that this isex post facto, as opposed to a general due processviolation?￼            MR. MILLER:  No.  I mean -- that's right.The Ex Post Facto Clause regulates the content of thelaws that Congress can pass, and there would be an expost facto issue in the case if Congress had tried to10111213   make section 1589 retroactive, but it didn't.  And14151617181920212223   failure to instruct.  And we think it's the24   Due Process Clause that is the source of the requirement25   that the defendant not be convicted on the basis of the14everyone agrees that section 1589 applies onlyprospectively.            So the constitutional violation, if there isone, comes from the possibility that the defendant couldhave been convicted on the basis of Congress -- ofconduct that did not violate the statute.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you -- you agreethat there is a violation?MR. MILLER:  There is a violation in theAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9conduct that doesn't violate a statute.            If there are no further questions, I’dlike to reserve the remainder of my time.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Fahringer.         ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD PRICE FAHRINGER               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MR. FAHRINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and if itOfficial￼please the Court:            We do believe there are errors that are so1011   basic that they require a reversal automatically.  And12   certainly one of them is trying a person for conduct for13   2 years that violated no law.  It's almost14   unimaginable and it's unheard of.  There are very few1516171819202122232425   objection, and so forth.  But in an ordinary trial, this15cases that even come close to resembling --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except that I thinkmost trial judges would have admitted this evidence withthe proper instruction to the jury, that it's backgroundevidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story andjust begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense tothem.MR. FAHRINGER:  That’s --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, I agree there was nota proper instruction here, there should have been anAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   evidence would have come in with the proper limiting 2   instruction. 3               MR. FAHRINGER:  What’s so important about 4   that, if it please Your Honor, is that he couldn't have 5   been convicted on that evidence.  The court would have 6   instructed that this evidence was received -- 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of -- of -- of course, the 8   jury would have to be instructed very carefully. 9               MR. FAHRINGER:  But here, Your Honor, all10   this evidence came in, and he could be convicted and was11   convicted on the -- what we lend -- we think lends an12   awful lot of force to our argument here is that the13   government has conceded that he could have been14   convicted exclusively on the pre-enactment conduct15   alone.  That that was --16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Convicted, but not --17   there was a possibility, but not a reasonable18   possibility.  That is, it's conceivable, but the19   government also is urging the reasonable20   possibility that it is not likely, given the character of21   the evidence in the post-enactment period.22               MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, Your Honor, I23   understand that, but I certainly -- I’d like to say24   first, in terms of the concession that was made here, you25   are talking about 2 years of conduct that came into a16￼Alderson Reporting Company9 10 11want to know what constitutes labor.            And they put in their note the -- the     largest task of all, the building and the designing of12   the Web site and then maintaining it.  And that was all1314151617   Your Honor.  Seven days the jury deliberated over thisOfficial1   trial that is really quite extraordinary and terribly2 dynamic.3               The one -- last third of that, Your Honor, I4   think cannot -- even though it came post-statute, it5   cannot be used to legitimatize that first 2 years.6   And -- and the jury heard all of it, and -- and as a7   matter of fact, what we attach a great deal of importance8   to, the last question the jury asked of the judge:  We￼pre-enactment; the threats were all pre-enactment.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this was a long -- along jury deliberation.            MR. FAHRINGER:  It was out for 7 days,18192021   would have come in to show pattern, scheme.  So it's one22   -- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not23   have seen that evidence, would not have heard thecase.that, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, itJUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Kennedy suggested24   evidence, and another to say the judge should have25   charged them:  Now, you cannot use this evidence that17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   you've heard for another purpose.  You cannot use it to 2   determine his guilt or innocence. 3               MR. FAHRINGER:  But -- but, Your Honor, I 4   wanted to mention to the Court, of course, Rule 403 that 5   says that if the prejudice of the evidence outweighs the 6   probative value.  I think if we could take ourselves 7   back to that trial court and a lawyer stood up and said, 8   Your Honor, we want to put in 2 years of background 9   evidence, I -- I think there’s a good likelihood that10   it would have been excluded.  I don't think you can￼1112131415161718192021   liability.  And I think the -- the question is terribly22   important because, obviously, it shows the jury was23   focused on the pre-enactment conduct, even with the24   forced labor.25               JUSTICE ALITO:  Does the --18say --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you can be pleasedthat I was not the trial judge.Honor.(Laughter.)MR. FAHRINGER:  Sorry to hear that, Your            But in the -- in the course of taking insome evidence as background, I don't think it's everbeen of this magnitude in a unique case where theevidence that’s coming in bears directly on theAlderson Reporting Company10111213141516171819202122232425-- you have to have a new trial if there’s anypossibility, no matter how unlikely.            MR. FAHRINGER:  Well --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, nobody else uses that.It seems contrary to our cases, and is there anyjustification for their using it?            MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because unless I can hear ajustification, I would guess I would vote to say send itback and let them use the same standard anybody elsedoes.            MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, one point you make,Your Honor, that I --that?JUSTICE BREYER:  What's your response toMR. FAHRINGER:  It's certainly welcome, and19Official1               JUSTICE BREYER:  I assume you could make all2   that argument on remand, if we remand it.  But what'syour argument -- apparently from what I've read in thiscase, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain errorthat nobody else uses.345678   circuits say:  This is our set of standards, and we've9   set them forth.  And the Second Circuit says:  No, it'sMR. FAHRINGER:  Well --JUSTICE BREYER:  And it says that all the other￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   that is that we are seeking a retrial here.  You know, 2   you speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the 3   gentleman can be tried on that conduct that was 4   post-enactment. 5               But in response to Your Honor's question, I 6   think, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in 7   this whole case is, it all ran together in front of the 8   jury, and they saw all of this proof with no 9   instruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the --10   the mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in11   front of that had to have a --21222324   under this circumstance was justified.  When the court25   saw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say ifOfficial￼1213   the --1415   the Second Circuit.  That's what we’re concerned about.16               MR. FAHRINGER:  Oh, I'm sorry.17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's what the18   question pertained to.  They’re using a test nobody19   else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior20   opinions.  Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them,JUSTICE BREYER:  So why don't you makeJUSTICE SCALIA:  Address the test used byyou know, use the right test?            MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, I think -- and Ichoose my words carefully -- I think that this test20Alderson Reporting Company89 10according -- that you think that you would have wonunder any test.                 So that -- so why -- why do you do have to11   have this special favorable test?  That's -- that's theOfficial1   there was any possibility that the jury2   relied exclusively --3               JUSTICE BREYER:  The very magnitude of4   the error would argue for -- you’d win on any test.5   I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test6   that is specially designed to find when there is hardly7   any error?  Here there’s such a bigger error,￼12   question that I'm thinking of.  I'm not thinking of13   whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the --14   how much evidence there was and how awful it was.15               MR. FAHRINGER:  I think -- to answer Your16   Honor's question, which is a -- an incisive one, and17   that is because, Your Honor, it's only -- the court made18   it very clear, we’re only applying this test to ex post19   facto, and I think in this instance you are right, the20   magnitude of the error prompted them to say that if21   there was any possibility that this 2 years of conduct22   -- the jury could have based their verdict23   exclusively on that, we think we had to be granted a new24 trial.2521JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. -- may I ask thisAlderson Reporting CompanyHonor?Official 1   question about the -- I -- I should know this, but I 2   don't.  To what extent has the regular test that my 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   been used in the Third Circuit in the Tykarsky case.  It10   has also been used in several States --11               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were those ex post --12               MR. FAHRINGER:  -- Georgia being one.13               JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- ex post facto cases?14               MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.15 And --16               JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that it isn't17   necessarily a conflict between this case and all other18   plain error cases; it's a narrow category of cases19   involving ex post facto violations?20               MR. FAHRINGER:  In the -- in this very21   narrow category, Your Honor.22               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you call it an ex23   post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with24   the government; it's a due process violation.25               MR. FAHRINGER:  Well --22colleagues referred to applied in ex post facto cases inother circuits?MR. FAHRINGER:  The -- the Olano test, YourJUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, the possibility test has￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- what happened is2   improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre-3   -- pre-statute conduct.  But it might have been evidence4 5 6 7 8 91011   are aware of the Marks case.  They held that the ex post12   facto concept applied to judicial precedent as well, and13   that was repeated in the Harris case in -- as well.  But14   I think, Your Honor, certainly the whole strength and --15   and weight of the ex post facto law is present here.16   The Second Circuit said that it certainly involves ex17   post facto implications.  What you are doing is, you’re18   taking conduct that violates no law before the law is19   passed, and you're taking --20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And when a State court21   allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an22   ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State23   court judgment.  But that's not what occurred here.24   What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury25   consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction,23that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason.That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation.            What is special about the fact that thereason the evidence before the jury was incorrect wasthat it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before thestatute?￼MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, as I know, youAlderson Reporting Company1   which it should not have let the jury consider.2               And there’s a lot of evidence that a court3   should not have let the jury consider.  I don't see4 5 6 7 8 9anything particularly special about fact that the reasonthis evidence shouldn’t have been before the jury wasthat it occurred before the statute.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it not only allowedthe evidence before the jury, but it also told the juryit was sufficient to convict.Official￼1011121314151617181920   be different?  Now, if you have 1 day of pre-enactment21   conduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based22   on that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't            MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, that's right.It -- it -- what is special about it is -- I think it's anextremely rare and irregular case that would allow 2years of conduct to come into a case --            JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the -- what if theperiod -- the -- the period that was charged started 1day before the statute took effect?            MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, if it was -- YourHonor, my stand --JUSTICE ALITO:  Would -- would the test23   it?  And so, therefore, if the test is any possibility,24   the result is automatic new trial in that situation.25   Is -- is that where your argument leads?24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234567   coerced.  And no person should be convicted with8   evidence given under torture.  And no person should be9   convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police.            MR. FAHRINGER:  My argument is, Your Honor,that no person in this country under our Constitutionshould be tried for 1 day on conduct that did notviolate a law.  I -- I --            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.  And also noperson should be convicted with a confession that was￼10               Now, for all those latter things, every11   court apparently uses the normal standard.  So why would12   we in this case use a special standard?13               MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, it's different, Your14   Honor.  In all of those cases, there was a law, at least15   giving the court jurisdiction, that was violated.  There’s16   a very serious question here whether there was17   jurisdiction when they came in.  Jurisdiction is derived18   solely through statutes that are violated in the19   criminal field.20               There were no statutes.  So there’s a21   serious question of whether there was even jurisdiction.22   But -- but what’s different is it seems to me if you23   have a law, a mail fraud law, and then there is some sort24   of a violation and a -- a suppression of evidence or25   whatever other arguments you’re going to make,25Alderson Reporting Company3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conduct --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and,therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.            MR. FAHRINGER:  I beg your pardon.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  There’s also no violationof the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I ofthe Constitution and which says no ex post facto Lawshall be passed.            MR. FAHRINGER:  But, Your Honor --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have -- you don’thave an ex post facto law that was passed here.            You have an incorrect jury charge.  You havethe judge telling the jury that you could convict on thebasis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't.That is not an ex post facto law.            MR. FAHRINGER:  But, Your Honor, I -- I --in all due respect, I invite your attention to yourcase in Marks and -- and the Harris case where they havesaid that we have extended ex post facto to obviouslya -- a whole host of cases now that involve judicialprecedent and -- and the actions of prosecutorsand what not.            This, I can't imagine in a way in terms of26Official1   that's -- that's light years away from a situation where2   there’s absolutely no law to -- to violate.  And the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   the concept of ex post facto to put in 2 years of 2   conduct that is not in violation of any law, that 3   certainly fits within the presiding spirit of the ex 4   post facto concept that people shouldn't -- you know, if 5   you want to go back to our very basics, and that's what 6   unique about this case, the entitlement to notice of 7   what conduct is to be avoided, a statute that tells you 8   what conduct you have to avoid, and all those -- 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I’m looking for Marks, where10   is that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?11               MR. FAHRINGER:  Beg your pardon, Your Honor.12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have mentioned several13   times the Marks case.  What case is --14               MR. FAHRINGER:  M-A-R-K-S.15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is that?16               MR. FAHRINGER:  That's in -- in our --17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it in your brief?18               MR. FAHRINGER:  I -- I believe it was cited19   in our brief, Your Honor.  I will give you that in just20   a moment, if I may.  But -- but I'm under the￼21222324   what that case is.  If it was a case in which we25   reversed a State supreme court because the State supremeimpression, Your Honor, from our research that therewere a number of cases --JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, see, I don't know27Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that 2   made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could 3   say that was an ex post facto violation through the 4   Fourteenth Amendment. 5               MR. FAHRINGER:  I think this comment is 6   relevant to what you just said.  Our forefathers in -- 7   in imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the 8   few that they imposed on the States as well as the 9   Federal Government, and I think that lends it force in a10   sense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as11   does the Federal Government.12               But we feel, under all those circumstances13   here, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very14   critical fact, and that is the enormity of the error15   here at being a -- a constitutional error, and we16   certainly think a structural error, structural error in17   the sense that it ran from the beginning of the case.  The18   grand jury should not have indicted on conduct that19   violated no law.  He should not have been arraigned.  He20   should not have been tried.  He should not have21   convicted.  He should not have been considered.  All of22 this --23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is your position24   that two concurring judges said that evidence should not25   have been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   jury should have been told you can convict only on 2   post -- whatever the date was?  But they also pointed 3   out that one of the most severe incidents fell in the 4   post-enactment period.  It was in April of 2001.  It 5   was -- and that was vivid evidence properly -- 6   properly used by the jury to determine guilt or7 innocence. 8               MR. FAHRINGER:  I -- I understand that, and 9   I think I know what you are referring to, Your Honor.10   I find much of the evidence in this case extremely11   distasteful, but we are operating under a land of laws12   and Constitution.  And it seems to me his rights are as13   important -- I know this Court appreciates that -- as14   any other person’s.15               And the truth of the matter is that much of16   this very unattractive evidence came in before the law17   was ever enacted.  And I think what happens is -- and this18   is a reality psychologically -- it all blends together, it19   all comes together.  And without any kind of20   instruction.  I -- my view would be, under ex post facto21   principles, it would have ordinarily been excluded.  It22   wouldn't have been brought in.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  This -- this24   evidence was improper because if the legislature had25   made that action punishable when it occurred before the29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of 2   the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Now, in fact, the legislature 3   didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation 4   of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  But we do have the 5   admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted, 6   which is no different from evidence that should have not 7   been admitted for some other reason. 8               For example, where the -- where the court 9   gives an instruction that permits evidence to be10   considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is11   irrelevant to the crime.  And the jury says you can12   find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up13   in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with14 the crime.15               Why is this any different from that?  It's16   just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed17   to use for conviction.  I don't see why there is￼1819202122232425anything special about the fact that the reason itshouldn't be used for conviction --            MR. FAHRINGER:  In all due --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- is because it occurredpre-statute.            MR. FAHRINGER:  In all due respect, YourHonor, I believe the cases and Supreme Court cases haveheld that the ex post facto law has been extended to30Alderson Reporting Company1   judicial precedent.  And we cite those cases, Your2   Honor, in our brief.3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I thought4   what we have said that it's just a violation of due5   process to convict someone for conduct that was not6   criminal when the conduct was -- was made.  It's --7   it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process8   violation.  It just -- it's a serious due processOfficial￼9 10 11violation.            MR. FAHRINGER:  I think you’re right, YourHonor, in the sense that it's an ex post facto law being12   applied through the Due Process Clause.  But the impact and13   the force of that, I think, is still just as great and14   just as powerful.  And -- and -- and the error here15161718   suffering under a 9-year sentence.  I think he is19   entitled to have another trial where he is only confronted20   with the evidence that came after the statute.  And if21   they’re going to put in evidence that goes before that,22   they would have to justify that under one of a number of23   different concepts, Rule 404(b) or one of the others.24               And we would argue in that context -- none of25   this was ever done in court -- under 403, if it was too31factually is -- is absolutely enormous.            And -- and what I think the very least adefendant in his position is entitled to is -- he’sAlderson Reporting Company4567   case.  And the -- the summary of the case at the8   beginning says:  “Petitioners were convicted of9   transporting obscene materials in violation of theOfficial1   extensive, the prejudice outweighs the probative value.2   And I think that many judges would be sympathetic to3   that, for putting in a whole 2 years of conduct.  Somemight come in --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Courtesy -- courtesy ofJustice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks￼10   Federal statute.”  “Held:  The Due Process Clause of the1112131415   think of immediately of that is, is the statute here.  He16171819202122232425was -- there’s no question the -- the -- the conductwas forbidden by statutes in -- in time, but was appliedin advance of those statutes, before --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, therefore, the DueProcess Clause was violated when the court let that in.            MR. FAHRINGER:  I don't have a quarrel withyou on that.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- you have topersuade us that there is something special about aviolation of the Due Process Clause that lets in32Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application topetitioners of the Miller standards.”            It was a due process case.            MR. FAHRINGER:  And the only thing that I wouldAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   evidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations 2   that let in other evidence that should not properly be 3   used to convict the defendant.  And I frankly don't -- 4   don't see why it's so special. 5               MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, I'm endeavoring 6   to pursue it, but somewhat unsuccessfully. 7               This is not an evidentiary error.  It is in 8   every sense a due -- an ex post facto error, but it is 9   through the Due Process Clause.  I think that there we10   meet on common ground.  It's through the Due Process11   Clause that the Ex Post Facto Clause is made -- made12   effective in trial.  But the truth of the matter is -- I13   mean, the indictment here, which you start with, charged14   these crimes going all the way back to January of 1999,15   when the Act didn't come -- didn't become effective16   until October of 2000.17               JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the conduct18   that -- we didn't have -- what if we did not19   have pre-enactment conduct?  What if we -- if this20   statute applies only within the United States, as I21   assume that it does, and all of the conduct that's now22   pre-enactment was conduct that took place outside the23   United States?  Would that -- would the case be24   different for these purposes?25               MR. FAHRINGER:  If all the conduct that was33￼Alderson Reporting Company12345678   what had happened in Canada.  That would be the same?9 10 11            MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes, that's right.  And I --all I'm suggesting is, wherever the evidence comes from,it shouldn't be admitted except under one of the veryproven at the --            JUSTICE ALITO:  Instead of havingpre-enactment conduct, you have conduct in Canada,Mexico, someplace else.OfficialMR. FAHRINGER:  I -- I think it would --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the jury wasinstructed that he could be convicted on the basis of￼12   narrow exceptions, such as Rule 404(b).  And we would13   argue, under 403, it should be excluded, wherever the14   evidence came from.  And a judge would -- as I15   understand it, a judge would instruct the jury:  You16   cannot convict Mr. Marcus on any of this evidence17   whatsoever that is pre-enactment.18               JUSTICE ALITO:  No, of course, but the19   question is whether the mere possibility standard would20   apply in that case as well, or whether you think this21   mere possibility standard applies only in the case of22   pre-enactment conduct?23               MR. FAHRINGER:  I think the possibility24   standard only applies to ex post facto statute25   cases and pre-enactment conduct.  That's my view, Your34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   Honor.  I think it's a very narrow holding.  And I'm 2   not urging that this would be the standard for other -- 3   other than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this 4   would be the standard in ex post facto cases where -- 5   what this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about 6   it, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule. 7               What has gone on in the past is we have to 8   measure.  We have to take, on the one hand, the post- 9   enactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the10   pre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I11   -- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before12   Gideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in13   that context whether a person got able representation14   until you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright.15               Aren't we in the same position here?16   Wouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where17   clearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment18   conduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct19   and there is any possibility that the jury convicted on20   that, there will be a new trial?  It seems that's going21   to avoid all of that balancing and weighing and22   perennial -- perennial appellate review.  That's what I23   think is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's24   decision.  I think that's where there is a great deal of25   sense behind it.35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234   pre-enactment?  That error is enough; it doesn't have to            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your position is,essentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area;it's just error because it involved evidence5 6 7 8 911   a misconception among some people.  We -- the Second12   Circuit took the four Olano factors and applied13   them, one, two, three, four.  They didn't touch them.14   They didn't in any way alter them.15               What they did is, on the concept and the16   rule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was17   purely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't18   apply to plain error.  Those four prongs have been left19   intact.  And so they haven't disturbed that in any way20   whatsoever.  They set those four prongs out in the21   preamble of their opinion.  Obviously, what they found22   was, when you have a case of this magnitude of23   pre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that24   certainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the25   trial and the judicial reputation.36meet --MR. FAHRINGER:  I’m sorry, Your Honor.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It doesn’t have to meetthe standard for plain error?￼                 MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes, absolutely.  And this10   doesn't affect that whatsoever.  I mean, I think there'sAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               I say it myself.  It appeared on the front 2   page of The New York Times:  Man convicted for 2 years 3   of conduct where there was no law.  That, I would guess, 4   would have an adverse effect on the reputation of our 5   judicial process, whereas a ruling where a court held 6   this man should go back and get a new trial on the 7   conduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct 8   that violated no law, would enhance the reputation of9 the courts.10               So applying that factor, we feel strongly11   and powerfully that the correct disposition here is to12   affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  And￼13141516171819202122232425we will go back and we will have a retrial on the conductthat violated the statute.            If you have no other questions, I -- I thankyou for your attention.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Fahringer.            Mr. Miller, you have 16 minutes.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. MILLER:  Just very brief -- excuse me --very briefly, I’d like to make two points.            The first is that, essentially, the error inthis case was the failure to give a limiting instruction37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   relating to the use of pre-enactment evidence, and2   that's the same sort of instructional or evidentiary3   error that can be considered in a case-specific analysis4   under prong four and should have been considered5   through that analysis.6               The second is that Respondent suggested7   there was a lack of jurisdiction in this case.  That8 910111213141516171819202122232425argument rests on an understanding of jurisdiction thatthis Court rejected in Cotton, and we discussed that atpages 9 to 11 of our reply brief.            If the Court has no further questions, weask that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialPage 39￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼A able 7:6 35:13above-entitled1:11
