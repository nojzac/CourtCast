The Federal Trade Commission.      Mr. Mooppan.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPANON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. MOOPPAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      A State regulatory agency does not lose itsState action antitrust immunity simply because theagency is run by part­time public officials who are alsomarket participants in their personal capacities.      The FTC's contrary position that theagency's officials must be disinterested cannot bereconciled with this Court's jurisprudence for threereasons:  First, respect for federalism requiresdeference to a State's sovereign choices concerning howto structure and manage its own regulatory agencies.Second, the regulatory conduct of public officials whoare also market participants cannot properly be equatedwith the conduct of private businesspeople.  And third,the FTC's position would be massively and needlesslydisrupted.3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 States obtain valuable benefits from using2 market participants as part­time public officials. They3 gain the benefits of their expertise and they gain the4 benefits of not having to have a full­time bureaucracy5 with a full salary.6 JUSTICE ALITO: Is thisit ­­ is it a question7 of Federal law or a question of State law whether the8 members of ­­ whether this board is a State9 instrumentality?10 MR. MOOPPAN: Ultimately whether this board11 should be entitled to State action immunity is a12 question of Federal law. But in characterizing the13 board as public or private, we submit that absent14 extraordinary circumstances, the Federal court should15 treat a State's designation of a State entity as public,16 and that when that entity is charged with public duties17 as a State entity.18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you agree that a19 State can't simply deem something that for all other20 purposes is private to be a State entity or21 instrumentality, there has to be some test. So what22 would the test be?23 MR. MOOPPAN: So we think the ­­ the24 fundamental key is that it's not just that they're25 designated as State officials but they are charged with4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 a State law duty to enforce State law. They are not2 acting pursuant to their unfettered private discretion3 to choose whatever ­­ whatever choices maximize their4 personal profit. They are obligated ­­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here, in this case, they6 didn't enforce State law. One puzzle in this case: Why7 should there be an antitrust exemption for conduct that8 is not authorized by state law? The objection here was9 that this board was issuing a whole bunch of cease and10 desist orders. They had no authority to do that. No11 authority at all.12 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, two points about that,13 Your Honor. First, it's not quite right to say that14 this board didn't have authority to issue these letters.15 It is true that the board doesn't have authority to16 issue self­executing orders akin to an injunction, but17 it is also true that the board has authority to send18 letters to prospective non­dentists saying that if you19 don't cease and desist your conduct, we will sue you.20 The only question in this case in terms of21 State law authority is whether the wording of these22 letters was somehow problematic. No State court has23 ever determined that that is a problem, and more24 fundamentally, all of that is a question about whether25 there is a clear articulation here, and the FTC has5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 assumed that there is a clear articulation.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Mooppan, can I take you3 back to Justice Alito's question, because I think you4 said in response that the question ­­ that the answer5 was has the State asked the organization to enforce6 State law and given ­­ entrusted them with that7 responsibility.8 So suppose a State just looked around and9 found a trade association and said we think that that10 trade association is going to be a very good enforcer of11 State law, and made the trade association a State12 entity. That's the board that's going to regulate this13 industry. Would that be sufficient?14 MR. MOOPPAN: If they had a State ­­ if they15 took an oath to the State to enforce State law, if they16 were subject to the traditional duties that a public17 entity has, if they had to comply with the18 Administrative Procedures Act and the open records rules19 and the ethics laws, if they were subject to judicial20 review, absolutely.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, which of those are the22 important ones? Do all of them have to be there?23 MR. MOOPPAN: We think the absolute key is24 that they're subject to a State law duty, that they have25 sworn an oath to the State to enforce State law and not6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to maximize their own private ­­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't buy ­­ I ­­ I3 think in the trade association case, I get off your4 train. It seems to me it's quite different to appoint5 a ­­ what should I say ­­ an entity that is already a6 conglomerate, which is already a contract or combination7 of individuals, and to authorize that separately created8 combination of individuals to enforce State law. I9 think that's quite different from saying we're going to10 have a board composed of dentists and we're going to11 pick the dentists.12 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, it is different, Your13 Honor.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they are serving only15 in their individual capacity on this board, whereas the16 people in the trade association you're talking about17 are ­­ I guess the governors of the trade association18 are elected by the members; right?19 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, but that's the key, Your20 Honor. I agree it is a more difficult case, but if the21 State law hasd basically drafted a private trade22 association and said: You will serve two hats;23 sometimes you will act as a private trade association24 but sometimes you will be the entity of the State that25 is responsible for enforcing State law. You have a7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 State law oath to enforce State law. You cannot take2 your actions to maximize your private gain. What you're3 doing here is enforcing State law.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, my goodness, there's5 a lot of cases. I would have thought it was6 well­established that if, in fact, the State says to a7 group of wine merchants, you go fix your own wine8 prices, be sure they're reasonable; or to a group of9 truckers, you go set your own trucking prices but be10 sure they're reasonable, et cetera, et cetera, that they11 can do that if, and only if, there is supervision. And12 because, you know, they might get out of hand, the wine13 merchants or the truckers or anybody else.14 Now, I started from that proposition. You15 seem to be questioning that proposition.16 MR. MOOPPAN: Not at all, Your Honor.17 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If we accept18 that proposition, then how is your case any different?19 Because what we have here is we have a group of dentists20 like the group of wine merchants, like the group of21 truckers, and of course they're not fixing prices, what22 they're doing is deciding who will be in the business23 and there we are, end of case. Is there supervision,24 yes or no? The FTC says, no, there isn't, and I want to25 know what you say to that.8Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE BREYER:Okay.  Suppose I say IOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MOOPPAN: The fundamental difference between the hypothetical you posed and this case is that when you have private people who are authorized to set their own prices, even if the State statute says they must be reasonable, they are exercising their discretion about what is reasonable in terms of maximizing their personal profit. They are not acting as fiduciaries of the State. They have no obligation to the State. They have not sworn an oath to the State. They're not subject to the State's administrative procedures ­­JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Well, we put all that in. We put all that in. We say our truckers and our wine merchants swear an oath. I swear that I am a member now of the State commission setting prices and I swear that I will be reasonable. Okay?      You think that would have changed the Midcalresult?MR. MOOPPAN: Well, since those are essentially the facts of Parker I do think it would actually change the result. The commission in Parker ­­JUSTICE BREYER: What happened? All that happened is they take an oath. For all I know, maybe the Midcal wine people did take an oath.MR. MOOPPAN: They didn’t and ­­9Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425don't think that's ­­      MR. MOOPPAN:      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. MOOPPAN:      JUSTICE BREYER:It is no small thing ­­   ­­ is there anything else?Huh?   Is there anything elseOfficial￼besides the oath?  Is this case identical to Midcalexcept they ­­ they took an oath?MR. MOOPPAN: No. So compared to Midcal there was literally no substantive standard whatsoever in the California statute. They were free to set whatever price they want, not even a reasonableness constraint.      In addition, not only is there the oath,there's the fact that they are subject to all of thetraditional duties that public entities have.  They haveto comply with the APA, the State ethics rules, openmeetings rules, public records laws.  None of thatwas ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is it entirely reasonable to say, yes, this can be a State actor, but because they are made at the same time the State says they must be in private practice. So they're both the State actor and they're private actor.      So yes, you can have such a board, but thereneeds to be a check of supervision; that is, they can't10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 just go make their regulations without approval from2 some State entity and they can't go around issuing cease3 and desist orders. They have to come to a court. If4 they want to ­­ and the court would act as the check.5 Why shouldn't ­­ because of the risk that6 these people have the self­interest, why shouldn't there7 be a check of the kind that Midcal ­­8 MR. MOOPPAN: Because, fundamentally, it is9 a question for the State to determine whether it wants10 to bear that risk. These are the State's officials and11 the State has made a different choice. The State has12 decided that the benefits of having market participants13 make decisions and not having their every ­­ each and14 every decision actively second­guessed by a higher level15 of bureaucracy is worth it.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That ­­ it really begs17 the question, if we give immunity because only when we18 have a clearly defined State intent, a policy accepted19 and created by the State, what ­­ how is the State doing20 that when all it's doing is letting dentists elect the21 representatives of their board? This is not an22 appointed position. This is an elected position by23 dentists of each other.24 How is the State going to be any different25 in giving that group of private actors a pass on11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 antitrust litigation that ­­ when they have a2 self­interest that's inherent in their occupation?3 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, the State gets involved4 at the front end in two ways. First, there has to be a5 clearly articulated anticompetitive policy, and in this6 case ­­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is that clearly8 articulated policy?9 MR. MOOPPAN: In this case it's been assumed10 by the FTC that that is satisfied here. What I would11 submit is the reason it exists is because the Dental12 Practice Act says that only licensed dentists can13 practice dentistry. That is on its face inherently14 anticompetitive.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is there any clear16 policy that teeth whitening is the practice of17 dentistry? I thought that that was determined before ­­18 the standard about removing stains on teeth, that that19 was before anybody ever knew about whitening.20 MR. MOOPPAN: That's an interpretative21 question under the statute. And what this Court has22 held in cases like Omni is application of a clearly23 articulated State policy is a question for State24 administrator review.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:12Alderson Reporting CompanyBut how can it be clearlyOfficial￼1 articulated when the problem being addressed didn't even2 exist when the ­­ when the policy was ­­3 MR. MOOPPAN: For the same reason that in4 Omni, for example. The State had authorized zoning, but5 they hadn't asked whether the particular ordinance6 passed in Omni was complying with substantive and7 procedural law. And what this Court held is once you8 have at the threshold a statute that authorizes the9 displacement of competition, how public officials10 implement that statute is a question for State11 administrative review.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does The Federal government,13 the FTC and the Sherman Act have an interest in ensuring14 that regulators do not pursue their self­interest?.15 MR. MOOPPAN: They do not. That is ­­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's inconsistent then17 with what we said in Hallie. The City of Hallie, we18 said this is not a case in which we are concerned with19 entities pursuing their self­interest because it's the20 city.21 MR. MOOPPAN: I don't think that ­­ Your22 Honor, with all respect, I don't think that's the23 correct interpretation of Hallie. I think if you look24 at that paragraph in its entirety the sentence25 immediately prior to the sentence you just quoted said13Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that the risk that we're worried about is that the State2 is circumventing the Federal antitrust laws.3 The concern was not that the officials were4 going to act contrary to the State's interest. The5 concern was that the State was just authorizing them to6 violate Federal law. What ­­ and then two sentences7 after the sentence you just read, what the Court said is8 if the concern is that they have parochial interests,9 we'll work ­­ clear articulation solves that problem.10 But if there's any ambiguity about where ­­11 what Hallie says on this it's resolved by Omni, because12 if ever there were a case where the State's officials13 had the self­interest, where they might have been acting14 contrary to the State's own15 State's officials are being16 JUSTICE KAGAN:17 have to explain that understanding of Hallie to me. And18 Hallie is a very important case because it essentially19 asks the question that's right here, which is we have20 this odd entity and we have to decide whether that21 entity is more like just private22 a prototypical State actor. And23 like a prototypical State actor.24 And how do we get there?25 requirement of active State supervision is a way of14Alderson Reporting Companyinterest, it's when thebribed by private parties.Mr. Mooppan, could we ­­ youparties or is more likethere we say it's moreWe say theOfficial￼1 ensuring that the actor is engaging in the challenged2 conduct pursuant to State policy. And we need to have3 that test, we need to have that test when there's a real4 danger that the party is acting to further his own5 interest but not when there is not such a danger.6 And here that suggests that the question is:7 Is this party, this board of all dentists, is there a8 danger that it's acting to further its own interests9 rather than the governmental interests of the State?10 And that seems almost self­evidently to be true.11 MR. MOOPPAN: With all due respect, Your12 Honor, I think you've skipped a sentence in Hallie. In13 between the first sentence and the second sentence you14 read me there is a sentence that says the rest ­­ the15 purpose of the active supervision requirement is to16 prevent the State from circumventing the Sherman Act.17 The danger that the Court was talking about in the18 sentence you read is the danger that the State is just19 authorizing private people to violate Federal law rather20 than having its own State policy.21 And that is what the Court meant in Hallie22 when they said there was no danger. There is no danger23 that the State create a municipality as an elaborate24 sham to let private people violate Federal law under the25 auspices of a municipality.15Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:there is no State policy if the State simply says we ­­you take an oath and then you do what you want.  And ifthe board says we think what's good for dentistry isgood for South ­­ good for North Carolina, our cases saythat's not enough because you're pursuing yourself­interest.MR. MOOPPAN: Well, that's true, Your Honor, because there the statute says do what you want. But that's not what the statute here says, and a statute that says do what you want wouldn't be a clearly articulated policy to displace competition.      Here what the statute says is only licenseddentists can practice dentistry.  That is a clearlyarticulated policy to displace competition, and the onlyquestion is whether the State's officials have properlyimplemented that statute.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is a statute that says do what you want not clearly articulated?MR. MOOPPAN: Because it's neutral.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says clearly ­­ do what you want so long as it promotes the dental ­­ monopoly of dentists.MR. MOOPPAN: If it said do what you want to promote the monopoly of dentists, I guess at that point16Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyBut the concern is thatOfficial￼1 it would be a clearly articulated policy to displace2 competition. In a circumstance like that where all that3 was at issue was a broad standard to do whatever was4 best for the dental practice and there were private5 parties and they were subject to no other type of6 judicial constraints, maybe that would be the sort of7 situation ­­8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not enough9 just to say, oh, you're a public agent or you're a10 public official.11 MR. MOOPPAN: As I said to Justice Alito at12 the outset, in extraordinary circumstances perhaps this13 Court could say that what has been deemed a public14 agency by the State is essentially a sham, but this is15 far from that. The board in this case is structured16 like ­­ the work of the board in this case is17 accomplished like every other State agency. It is18 subject to the administrative procedures rules, it's19 subject to public records laws, it's subject to20 ethics ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But none of that's22 responsive to the concern that the State policy is23 purely to displace competition by promoting the24 self­interest of the dentist.25 MR. MOOPPAN: It's response ­­17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can do that in2 open meeting. They can do that with let anyone look at3 the records but ­­4 MR. MOOPPAN: It's responsive to the fact5 that if these people are acting contrary to the State's6 interest, the State can deal with it and the State has7 chosen to deal with it in a certain way. And the8 fundamental question in this case is does Federal law9 second­guess how the State has chosen to deal with this10 problem. And what we know from cases like Omni ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The antitrust exemption12 is a matter of State law ­­ of Federal law, not State13 law. So it's ­­ the Federal law sets the dimensions of14 what fits within the State action. It's not up to the15 State to create the State action exemption. It's16 Federal law and what its metes and bounds are are also17 Federal law.18 MR. MOOPPAN: That's true, but the line that19 this Court has consistently drawn from Parker onwards is20 that the Sherman Act does not apply to the acts of21 States or their officials when implementing laws22 directed by the legislature. And absent extraordinary23 circumstances, I would think that Congress did not24 intend for Federal courts to second­guess whether a25 public entity is really private. That would flip18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 federalism on its head.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG:3 about this, but I thought4 exemption was adopted and5 MR. MOOPPAN:6 JUSTICE GINSBURG:7 spelled out in a ­­ in a law.8 MR. MOOPPAN: It was adopted by this Court.9 It's a version of a more general clear statement rule10 that this Court has consistently applied, that we11 don't ­­ the Court does not assume that Congress lightly12 intends to intrude on courts' sovereign prerogatives.13 It's just like cases like Gregory v. Ashcroft. What the14 Court said in Parker is nothing in the Sherman Act's15 text or history indicates any intent to interfere with16 sovereign State regulation, and therefore, States are17 not subject to the Sherman Act.18 And the question in this case is when you19 have a State entity, that the State has labeled as a20 State entity ­­ but not just labeled, charged with a21 duty and subjected to all the duties that State agencies22 normally have ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's ­­ there's24 another factor that the State has stipulated, that is,25 the State has said "and the members of this board must19     Tell me if I'm wrongthat the State actionannounced by this Court.It was.Alderson Reporting CompanyAnd that's nothingOfficial￼1 be private practitioners." That ­­ that is not your2 typical State agency.3 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, it actually is the4 typical way of regulating the professions. Every State5 medical board, every State dental board ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And may be so, and that's7 why the FTC says we need a check, we need the Midcal8 check of some genuine State supervision over private ­­9 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, I would submit it would10 cut the other direction, that we should ­­ we would11 require very clear intent that Congress intended to ­­12 to oversee and regulate the most traditional way of13 regulating the professions that States have historically14 used and have consistently used for a long time.15 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if the16 North Carolina courts were to interpret the North17 Carolina statute that says that removing stains from18 teeth is the practice of dentistry, to apply to19 whitening? What would ­­ what would that mean for this20 case? Because that seems ­­ that's an unanswered21 question, isn't it? An unanswered question of ­­ of22 North Carolina law.23 MR. MOOPPAN: It is an open question. If24 they were to interpret it to say that it was the25 practice of dentistry?20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.2 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, I'm not sure what it3 would have to do ­­ the effect it would have on this4 case, because the FTC has already assumed that we are5 satisfied the clear articulation requirement. I assume6 it would make their case harder on remand to dispute7 that we were acting pursuant to clearly articulated8 policy.9 But in terms of going forward, whether we ­­10 the board is correct about the meaning of the State11 statute is a question of State administrative review.12 If the State courts were to reach the opposite13 conclusion, then the board would have to stop this14 enforcement practice and they could be sued in State15 court if they did.16 The fundamental question here is whether17 Federal courts need to second guess these State18 administrative questions. Just like in Omni, it was19 possible that the zoning ordinance that the city council20 promulgated in Omni was in violation of State law.21 There were all sorts of substantive and procedural22 requirements that needed to be followed, and this Court23 didn't ask whether any of those things were satisfied.24 This Court said that that is a question for State25 administrator review, not for Federal antitrust law,21Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. MOOPPAN:      JUSTICE BREYER:understand.MR. MOOPPAN:Well, the ­­   That's an argument ISo the ­­ let me ­­   I don't understand how OmniOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because the Sherman Act was never intended to supplantState administrative review.  That would turn federalismon its head.      And again, I would like to emphasize thatthat was in the context of city council officials whowere allegedly being bribed.  If city council officialswho are allegedly being bribed are entitled to immunity,I find it very difficult to understand how themere existence ­­JUSTICE BREYER: The obvious difference is that city council officials are State officials, and a local wine merchant is a local wine merchant. He is not a State official. That's the obvious difference.MR. MOOPPAN: Well, but these ­­ these are not just local wine merchants. These are people who ­­JUSTICE BREYER: That's your other argument. You can ­­ I can understand your argument as saying, no, there's enough Stateness in this that they become State officials.      JUSTICE BREYER:supports you because there they were clearly not private22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425people.  I mean, they weren't private merchants.  Theevil we are trying to get at was not present.MR. MOOPPAN: I guess the fundamental key is that I don't really take the FTC to be disputing that these are public officials. What they are saying is they are public officials who have a conflict of interest. They're saying that they're not disinterested public officials.      They're not saying that they're actuallyprivate people.  They're not saying that ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's say they have to be because they are, by State law, they must be privatepractitioners. They cannot beMR. MOOPPAN: They are ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: They can't be on thisboard unless you are a regularly practicing dentist. MR. MOOPPAN: They are also private people.They serve ­­ they have two hats.JUSTICE BREYER: Just that they're privatepeople.  The object of the antitrust laws is to preventprivate individuals who compete with each other inbusiness from getting together and making agreements.That kind of interest seems present here, present inMidcal, and present in all the other cases, but notpresent in Hallie.  Because in Hallie they were private,23Alderson Reporting Companyfull­time civil servants.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425yes, but they're not businesspeople about to makeagreements with each other in the sense that theantitrust law is concerned.MR. MOOPPAN: Well, two points about that, Your Honor. First of all, in Parker, the people on the commission were, in fact, market participants, and yet this Court still treated that ­­JUSTICE BREYER: If you don't ­­ you mightnot agree with my analysis, and because I'll work that one out. MR. MOOPPAN: Okay.­­ and go on with thisOfficial￼                                 So in setting asideParker, I think the more fundamental point is the ­­ theFederal antitrust laws shouldn't be interpreted tosecond guess whether a public official is really privatejust because they have a conflict of interest.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Goldfarb?MR. MOOPPAN:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:that the State bars the statesame agency for some limitedpurpose does not create an antitrust shield that allowsit to foster anticompetitive practices of the benefit toits members.MR. MOOPPAN: Absolutely. Goldfarb ­­ what you need in addition is a clearly articulated policy of24Do we set asideNo.  Goldfarb, the basis ­­      Goldfarb says the factAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 displaced competition. That was lacking in Goldfarb as2 the Court explained in Goldfarb and has reaffirmed in3 cases like Southern Motor Carriers, and it is present4 here and the FTC doesn't dispute ­­ or at least for5 present purposes that it is present here.6 The question in this case, unlike in7 Goldfarb, is whether a board that has public ­­ that has8 market participants on it are entitled to immunity even9 when enforcing a clearly articulated policy of displaced10 competition.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Mooppan, the two12 prongs of Midcal are supposed to operate in tandem with13 each other. They both have a role to play in ensuring14 that an actor is in accord with the State policy and is15 not acting solely to further his own interest.16 So the first prong comes along and says17 here's what ­­ there needs to be a State policy, and18 then the second prong ­­ because we understand that that19 policy is not going to answer all questions. There are20 going to be lots of little things that the actor does,21 and the question is going to be are you acting in accord22 with that State policy or not. And then there needs to23 be some supervision to ensure that the actor is acting24 in accord with State policy.25 So to strip the second half of the test off25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 is to leave the first half of the test essentially ­­2 you know, "meaningless" might be too strong, but3 unprotected. There's no way to make sure that the4 people are acting in accord with State policy rather5 than to serve their own interests.6 MR. MOOPPAN: Your Honor, I just7 fundamentally don't think that that is the point of the8 second prong. The point ­­ the concern that you are9 articulating, the way to solve that problem is through10 State administrator review. That's what Omni held. If11 there's a ­­ if there's a possibility that State12 officials are misapplying State law, are deviating from13 State policy, that can be solved through State14 administrator review, and Federal antitrust law was15 never intended to second guess16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you ­­17 MR. MOOPPAN: What active supervision is18 intended to do instead is to prevent the State from19 authorizing private people to violate Federal law, even20 if that's what the State wants. Take a case like21 Midcal, the economical act of supervision case.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think all over,23 Mr. Mooppan, it's in Patrick v. Burget, it's in other24 cases, that the act of supervision prong is ­­ is to25 make sure that the action is the State's own, it's in26Alderson Reporting Companythat question.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425accord with the State's policy. That's what it's doing. MR. MOOPPAN: By State's own, what the Court meant is they are not just authorizing private people toact illegally.  Take a case like Midcal where the Statesaid, go set prices.  No substantive standardwhatsoever.  There was no reason to think that theprivate people were acting contrary to the State policybecause the State just wanted to let them fix prices.      The point of active supervision in a caselike Midcal is to make sure that private parties are notjust being authorized the power to violate Federal lawbecause private parties are presumptively subject toFederal law and the only way they can get immunity is iftheir actions are made the State's own by the State'ssupervision.  That is not necessary when the State hasalready made their conduct their own by making thempublic officials and charging them with the State lawduty to enforce State law.If I can reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:27Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE SCALIA:What do you do about aOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      If the dental board were designated aprivate agency, this would be a paradigmatic caseillustrating the reasons that active supervision isrequired.  The board members, the majority of them atleast, are required to be practicing dentists, they havean evident self­interest in the manner in which thedental profession is regulated and in regulations thatmight keep other people from competing with dentists.      That natural self­interest is reinforced bythe method of selection.  North Carolina law providesthat the members of this dental board will be selectednot by the governor or by the public, but by thecommunity of dentists.JUSTICE KAGAN: You are not suggesting, or are you, that that's critical to your case?MR. STEWART: We're not saying that that's critical. That's simply a ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: It's just like an add­on feature.MR. STEWART: That's right. And ­­ and that's the way the commission treated it in its opinion. The commission didn't suggest that the outcome would have been different if the method of selection had been different.28Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425State supreme court that sets the ethics rules for thelegal profession, including what constitutes theunauthorized practice of law?  And let's assume theState has a requirement that all members of the Statesupreme court have to be lawyers.  What do you do aboutthat?MR. STEWART: I mean, this is essentially Goldfarb. Goldfarb involved the Virginia Bar, it was designated as a State agency as a matter of law.JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the Virginia Bar. I'm talking about the Supreme Court of Virginia.MR. STEWART: The Court in Goldfarb ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to say the Supreme Court of Virginia has to be actively supervised?MR. STEWART: No, the Supreme Court of Virginia ­­ the Supreme Court of any State, like the State legislature, speaks for the State itself.JUSTICE SCALIA: They are all lawyers.MR. STEWART: And that is simply an unavoidable exception, if you will, to the general requirement ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they are not practicing lawyers?MR. STEWART:They are not practicing29Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   lawyers.  Whatever marginal self­interest they mightOfficial￼ 2 3 4 5 6 7   rules.  But what I was saying about Goldfarb is that 8   Goldfarb dealt with the relationship between what the 9   Virginia Supreme Court did and what the Virginia Bar10   did.  And it said, of course, the Virginia ­­ the ethics11   rules promulgated by the Virginia Supreme Court would be12   the authoritative state policy ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe we can pursue this,14   because I think that's the question exactly that is15   bothering me, but I have another example of the same16   thing, and I think this is it's for me a very difficult17   case.  On the one hand, I absolutely understand the cases,18   and I understand why the law ­­ at least I think I do.19   You would be pretty careful about having a group of wine20   merchants set their own prices or decide who can sell wine.21   And the same is true of a group of railroads and the22   same is true of a group of truckers and the same is true23   blah, blah, blah, okay, probably including dentists.24 And soSo what we have is a set of pretty tough25   rules saying the State had better get in there and30have is outweighed by their status as supreme court bar­­ as supreme court justices.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably they also set judicial ethics rules.MR. STEWART: They would set judicial ethicsAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 supervise or you are subject to the antitrust laws.2 That to me is the state of the art. And that all seems3 fine and you seemed ­­ until I thought of a different4 example. Now, what they are is they are neurologists5 and they are brain surgeons, and what the State says is:6 We would like this group of brain surgeons to decide who7 can practice brain surgery in this State. I don't want8 a group of bureaucrats deciding that. I would like9 brain surgeons to decide that. Of course the risks are10 ­­ and so we have to have some supervision, I guess.11 What? What kind of supervision? And why isn't that12 present here? A, any rule has to go to some rule13 revision agency. B, before they can throw anybody out,14 they have to go into court and get a court order. And15 C, even these letters would be subject to their state16 ABA.17 So if I'm on your track, I want to see you18 talk about the neurologists and any kind of serious19 medical board, and I don't want to suddenly destroy all20 the temptation of medical boards throughout the country21 to decide everything in favor of letting in the22 unqualified person, lest he sue them under the antitrust23 law for treble damages and attorneys' fees. Those are24 the things that ­­ have you followed where I'm coming25 from? And I would very much appreciate your comment.31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. STEWART: What is true of the Dental2 Board in North Carolina and could also be true of the3 neurology or the more general medical board in another4 State is, as you say, any regulation that the board5 promulgates as a matter of North Carolina law is subject6 to review by the Rules Review Commission. And that's a7 body of disinterested State actors who pass on the8 validity of the rules, that the standard in the statute9 is the Rules Review Commission determines is the10 regulation reasonably necessary to implement the11 statute, which at least suggests to me that the review12 commission is engaged in something like de novo review:13 Does this reflect the correct reading of the law.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Really, really? You are15 going to have a review board composed of16 non­neurologists deciding de novo whether a particular17 person should be admitted or a particular rule should be18 adopted?19 MR. STEWART: For rules, and the basis20 for ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 a neurologist to decide it.23 MR. STEWART: If the State wanted a board of24 expert practitioners to be able to promulgate rules and25 have those rules reviewed deferentially within the State32Alderson Reporting CompanyI don't want that.  I wantOfficial￼1 agency, then the question would arise, is deferential2 review sufficient to constitute active supervision? If3 it were de novo, yes. Patrick v. Burget makes clear4 that extremely deferential review, review only for5 procedural regularity, is not sufficient. And the6 question, is Chevron­type review enough, that's an open7 question.8 But the main point I'm making about the9 Rules Review Commission is North Carolina evidently10 doesn't believe that there is anything amiss with an11 agency composed of ­­ the Rules Review Commission, an12 agency composed of nonexperts, reviewing the regulations13 promulgated by an expert body for consistency with the14 governing statutes.15 Now, the question of exclusion of an16 individual member, a proceeding to revoke the license of17 a particular practitioner, whether or not that would18 qualify for State action immunity, it's very unlikely to19 have adverse consequences for competition as a whole20 and, therefore, would not likely be a subject of21 antitrust concern.22 I'm sorry, Mr. Justice.23 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you tell me as24 precisely as you can the contours of the rule that you25 are advocating? You told Justice Kagan that election33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 isn't essential to the analysis here. So is it2 essential that the statute ­­ that the statute3 stipulates that the members must be dentists? If they4 were appointed by the governor, would that take care of5 it? If the governor had to appoint dentists, would that6 ­­ would that involve the same problem? Is it essential7 that they must all be dentists? What if there is a8 breakdown between dentists and nondentists?9 Let me just add this. What if there is no10 requirement that they be dentists but the governor11 always chooses dentists, because there's a very powerful12 dentist lobby; so he is always going to put dentists on13 this board exclusively.14 MR. STEWART: I would say two things ­­ I'd15 say three things maybe. I think, first, we would say16 our theory still applies that the self­interest would be17 present whether or not they were required to be18 dentists.19 The second thing we would say is, but that's20 a harder case. In that situation you would at least21 need to look beyond the statute books in order to22 determine whether the people were dentists and you would23 get, at least, a little closer to Omni ­­24 JUSTICE ALITO: I think that's what troubles25 me about your position because it seems to lead to a34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 case, State by State, board by board, inquiry by the2 Federal courts as to whether the members of a regulatory3 body are really serving the public interest or whether4 they have been captured by some special interest?5 MR. STEWART: But I guess the third point I was6 going to make is we're not aware of any board like that.7 That is, the amicus briefs on both sides say that it is8 a frequent practice for States to establish regulatory9 boards that are required by law to be composed of10 members of the profession being regulated, and the11 amicus briefs on the other side says, that's a good and12 efficient practice. The amicus briefs on our side say13 that's a problem. But they all agree that that is a14 prevalent practice.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Under that practice, you16 said it's not an antitrust violation: Boycott. The guy17 didn't get into the profession. He flunked the exam.18 The antitrust lawyer says: I'm out of this profession;19 I would offer them competition. We only have 8220 qualified people in this specialty in this State. Now21 there is only 81. That makes a difference. Their22 questions are unfair, they are against me, and for a23 bunch of reasons.24 Silver v. New York Stock Exchange. You25 know, it's not hard to make up reasons. I don't want to35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 cut you off from Justice Alito, but I would like you to2 also, in doing that, to think about what my problem is.3 It's the neurologists who are subject to the antitrust4 suit. And the answer seems to lie in the kind of5 supervision that you are advocating.6 Now, go ahead and go back to Justice Alito,7 but I put that in your mind.8 MR. STEWART: I guess the point I was going9 to make is, while there is a frequent practice of States10 requiring by law that regulatory boards be staffed by11 members of the profession, that there appears to be no12 instance in which the State left it up to the governor13 whom to decide whom to appoint and the governor chose to14 appoint only practitioners. I mean, part of our point15 in this case ­­16 JUSTICE ALITO: Does that mean that is what17 is critical in your opinion, that there is a State18 statute that says they must be dentists? If that19 weren't there, but the governor always chose dentists20 because he wants the dentists' vote and the dentists are21 very powerful in that particular State ­­22 MR. STEWART: We're not prepared to give23 that up, but we don't think that that's as strong a24 case. I mean, the fact that they are required to be25 dentists signals that they are there in their capacity36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 as such.2 JUSTICE ALITO: If you are not prepared to3 give that up, then I really don't understand the4 contours of your rule. And I find it troubling, because5 I really am not attracted to the idea of Federal courts6 looking at State agencies, State regulatory entities, to7 determine whether they are really serving the public8 interest or they are serving some private interest.9 MR. STEWART: We're certainly not advocating10 that the Court look to the internal subjective11 decision­making processes of the individual members.12 That is, if the members were ­­ if the membership of the13 board were people who had no active participation in the14 dental profession, who had no economic interest.15 The Court in Omni Outdoor certainly made it clear that16 the Court is not supposed to be probing whether, in17 fact, an individual board member made a decision based18 on illicit criteria.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: So to the same sort of20 question. Suppose that, you know, we come out with a21 ruling that makes clear that an all­dentists board is22 not okay and then a State says, okay, we'll do a board23 with five dentists and three non­dentists. How do we24 feel about that.25 MR. STEWART: It would still be a37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 majority or I think the commission used some phrase like2 "decisive coalition." And in this case, in a sense, the3 majority treatment of the dentists on the board was4 exacerbated. Only six of nine of the board members are5 actually practicing dentists. But three of the6 members ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about ex­dentists?8 They're ­­ they're no longer practicing. But they're9 all dentists and they have a lot of dentist friends.10 They're sympathetic to the profession of dentistry. Are11 you going to give them a pass?12 MR. STEWART: I think if the ­­ if you ­­13 the board were composed of retired dentists, people who14 were selected because they had expertise but no current15 financial interest, that would be a legitimate way of16 staffing.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That’s okayOkay. Okay. Do18 you really think that the financial interest of the19 individual members of the board is going to be20 significantly affected? Of each individual member of21 the board? My goodness. I ­­ I find that hard to22 believe.23 MR. STEWART: I guess to my ­­ to my24 previous answer, I should add if those board members25 were selected by a dispassionate State official; that38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 is, there could also be circumstances in which board2 members themselves had no financial interest but were3 selected by those who do. And that might be treated as4 a separate ­­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, going back to6 Justice Alito's question, if we have to look at it board7 by board, if I were a private practitioner and, in8 Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a neurologist came to me9 and said, I think it's important for us to do standards,10 can I get on this board? I say, have no part of it.11 Triple damages, attorneys' fees. You can't even afford12 to defend this case. Get off that board. That's going13 to be the consequence of your ­­ of the rule you14 advocate it seems to me.15 MR. STEWART: There's no problem with active16 participation by ­­ but there's no problem with the17 board ­­ boards being staffed by active practitioners so18 long as they are adequately supervised.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that consist of ­­ if20 you want my off­the­cuff idea, which is probably not21 particularly good to give you ­­ that active ­­ that22 supervision consists of either your board on regulation23 or a court which, when reviewing what they do, does so24 with an awareness of the State law and the subject and25 also the risks of anticompetitive harms. Ready to set39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 it aside if, in fact, those risks, which are outside2 what the State law wants, seem likely to eventuate.3 Now, I could write such a standard pretty4 vaguely and that's not necessarily the right standard.5 But this whole thing turns to me on what the supervision6 consists of and whether it's good enough or not here.7 And so that's why I repeat for the ­­ you know, like the8 third time, and I think you ­­ probably the government9 doesn't have a definite position on this or what it10 consists of.11 MR. STEWART:12 JUSTICE BREYER:13 just want to ­­14 MR. STEWART:15 different things that could qualify as adequate16 supervision and, in part, that turns on the nature of17 the question to be answered. That is, the difficult18 question that is posed in this case or the ­­ the19 ultimate contested question is: Is teeth whitening the20 practice of dentistry as defined by North Carolina law?21 That is a question of statutory interpretation. The22 North Carolina statute speaks of removing stains or23 accretions from the human teeth. There are arguments on24 both sides as to whether that encompasses the teeth25 whitening methods that are used today. That's the kind40I mean, there are different ­­   Not that you should.  But II mean, there are ­­ there areAlderson Reporting Companyof dispute that is capable of being definitivelyresolved by ­­Official￼1234567 not ­­8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it's not, then9 you're going to have the neurology qualification10 determination made by some people in the State who are11 not neurologists. Now, that to me spells danger.12 MR. STEWART: And the point I was going to13 make was the determination of whether a particular14 individual is qualified to practice neurology is a15 different sort of question from the issue is teeth16 whitening the practice of dentistry. That question is17 one of law that a court is capable of deciding. It18 might or might not give deference to the views of a19 particular administrative agency.20 In our view, it would certainly make sense21 not, as a matter of State administrative law, not to22 give deference to the view of self­interested23 practitioners for the same reasons that ­­ on that legal24 question for the same reasons that ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the ­­ I'm41JUSTICE BREYER: But they'd have to give deference to the expert board's determination that would be normal.MR. STEWART: They ­­ they might or mightAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 sorry. Please.2 MR. STEWART: ­­ for the same reason that we3 think the State action immunity shouldn't apply.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if one of5 the members of the board is appointed as a full­time6 member of the board for a one­year term and he's ­­ he's7 called the board state supervisor, is that good enough?8 MR. STEWART: I mean, it depends on what ­­9 first, it would ­­ we would want to look into the10 question does that alleviate his financial interest.11 What is his ­­12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. It's only ­­13 it's one year. But for that one year he's not14 practicing dentistry or whatever. And that way the15 supervisor is ­­ responsive to Justice Breyer's16 concern ­­ the supervisor knows what he's talking about17 when it comes to dentistry.18 MR. STEWART: I guess in ­­ in order even19 potentially to qualify as satisfying the active20 supervision requirement, the one supervisory member21 would have to have the power to countermand the orders22 issued by the other members. If it were simply one and23 he were designated a supervisor, but he didn't have the24 authority to do ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So he has the42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 authority. For that one year, he can veto whatever the2 board decides to do.3 MR. STEWART: I'm ­­ I'm hesitant to take a4 position on behalf of the FTC because it would turn on5 part ­­ in part on would the expectation that this6 person will return to private practice after a year be7 sufficient to maintain his fundamentally private8 characteristic.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, the question10 that follows is: What if all of the members of the11 board have to refrain from the practice of dentistry12 during the year that they serve? And you're saying you13 don't know what the answer will be to that? What the14 FTC will say to that? I know what the FTC will say to15 that.16 MR. STEWART: Well, I guess part of what I17 would say in response to these hypotheticals ­­ and it's18 not that they're not legitimate questions. But this ­­19 this seems to us to be the case at the furthest end of20 the spectrum from those. This is a case in which the21 only members of the board who actually participated in22 the decision to issue the cease and desist letters were23 practicing dentists. They were people who were required24 by law to be practicing dentists. They were appointed25 by other practicing dentists.43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 The other thing I would say ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart, the problem3 with your answer, at least for me, is that you're being4 asked for the rule that we're going to announce not just5 in this case, but to guide the decision­making for6 future courts. I mean, just to say this board we can do7 it the way Judge Keenan did, and say it was an elected8 board, but an appointed board is different. We can say9 one of a dozen sort of limitations or not. So what do10 we say? How do we articulate your ruling?11 MR. STEWART: I mean, the way I read both12 Judge Keenan's concurrence and the majority opinion is13 both of those said, at least where the members are14 selected by other practicing dentists, there is no State15 action immunity. We leave for another day the question16 whether the outcome would be different if the members17 were selected by the government.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, that's what the19 Supreme Court does. It walks that line and it goes and20 looks at the trajectory we're taking. And some of my21 colleagues have expressed the concern that the22 trajectory will involve us in case after case trying to23 decide how far too far is.24 MR. STEWART: And frankly, if the Court25 wanted to say, as part of its opinion, as long as they44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 are actually required by law to be practicing dentists,2 there's no State action immunity, but if the law doesn't3 require that and it happens to be the pattern of4 gubernatorial appointment, if the Court says that ­­ the5 outcome would, in fact, be different in that case, we6 would prefer that to a decision that says we're going to7 give these boards a blanket pass because we can foresee8 some hard questions at the end of the day.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Look. Take your ­­ suppose10 I write that down. Still the problem in the back of my11 mind is there are now 311 million Americans who are12 going to have medical care. And this is ­­ I agree with13 you. This is at one extreme. But ­­ but those words14 that you just enunciated seem to cover to exactly the15 same extent every medical specialty. And I've16 articulated that already that that's my concern. So I17 wonder if you can do something a little bit better18 before we say that the doctors cannot be active doctors19 and decide on the qualifications of doctors.20 MR. STEWART: I guess the ­­ the two21 things ­­ the two or three things I would say are first,22 I think the decisions about whether particular23 individual practitioners will be licensed or have their24 license ­­ license revoked is a fundamentally different25 type of determination from the legal question is teeth45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 whitening or some other generic type of service the2 practice of dentistry within particular State law.3 The second thing is although, Justice4 Sotomayor, you're certainly right that the Court doesn't5 announce decisions that are good for one case only and6 leave every other question unresolved, the Court also ­­7 the Court also does proceed incrementally and it doesn't8 feel disabled from announcing the right rule in the case9 before it simply because it can foresee both that10 difficult cases will arise in the future and that the11 rule it's announcing won't clearly revolve ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have very long13 sentences, so it's very hard not to interrupt you. I ­­14 I don't agree with your first point. I don't see that15 there's an immense difference between establishing16 the ­­ the standards for a profession and excluding an17 individual from the profession. My goodness. What ­­18 what is a more obvious restriction of competition than19 preventing somebody from competing? I ­­ I don't see20 how you draw that line. Well, it's one thing to say21 that so­and­so can't practice, but it's another thing22 to ­­ to say that tooth whitening is ­­ is part of the23 practice. It seems to me they both involve24 anticompetitive decisions.25 MR. STEWART: They ­­ they involve46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 anticompetitive decisions and they involve ­­ they2 require the State to tap into expertise. That is, the3 basic decision to prohibit unlicensed individuals from4 removing stains or accretions from teeth was made by the5 North Carolina legislature back many decades ago.6 Obviously, the North Carolina legislature is not an7 expert body, it's not composed of dentists, but8 presumably they got input from the dental profession and9 they ­­ they tapped into the relative expertise for10 purposes of making their decision.11 The determination, once the statutory12 structure has been established, the determination13 whether teeth whitening falls within one of the14 enumerated categories is not really establishing the15 standards. It is interpreting the existing standards.16 And that does require some interstitial discretionary17 decision­making. And our point, as ­­ as Justice Kagan18 was alluding to earlier, is we want those interstitial19 decisions to be made by disinterested persons or at20 least, if they're not made by disinterested persons, we21 don't feel confident that they truly reflect the policy22 choices of the State legislature itself.23 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if the24 North Carolina courts were to decide tomorrow that25 whitening is the practice of dentistry under this old47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 statute?2 MR. STEWART: If the North Carolina ­­ I3 mean, to make the case clearest, if the North Carolina4 Supreme Court held as an authoritative construction of5 State law, I mean, that would basically be the end of6 it. There could still be potential arguments that the7 mode of enforcement had anticompetitive consequences8 that went beyond the basic prohibition. But ­­ but for9 all intents and purposes, just as if the North Carolina10 legislature had specified that non­dentists cannot11 lawfully perform teeth whitening, that policy choice12 would not be subject to second­guessing by the FTC or a13 Federal antitrust court.14 Similarly, if the North Carolina Supreme15 Court said, we construe the existing statute to have16 that meaning, that determination also wouldn't be17 subject to review by an antitrust court. And18 there's been a lot of ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: Just to follow up on that.20 So was the FTC decision predicated on the proposition21 that this was not ­­ whitening teeth was not within this22 old statute?23 MR. STEWART: It was ­­ the FTC specifically24 declined to announce a decision one way or the other;25 that is, the complaint counsel in prosecuting the case48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 before the commission offered reasons to believe that2 teeth whitening was not covered by this provision. And3 basically, there were two reasons. The first is that4 scientifically, teeth whitening does not result in the5 removal of stains or accretions. The staining material6 remains in the enamel. It's simply bleached so that the7 discoloration is less and it's not so evident.8 The second type of evidence that complaint9 counsel offered was that, back when the statute was10 passed, the methods of removing stains and accretions11 that would have been familiar to the legislature12 involved scraping, chipping, to some extent electronic13 instruments. It was the type of procedure that could14 not safely be done by people who lacked expertise.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you know, last week we16 had a case in which the North Carolina Court of Appeals17 held that an old motor vehicle statute required only one18 brake light rather than two brake lights. So it doesn't19 seem that an interpretation of this statute to cover20 whitening would be completely out of the question.21 MR. STEWART: We agree. And as I say, the22 commission specifically declined to announce a decision23 one way or the other as to what was the correct reading24 of North Carolina law.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:49Alderson Reporting CompanyI thought they agreed toOfficial￼1 the stipulation that this was an articulated State2 policy, and the question was must there be in addition3 supervision. But you ­­ you've conceded for purposes of4 this argument the articulated State policy, didn't you?5 MR. STEWART: Well, we conceded ­­ the6 commission assumed arguendo that there was a clearly7 articulated State policy. But if, for instance, rather8 than having the dental board composed of dentists, they9 were composed of disinterested bureaucrats who would10 hear from dentists but would make their own11 determination. The clear articulation requirement would12 be satisfied because clear articulation can be satisfied13 by something phrased at a relatively high level of14 generality. And so ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the consequences of a16 decision in your favor were that no professionals or17 representative of any occupation would ever serve on a18 government board where there's any chance of antitrust19 liability, would that, in20 purposes of the antitrust21 MR. STEWART:22 were the consequence of the Court's decision, then we23 would be very leery of urging this result. But we see24 in cases like Goldfarb that the Virginia bar, for25 instance, was held to be susceptible to suit under the50your view, advance thelaws?I mean, if we thought thatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 antitrust laws and could not invoke the State action2 immunity because it was3 Supreme Court, and that4 inducing members of the5 association activities.6 Just to finish my answer to Justice7 Ginsburg, even if the statute is phrased at a relatively8 high level of generality that leaves some interstitial9 questions unresolved, it can still satisfy clear10 articulation. So if we had a body of disinterested11 bureaucrats who said we interpret the phrase "removal of12 stains and accretions" to include teeth whitening, we'd13 have clear articulation in the statute even though it14 didn't resolve every question. And then we would have a15 determination made by a body that would not require16 active supervision and that would be good enough. That17 would satisfy the prerequisites to State action immunity18 as this Court has articulated.19 If I could, I'd like to make two ­­ two20 additional points. The first is that there was a fair21 amount of talk in the first part of the argument about22 the oath. The oath is at North Carolina General Statute23 11­7, and basically, the members of the board, like ­­24 like people who are designated State officials25 generally, will take an oath to support the51out ahead of the Virginiahasn't had the effect ofbar en masse to refrain from barAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Constitutions of North Carolina and the United States2 and to essentially be loyal to the State of North3 Carolina.4 It's essentially a State law version of the5 oath that new members of this Court's bar take in ­­6 take when they're sworn, as was done this morning. I7 believe the members ­­ I know the members of the bar8 swear to support the Constitution of the United States.9 I believe that they also swear to faithfully execute10 their duties as officers of the Court and members of the11 bar of this Court.12 But when private counsel take that oath, no13 one imagines that they lose their private character, and14 in particular, nobody construes that oath as a promise15 by private counsel that he will place the interests of16 the general public ahead of the interests of his17 clients. Everybody understands that vigorous18 representation of a particular constituency may be19 consistent with ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's because what they're21 promising to do is to serve as faithful private counsel.22 If they were being sworn in to an agency and promise to23 execute their duties in accordance with law, it would be24 quite different. And that's what's happening here.25 MR. STEWART: There's nothing in the oath52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that requires them to place the interests of the public2 on a par with the interests of the dental community.3 And everything about their selection ­­ the fact that4 they are required to be dentists, the fact that they are5 selected by other dentists ­­ reinforces the sense that6 they are expected to treat the dental community as their7 constituency.8 And the last thing I'd say is a lot of the9 debate in areas like this centers on the idea of the10 profession regulating itself; neurologists regulating11 neurologists, dentists regulating dentists. A lot of12 what the board does is dentists regulation ­­ regulating13 dentists. But this case is not about that. This case14 is about dentists regulating non­dentists and, in15 particular, dentists telling dentists ­­ telling16 non­dentists in what endeavors can you legally compete17 with dentists. And so the concerns that underlie the18 Sherman Act with unfair restrictions on competition are19 at their zenith in a case like this one. Thank you.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.21 Mr. Mooppan, you have 4 minutes remaining.22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN23 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER24 MR. MOOPPAN: I'd like to begin with Justice25 Breyer's question. The ultimate question in this case53Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 is how to balance a cost­benefit question.2 There are benefits from having experts, and3 there are risks from having experts be regulators, and4 the question is who should make the decision of how to5 weigh those costs and balance those risks. And what the6 government is arguing is that the Federal antitrust laws7 second­guess the State's decision about how to balance8 that risk.9 The States have decided that the better way10 to handle the situation where you have experts like11 neurologists is to have some level of supervision, but12 not the level of active supervision that is required for13 private parties.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not simply say that the15 supervisor, be it the Court or be it the commission,16 must, when it decides the lawfulness of the agency's17 action or the private board's action, take into account18 the risks of self­dealing as well as the State policy19 that favors them making this decision, and where the20 consequence is an unreasonable weighing, it is unlawful21 under State law.22 Now, that way you bring in an anti­trust23 element, it would comport with Midcal, you would be24 guarding against self­dealing without interfering25 tremendously with the state.54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, for two reasons. First,2 Your Honor, because the states are allowed to act3 anti­competitively. The states don't have to make a4 balance between anti­competitive benefits and public5 benefits. The states can unabashedly act competitively6 if they wish.7 It would also be extremely complicated8 because what you would essentially have are two9 different versions of active supervision. One standard10 of active supervision that applies to private parties11 and one standard of active supervision that applies to12 public officials who also have private interests.13 That's the reason why Mr. Stewart wouldn't14 answer your question by saying any of those things would15 work because they will never say that that stuff works16 for purely private parties. They will never say that17 just near ­­18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. I'm sorry.19 MR. MOOPPAN: I was just going to say they20 would never say that the mere ability to have some level21 of review is good enough for private parties because22 even they recognize there is a fundamental difference23 between a private party and a public official who also24 has private interests.25 JUSTICE KAGAN:55Alderson Reporting CompanyMr. Mooppan, the activeOfficial￼1 supervision requirement has been around a long time and2 it varies case by case and state by state. There are a3 wide, wide, wide variety of mechanisms that might4 satisfy the active supervision prong in a particular5 state with respect to a particular kind of activity.6 But what you are suggesting is that that7 prong be simply removed from the analysis, that it be8 utterly irrelevant, that there is no supervision at all,9 and that's a very different and much more dramatic10 thing.11 MR. MOOPPAN: Well, what I'm suggesting is12 twofold. First, the act of supervision is a fairly13 rigorous standard and I am sure the FTC would have told14 you that if you had asked them that question precisely.15 And I'm saying that it ­­ the issue here isn't whether16 these people will be unsupervised. The question is who17 will determine what level of supervision. And the18 question is whether the state should decide that a lower19 level of supervision is the appropriate one, balancing20 expertise versus the risk of conflicts of interests.21 And especially when you're dealing with supervision of22 market participants. There is a grave risk that if you23 require too much supervision as a condition of24 anti­trust immunity, no one will serve on these boards.25 Mr. Stewart said he would be leery of56Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 advocating this position if we would have a high2 deterrence effect. Well, there is an amicus brief from3 the ADA and the AMA and from 23 states, all of whom4 express grave concern that if you require supervision5 market participants will not serve on these boards, and6 that is the sort of concern this Court has recognized in7 cases like Hoover v. Romlin.8 It is fundamentally up to the state to9 determine how to bear this risk. Whether they want to10 say that the benefits of expertise outweigh the risks of11 conflicts of interest. That is what this Court held in12 cases like Omni, that the Sherman Act is not intended to13 serve as some general rule of good government. It is up14 to the state to determine how they want to regulate as15 sovereigns.16 The final point I would like to make is17 about Justice Alito's question about what would happen18 if the State Supreme Court tomorrow said that teeth19 whitening was the practice of dentistry. I'm not quite20 sure I understood Mr. Stewart's position but the holding21 below is that active supervision is required regardless22 of whether there is clear articulation, so I would think23 that there would be liability regardless of what24 the Court did in the future.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.57Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
