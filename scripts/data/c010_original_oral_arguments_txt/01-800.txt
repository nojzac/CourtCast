Dean Witter Reynolds. Mr. Friedberg.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C. FRIEDBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. FRIEDBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:There is at least a little irony in the fact that Dean Witter is the litigant here before you, about 27 years past the time when it started with Dean Witter and Byrd the -- the move toward closing the courthouse doors to public investors and forcing them into industry-run arbitration. Dean Witter is now back here attempting to place a hurdle in the way of the public investor who ironically at this point seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement.The issue today before the Court is the extent to which the industry and Dean Witter may now invoke court involvement to interfere with a customer's claims before arbitration and -- and to decide whether the customer's claims are timely under a section of an arbitration code providing for a time limitation on eligibility. The issue is who decides.3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 It is clear that -- that over the years a2 presumption has developed in favor of arbitrability where3 there is an arbitration clause in a contract. And the4 cases say that that presumption can only be overcome by5 clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to6 have a court decide arbitrability issues within a --7 within the scope of an arbitration agreement. In this8 case, there is no such evidence.9 The arbitration clause in the 1992 agreement10 between the parties is as broad a clause as one can11 imagine. The client agrees that all controversies between12 her and Dean Witter concerning or arising from any account13 or any transaction involving Dean Witter and the client,14 whether or not it occurred in the account, or the15 construction, performance, or breach of this or any other16 agreement between us. It's an industry-designed17 arbitration clause, meant to be as broad as possible. The18 intent clearly is to move cases against brokers by19 customers out of the courts and into arbitration.20 That -- that 1992 agreement was, of course,21 followed by a 1997 submission agreement signed by22 Ms. Howsam which merely states that as an undersigned23 party, she and her trust submit the present matter in24 controversy, as set forth in the attached statement of25 claim, to arbitration in accordance with the Constitution,4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 by-laws, rules, regulations, and/or code of arbitration2 procedure of the sponsoring organization. In this case,3 it's the NASD, but the -- the other self-regulatory4 organizations and exchanges have similar rules to the 6-5 year rule.6 QUESTION: It seems to me that some of the7 language in First Options, which the respondent relies on8 cuts against your case. How -- how do you deal with that?9 MR. FRIEDBERG: Well, first of all, First10 Options is a case in which there was a question about11 whether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the12 case here. And Justice Breyer, writing for the Court,13 wrote that -- that in that situation, the presumption14 shifts.15 The AT&T case -- clearly the -- when the16 question is just the scope of an arbitration agreement,17 but there is no question about the existence of the18 agreement, there needs to be clear and unmistakable19 evidence of an intent to have the courts decide rather20 than the arbitrators decide.21 QUESTION: The respondents here, of course,22 argue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the23 6 years, that limits the scope of the -- of the24 arbitration agreement.25 MR. FRIEDBERG: The -- the respondent, of5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 course, is -- is referring to rule 10304, which says that2 -- that disputes which arose out of transactions or events3 more than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to4 arbitration.5 First of all, that -- that rule is found in a6 section of the arbitration code. It's not found in the7 agreement itself. And it's found in a section of the Code8 of Arbitration Procedure.9 QUESTION: Well, so is 10324 which you're10 relying on. That is, the arbitrator shall be empowered to11 interrupt12 that's --1314 the point15 codehastobereadas--asonecodeinthat--inthat16 respect.17 The -- it's also, I think, illuminating that the18 -- the section, the 300 series of the code in which that19 is found, is -- is not the eligibility section in the20 sense that the 100 series is. The 300 series is -- is21 basically a procedural, instructive portion of the code22 for the arbitrators to apply.23 There is some -- we -- we've made the argument24 and -- and I think it's a valid argument -- that eligible25 for submission can mean a number of things. And -- and6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005and determine the applicability of. I mean,MR. FRIEDBERG: Exactly, Justice Scalia. And I was -- was trying to make is that -- that the￼1 that it refers, in this case to -- it could refer in this2 case to when the arbitrators take the case under3 submission, just as this Court takes the case under4 submission after the petition, after the briefing, after5 the arguments are made.6 There -- there is, of course, the need to get7 the case in front of a tribunal in order to -- to decide8 whether or not the case is timely. So while the rule may9 prevent the case from going all the way to the end zone,10 it -- it certainly doesn't prevent the -- the litigant11 from or the -- the person arbitrating from -- from getting12 out of the starting gate.13 Moreover --14 QUESTION: Is -- is that your criterion, that --15 that -- the -- on -- on the question of what -­16 arbitrability turns on the question, do you get in front17 of the particular person or tribunal at all as opposed to18 how long do you stay when you get there? In other words,19 if -- if it's a question of whether you get there at all,20 it's -- the question is arbitrability and the presumption21 goes one way. If the question is how long you stay there22 if you get in front of that person, that's not an23 arbitrability question and the presumption goes the other24 way. Is that -- that's your point.25 MR. FRIEDBERG: That -- that is one point,7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Justice Souter.2 The -- the other point that -- that needs to be3 made is that whether or not this is part of the code, part4 of an agreement, it falls within the John Wiley and Moses5 Cone case law as opposed to the First Options holding.6 And in -- in John Wiley, if the Court will recall, there7 were prerequisites, timeliness prerequisites, to filing8 for arbitration, which the Court said, because there was9 an arbitration agreement and there was no dispute about10 that, were for the arbitrators to decide.11 In Moses H. Cone Hospital, there were -- there12 were prerequisites of timeliness. The -- as I recall, the13 arbitration had to be filed within 30 days after an14 opinion by an architect as to the disputed contracting15 claims. And so -- and -- and the Court -- the Court16 clearly said in Moses Cone that the Federal Arbitration17 Act establishes as a matter of Federal law that any doubts18 concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be19 resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the contract20 involves construction of the contract language itself or21 an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to22 arbitrability.23 QUESTION: -- definition of the domain of24 arbitrability? You're saying shall be eligible for25 submission just means that the arbitration forum doesn't8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 get to the merits if more than 6 years have elapsed. But2 -- so you say that's not a question of arbitrability but3 how the arbitrator will proceed.4 What is your definition of arbitrability?5 MR. FRIEDBERG: Justice Ginsburg, our -- our6 definition of arbitrability I think has to be broader than7 that. But there is -- there is the merits arbitrability.8 There is the --9 QUESTION: Well, the question that doesn't go to10 the arbitrator -- you're saying this one does. It's just11 he has to take it up first -- or she. But we're dealing12 with, if it's a question of arbitrability, the courts13 decide it. If it's not a question of arbitrability, but14 the -- the range of other questions, then it's for the15 arbitrator.16 So my question is, what -- the domain for the17 court -- the question is it arbitrable is a question for18 the court. What is the content of that label, arbitrable?19 MR. FRIEDBERG: It's a hard question for me to20 get my hands around, Justice Ginsburg, but there -- there21 is no question that in the first instance the court has to22 decide whether a claim is -- is arbitrable. And -- and if23 the court finds that -- that there is an arbitration24 clause that covers the merits of the dispute, then the25 court should defer to arbitrators on any question9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 regarding 234scope.QUESTION: Well, now --MR.

I6 the arbitrator to do this and wanted the court to do it,7 you -- you don't dispute that the court would do it.8 Right?9 MR. FRIEDBERG: Right.10 QUESTION: So it's just a question of contract.11 Now, you concede the point that arbitrability is12 for the courts. Right?13 MR. FRIEDBERG: Right.14 QUESTION: So presumably if 10304 had read no15 dispute, claim, or controversy shall be arbitrable, okay,16 under -- under this code where 6 years have elapsed, that17 would -- would that exclude this from -- from the18 arbitrator?￼19 2021 term that22 court.232425 using theMR. FRIEDBERG: I believe not, Justice Scalia. QUESTION: My goodness, it's using the exact you concede sends it over to the -- to theMR. FRIEDBERG: Well --QUESTION: It -- what do you have to do beyond -- the very word that you say bounces it to the10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425court? They say it. It shall not be arbitrable. And even that will not -- will not get it to the courts. What -- what does one have to do to get it to the courts?MR. FRIEDBERG: Well --QUESTION: And my next question is going to be, is there a whole lot of difference between saying it shall not be arbitrable and saying, it shall not be eligible for submission to arbitration?MR. FRIEDBERG: I'm not --QUESTION: And I don't think there is.MR. FRIEDBERG: I don't think there is either,Justice Scalia.QUESTION: Okay. Which is why you're fightingme so hard on this. Right? (Laughter.)MR. FRIEDBERG: Precisely.I think what we have to do is look to the case law, including the ATT case and -- and its progeny, and First Options says the same thing really, that the court has to decide in the first instance is there an arbitration agreement. Having decided -- and in this case it's undisputed -- that there is an arbitration agreement, then the question is, does it go to the substance of the case or is it a matter of the scope? And the cases say, starting with the Gulf and Warrior --11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: What happened to the intent of the2 parties?3 MR. FRIEDBERG: That -- that's what --4 QUESTION: I mean, you're talking as -- as5 though this is some law being sent down from on high. I6 thought we established that step one is what did the7 parties intend.8 MR. FRIEDBERG: Right.9 QUESTION: And you say that even if the parties10 say it's not arbitrable, well, that doesn't matter. We11 still go through this -- this game that seems to come down12 from on high.13 MR. FRIEDBERG: But the question is who will14 decide a certain issue of arbitrability, and AT&T and --15 and Moses H. Cone and First Options even says that once16 you find that there's an agreement to arbitrate the17 substance of the -- the dispute, then the question is did18 the parties, by unmistakable evidence, agree that the19 courts, rather than the arbitrators, would decide that20 scope issue.￼2122 under our 232425QUESTION: So then you're saying arbitrability cases is not for the court necessarily.MR. FRIEDBERG: I'm saying --QUESTION: I mean, you can't have it both ways. MR. FRIEDBERG: There -- there's a --12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: If you say arbitrability is for the2 courts, then if the -- if the agreement between the3 parties says this is not arbitrable, that question of --4 of whether those facts exist or not ought to be for the5 courts.6 MR. FRIEDBERG: I think that's true for that7 threshold issue, but if we get to a point where all issues8 that -- that may preclude ultimately submitting the case9 to the arbitrators for determination have to be decided by10 the court, then we're running afoul of John Wiley.11 QUESTION: I -- I didn't understand it that way.12 I thought the question was not what the parties intend.13 It's how we find out what they intend. And I thought14 we're trying to decide between a tough burden of proof15 standard on that that favors courts and where you apply no16 burden of proof standard or, if anything, favor the17 arbitration. In both instances, we're trying to find out18 what the party intended. But we assume that they intended19 court unless there is clear and convincing evidence they20 wanted this arbitrable. Am I right?21 MR. FRIEDBERG: I think you're wrong, Justice22 Breyer, although --23 QUESTION: Because? Then I may not have stated24 it correctly.25 MR. FRIEDBERG: I think what -- what the --13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425again, what the initial issue for the Court is, did the parties agree to arbitrate the substance of the dispute.QUESTION: Yes, of course, and I thought what my opinion said was that when we're trying to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate or not, we apply a fairly tough standard. They have to show rather clearly that they did.What were the -- what was the word you quoted at the beginning from the opinion? Didn't you quote a phrase that said on that -- in deciding whether an issue is arbitrable, we apply the standard of?MR. FRIEDBERG: I believe I Moses H. Cone --QUESTION: Yes. I'm sorry.MR. FRIEDBERG: -- decision -- which says that the presumption isarbitrator's deciding.quoted from theYou go ahead. which -- which says in favor of the￼QUESTION: I'll get the phrase and then -- I'm not communicating. I'm sorry.QUESTION: I -- Justice Ginsburg asked a question that I'm also interested in. Quite apart from the reference of -- in the agreement to the fact that the arbitrator shall decide this, your second argument, on your first argument, what do you want me to say if I write the opinion or another member of the Court writes the14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 opinion in your favor? If the essence of the dispute2 involves the particular issue, then that is arbitrable and3 that's for the arbitrators to decide?4 MR. FRIEDBERG: No. I --5 QUESTION: I -- I just don't know what you want6 us to write. It's the same question Justice Ginsburg had.7 MR. FRIEDBERG: Justice Kennedy, it's basically8 what was announced in the AT&T case when it was sent back9 to the court to decide who decides certain questions. The10 Court should decide in this case that where there's a11 valid, written agreement to arbitrate the subject matter12 or the merits of the dispute, particularly where the13 arbitration clause encompasses all controversies and the14 parties have not clearly and unmistakably reserved certain15 issues of arbitrability for a court decision and -- and I16 mean, within the scope as opposed to the basic dispute --17 the presumption in favor of arbitrability should apply,18 and issues relating to the scope of the arbitration19 agreement are for the arbitrators.20 And in this case -- AT&T, when the Court sent21 the case back to the lower court said, these issues are22 for the arbitrators to decide unless you find unmistakable23 evidence that the parties agreed -- and this is the intent24 of the parties -- that the court would decide.25 I -- I would like to reserve --15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Mr. Friedberg, do you disagree with2 the Government? The Government did say there are two3 considerations. The first one you agree with obviously,4 whether the parties entered into a binding arbitration5 agreement. And then the Government says there's a second6 question, that is, whether the subject matter of the7 dispute falls within the scope of that agreement. Those8 are the two things. You seem to be saying there's only9 the one, did they agree to arbitrate.10 MR. FRIEDBERG: No. I'm not -- obviously I'm11 not doing a very good job of expressing our position.12 Where the subject matter of the dispute, the merits-13 related issue -- as in First Options, it was the question14 of whether the Kaplans owed money or not -- is within an15 arbitration agreement, then any ancillary type dispute as16 to timeliness should go to the arbitrators to --17 QUESTION: What -- what if I have an arbitration18 agreement that says all -- all disputes arising from an --19 an accident on the employer's premises shall be20 arbitrable, and the issue is whether this accident21 occurred on the employer's premises or not? One of the22 parties -- or the -- the employer contends that this23 injury occurred elsewhere entirely. Who decides whether24 it occurred on the premises or elsewhere?25 MR. FRIEDBERG: I think in the first instance16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the court would decide that because the parties did not agree to arbitrate any claims.QUESTION: Why is that different from here? The parties --MR. FRIEDBERG: Because --QUESTION: -- did not agree to arbitrate any claims that -- with -- with regard to an accident that did not occur on different premises, but that incurred -- occurred more than 6 years before.MR. FRIEDBERG: Because --QUESTION: They didn't agree to arbitrate it. They said it shall be -- shall not be eligible for submission to arbitration.MR. FRIEDBERG: Because of the principle, Justice Scalia, set out in the John Wiley case and the Moses H. Cone --QUESTION: But I don't see how that principle applies -- doesn't apply here, but applies in the other premises situation. I -- I just don't see any distinction between the two.MR. FRIEDBERG: I -- I think because the Court has previously said that a timeliness issue is -- is a procedural issue. It's intertwined with -- with substantive issues, of course, but --QUESTION: Well, can't you make it a -- I mean,17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it's up to the parties, who are masters of their agreement. If they want to make timeliness part of the condition of the arbitration, surely they can do it, can't they?MR. FRIEDBERG: They could but they didn't in this case.QUESTION: What you're saying, I guess, is that if the -- if the allegation of harm falls within thesubject of the arbitration clause, everything goes arbitrator unless they have unmistakably said that subsidiary issue does not. Is that --MR. FRIEDBERG: That -- that is what our position is.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Friedberg. Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,to the some￼AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:For two reasons the question whether petitioners' claims were submitted within the 6-year time limit is for the arbitrators to decide.First, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in John Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 subject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration,2 the question whether the dispute was presented within a3 contractual time limit is presumptively for the4 arbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that5 conditions the duty to arbitrate.6 Second, the time limit in this case is imposed7 by the NASD Code of Arbitration8 parties incorporated into their9 QUESTION: What is --Procedure, which the agreement in full. what is the general was asking for that10 principle that Justice Ginsburg11 controls your first conclusion?12 MR. ROBERTS: Okay. Arbitrability is, as used13 in the Court's cases, a term of art that includes two14 questions. One of those questions is whether the parties15 are bound by a valid arbitration agreement and the other16 question is whether the subject matter of their underlying17 dispute is within the scope of that agreement. And by the18 subject matter of their underlying dispute, what I mean is19 whether they agreed to arbitrate disputes about the20 primary conduct that -- that is given rise to the -- to21 the underlying claim.22 And what the Court held in -- in John Wiley is23 once the parties -- once the court has determined that the24 parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of25 the -- the underlying conduct that's at issue, then￼19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 questions about their litigation conduct and how those --2 how that dispute was processed after it arose -- those are3 presumptively for the arbitrators to decide.4 QUESTION: What was the text in John Wiley &5 Sons? What was the language of the agreement? Did it --6 did the agreement say that no controversy shall be7 eligible for submission to arbitration?8 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. The -- the9 agreement didn't use that -- that language. It said the10 failure of either party to file a grievance within this11 time limitation shall be construed and be deemed to be an12 abandonment of the grievance. But the point --13 QUESTION: Why? That -- that seems to me -- let14 me put -- it's the same question. Let me put it to -- to15 you another way. Is there any difference between your16 reading of this clause, shall be -- shall not be eligible17 for submission to arbitration, and the -- the way you18 would read a clause which said, no dispute, claim, or19 controversy which -- which occurred 6 years previously20 shall be --21 QUESTION: Arbitrable.22 QUESTION: No, not arbitrable -- shall be23 remediable? No award shall be given for any -- for any24 occurrence prior to 6 years.25 MR. ROBERTS: There -- there may be --20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

ROBERTS: The --QUESTION: This is not phrased as a statute. MR. ROBERTS: There may be differences, YourHonor, but -- but the -- the time limit language, the eligible for submission language, what that indicates is that the timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to arbitration of the merits of the claim. It doesn't say one way or the other who decides whether that prerequisite has been met. It doesn't say that the timeliness question is not arbitrable.QUESTION: Of course, it says the --MR. ROBERTS: It says the underlying claim is not arbitrable --QUESTION: Neither --MR. ROBERTS: -- if it's not timely.QUESTION: Neither does a clause which says only-- only events that occurred on the employer's premises are arbitrable. That doesn't say --MR. ROBERTS: No.QUESTION: -- who decides that either. But -- but since it is an arbitrability question, you -- you assume the court will decide.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. ROBERTS: You presume -- you presume that2 because if the parties didn't -- didn't contemplate that3 they would arbitrate about disputes arising from the --4 from the underlying conduct, which that goes to, then they5 presumably didn't think the arbitrators were going to have6 anything to do with any questions connected with such a7 dispute. But when they did -- no. Here -- here we know.8 QUESTION: They didn't think they were going to9 arbitrate about any matter that occurred more than 6 years10 previously.11 MR. ROBERTS: When --12 QUESTION: And therefore, they didn't think the13 arbitrator would be the one to decide whether it occurred14 6 years previously or not.15 MR. ROBERTS: They agreed and there's -- there's16 no question about it that they agreed that disputes that17 arose from petitioners' securities accounts would be18 within the -- would the kind of disputes that they would19 arbitrate. And so when this claim arose, it was within20 the scope of -- of the agreement.21 And the question here is not whether it's the22 kind of claim that the parties agreed that they might23 arbitrate about. It's a question of whether a claim that24 was arbitrable when it arose has become not subject to25 arbitration because of the parties' litigating conduct.22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 And ordinarily people -- people would assume that the --2 the forum that they've selected to resolve the underlying3 dispute is going to resolve ancillary questions about how4 the dispute has been processed and the litigating --5 QUESTION: There are all sorts of6 characteristics of a claim: where it occurred, when it7 occurred, the people between whom it occurred, and so8 forth. You -- you've given us no -- no basis for9 distinguishing one of those characteristics from another10 as far as whether the court or -- or the arbitrator11 decides.MR. ROBERTS: I --12 1314 what the15 referred16 arbitrable, it means that the question of whether that17 issue -- whether that -- that fact rendering it non-18 arbitrable exists is a question for the courts. That --19 that would solve a lot of cases. And I don't know how20 else you -- you -- you distinguish where from when from21 between which people.22 MR. ROBERTS: My -- my distinction is between23 and it's the distinction the Court drew in the John Wiley24 case and that the courts of appeals have followed for 4025 years except in -- in the limited context of the questionQUESTION: I suggest that a very clear basis is parties themselves have said. When they have to a particular characteristic as being non-￼23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 presented here. It's the -- the distinction that's --2 that's been embodied in the Uniform Arbitration Act, which3 is cited on page 14 of the reply brief. It's the4 distinction between the primary conduct and whether5 there's a limit on what primary conduct is subject to6 arbitrability and other questions about -- about7 litigating conduct.8 And the -- the rule that would focus on the9 language of -- of the parties and parse that language to10 see whether it's phrased as a limit of arbitrability, to11 then decide whether the presumption in favor of courts12 deciding the question of arbitrability imposes an extra13 layer of complexity that doesn't -- it's not likely to14 reflect the -- the real intent of the parties.15 The -- what we're trying to figure out is not16 whether the parties thought this was a question of17 arbitrability, but who they intended to decide the -- who18 they intended to decide the question. And the -- and when19 the underlying claim is within the scope of their20 agreement, it's likely that they intended that ancillary21 questions would be decided by the party that they22 committed the underlying dispute to.￼2324 10324. 25But even setting that aside, here we've got QUESTION: Here where language is not very24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 likely to reflect their intent, it's -- their language2 will --3 MR. ROBERTS: Their language reflects their4 intent --5 QUESTION: It's more likely to be reflected by6 some arbitrary rule that if it relates to place, yes; if7 it relates to time, no.8 MR. ROBERTS: It reflects their intent that --9 that timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to10 arbitration of the merits of that claim. But it doesn't11 reflect their intent of who is to decide whether the12 prerequisite is -- is met. There's -- it doesn't say13 anything about that.14 Rule 10324, which is also a part of the parties'15 agreement, does say something about that. It says that16 the arbitrator shall be empowered to interpret and17 determine the applicability of all code provisions. And18 the time limit is a code provision. The clear import of19 that, regardless of the issue that we're discussing, is20 that the arbitrators are empowered to apply the time21 limit.22 And so, even setting aside the 40 years of law23 that's settled by John Wiley and the distinction between24 the subject matter of the underlying dispute and -- and25 questions that go to the parties' litigating conduct, the25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 agreement here is clear and that --2 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, are you saying3 essentially the parties have an agreement to arbitrate,4 and that looks like very broad, any and all questions, and5 then there's this code of procedure? So what the NASD6 code is directed to is how, if the arbitrator has7 authority, the arbitrator is to proceed. Is that8 essentially what you're saying?9 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. It's -- it's concerned --10 the -- the code is concerned with the rules of the11 arbitrable forum, and it makes sense that the arbitrators12 are the ones to interpret and apply those rules. And13 that's confirmed by Rule 10324.14 But -- but yes, the -- the question whether a15 claim is timely submitted goes not to the character of the16 underlying claim at the time it arose and whether claims17 of that character are subject to arbitration.18 QUESTION: And haven't we got to take that19 position? Because otherwise we're just going to have20 litigation chaos?21 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. That -- it's going to22 completely undermine the purpose of arbitration, Your23 Honor. The reason that people agree to arbitration is24 because they want cost effective and efficient dispute25 resolution, and moving all these questions into antecedent26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 judicial proceedings is going to delay dispute resolution.2 It's going to impose added costs on the parties, and it's3 going to undermine the very reason they agreed to4 arbitrate. And it's -- it's -- that's another reason why5 it's just not likely that that's what they intended --6 intended to happen.7 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, am I right in8 understanding that this 6-year is a statute of limitations9 for the arbitration forum?10 MR. ROBERTS: Yes.11 QUESTION: Because it says nothing about if the12 case were in court what the limitation would be.13 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. It's a forum-specific limit,14 and that's another reason why it makes sense that the15 forum that the limit applies to should be the one that --16 that applies it. It says that cases won't be eligible for17 arbitration under this code. It doesn't refer to whether18 they might be pursued in other -- in other forums or other19 venues. It reinforces the -- the expectation that the20 arbitrators would decide it which, in any event, as I21 said, is -- you know, you can't get any clearer than a22 rule that says that the arbitrator shall be empowered to23 interpret and determine the applicability of all code24 provisions.25 Thank you.27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

Mr. Starr, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. STARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Let me begin with what we believe to be the fundamental point in the case. It has been mentioned in the opening arguments, and that is, this is in fact determined by contract. What did the parties intend?In response to the specific question posed by Justice Ginsburg, the language of AT&T we think is quite pertinent. It says arbitrability simply means whether the parties' agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular grievance, not whether there's an arbitration clause at that level of generality.QUESTION: But doesn't a grievance -- I mean, isn't the point of speaking of grievance just whatMr. Roberts said? The grievance has got to refer to the primary conduct causing injury. If it is not limited to that, in the absence of unmistakable language, then we're going to have a trial before every arbitration if there is any procedural or other defense that could be raised.MR. STARR: We believe, Justice Souter, that the language is in fact clear, of 10304. Let me return to28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that.2 But let me go to your point with respect to3 litigation chaos.4 QUESTION: Wait. Before you do that, do you5 disagree with -- what he said the -- I thought that your6 -- your -- you would accept what he says, but that -- that7 your point is that the primary conduct causing the injury8 under this agreement is conduct that occurred within the9 last 6 years --10 MR. STARR: It is --11 QUESTION: -- and not conduct that occurred12 before 6 years.13 MR. STARR: It is going to the issue of what did14 AT&T mean by the specific word grievance. What I believe15 10304 is is a clear statement by the parties, leaving the16 First Options presumption aside, which works for us. If17 there is any doubt as to who decides, the presumption is18 the courts decide. But here we know, by virtue of the19 plain meaning of eligible for submission. When we couple20 that, since this is an NASD rule -- and what we did not21 hear from the SEC was what did the NASD intend. What have22 they said this rule, which has been --23 QUESTION: This is your submission argument,24 your -- your argument based on the -- on the word25 submission.29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. STARR: It's eligible --QUESTION: Okay.MR. STARR: -- eligible for submission. QUESTION: But submission -- I just don't seehow submission can decide this case because you can say the -- the ultimate issue is submitted when the -- when the whole case goes to the arbitrator, or you can say it is submitted when the arbitrator gets beyond procedural issues and gets down to the issue of the primary conduct that caused the injury.MR. STARR: Justice Souter --QUESTION: So I don't see how submission is -- is going to be the -- the deciding factor.MR. STARR: Justice Souter, we would guide the Court first to the word eligible for submission. Eligible -- and the NASD has described -- and we set this forth at page 25 of the brief -- specifically what it means in this context. But eligible is a very familiar term. It is found in rule 6 of the Court, and what it means is if you're not eligible, you don't get to this podium. You don't go to the forum.And the parties are -- I think what is essentially dividing the parties here today is that there is some sense that because of John Wiley & Sons, the parties cannot agree to a temporal restriction. That30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425makes no sense whatever, and indeed it's inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress' policy.QUESTION: But you can agree to a temporal restriction and still not commit yourself as to who decides whether that restriction is true.MR. STARR: And that guides us -- you're exactly right, and so you then go to what is that temporal restriction, and let's analyze that temporal restriction. We believe the words --QUESTION: But if the temporal restriction then were phrased in terms of no relief shall be granted on a claim arising, then it clearly would go to the arbitrator.MR. STARR: It might very well go to the arbitrator --QUESTION: But it clearly would, wouldn't it?MR. STARR: -- under -- under those circumstances. It all depends upon the specific language.QUESTION: So it depends on the wording of theclause.MR. STARR: Absolutely. But here, Your Honor -- Justice Stevens, we know -- and I would guide the Court or refer the Court to page 25 where we summarize what the NASD has said this is its rule. The rule is applicable throughout the industry. This is commonplace. This is what the rule means, and it is called a -- a31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 jurisdictional limitation, a -- a substantive2 jurisdictional limitation, and it gives the reason.3 QUESTION: But how -- how does the party that's4 dealing with the NASD know that this is -- I mean, why5 should it be bound by what the NASD has said in other6 contexts? I mean, it's not a Government organization, is7 it?8 MR. STARR: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the9 submission agreement in 1997 -- and this is commonplace.10 In that submission agreement, the petitioner did, indeed,11 agree to submit the issue for arbitration to the NASD12 under the rules.13 QUESTION: No, no. To one of three -- I think14 they agreed to submit to one of -- one of three or four15 different arbitrators, and they happened to pick this one.16 And if the other arbitrator had different rules, it would17 have had a different result.18 MR. STARR: But they -- they don't, and that's19 the assurance I want to give and why it's odd that the SEC20 has been silent on this. The SEC has had, in terms of21 what the industry knows -- this is common practice in the22 industry, this -- this rule, the eligibility rule that you23 could use at a university, are you eligible for admission24 to this university? Eligibility means qualified for our25 justice. Chief -- now Chief Judge Becker described in32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 PaineWebber v. Hofmann -- we quote that language at page2 20. 12 years ago he said, looking at the dictionary, at3 Webster's, it can only have one reasonable meaning, and4 that is qualified for it. One doesn't get in the door.5 And there needs to be a gatekeeper. And it is,6 under this Court's presumption -- this Court's law and7 it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act as well8 -- it makes sense for the courts to be the gatekeeper.9 And I want to come, if I may, to Justice10 Souter's concern about litigation chaos. To the contrary.11 The rule that is being suggested here ushers in all manner12 of difficulties and we would describe or refer the Court,13 in particular -- this is in our brief -- to the Edward14 Jones v. Sorrells case. The Seventh Circuit had before it15 the following kind of question. Eligibility claim made.16 No one went to court, but an eligibility defense offered17 to the arbitrators. The arbitrators simply noted it.18 Some of these arbitrations go on for years.19 Literally 2 years is not unknown in the industry.20 In that particular case, the arbitrators never21 decided the eligibility issue.22 And the NASD has said this -- we refer you to23 page 7 of our brief, as well as page 25. There was a need24 for the eligibility rule -- for that rule to be clear and25 for there to be a gatekeeper.33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, I thought that -- that what it2 says, this rule says -- one interpretation of it,3 plausible interpretation, is arbitrators decide the4 eligibility question first.5 Do you agree, Mr. Starr, that this 6-year rule6 is a rule for the arbitration forum? That is, suppose7 this dispute now goes to court and the court says, we8 think that the 6-year limit has not been met. Then the9 customer says, fine, court, but under New York law, the10 limit, if we're in court, is 10 years and I'm well within11 that. This is a limit, as I understand it, this 6-year12 limit, is for the arbitration forum only, not for the13 dispute.14 MR. STARR: That is correct. But the issue is15 who then decides whether this forum -- who is the16 gatekeeper? That's what's before you.17 QUESTION: That's now -- now, that's my puzzle18 because isn't it odd that a limitation period that19 only in the arbitration forum is then decided by a20 where the court would have a different limitation?21 MR. STARR: Not -- not at all because if22 is a different limitation -- and, indeed, 10304 draws the23 very distinction between the eligibility requirement to24 get in the door of arbitration as opposed to a statute of25 limitation which might vary.34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼applies courtthere1 Now, the 6-year limitation -- the eligibility2 rule -- and we would guide the Court back to the meaning3 of the word eligible for submission. We think that's4 clear, but we think it's clear for the reasons Chief Judge5 Becker said. But we would again refer the Court to what6 the NASD has said. It is a substantive jurisdictional --7 QUESTION: It said more than that. I mean, it8 said--youquoteitonpage25. Itsaid--andthis--I9 wanted to ask you how that got into the Federal Register.10 It said, the courts determine the scope of the agreement11 to arbitrate, including whether a matter is eligible for12 arbitration on subject matter, timeliness, or other13 grounds. And that's the NASD in the Federal -- what's it14 doing in the Federal Register?15 MR. STARR: Yes. The self-regulatory16 organization, which is what the NASD and the exchanges17 are, submit their proposed rules to the SEC which could18 change this at the stroke of a pen. It has not done so19 for lo these years while these issues have been20 languishing in -- in the courts.21 QUESTION: I -- I would like to get back to the22 question --23 MR. STARR: Yes.24 QUESTION: Well, why is these interpretations25 that are not part of the agreement that the respondent or35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the petitioner here signed -- why are they binding on the petitioner?MR. STARR: Because she agreed in the submission agreement to be bound by arbitration under the code of procedure. It's an express agreement by her which she signed, which goes back to paragraph 19 --QUESTION: Well, so we're just talking here, when you say the NASD has said, this is incorporated in the code of procedure which she agreed to be bound by?MR. STARR: No.QUESTION: Okay. I thought -- I thought you said something else.MR. STARR: What I tried to say is that the NASD has described the reasons for the rule to which she agrees.QUESTION: Well, why should that bind her?MR. STARR: It binds her only in the sense of it helps the Court understand what the background of the rule is. She is bound the rule. We are now moving to what does the rule mean and what's the purpose of the rule. We think, Mr. Chief --QUESTION: Well, supposing I enter into a contract with Sears and, say, I'll pay $300 for something, and then Sears has a publication which says, you know, here's the warranty and, okay, you get the warranty. And36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 then Sears puts out a magazine and says, what we really2 mean in this warranty is A, B, C. Now, certainly that3 doesn't affect the terms -- how you interpret the terms of4 the warranty.5 MR. STARR: There may very well be, under those6 circumstances, an issue of whether there was a contract.7 The other side doesn't dispute that there is a8 contract and that the NASD rule is a part of the contract.9 QUESTION: But it's the NASD's interpretation of10 the rule. I mean, if you have a private entity expressing11 a view as to what the contract means, I just don't think12 it binds the other side.13 MR. STARR: I'm not suggesting binding14 authority. I'm suggesting that illumination is provided15 by the NASD's explanation, which also goes to the purpose.16 Why is this? Is this simply an arbitrary rule? No. It17 is a rule that is borne of experience of the entire18 industry --19 QUESTION: But, Dr. Starr, can I ask you a20 question about the meaning of the rule? It may not really21 be germane to this ques -- but I've been puzzled.22 Supposing you had a case in which the conduct occurred 723 years ago and it was fraudulently concealed until 1 year24 before the arbitration is requested. Would that be25 arbitrable or not?37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. STARR: Well, there would be an issue that the Court would then analyze what is the occurrence or event.QUESTION: Well, I'm talking about the occurrence is 7 years ago.MR. STARR: And -- and in terms of purchase or sale of security, it might very well that that would not be arbitrable in this industry because of the occurrence or event. There are also, as the Court knows, statutes of repose in the statute of limitation -- in -- in the Federal securities context as well.But the point is the --QUESTION: So this is an absolute rule without any tolling provision.MR. STARR: That's correct. It -- it is a absolute eligibility rule that simply tells the person -- and again, there's no choice here in the sense of if she had gone to the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange because the rule is exactly the same.QUESTION: But I'd -- I'd like you to go back to what I thought was the key question, Justice Ginsburg's initial question. What is this term arbitrability?That the context -- I've gotten not to an answer, but I've gotten to a beginning with First Options. First Options says that the question of whether you agreed38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to arbitration is basically a matter of intent and apply2 State law. That's the basic rule.3 Then there's a subsidiary rule. The subsidiary4 is, but if what you're interested in is whether the5 parties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability6 -- see Justice Ginsburg says what is that -- at subsidiary7 rule, what you do is assume that silence means no because8 only if it's clear and unmistakable.9 Then First Options goes on to say we'll give you10 a couple of examples. An example whether or not a11 particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable because it12 was within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement,13 that is not a question of arbitrability. Why not?14 Because the parties, after all, have a contract for15 arbitrability. They thought about the question of16 arbitrability. It won't -- it -- it's all very likely17 that they wanted this whole thing to be arbitrable. And18 then they give you an example of where it is, where there19 is no contract, where there is nothing, where the parties20 never thought about arbitration, in all likelihood.21 Now, with those examples, it seems to me that22 we're honing in on but we don't have yet an answer to the23 question Justice Ginsburg asked. Well, if there's a24 contract and it's a thing they likely thought about and25 it's sort of a minor subsidiary thing and, after all, it's39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 something that the arbitrator knows about and courts2 don't, that would all say it's not about arbitrability in3 the sense of requiring a special presumption. But if4 there's nothing at all in writing, if it's something5 courts know about, there is.6 All right. That's where I am. That doesn't7 help you because I think in this case, yours would fall in8 the first category. But, nonetheless, I'd appreciate a9 response because I -- I need my thinking developed on10 this.11 MR. STARR: Justice Breyer, I believe that the12 question of arbitrability, the duty, and who decides that13 question is guided by the -- is determined by the intent14 of the parties.15 QUESTION: And we agree with that.16 MR. STARR: We now look to the contract.17 There's some discussion as what does the contract include.18 The parties have been in agreement that the contract19 includes the rules, including 10304. That is the most20 specific and targeted provision, that we then go to that21 rule, and we say, what is the parties' intent with respect22 to whether this issue is eligible -- this matter, dispute,23 claim, or controversy shall be eligible for submission.24 It does not say specifically the courts are going to25 decide that. Right? But the First Options presumption,40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 since the language is not clear that the court shall2 decide it, is that that is the baseline. That is, in3 fact, the default position unless, indeed, the parties4 have clearly and unmistakably provided that that is an5 issue for the arbitrator.6 QUESTION: Which brings you to 10324.7 MR. STARR: And 10324 is, in fact, a broadly8 worded provision that says on its face that the9 arbitrators are empowered to decide, to interpret, and the10 like, the provisions of the code.11 Several points. The first is this is a very12 general, as opposed to a quite specific, provision, and13 when we then analyze it, and we analyze it in the context14 of the remainder of the code -- and I would guide the15 Court especially to rule -- or section 10104 that says16 arbitrators shall be appointed --17 QUESTION: Where do we find that in your brief?18 MR. STARR: 10104 is at page 35 --19 QUESTION: Thank you.20 MR. STARR: -- of the brief, Mr. Chief Justice.21 And that's 10304. And then at the bottom22 paragraph, 10104 says that arbitrators shall be appointed23 by whom? The director of arbitration only for cases that24 shall be eligible for submission under the code. In other25 words, when we take the code and we look at various41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 provisions -- and we refer the Court to our footnote 8 on2 page 36 of our brief where we identify, Justice Kennedy, a3 number of provisions of the code that cannot, in reason,4 be interpreted by the arbitrators. The powers of the5 director of arbitration, by way of example. We enumerate6 six examples. I think they're more like 17, but when one7 goes through the entire Code of Arbitration Procedure, one8 will see a number of provisions that the arbitrators just9 will not have occasion --10 QUESTION: But are not -- but that those --11 those provisions are not ones that the court decides12 either.13 And I'd like you, Mr. Starr, to tell me why I'm14 wrong, because I take it from your argument you would say15 I'm wrong, in saying we have an agreement to arbitrate16 signed by the broker and the customer. That seems to be17 as broad as you can get. And then we have a code of18 procedure which says, if you are going to use the NASD19 auspices, these are the procedural rules, including20 statute of limitations, which you should decide up front21 and not after you've decided the merits. Limitations22 first, then merits. If I think of this as the agreement23 is the agreement to arbitrate and sets what's arbitrable,24 then the code of procedure is how you proceed in the25 arbitration forum.42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

STARR: Because it is building in a procedural versus subject matter distinction, a sort of way of looking at the code as opposed to determining -- and you used the term, Justice Ginsburg, statute of limitations. This is not a statute of limitations. We would guide the Court again -- refer the Court to the second sentence of 10304 which draws the distinction -- this also goes back to Justice Kennedy's question -- that with respect to this -- the first sentence tells us, 6 years eligible for submission. It's not eligible for submission --QUESTION: Mr. Starr, can I interrupt?MR. STARR: Yes.QUESTION: Supposing the -- the claimant files apiece of paper saying the events occurred 5 years and 11 months ago, and the -- a company comes in and files a piece of paper and says, no, they occurred 6 years and 1 month ago. It depends on how you interpret it. Who's going to decide which is right?MR. STARR: That would be a question of -- for the court. It's a question of arbitrability.QUESTION: So just filing a defensive pleading would oust the arbitrator of jurisdiction --MR. STARR: Oh.43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

The -- at -- there, there has been, in effect, an agreement, as it were, to allow the arbitrators to take that first cut which comes back to Justice Kennedy's rule. They can, if the parties agree, make the eligibility determination, but if they make it wrong, that's Sorrells. If -- if the evidence is it's 6 months --QUESTION: Well, so--soinmy hypothetical -- MR. STARR: Yes.QUESTION: -- it would be the arbitrator'sinitial task to resolve the question of fact.MR.

The issue of eligibility is, in fact, a question of arbitrability and it's presumptive -- it is for the courts to decide absent clear and convincing evidence.QUESTION: So then am I correct --MR.

STARR: Well, you're suggesting a procedural issue, namely, filing an answer which suggests to me that the company has, under those circumstances, agreed for the arbitrators to decide that issue.QUESTION: Why? Why? The whole reason for filing the answer is to get it out of the arbitration.MR. STARR: No, I'm sorry.QUESTION: That's why you file. Go ahead.MR. STARR: You can, under those circumstances,say the arbitrators -- I will allow the arbitrators to take this initial cut at that.QUESTION: But you can, but what if you don't say that? What if you say, I am saying it was 6 years and 1 month and for that reason this eligibility question isjurisdictional and it goes to acourt?Exactly. And that'sQUESTION: All right,they go to the court.MR. STARR: That's right.QUESTION: So all they've got to do is file a we're out of arbitration and into court. AndMR. STARR: You're -- you're in -- you're in the45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

I was trying to respond to the specific --2 specific hypothetical, but the principle is yes, you go to3 the court. What you would do under those circumstances is4 not file an answer. You would, in fact, say you go to5 court and you go to court --6 QUESTION: And it's the same thing if -- if you7 say that the accident occurred somewhere other than in the8 work place. And it --9 MR. STARR: There's -- it's the same principle.10 You're saying this is an eligible arbitration.11 QUESTION: All right. And -- and doesn't12 that --13 MR. STARR: Are you going to stand -- I'm sorry.14 QUESTION: No. You go ahead.15 MR. STARR: I was just going to say the issue is16 are you going to stand on your rights under the contract.17 In your hypothetical, they're filing an answer which is18 exactly what happened in Sorrells. It goes through19 arbitration and eventually this is -- I want to provide￼20 the Court 21222324 motion to25 proper --again with the Sorrells exam --QUESTION: They make --MR. STARR: I'm sorry.QUESTION: They make their submission in a dismiss, not in an answer. They say this is not suited for arbitration because the time, in46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 fact, is different.2 MR. STARR: You -- the point is you would file3 that in court.4 QUESTION: Can you step back one second -- one5 second from these details you're in? Because I'm seeing6 it not as a matter of detail. What we're after is the7 parties' intent. In most places in the law, the law of8 arbitration in this area is either neutral or sometimes9 favorable to arbitration. But there is one exception.10 The one exception is where the parties may or may not have11 agreed to arbitrate arbitrability. And there we,12 interestingly enough, use a presumption that's very13 hostile to finding the intent to have the arbitrators14 arbitrate arbitrability.15 Now, in terms of the reason for that hostility,16 how does that apply here? I would think, at first blush,17 it shouldn't apply at all. Why? Because we're talking18 about rules of an arbitration forum. And rules of an19 arbitration forum -- after all, they're more expert in.20 And moreover, the parties have agreed to go to arbitration21 in a lot of circumstances anyway, so they at least know22 something of what they're talking about. Why would we23 want to apply so hostile an interpret -- hostile a24 presumption as to what their intent really is in this kind25 of an area?47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. STARR: Justice Breyer, we're asking you not2 to apply a presumption at all. We want you to follow the3 intent of the parties --4 QUESTION: Oh, well, fine. If no exception --5 if no -- if -- if that's really what you mean, then you do6 not mean that there has to be clear and unmistakable7 evidence. What I mean by my assumption is these words,8 clear and unmistakable evidence, because once we're out of9 that box, then I think we're right into what Justice10 Kennedy said and that's the end of the case. But, I mean,11 it's only those words, clear and unmistakable, that help12 you, and that's what I mean by the hostile presumption.13 MR. STARR: But again, the presumption and the14 analysis in First Options goes to where, in fact, the15 parties have not spoken to this issue. We believe the16 parties have spoken to the issue through the NASD rules17 for the reasons that we have stated, and that is, it's not18 that we're seeking to build in some new presumption. To19 the contrary, we're suggesting --20 QUESTION: No, I know. But would you agree --21 you want it clear and unmistakable or not? Is that the22 standard or not?23 MR. STARR: That's the standard with respect to24 -- the First Options presumption works for us. What we're25 relying on is the intent of the parties as articulated in48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the rules, and again, the NASD has said, here's the reason for the rule.QUESTION: Can I -- can I ask you about the rules, about 10324 in particular which deals with the interpretation of provisions of code?MR. STARR: Yes.QUESTION: I assume your -- the -- the other that -- that that provision gives the arbitrator to decide whether 6 years have elapsed or not. that, I suppose it would also give theside saysthe powerIf it didarbitrator the power to decide whether the injury was one that occurred in the work place; that is, whether the subject matter was also --MR. STARR: The same logic applies.QUESTION: I don't see how you could limit it to the one and -- and not apply it to the other, could you?MR. STARR: I don't think that they could.QUESTION: Shall be empowered to -- so how do you read it? Shall be empowered to interpret and￼determine the applicability of all provisions. How read it? Meaning what? Once he has -- once he has jurisdiction.do youMR. STARR: Once the arbitrator has juris QUESTION: Within the scope of --MR. STARR: -- arbitrators have jurisdiction,49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005--1 they are empowered to interpret the code. But it would be2 passing strange to suggest that prior to arbitration a3 number of the provisions of the code precede the4 appointment of the arbitrators and go to the powers of the5 director of arbitration. Therefore, it makes no sense to6 say that the arbitrators can by virtue of the all7 language, which this Court has said in a variety of8 contexts, TWA, any number of contexts, to the effect that9 that breadth, if anything, raises ambiguity.10 I just to -- if I may respond, I believe again11 the First Options presumption is the default presumption.12 But we would guide the Court and we rest our case on13 10304 --14 QUESTION: So you don't think you even need it.15 You don't think you even need the presumption.16 MR. STARR: That's correct, because we think the17 parties' intent is clear and the NASD is clear with18 respect to why this rule exists. It exists because long,19 stale claims, as good as the arbitration forum is -- and20 it's a very fine forum. It's been used in the industry21 since 1872. But it does not work for long, stale claims.22 You can't say let's arbitrate a claim from 1929 --23 QUESTION: Well, nobody is questioning the24 6-year limitation, and the question is who decides it.25 And I'm still left with the anomaly that a limitation,50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 applicable only in the arbitration forum, gets decided by2 a court. It's not a limitation on court action. It's not3 an all-purpose. It's not saying this -- these parties4 will arbitrate -- will -- will have this dispute. This5 dispute will be dead after 6 years. You've conceded that6 that's not so. The dispute might be alive for 12 years7 depending on what the State law is.8 Isn't it odd that -- to read a contract to say9 that a rule governing only the arbitration forum and not10 the court is decided by the court?11 MR. STARR: It's not odd in this context where12 the original agreement -- there was not, Justice Ginsburg,13 an agreement, in paragraph 19 of the original client14 access agreement, to arbitrate in some generic,15 undifferentiated way. It is to arbitrate under the rules16 of either a self-regulatory organization or an exchange --17 QUESTION: But that would --18 QUESTION: Mr. Starr, I guess the same anomaly19 occurs when -- when the dispute goes to whether the20 primary conduct is covered. Isn't there the same21 anomaly --22 MR. STARR: It's the -- it's --23 QUESTION: -- if the court decides it? And if24 the court decides it, the arbitration can't go forward25 even though the plaintiff may have a cause of action51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 before that court --2 MR. STARR: It's the --3 QUESTION: -- for the conduct that -- that is4 not arbitrable.5 MR. STARR: It is the same principle in terms of6 to what did the parties agree. And I think Justice7 Ginsburg is resisting -- I'm inferring -- resisting the8 idea that something that is in the code could somehow be9 in the contract. We would respectfully disagree and say10 that will, indeed, create havoc in the securities --11 QUESTION: What I was saying is that there's a12 difference between a code of procedure that says we agree13 to arbitrate and then this is the rules governing the14 arbitration forum when you're in arbitration. The parties15 have agreed to a code of procedure for arbitration.16 That's how I'm reading this.17 MR. STARR: But, Justice Ginsburg, I would guide18 you back to 10304 and its language and the term eligible.19 I think, with all due respect, that that interpretation20 does grave violence to the term eligible for submission.21 Eligible cannot mean that you go to the university and22 then they said, whoops, you're now out. It cannot -- and23 there needs to be a gatekeeper here --24 QUESTION: But it could be if you say that all25 this is is a code of procedure, like the Federal rules.52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
