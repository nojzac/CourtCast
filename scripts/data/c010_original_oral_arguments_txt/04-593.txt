McDonald.          Ms. Mahoney.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MS. MAHONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The complaint in this case actually allegesthat Domino's breached its obligations under a contractwith JWM.  It does not allege that any of the terms ofMcDonald's own contracts were violated.          The Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, held thatMr. McDonald could recover damages so long as he couldshow that he had suffered some distinct injury arisingout of the violation of the contract between hiscompany and Domino's.          We -- we ask this Court to reverse thatholding for two principal reasons.          First, Mr. McDonald did not hold any rightsunder the contracts between his company JWM andDomino's, and that's disqualifying under section 1981.          Second, the injuries that he alleges aresimply too indirect to be cognizable under an implied31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 right of action. This Court, even in the context of2 express rights of action, whether RICO or the Clayton3 Act, has looked to the background principles of the4 common law to define the scope of a damage recovery.5 And these kinds of injuries, which are really the6 classic form of derivative injury, have never been7 recoverable.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can you tell me, Ms.9 Mahoney, just in -- in a case where the person is10 directly implicated -- he was the one discriminated11 against. He obtains in a suit the damages for the loss12 of the profits in the contract. What are the other13 damages? Does he get emotional distress?14 MS. MAHONEY: If -- if he's -- yes, you can15 get emotional distressed under section 1981, and --16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If -- if you're17 contracting for yourself --18 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct.19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in your own behalf.20 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. There is no21 standalone cause of action under Federal law simply for22 emotional distress that is suffered as a result of23 racially discriminatory conduct. Presumably Congress,24 you know, might do that some day, but it has not done25 so. And in fact, even under title VII, racially41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 disparaging comments can cause distress to a2 they're still not actionable unless it rises3 level of a hostile work environment.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And whatworker andto the5 plaintiff's -- it wasn't here. What6 was he asking for?7 MS. MAHONEY: He is asking8 the complaint is a little unclear, but he's asking for9 losses that arise out of the company's failure to have10 revenues that would have passed through the company to11 him in either his capacity as a shareholder or possibly12 as an employee. In fact, it's important to stress how13 indirect these injuries really are. The gravamen --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought they were --15 they were essentially, as I guess you said a moment16 ago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because17 otherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery. So he18 doesn't do that because they -- they settled19 contract case with the corporation for what?20 MS. MAHONEY: $45,000, Your Honor.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that the22 he -- he's not claiming an economic injury, as I23 understand it, or am I wrong?24 MS. MAHONEY: I think you're wrong, Your25 Honor. He actually in his complaint asked for economic51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOwas thekind of-- it'sdamages-- it's --the $46,000?only thing￼1 damages. He doesn't specify them, but in an affidavit2 that he submitted3 his net worth had4 saying that he --5 JUSTICE6 where I went wrong. I thought those were the reasons7 that he was claiming that he had been distressed8 emotionally.9 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- you're saying11 he wants the --12 MS. MAHONEY: But either way, the outcome13 should be the same because emotional distress is not a14 standalone claim. He has to establish that he had15 rights to make and enforce a contract that were16 violated, and even if he did that, he still has to show17 that the damages that -- that were caused by Domino's18 were sufficiently direct to be cognizable.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you have a --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what he's saying21 is treat me as a sole proprietor. Yes, I created this22 corporation so I can be insulated from liability, but23 this is a one-person show and so I am bringing a 198124 claim and say forget the corporation. I'm the only25 human that's involved in this activity.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto the district court, he said thatdeclined 8 million dollars and he isSOUTER:  But I -- I guess that's￼1 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think there's a2 couple of problems with that. I mean, first of all,3 these were contracts where Domino's had rights under4 these contracts as well, and if it had sued Mr.5 McDonald under the terms of the contract for failing to6 perform, he would have rightly said, that's not my7 contract.8 And I don't think that we can think that9 Congress intended this Court to simply disregard those10 principles that have always governed where you -- if11 you take the benefits of avoiding liability, you can't12 turn around and say, well, now that it's time to13 recover against Domino's, it is my contract. That's14 not the way the law works. He can't disown the -- the15 force of the law when he's taken the benefits of the16 law.17 And now, the burden here is really a moderate18 one. It's one that says that the recovery that is owed19 will come through the corporate entity. He will get20 whatever his share of that is through the -- the21 corporate processes, and he won't be able to have an22 independent claim for emotional distress. But --23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if you24 have a case where a company says we are not going to25 deal with any companies that have an African American71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 as the CEO? Couldn't that CEO, the individual, claim2 that that3 contracts4 5policy interferes with his ability to makewith his company to be the CEO?MS. MAHONEY:  Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And shouldn't he then6 have a right to bring a claim under section 1981?7 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, if his company8 fired him because he couldn't make contracts -- in9 other words, they said, we -- we don't want you to be10 our CEO. We don't want a black CEO because, after all,11 we're going to lose business with these other companies12 -- then I think under an interference theory, that he13 probably could sue under 1981, sue both his company and14 also the third party that induced the interference.15 If we look to common law principles, the16 common law of tortious interference established various17 rules that were designed to provide recovery for18 interference when the causation was sufficiently19 direct, and the common law says -- this is section 76620 of the Restatement and cases that follow that -- that,21 in essence, if the third party -- or if the defendant22 induces the breach, essentially, you know, tells them,23 this is how we want it done, we want you to fire so and24 so if you want our business, if they induce the breach25 or induce the violation, then they can be liable as81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 well.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that McDonald had3 had a contract with the corporation that he gets 804 percent of the gross from every contract. Could he5 then sue?6 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. There are two7 different things. I mean, one -- one part of it is8 that here his -- he doesn't say that his contract9 wasn't performed, but he also would have to show that10 Domino's was the direct cause of his loss. And the11 common law, under section 766, for instance, says,12 look, if a -- if a third party or if the defendant just13 made it more difficult for your employer to perform or14 for your company to meet its obligations, its15 contractual obligations, by causing it to have less16 money, that doesn't count. That's not inducing a17 breach.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but in this19 case, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the20 corporation. They cared about him. He was the target.21 MS. MAHONEY: Well, he may have been the22 reason for the discrimination, but the target, in terms23 of the direct victim of the conduct that is alleged,24 was clearly JWM. It's JWM whose contracts were25 supposedly breached.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 And -- and the point is, Your Honor, the --2 the law has made it clear that simply breaching a3 contract in a manner that makes it more difficult for4 somebody else to perform is not a sufficiently direct5 cause of the -- of the failure to perform all of the6 succeeding downstream contracts. Otherwise, the -- the7 rules of privity would simply be eroded. And so instead,8 it's a very narrow category of cases where a breach of9 contract can be viewed as the direct cause of another10 party's failure to perform a separate contract with the11 plaintiff.12 And let me give you an example, just to -- to13 show what it's talking about. If, for instance, there14 is a contract where I am the defendant and I have the15 right to approve an assignment, and the plaintiff has a16 contract with a third party and I refuse to approve17 that assignment. Then I have retained the legal18 control under the terms of my contract as to whether19 the plaintiff's contract can be performed or not. And20 in that circumstance, if -- if I deny approval on the21 basis of race, I have made it literally impossible for22 the other parties to perform.23 And that's the -- the narrow exception. It's24 either inducing the breach, inducing the breach of a25 contract, or it's making it literally impossible, but101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 not simply making it more expensive or more difficult.2 And -- and I think it's important to3 emphasize why these rules were developed under the4 common law this way. In -- in part, it is to protect5 the very reasonable and legitimate interests of -- of6 innocent third parties. In -- in -- take the corporate7 context. If General Motors has a dispute with a major8 customer, and imagine that there is some sense that9 that -- that the customer may have breached its10 contracts because it -- it thought GM's work force had11 too many black faces, GM has got to figure out what to12 do about that. It's not going to capitulate and fire13 its work force, but it has to decide whether it wants14 to settle, whether it wants to litigate. It may15 litigate and then want to settle. But that's its16 claim, its contract claim, and it has to have the17 freedom to figure out how it ought to be settled.18 If every black employee at GM could file an19 action under section 1981 for emotional distress or for20 wage increases that they might not have gotten because21 GM lost this big piece of business, then GM would lose22 the ability to control the settlement of its own claim.23 And so -- and it's an innocent party in this fact24 pattern.25So the law has been designed under -- under 111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the common law to make sure that everybody's interestsare sufficiently protected.          And what the Ninth Circuit's, you know,ruling does here and what the plaintiffs are reallyasking for is to just blow through all of those rulesthat -- that have been designed to -- to make sense outof contracts -- contract laws and still allow some roomfor tortious interference sorts of principles.  Andunder -- under the Court's cases, I don't think thereis any basis to think that Congress intendedto create an implied right of action that isdivorced from the common law principles thatforeclosed these kinds of remedies.the Courtcompletelywould have          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there any --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you say there is or --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- are there any caseswhere we pierced the corporate veil in order to helpthe shareholder?          MS. MAHONEY:  Not that I know of, Your Honor. And I --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is kind of an inverse--          MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, inverse -- reversepiercing.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- corporate veil piercing. 121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MS. MAHONEY: Not that I know of, and I don't2 -- and I -- I think if you did that, would you do it3 for employees too? Can all the employees sue? I mean,4 where -- where does it stop? Can -- if Domino's5 violated a term of a contract because it was -- it6 wanted to cause economic loss to the employee of a7 subcontractor, can -- can he then sue?8 I mean, looking at the theory of damage in9 this case shows just how indirect it is. If you look10 at paragraphs 24 through 27 of the complaint, the sole11 theory of harm here is that Domino's had an obligation12 to provide a letter to -- to JWM, certifying that JWM13 wasn't in breach of any terms of the lease, and that it14 refused to provide that letter, and when it did so, the15 bank denied some financing on a project, and then that16 caused JWM not to have money to invest in other17 projects. And so then it didn't have enough money to18 pay its creditors, and so then it went into -- had to19 declare Chapter XI bankruptcy. And then McDonald20 didn't get as much money from the corporation as he21 otherwise 2223 arguments24 guess that many States have a doctrine in two areas of25 law. Third party beneficiaries can sometimes recover;would have.JUSTICE BREYER:  There are two separatehere, and I'm trying to separate them.  I131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 sometimes they can't. Victims of efforts to interfere2 with a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they3 can't. And one question is whether this particular4 individual fits within those doctrines. And you have5 to be an expert on contract law to know.6 But in respect to the civil rights law, I7 guess your position is -- and this is what I want to8 know -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to9 be the same for white people as for black people.10 MS. MAHONEY: I think the language of the11 statute says that it's protecting the -- the right of12 all -- the same right to make and enforce --13 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So -- so it might apply.14 And one thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a15 different rule for black people that treated them worse16 than white people.17 MS. MAHONEY: I think that's correct, Your18 Honor, but --19 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And has there20 ever been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative21 action or some other thing, that interprets that --22 that -- this particular civil rights statute to say23 that for whatever historical reasons, et cetera, black24 people are entitled to more protection under contract25 law than white?141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MS. MAHONEY: Not that I can think of, Your2 Honor. And I think the language of this statute,3 though -- I mean, certainly though -- of course, the4 Court in McDonald did interpret this statute to -- to5 also protect white person -- white -- white people,6 people of all color, despite the language that says,7 you know, rights the same as -- as whites. But --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do corporations have a9 color?10 MS. MAHONEY: No, they don't, Your Honor, but11 all of the courts of appeals have, in effect, imputed12 race to corporations under circumstances where their --13 their contractual rights have been violated because of14 the race15 has been16 appeals.17of their shareholders or employees.  And thatwell-settled, at least in the courts of JUSTICE BREYER:  So how do we deal with this?to say, do I have to become an expert onlaw, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or thelook, the -- the question here is not what thelaw is except insofar as it's relevant to18 That is19 contract20 circuit,21 contract22 whether there's a differential in treatment?23 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't24 think you have to be an expert on contract law. I25 think that this Court already held in Patterson, for 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 instance, that section 1981 was designed to have its2 own Federal content, but that when we look at the term,3 the right to make and enforce contracts, certainly we4 have to interpret that in light of common law rules.5 And under the common law of contracts, only parties and6 third party beneficiaries have -- hold rights under7 those contracts.8 Under section 302 of the Restatement, it9 defines who a third party beneficiary is, and I think10 that's a good starting place. It shows us that11 children, you know, as in this Court's case in Runyon,12 are third party beneficiaries. Union members are third13 party beneficiaries of collective bargaining agreements14 under that -- under the comments in the Restatement.15 But the plaintiff acknowledges that the shareholders16 and employees are not intended third party17 beneficiaries of the contract.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe not --19 maybe not shareholders in general, but what if you have20 a situation, like here, where you're dealing with sole21 shareholders? Why is that a real stretch to say that22 that person is a third party beneficiary of the23 contracts of his corporation?24 MS. MAHONEY: Well, the -- for two reasons.25 First, the contract has to actually identify third161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 party beneficiaries. In other words, parties need to2 agree on who the third -- on who the beneficiaries are3 supposed to be. And here, of course, there's nothing4 in the contracts. They haven't alleged there's5 anything in the contracts to identify him as that.6 And also, if -- if --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was nothing in8 these contracts requiring anything in the way of9 personal guarantees or anything of that sort?10 MS. MAHONEY: I don't believe so, Your Honor.11 It's certainly not alleged in the complaint that there12 is a personal guarantee. And -- and I don't think so13 because when Domino's sued JWM, it did not sue Mr.14 McDonald. And -- and as I say, if -- if they had, I'm15 sure Mr. McDonald would have put up his hand and said,16 no, thank you, that's not my contract.17 And I -- so I don't -- I think that really18 what we are asking the Court to do is just to look at19 the language and -- and read it in light of these well-20 established principles because that's what Congress21 would have intended the Court to do, and that he is not22 a third party beneficiary. He is not a party. And so23 the Ninth -- the rationale of the Ninth Circuit would24 need to be reversed because that's all it relied upon.25 And then the alternative theory --171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's exactly2 what I'm asking. If -- if you win, this case is3 reversed, sent back. I mean, what do -- would I tell4 them? And why not tell them, instead of having to5 delve into this, is, look, it's plausible here that6 third party beneficiary doctrine might cover this7 person? It's also plausible not. We're not experts.8 We don't know. You figure out what the normal rule is9 and apply that normal rule.10 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think we need to11 do that because there's been a concession in this case12 that Mr. McDonald is not a third party beneficiary13 under the normal rules and is asking, instead, that the14 Court create new rules, rights greater than third --15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other16 part of it, which is the -- the interference with the17 contract? Could we say the same thing there? We send18 it back, say, look, we're not experts on this, it's a19 matter of State law typically, and be absolutely sure,20 please, that whatever doctrine you normally apply is21 applied to this case too because it's plausible. He's22 the sole shareholder. He's the sole beneficiary.23 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I -- I -- we would24 ask that this Court not do that for two reasons, that25 the alternative theory of tortious interference was181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 never pled. It was never argued, and the district2 court dismissed this complaint with prejudice because3 there was no alternative theory. They did not move for4 leave to amend.5 So I think this Court should say one of two6 things about the alternative theory. Either, number7 one, it is waived, or number two, based on the8 arguments that have been advanced and the allegations9 of the complaint, it could not possibly be cognizable.10 And I -- I don't think you have to be an expert on11 interference law in order to reach that conclusion12 because --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying this is a14 matter of Federal contract law, common law, Federal15 common law, are -- or are you saying you go State by16 State, in which case 1981 is some places it will be17 third party beneficiary, some it won't?18 MS. MAHONEY: I -- I think, Your Honor, that19 in -- in the prior cases, in Patterson in particular,20 that the Court rejected the idea that it ought to be21 the State -- the law of each State that governs the22 scope of the rights. That argument, I believe, was23 advanced by the Solicitor General, and this Court said,24 no, they didn't think that was correct.25 And similarly, in Haddle v. Garrison, which 191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 is a section 1985 case, this Court looked to common2 law. But it -- it said that it's really Federal common3 law that controls these issues.4 So I think it's looking just to -- to State5 law principles to inform what Congress may have had in6 mind when it -- it allowed for persons to recover for7 violations of the rights to make and enforce contracts.8 Here --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it State law10 today or State law back when section 1981 was passed?11 MS. MAHONEY: This Court has looked to both,12 but in Associated General -- Associated General13 Contractors, for instance, this Court said that it's14 not bound by the terms of common law that existed at15 the time that the statute was adopted, and -- but16 rather, that common law evolves, and so it's17 appropriate to -- to look beyond that.18 I think it bears emphasis, though, that the19 common law of tortious interference at the time that20 this statute was adopted in 1866 was narrower than it21 is today. But even under the broader views of tortious22 interference, the plaintiffs concede that they would23 not be able to recover under those theories, and24 instead, have said to this Court 1981 should be -- go25 well beyond the terms of common law interference201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425principles.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in a -- in a sensethis is stronger than some tortious interference claimsbecause here the target is this -- this party.          MS. MAHONEY:  That's always true in tortiousinterference claims, Your Honor, and --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You mean that -- that theinjured party has to be the target?          MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely.  The injured partyhas to allege that the defendant knew about thecontract and specifically intended to interfere withthe performance of the plaintiff's contract.  But,nevertheless, we know of no --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  To interfere but notnecessarily to injure him.          MS. MAHONEY:  And to injure.  Well, to injurehim, to prevent his performance for -- for purposes ofinjury, yes.          And, nevertheless, we are aware of no casethat has ever found that an employee of a company or ashareholder of a company could recover under common lawtortious interference theory simply because it sufferedlosses arising out of a breach of contract with its owncorporation that made it more difficult or moreexpensive for the corporation to recover.211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 And I think it -- it is -- also bears2 emphasis of where this theory would take the Court if3 it were to recognize this. It would go far afield from4 the core requirement that there not be discrimination5 in the terms of an employment contract because this --6 the tortious interference theory, of course, is based7 solely on the concept that he may have had some sort of8 implied employment agreement with JWM.9 What this would mean then is that if -- in10 the case of GM, if a major customer cancels a contract11 and GM doesn't give raises to its work force, all of12 the black workers would have causes of action because13 of the injuries that were intended because the contract14 was canceled on the basis of race, but their similarly15 situated white coworkers would not. They would have16 suffered exactly the same injury, but they would have17 completely different rights. And that shows why this18 derivative injury theory just doesn't fit section 198119 because at its core, it has to be about preventing20 discrimination in the terms of the actual contract.21 And here, there is no allegation that JWM22 subjected McDonald to any discriminatory terms of23 employment, and therefore, it is not -- or that it -- a24 breach was induced. And therefore, it isn't the25 paradigm case, and it would create problems down the 221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 road to recognize this -- this kind of theory.2 So I don't -- I don't think that we are3 asking the Court to do anything radical, and I think4 the whole issue of tortious interference can be5 avoided, if the Court would prefer, because the -- the6 theory was unquestionably waived.78 complaint9 Paragraph10 sole shareholder, and operator of the company. Nowhere11 in those 14 paragraphs does it say that he had an12 employment contract with JWM.13 Similarly, the cause of action paragraphs --14 I believe there are 15 of them -- repeatedly identify15 the contract between Domino's and JWM as the contract16 at issue, the contract that was breached, the terms17 that were violated. Nowhere does it refer to an18 employment contract.19 This complaint, as the district court20 recognized, only pled one theory, and that was the21 theory that Mr. McDonald was entitled to enforce the22 rights of JWM. It does not plead any theory about23 violations of his own employment contract. And as I24 said, that -- even if -- even if you could infer it,25 you would still have to find that it's not a cognizable231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOThere are 14 paragraphs of facts in thislaying out the factual allegations.11 says that Mr. McDonald is the president,￼1 theory because he doesn't allege that the terms of that2 contract were actually violated. And in fact, at page3 45 of his brief -- or 44, he concedes that JWM did4 perform the terms of the contract. And second, even if5 there had been a failure of performance, he cannot show6 that Domino's was a sufficiently direct cause of that7 failure of performance.8 Just -- just to give, you know, yet another9 example, I mean, if I -- if my employer has a -- a bad10 year this year because somebody breached a contract11 with the employer and I don't get a bonus, I -- you12 know, I may say I've suffered some -- some loss. The13 value of my contract, my employment contract, may be14 reduced, but my rights under that contract have not15 been impaired or abrogated. I have the same rights.16 They're just worth something less.17 And all that this statute does is to protect18 rights, the same rights as white people have. It19 doesn't say that you are protected from any kind of20 discriminatory conduct in the economy that may, in some21 sense, make your rights less valuable.2223 rebuttal. 2425I'd like to save the remainder of my time forCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.Mr. Lichtenstein.241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN LICHTENSTEIN               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:          The issue here is whether, by choosing tooperate as a solely owned corporation, John McDonaldforfeited his 1981 protection.          Rather than federalizing State contract law,section 1981 imposes a nonnegotiable nondiscriminationduty that is neither a contractual provision norgoverned by contract law.  Intentional racialdiscrimination is not merely a breach of contractterms.  As this Court has already noticed -- noted, itis more akin to a tort.          Domino's question presented asks that bothplaintiff and defendant had to be parties to thecontract.  Yet, Domino's notes that non-parties withoutprivy of contract are also protected, citing thirdparty beneficiaries and the fact there were employers,such as supervisory employees or prime contractors.Thus, even Domino's concedes that the answer to thequestion presented is no.  Section 1981 protection isnot limited to parties to the contract.          There's still, however, the remainingquestion of whether John McDonald fits within the251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 statute's protection. Clearly, if he had been a sole2 proprietor, there would be no question of stating a3 cause of action. We contend that he's still protected4 based on three grounds: one, the intended language of5 section 1981; two, John McDonald's relationship with6 Domino's; and three, John McDonald's relationship with7 JWM.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's take that9 last one first, if you don't mind, since the argument10 is that you've waived that argument by not -- not11 raising it below.12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, we believe that it13 has been sufficiently raised below. 1981 does not have14 any special or enhanced pleading requirements. This is15 notice --16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where in the complaint17 does it allege a tortious interference claim?18 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: It doesn't allege a19 tortious interference claim, and this really isn't a20 tortious interference claim as petitioners suggest.21 This is a 1981 discrimination claim, and very clearly22 that was alleged.23 In terms of the requirement for wages, back24 wages and front wages, that is on -- I believe it's25 page 17.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- the allegation I'mlooking for -- and I -- I guess you probably didn't --you didn't have to raise it below, given the state ofthe Ninth Circuit law I would suppose.  But in yourbrief in opposition, where is it raised that thisinterferes with the contract between you and -- betweenMcDonald and JWM?          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  I don't think it doesappear there specifically.  But again, the -- thequestion was a fairly narrow one, which is what isNinth Circuit law?  Does Gomez apply?  And it went upto the Ninth Circuit on that particular level.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But coming here, Iwould have thought our rules say that if you're goingto rely on this as a ground for affirmance here, weshould see it in the brief in opposition.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  The brief in opposition atthe Ninth Circuit you're referring to or --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Here.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  -- this brief?  Theallegations concerning our argument about --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Brief in opposition to thepetition for certiorari.  You -- you did not raise271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 this.2 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: They did not raise that --3 that does not appear there.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's -- it's brand new5 to us. We -- we didn't think this was in the case at6 all.7 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, again, I think that8 if the issue is whether it was raised below or should9 be, then perhaps a remand back to flesh out that10 particular argument would be the appropriate response.11 1213 argument.14 it wasn't1516 it more specifically needs to be set out in the17 complaint, then clearly that would be one of the18 remedies. We don't really believe that that is19 necessary in a sense when dealing with the question20 presented. Both of our arguments are really sort of21 formulations of the same argument. The question is did22 Domino's actions aim at John McDonald? Was he the23 precise target? That was clearly set out, and --24 JUSTICE BREYER: Is targeted enough? I mean,25 I'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOI think that in terms of --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It wouldn't just be an You'd have to amend your complaint becauseset out in the complaint.MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  If the Court believes that￼1 general. Is a claim of discrimination -- I don't know2 the state of the law, but maybe if a minority3 shareholder -- a minority person is the sole4 shareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation5 could assert protection, or maybe it couldn't.6 But here, I take it that the corporation JWM7 brought an action and won or settled for $45,000. So8 they're out of it.9 Now we're just thinking about the sole10 shareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's11 another action here. And as to the two most plausible12 ones that I would like to assert an action as a third13 party beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that14 you've conceded you have no right there. And as to the15 other one, which might be protected in many cases, that16 the -- knowing that what was going to happen, they17 deliberately interfered with the contractual relation18 between me and the corporation. That's what we're19 asking about now. And you say, well, I didn't raise20 that.21 Now, is there a reason you should be given an22 opportunity to raise it?23 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I believe that the24 opportunity to raise that is part of the -- the same25 argument. This isn't really a question of third party291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 beneficiary. This is an issue of --2 JUSTICE BREYER: You conceded that out.3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- discrimination and this4 was claimed in terms of discrimination. If in fleshing5 this out, it was not specified in the various ways that6 this discrimination was affected, that oversight7 shouldn't preclude the basic argument that is really8 the same --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?10 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Because it still is11 responsive to the question presented, which is, is the12 privity issue one that precludes recovery from John13 McDonald? And that seems to be the same issue,14 regardless -- regardless of how it's formulated. And15 the answer to that question I think is -- is clearly no16 in terms of the tort -- tortious behavior by the -- by17 Domino's in terms of the discrimination. It is not --18 also, the damages that are --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I thought20 the question presented -- I didn't think. I'm reading21 it from the petition for writ of certiorari. In the22 absence of a contractual relationship with the23 defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone24 sufficient to25 to 42 U.S.C.,1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400confer standing on a plaintiff pursuantsection 1981?  So, I mean, the question30Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 presented was -- was precisely if your client did not2 have a contractual relationship, would the mere3 allegation of personal injury, which you're now4 alleging, be enough to confer standing?5 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, it's -- the6 allegation of both -- well, discrimination is a7 personal injury. In Goodman, this Court has said that8 violation of section 1981 is a personal injury. It's9 not a contract injury. So the question presented --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question is -- I11 mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a12 violation of section 1981, and the argument here is13 that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're14 interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: And the response of the --16 of the respondent is it is not simply your own contract17 or your contract with the defendant that is subject to18 1981 protection. There are several instances -- and19 we've cited them in our brief -- such as Shaare Tefila20 and Runyon -- where the actual target of the21 discrimination is not in contractual privity with the22 defendant. And --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you referring to24 Runyon, for instance? The parents always had a special25 relation to the child. It's something of a stretch to311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 say that the corporation has that same relation with2 its own shareholder.3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I think in this particular4 case it isn't a stretch. The discrimination was aimed5 at John McDonald. It was not --6 JUSTICE BREYER: That might --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's no doubt he's the8 target. That's the --9 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: But, I mean, the --10 Domino's itself viewed JWM as John McDonald. The11 statement, we don't want to do business with you people12 -- you people isn't anyone else other than John13 McDonald. And the allegations go further than simply14 back wages and even the dignitary damages which are15 available under section 1981 but not under contract law16 is also alleged that by going after his credit and17 going after the banks that he had relationships with18 and given guarantees to and going after him personally,19 that this wasn't simply derivative of JWM's damages,20 that he had his own separate damages that, in fact,21 could not have been recovered by JWM had JWM filed a22 1981 action.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any overlap?24 The -- what damages could the corporation JWM have25 collected under -- had it brought a 1981 suit?321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: It had -- it could bring2 the -- a suit for the damages of the lost revenue that3 it could have gotten from its contract. We believe,4 looking at State law, because we think it is a matter5 of State law, that here JWM would get its net profits.6 The wages that would be paid out would be recoverable7 by John McDonald. Different States may look at this8 differently, but that really wasn't the issue that this9 case had been --10 JUSTICE BREYER: Then the argument for11 sending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when12 you look at the question presented, no one could13 possibly file a lawsuit -- and you didn't -- on the14 theory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me.15 That isn't a legal theory.16 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: That is correct.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Rather, the legal theory18 here was that this contract-related section of the law19 is violated. And you want to say the simple fact that20 the contract wasn't between McDonald and JWM, that's a21 separate matter. That doesn't bar you from bringing22 your claim. So, on the one hand, you argue that I can23 bring my claim as long as I'm a target and the motive24 as to why they breached some other contract, the one25 between the two corporations.331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And we seem to have it conceded that even ifthat's too broad, there are at least some circumstanceswhere you could bring your claim.  One is if you were athird party beneficiary.  That's not present here.  Andthe second is if you are a target such that theiraction violates and interferes with a contract betweenyou and your own corporation.  At least you have thatgoing for you.  So you say, well, if I was wrong aboutthe broader theory, give me a chance to allege thenarrower.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Well, I don't --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Well, I don't really think--          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm trying to be helpful inthis respect.(Laughter.)          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  I understand, and I doappreciate it.               I don't think the broader theory,     was if I was a target, that's all there is.               JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  You have to     certain kind of target.  The kind of targetthey --MR.

LICHTENSTEIN:  Yes.  I think that thereare circumstances, in terms of alleging particularinjuries and interference with the making, enforcing,or performance of contract.  I don't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which you didn't allege anddidn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  I -- I think we allegedthat in terms of the ability of Mr. McDonald to performon the contract, even though it was --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But those contracts --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  His contract with -- withthe corporation?          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  The statute doesn't saythat it has to be his own contract with the defendant.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's exactly the issue.And --          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  And that's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and that's how Iunderstood this came -- case came up here.  Thecontract you're relying on is the contract between thecorporation -- between the corporation and Domino's.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for theviolation of that contract?  There was no mention ofany other contract.  I don't know why we should send itback down so you can mention a contract that youhaven't even thought of even when you filed the briefin opposition.          So that's the issue, whether the violation ofthe contract between McDonald -- between Domino's andyour client's corporation will allow your client to get-- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target.That's how I understood the lawsuit.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Well, that is clearly themain thrust of -- of our position.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, could you tell me when-- the -- the claim was settled when your client'scorporation was in bankruptcy.  Right?          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I assume your client hadno -- nothing to say about -- about whether thesettlement would be -- would be accepted by the trusteeor not.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Absolutely.  He -- it wasout of his hands.          JUSTICEwhich means that,SCALIA:  It was out of his hands,you know, you're -- you're sort of36Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited2 liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy3 taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which4 was that you left it to the corporation to settle this5 claim.6 And now you want to disclaim the advantage of7 a corporation and say, oh, although the -- you know,8 the corporation settled it out -- you know, I was no9 longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy -- I10 want to bring the claim on my own. I mean, I can11 understand why it would be nice for you to get that,12 but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to13 play dog in the manger that way. You either -- you14 either accept the corporate form or you don't.15 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: The corporate form gives16 certain protections, largely from personal17 responsibility for corporate debt has some tax18 advantages. It certainly is not going to protect any19 corporate officer or shareholder from their own, for20 example, tortious behavior.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you'd have to concede22 at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled23 the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that24 the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's25 gone too because those two claims were intimately371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425related, and you would be precluded from bringing sucha claim.  So to the extent that there's an overlap, youface a res judicata bar.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Your Honor, even if thatclaim had not been precluded by bankruptcy -- and therewere two plaintiffs in this case, JWM and McDonald --there certainly couldn't be double recovery.  Anythingthat would be recoverable in any form by JWM clearlycannot be recovered by John McDonald as an individual. And the Ninth Circuit said that.  They were talkingabout his own separate and distinct injuries.  Sodouble recovery would never be possible.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So they -- the NinthCircuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs inthis situation.  Both can sue and one gets -- thedamages are not identical.  That's --          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The shareholder can sue.The sole shareholder can sue.  The corporation can sue. Both have 1981 claims.  It's not either/or.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They both have 1981claims, but the damages are different in the case ofthe individual than in the case of the corporation.MR.

LICHTENSTEIN:  Yes, I believe that the --and I would have to check on the timing of this, but Ibelieve that the suit was filed prior to the settlementof the 1981 claim -- of the bankruptcy --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I would have assumed --          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  I'm sorry.  Of thebankruptcy claim.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- there wouldn't have beena settlement first without taking care of the second,if they had known both were on the table.  But you saythe first had been -- both of them had been --          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  That is my understanding. I -- I would have to really check on that, but that ismy understanding.          And again, we are looking at this particularsituation.  We keep talking about actual target.  Thepetitioner keeps talking about derivative, incidentalclaims.  This isn't a derivative, incidental claim.There is no one who has a race in this case that isrelevant other than John McDonald.  JWM, John W.McDonald, didn't get its financing, didn't get itscredit based on the fact that it was just created as a391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425corporation.  It was John McDonald.          Here, you have a situation where -- andit's kind of a unique one -- where there's a claim thatJohn McDonald, the actual person who was beingdiscriminated against, can't recover but some otherentity can.  That sort of turns section 1981 on itshead.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it was his -- it washis corporation, and until he went bankrupt, anyrecovery by that corporation would have been a recoveryby -- by John McDonald.  What -- what created yourproblem is the fact that -- that the corporation wentbankrupt.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I don't thinkthat's the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, you know, that's --that's one of the -- one of the consequences of takingadvantage of the corporate form.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I don't thinkthat's the case because if there was, for example, thistwo-party suit, JWM could not recover for dignitarydamages.  Only an individual can do that.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, can you -- can you dothat under a general contract theory?MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe you can do 401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it under a general contract --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're reporting not3 merely the -- the tort of tortious interference, but4 some general, broader concept of tort law as being5 subsumed with -- under 1981. Aren't you?6 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, and I think the --7 the case law indicates that, that this is not simply8 just federalization of State law. This -- looking at9 the history of section 1981, this was designed to10 combat not tortious interference claims in common law,11 but the black codes during Reconstruction that12 prohibited black individuals, individuals just like13 John McDonald, from being able to pursue their trades,14 operate --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the -- the16 focus of it is, as -- as I understand it, and the --17 the kernel of it is -- is the capacity to contract.18 And we can certainly understand, I guess, how tortious19 interference with contracts might come under that20 umbrella, but you're going further and you're saying, I21 take it, any tort that would give a recovery --22 recognize a recovery for -- for dignitary injury would23 be subsumed with -- within the concept of what 1981 was24 intended to -- to cover, which is a broader25 proposition.411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  I think that what we aresaying I think is what the Court has said -- is thatthis is a personal injury, and that dignitary claimsare subsumed under 1981.  I don't think it's expand --I don't think --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, contract -- I -- you-- you pointed out the -- the terminology whichincludes contract damages or -- or contract harm aspersonal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow fromthat that every harm or every injury that is personalfalls under -- conceptually under the 1981 umbrella.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  No.  Discrimination is apersonal injury.  This Court said that in Burke and Ibelieve in Goodman also.  So we're talking aboutpersonal injury here, not just contract harm.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't -- it doesn'ttalk about personal injury that -- that broadly.  Ittalks about the right to make and enforce contracts.That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon.It doesn't talk about --not a --MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Well, it's --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- personal injury.  It'sMR. LICHTENSTEIN:  -- it's --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it's not a more421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 generalized tort. If want to call it a tort, it is a2 tort that goes to your ability to make and enforce3 contracts. I don't see anything --4 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I believe, Your Honor --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- dignitary about that.6 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- that it goes to your7 right to not suffer discrimination within the realm of8 making, performing, and enforcing contracts. The focus9 is on discrimination, which is a personal injury and a10 personal harm, and the --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying it means12 discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing13 of a contract with somebody else. And you're saying14 that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even15 though the contract was with -- was with somebody else,16 you have a claim under this language of 1981.17 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, in this circumstance18 where the contract with someone else was the mechanism19 that was used to target an individual. And, again,20 when you're dealing with --21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there's no way to22 confine it to the individual, is it? I mean, the -- on23 your -- on your target theory, a -- a general24 discriminatory animus as a basis for breaching a25 contract with General Motors would give a right of431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 action to -- to every minority employee of General2 Motors. Isn't that correct?3 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: If there is a4 circumstance, as I understand the hypothetical, where5 there is blatant and intentional discrimination, racial6 discrimination, by a multinational corporation like7 General Motors, who say we're not going to do business8 with any company that hires black people -- and clearly9 there's an uphill battle for any kind of proof, but10 you'd have to show that there was actual targeting,11 that it really did interfere with the ability to12 perform contracts, and that there were specified13 individual damages. But if that were the case and14 could be proven, that would be pretty egregious and15 probably something that 1981 should cover.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but when you say17 damages that can be proven, the only damages you -- you18 insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target19 and that it -- it insulted you. It -- it was -- you20 know. That's the only damage you require. So you're21 saying that every -- every minority employee of all of22 the companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do23 business, would automatically have a cause of action.24 MR.25 believe we're1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400LICHTENSTEIN:  No, Your Honor, I don'tsaying that because --44Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. Okay. Well, then --2 then what do they have to show? They have to show that3 -- that their salaries were -- were reduced? But --4 but you haven't shown that here. You didn't plead that5 here. They have to show -- show that a contract with6 them was breached? But you didn't plead that here and7 you didn't show it here. So the -- the only thing that8 -- that you -- you can answer is they would all have9 causes of action if their -- their honorific values10 were somehow impugned.11 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe so, and I12 think that what was pled and what we believe is not just13 the wages that were not paid, but also the dignitary14 damages and also the damages specifically aimed at John15 McDonald in terms of ruining his credit, going to the16 banks, and in a sense slandering him, and those kinds17 of damages that were not recoverable by JWM but were18 specifically John McDonald.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was -- that was the20 consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation. I21 mean, that didn't -- didn't --22 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: No, sir. There were23 actually allegations of statements we are going to ruin24 you personally and actions that went to ruin him25 personally. This was not just simply derivative from451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the corporation.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But none of the ruin3 occurred, as I understand it, until the corporation4 went bankrupt. In other words, there was no direct --5 the bank, for example, didn't say we're not doing any6 more business with -- with you, McDonald. As I7 understand it, all the -- all the -- leaving dignitary8 harm aside, all the actual loss was -- was as a9 consequence of the loss to the corporation. His stock10 fell, you know, whatever. But it -- it seems all11 derivative from the corporate loss.12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe so, sir.13 And the opposition to the motion to dismiss talked very14 specifically about the statements to the banks that15 were specific to John McDonald that hurt John McDonald16 individually that really was not derivative from the17 bankruptcy --18 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have an action --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can you give me an20 example?21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- on that in California?22 Wouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody23 goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and24 so forth?25MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I think the action 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that Mr. McDonald took was just this, the 1981 action,2 saying that there was a Federal violation, that this3 was done to discriminate against him, and this seems to4 fit in with the 1981 cause of action and the purpose of5 1981, which is why this case was filed.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it fits, it's because7 of some cases. So -- because this whole area, 1981,8 didn't take off until Runyon against McCrary. So we're9 starting with what? 1976. So to -- to flesh out what10 that claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of11 this Court when you talk about dignitary damages.12 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, again, we -- I think13 we could look at Shaare Tefila as -- as a good example14 of the kinds of damages. This was the Nazi swastika on15 a synagogue.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that didn't17 go into anything. That was a two-page per curiam, and18 it was just was there a claim. And it didn't --19 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, the claim was still20 -- it was certainly not because of any kind of -- of21 privity. It was damages based on --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that was23 about does the -- does the act cover religion or -- or24 does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race,25 or does anti-semitism count as race. I thought that's471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 what was all that was decided.2 MR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, at that time, that3 -- it said that anti-semitism counted as race, but4 certainly they were able to recover once that threshold5 was met because of the dignitary harms.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't see anything7 in the opinion about -- I just see the issue before the8 Court was910 was a bit 1112 Sullivan where the right not to be discriminated13 against was compensable for the black family that was14 not allowed into the club. So the cases that we have15 cited --16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Both Sullivan and17 Shaare Tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases.18 Right?19 20 2122 said that23 for these24 And clearly, it would make no sense to have -- have25 different ones. So they were 1982 claims, but the idea481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOdoes this come under the heading race.MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  My reading of that was --broader I think.Also, you could look at cases such asMR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not 1981 cases.MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Right.  But this Court hasthe language is so similar that they should,purposes, be viewed as having the same rules.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that discrimination in terms of housing should havedignitary claims while discrimination in terms ofcontract should not is something this Court has neversaid.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          MR. LICHTENSTEIN:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Mahoney, you have4 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MS. MAHONEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.          I'd like to focus on the issue of whetherthere is any need for a remand.          The district court dismissed the complaintwith prejudice, and I think that it's fair to say thatat that point, the plaintiff was under an obligation toseek leave to amend if it had any other alternativetheory that it wanted to advance in this case.Otherwise, we're left with the situation where they cansee that dismissal with prejudice, litigate up to theNinth Circuit, and then we litigate here.  We go backdown and we keep doing this seriatim.  It would make nosense.  The dismissal with prejudice was proper, andcertainly in a 1981 case, despite liberal rules ofpleading, you have to identify the contract that was491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 supposedly violated, as well as, you know, the other2 elements.3 Second, I think that if this were a harder4 case about tortious interference principles, even if it5 hadn't been waived, I might understand the Court's6 reluctance to get into it. But we know from the7 briefing that the plaintiff has conceded that his claim8 would not be cognizable under the common law of9 contract, third party beneficiary, or tortious10 interference, and that is very plain from the brief at11 pages, I think, 43 through 46 where they acknowledge12 that under section 76 of the Restatement, they would13 not be able to -- to recover. And they say, so what.14 This isn't a federalized version of common law of15 interference.16 So given that concession, I think all this17 Court would have to say is that the alternative theory18 that wasn't even pled can't possibly state a claim19 because it -- it asks us to go far beyond what the20 common law did.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, may -- may I22 ask you one brief question that I should have asked on23 direct? I hope you have time for it.24 But supposing a fact situation in which a25 wholly owned -- a -- a corporation wholly owned by an501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425African American starts to negotiate with your client,and your client says, we have a policy of not dealingwith companies owned by African Americans.  Would thecorporation or the individual have a lawsuit undersection 1981?          MS. MAHONEY:  I think the corporation would,Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You think the corporationwould.          MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely because they -- arefusal to deal -- it covers rights to make and enforcecontracts, and if -- if the defendant said, I will notdeal with this company, then I think that they have aright.          And in this case, there was a claim that wasbrought by the company for -- based on -- for breach ofcontract.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But not under 1981.          MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, but the trusteemakes a finding that the -- the causation -- or reportsto the court that causation principles could not beestablished, and so there was no point in bringing a1981 claim because he actually found in -- in materialsthat are in the record of the bankruptcy proceeding --JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but in your view, to 511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the extent that racial discrimination might have2 affected negotiations, that would be an element of the3 corporation's claim under 1981 rather than an4 individual claim.5 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.7 MS. MAHONEY: Because if the -- if they were8 negotiating on behalf of the company, that is the9 company's right to contract. It is not the10 individual's right.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you attribute the12 shareholder's race to the corporation?13 MS. MAHONEY: That's what the courts of14 appeals all do. Judge Friendly in Hudson Valley15 Freedom Theater looked at this issue and said that it16 was the best way to approach this issue, that -- that17 -- and explained that it doesn't make sense to impute18 the corporation's contract rights to somebody else,19 give them power to enforce their contract rights. And20 it wasn't a 1981 case, but it was analogous, and that21 it made sense to, under those circumstances, impute22 race, in effect.23 And I think that the way that courts have24 done it is also a link to the word discrimination,25 which appears in 1981(c). In -- in Jackson v.521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Birmingham for the -- for instance, this Court did find2 that a -- a male coach had been subjected to3 discrimination on the basis of sex, even though he's4 obviously not a woman, because it's a form of5 discrimination. And I think the courts have looked at6 that as well.7 But this -- the -- the -- all of the exact8 same issues that are alleged in this complaint were9 already raised and litigated through depositions and10 discovery in the bankruptcy court. And this presents11 all of the problems that this Court addressed in12 Associated General Contractors about why there's such a13 strong presumption against derivative claims because14 here you can't trace the losses. You have no idea15 whether or not the monies that JWM would have recovered16 from Domino's would have been used to pay other17 creditors or used to do new projects or perhaps given18 to -- to McDonald.19 Thank you, Your Honor.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.21 The case is submitted.22 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)24 25531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO
