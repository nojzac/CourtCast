SHAPIRO               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. SHAPIRO:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in theSeventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report inthis case should be required on both statutory andconstitutional grounds.  As Judge Cudahy put it, there isno item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court'sdecision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr. Shapiro, can this case,in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?          MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes, Your Honor.  We believeit can.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  There also are due processallegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand whatthe precise due process violation is that's alleged.  ButI would like you to address both and to tell us, first ofall, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425from your perspective.          MR. SHAPIRO:  The readiest ground for decisionis the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute isa good means to avoid a complex due process question.          There are two statutes that are key here.  Oneis the appellate review statute.  The other is the publicrecord statute.  The public record statute says allreports of the Tax Court are public records, and we'retalking about a report of the Tax Court in this case.          The legislative history of that provision showsCongress had the broadest possible intent to make allpractices in the Tax Court completely transparent.  Allsteps in the adjudication were supposed to be --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, would that include --if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include lawclerk memos to the judge?          MR. SHAPIRO:  We -- we don't take that position.It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of atrial judge who heard the witnesses.  The report ispresumed correct under rule 183.  It's the onlyindependent evaluation of witness credibility --that?JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, why -- why do you sayMR. SHAPIRO:  -- and the only judge --JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you elaborate for this51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reason? Because the briefs and you again today keep2 talking about that first document. You use the word3 report.4 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, to me that's the whole6 conclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least7 for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the8 report they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't9 what the Government says.10 The Government says that's a piece of paper,11 preliminary. We -- like my draft. I write drafts all the12 time. So -- so do trial judges. And he goes and brings13 the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down14 and talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it,15 and he changes his mind and writes a different document.16 And that different document, of course, is totally public.17 The whole18 document.1920 Under the21 and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the22 trial, which contains his independent credibility23 findings.24 JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know that? Now --25 now, what is the answer specifically in the statute?61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOopinion of the Tax Court.  There is thatMR. SHAPIRO:  There is only one rule 183 report.rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares￼1 Let's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really2 didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 13 continuously labeled with the word report when I thought4 that's the key question. Is it? Is it that report5 they're referring to?6 So now, go ahead.7 MR. SHAPIRO: Under rule 183(b) there is a8 report denominated as such. There's no question here it9 was submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of10 the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge11 submitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this12 case was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no13 involvement with the case until this report was given to14 him.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Which --16 MR. SHAPIRO: I'm sorry.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Which -- which brief --18 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh. It's the petition for cert.19 The Kanter petition.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At least --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page did you say?22 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what page?23 MR. SHAPIRO: 114a, 114a. And throughout --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, why don't you25 simply read the text of 183(b) --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- which is in the3 Government's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's4 report. It is the only report to which the Tax Court5 rules refer.67 it's -- 89And1011 even have12 statute?13 rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?14 MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. This is a report that15 must be submitted. It is presumed correct under this16 rule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from17 the only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course,18 it's part of the record. And it doesn't --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you've really got three20 arguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute,21 and you have due process.22 MR. SHAPIRO: And it doesn't make the slightest23 difference that the superior judge caused the subordinate24 judge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in25 the proceeding, because it is the original report that is81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. SHAPIRO:  That's correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE SOUTER:  And -- and if in fact --MR. SHAPIRO:  -- it is presumed correct.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- you rely on the rule,to resolve the issue of meaning of reportCan't we simply, from your position, relydo wein theon the￼1 presumed correct under the rules.2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what -- what3 was the page? Please. You're going quite -- and I want4 to -- because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in5 the Government's brief that you said yes --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, not the Government's7 brief. The Tax Court rules.8 MR. SHAPIRO: That's -- that's appendix 4a.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 4a of the Government's brief.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the rule.11 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b).12 And it makes it clear that there must be a13 report filed with the chief judge. The docket here says14 that that was done.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you make the argument that16 -- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go17 to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief18 judge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm19 thinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm20 thinking. And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well,21 why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z?22 He says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the23 argument that that first document is not the report?24 MR. SHAPIRO: The first -- there is only one --25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess another way of91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before2 the report is submitted? I -- I guess that's my question.3 MR. SHAPIRO: The rules are silent on that, but4 Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the5 report is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge6 Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a7 presumptive correctness standard. So it would be8 surprising if there were consultation of that sort.9 But what we contend is if there is consultation10 behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then11 it is critically important that the report be submitted12 and made part of the record and not concealed, and that13 the deferential standard of review be --14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- would that problem15 be overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his --16 the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then17 the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look18 at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a19 notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special20 tax judge?21 MR. SHAPIRO: I suppose that's a possibility,22 but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like23 that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate24 demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great25 deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the trial judge. Maybe in a -- in the future the Tax2 Court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate3 the Raddatz problem that they now have.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: In which case, they -- they5 might well revise the language of their rule.6 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, they -- they might, and --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which currently requires that8 the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be9 correct.10 MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, and after all, we11 should remember that the Government was supposed to12 present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this13 case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on14 behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what15 could be more important to the reviewing court than to16 know what had occurred at the first stage and the second17 stage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and18 no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three19 Tax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that20 was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible,21 then an unexplained overturning of that credibility22 determination with no trace in the record would surely be23 a candidate for reversal on appeal.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask this25 question, if I may. Suppose the -- a special trial judge111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 hears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the2 chief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge3 looks it over it and says, you know, before I -- before I4 really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't5 explore these three problems. Would you please do it over6 again? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation7 of the rule that he shall presume the report to be8 correct?9 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we haven't challenged the10 conversations as such. We think it is -- it is suspect,11 however. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the12 witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses,13 I don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your14 credibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider15 that, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure16 for that is to make the first report part of the record.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if it's a violation18 of -- of the rule.19 MR. SHAPIRO: The --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the -- the rule says a21 special report shall be presumed to be correct.22 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there's this initial24 review, he says, you know, I think it's really pretty25 incomplete until you do X, Y, Z, please do it over again,121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 is that a violation of the rule?2 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the rule is silent3 on that, but the spirit of the rule, frankly, is that the4 STJ does his job. He completes his report. He submits5 it, and the reviewing judge examines it under a presumed-6 correct standard in -- in the same orderly fashion that7 ordinarily occurs when there is an initial judgment from a8 -- from a trial judge about credibility with deferential9 review that comes later.10 But the rule doesn't tell us much about these11 consultations, and we do submit that if -- if they do take12 place, as the Government suggests, there's importuning and13 changing of minds going on through consultations, do this14 on record. Turn square corners because it would be quite15 important to the appellate court to know if there was a16 good reason for the overturning of these credibility17 determinations.18 And we -- we've seen that kind of review in the19 Stone case in the D.C. Circuit, which is very similar to20 this case. Factually the cases are quite similar. And21 the reviewing court, Judge Williams, found clear error22 based on what the rule 183 report stated about witness23 credibility. There was an elaborate explanation why24 particular witnesses were credible and incredible, and the25 court could use that to evaluate the judgment of the Tax131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, what you're askingus to do would -- would just solve your problem in thiscase, and -- and in the future, I suppose they couldrevise rule 183 as simply not to require a report.  There-- there's nothing in the statute that requires thisreport, is there?          MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, that's true.  They couldcease using the STJ's, but --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they could -- they coulduse them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'llconsult with the -- with the deciding judge.          MR. SHAPIRO:  I -- I suppose that could happen.If there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn'tcontend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, andthat -- that might be.          But it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in thatscenario that you present, Justice Scalia.  If one judgeheard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear thewitnesses and -- and the -- the superior judge --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they confer with eachother.  Maybe, maybe.          MR. SHAPIRO:  But it -- it would be -- it wouldbe quite strange to have credibility determinations madeby a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼12 agencies,3 itself or4 and there5 witnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's6 possible. It happens in the Federal Communications7 Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and8 forth in ratemaking cases.9 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens in cases inyou know, where -- where -- suppose the agencya member thereof is going to make a decision,might be other members who would hear the10 JUSTICE BREYER: It's hard to find precisely the11 analogy, but it seems likely.12 MR. SHAPIRO: The -- the closest analogy in this13 Court's decisions is the Morgan II decision.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, which gives and takes15 away.16 MR. SHAPIRO: Now, Morgan II is really on point17 because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings,18 proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but19 did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this20 Court held that was a violation of due process.2122 to refute 232425JUSTICE BREYER:  You have to have an opportunitythe information that's going to --MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.MR. SHAPIRO: And -- and every administrative 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 body that we know of in the Federal courts and in the2 State system too -- Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out3 in the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires4 disclosure of these administrative law decisions to the5 parties.6 JUSTICE BREYER: If you analogize the STJ to the7 administrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a8 member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy,9 it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you10 look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's11 going on.12 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. Well, we -- we've avoided13 suggesting that any depositions should be taken of -- of14 judicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view15 is simply that the report that was prepared -- it was16 prepared -- should be made part of the record by virtue of17 two statutes. There is an appellate review statute,18 Justice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that19 Congress expected review to take place here just as it20 does in the district court, to the same degree, to the21 same extent, and in the same manner. And in the district22 court, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact,23 whether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge,24 that is always disclosed to the parties.25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Shapiro, is there any161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 evidence in this record that the special trial judge in2 fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?3 MR. SHAPIRO: We don't know what is contained in4 that first report. We have heard from three of the5 judges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that --6 that what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the7 credibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see8 this. That could be wrong. But -- but it should be part9 of the record for the court of appeals.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, on credibility,11 which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the12 case for it? Because credibility is more than just13 observing the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson14 could have said, yes, they -- these witnesses might have15 looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering16 this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me17 that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.18 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, you'll see in perhaps a19 dozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that20 witness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where21 credibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the22 kind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified23 said no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments24 with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet,25 the Government's theory was there is some nefarious171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 bribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no2 documentary evidence of that. The evidence of the3 proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the4 result of their investing money in real estate deals. And5 so credibility was the key to this whole case.6 And the -- the Government, I don't think, can be7 serious when it tells this Court that this first report is8 some confidential document, that it's privileged internal9 deliberative material. For 40 years, the -- the Tax Court10 made these reports available to the public. It -- they11 were routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there12 was no suggestion --13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you comment on14 that? I -- I understood from the brief there was a15 suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge16 volume of -- of printed material that we're not troubled17 with now.18 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. That's a post hoc19 rationale. There was no such explanation when this rule20 was changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of21 expense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a22 copy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us23 electronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making24 a very modest request under these statutes and under the25 Due Process Clause. And there was no explanation --181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, now, wait.  Under the DueProcess Clause, I assume you would be asking for more thanjust access to the report.  You -- if -- if you're reallyrelying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I thinkyou would be saying that after reading the report, youshould have the opportunity to argue to the -- to Dawsonhere, to -- to the Tax Court judge that the report shouldnot be adopted.          MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we defer to --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that part of your dueprocess case?          MR. SHAPIRO:  It -- it really is not.  We'reasking --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think it satisfies dueprocess just to show you the report, and then --          MR. SHAPIRO:  To give -- and make it part of theappellate record.  We're not asking for any remand to theTax Court.  If the Tax Court doesn't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then -- then you're notrelying on Morgan II.          MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we -- we just rely on thatas an example of the need to disclose this at anappropriate juncture.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There wasn't a need to disclosethe point that Morgan II made.  It was he who hears must191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 decide.2 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, in Morgan II, the -- the3 point was that any -- any proposed findings that are4 drafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now,5 they had to be shared with the parties at the6 administrative level. We're not going that far. If7 Tax Court tells us that they don't want to have that8 of review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive9 our comments on the initial report, that's fine with us.10 We want it to be made part of the appellate record so that11 the judges who are interested in this and believe it will12 shed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing13 evidence can have this be part of the record.14 And already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the15 finding of fraud in this very same case.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -- do I understand that17 you would be satisfied if the18 what is it -- 7482(a)(1), the19 which says that the Tax Court20 in the same manner and to the21 court decisions? And that --22 MR.

It's -- it9 is specified someplace, but when you review a district10 court decision in -- in a court of appeals, the --11 certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but12 there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule13 that lists --14 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's15 -- it's very general. It says that all the original16 papers in the trial court come before the appellate court,17 and an original report is an original document submitted18 in the trial court.19 And this Court confronted that question in20 Universal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the21 same arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to22 2 in that case. It -- it said that the report --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Institutional memory. Isn't24 that -- that's a good institutional memory --25 MR. SHAPIRO: It goes back.211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 (Laughter.)2 MR. SHAPIRO: The same argument was made that3 the report is an irrelevance. It's just an aid to the4 decision-maker, and the decision-maker can do what it5 wants and has ultimate judgmental power. So there's no6 need to include that report in the record, and no weight7 should be given to it.8 This Court said, we will not adopt an9 exclusionary rule for the administrative law judge's10 report. And this is an a fortiori case because this11 report is presumed correct. In Universal Camera, there12 was no presumption of correctness at all. So that -- that13 case, you14 has to do1516 somehow this is --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that was decided under18 the APA, wasn't it? I mean, that was an APA case, which this19 isn't.know, goes further than -- than what the Courthere.And the Government's argument that -- that20 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, that's true. But, you21 know, the Court reached out to the APA for guidance in22 construing the labor laws. The labor laws were silent on23 this issue, but under the APA, the Court said the general24 policy is to disclose these reports and we are going to25 say that that is applicable to the NLRB.221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Now, the Government says all of this changes the2 course because the judge changed his mind, but you know,3 there are so many opinions and orders and reports in the4 Federal judicial system where a mind is changed and an5 opinion is suppressed or -- or vacated or replaced and6 that first opinion is still part of the record. It's a7 fallacy to say it's not part of the record just because8 it's been abandoned.9 For example, if I seek summary judgment in the10 district court and it's denied and then I ask for11 reconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been12 abandoned, but it's still part of the record. And if I --13 if an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit A in any14 appeal, and it may result in a reversal.15 Same thing when a case goes en banc. The panel16 opinion is vacated, but then when -- when cert is granted,17 the argument before this Court may convince this Court18 that the panel was right. Even though it's been19 abandoned, it's still very important.20 Or if a jury verdict is set aside -- the -- the21 district court says, judgment as a matter of law -- on22 appeal, the jury -- jury verdict may get sustained. So23 it's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody24 has changed his mind, if that's what happened here, that25 -- that the first report drops out of the record.231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would the -- the Tax Courtrule -- now, this 183(c) -- says -- it describes thespecial trial judge's report, which is submitted to thechief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Courtjudge, and then it says that -- that the Tax Court judgemay modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, ormay reject it in whole or in part.  Does the Tax Courtever modify a special trial judge's report?  Does it everreject it in whole or in part?          MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes, and -- and the remarkablething is that every time it does that, it recites, wehereby adopt the findings and opinions of the trial judge.Now, in the old days, that was not a problem.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's one thing thatthey can do.  They can adopt it, but my question is, dothey always adopt and never use -- never use the termmodify or reject?          MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, no.  They -- they do modifyand reject.  It's just it's hard to determine, when theyare doing that.  In the old days --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they never say so intheir opinion.          MR. SHAPIRO:  They don't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  They always say that they adoptthe trial judge's report.  Don't they?241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's entirely correct.2 And now, in the old days, before they amended3 the rule, you could compare the two and see what was4 changed, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been5 changed.6 And in this instance, we believe there's been a7 complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate8 courts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for9 doing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda10 at work in this decision? No one can tell because it is11 all off the record.12 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is -- can I ask13 you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I14 have never been able to figure out? It's probably15 relevant, but I -- this is an agency. That's what -- my16 great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no17 Tax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be18 known as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not19 -- it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So -- so this20 is an agency, an administrative agency.21 So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA,22 when you look at the section, says this initial decision23 can be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556-24 qualified person can include the agency itself or a member25 of the agency or an ALJ.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Then when you to look at what happens in 557,2 after that presiding employee makes an initial decision,3 it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond4 to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where5 the presiding employee -- presiding person is a6 subordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just7 checking here.8 And so -- so what's supposed to happen where the9 presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative10 decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote,11 one or more members of the body which comprise the agency?12 I've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't.13 Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.1415 the judge 161718MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, I -- I haven't either.  Buthere certainly was subordinate and --JUSTICE BREYER:  He was a subordinate employee?MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes, he was.               JUSTICE BREYER:  Rather than a member -- is --19 is -- if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then20 the case is easy I think.21 MR. SHAPIRO: He -- he is a subordinate because22 as the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is23 the only official spokesman for the court. They get to24 make the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews25 what the STJ has done.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼123 asserting 4567 exception 89 Article IJUSTICE GINSBURG:  These -- these --JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you're -- you're notthat the APA governs this.MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh --JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I'm just looking --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't there an expressfor -- for --MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes, and this a court.  This is ancourt, this Court has held.  And Congress has10 created very specific appellate review procedures for this11 court.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the special trial13 judge has no tenure, does she?14 MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct. He -- those15 judges could be terminated at will, including because16 there is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be17 terminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the18 analysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave.19 This is not an independent judge. When he is20 persuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious21 that he -- in our view, that he's going to be heavily22 influenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The23 only cure is to make this part of the record and to24 enforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which25 creates a clear error standard of review.271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          I see my time has run out.  May I reserve therest for --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, you may, of course.          Mr. Hungar.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. HUNGAR:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          The central flaw in petitioners' case is thatboth of the trial court judges responsible for evaluatingthe evidence in the record reached the same conclusionregarding all of the factual issues.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hungar, before youproceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why theGovernment is defending this practice because theGovernment, after all, is on the other side of every case.And aren't there situations where it might be that thespecial trial judge would call a credibility question inthe Government's favor and then the Government loses thecase before the Tax Court judge and might like to know,before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid thecredibility findings were?  I mean, I -- I -- theGovernment being a party to all these proceedings, why isit satisfied with not knowing what the report of thespecial tax judge -- special trial judge was?281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, we do know what2 the report of the special trial judge was. It is in the3 record. Judge Couvillion's name is on his report.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it is not the report. It5 is called an opinion. It isn't even called the report,6 and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report.7 Does anything else describe the report? And what is this8 report? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief9 judge. What would you call that?10 MR. HUNGAR: The report is the -- contains the11 recommended findings of fact and opinion, analysis of the12 law and application of the law to the fact, of the special13 trial judge. The report is the findings of fact plus,14 quote, the opinion.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what is the 183(b)16 report?17 MR. HUNGAR: Well --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There --19 MR. HUNGAR: The -- under rule 183(b), the --20 the special trial judge submits his report to the chief21 judge. It is then referred to a Tax Court judge.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that report, the special23 trial judge's24 special trial25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400report, is a document prepared by thejudge which he gives to the chief judge.HUNGAR:  Correct.  But the important thing29Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 to understand, Your Honor, is that nothing in the rule2 precludes, during the course of the deliberative process3 that then follows, the special trial judge from concluding4 that he has made a mistake, that he no longer agrees with5 the -- the stated findings of fact in that -- in that6 original report, from withdrawing and submitting a7 corrected report.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not the way the rule9 reads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that10 the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It11 doesn't say anything about the special trial judge12 reconsidering and rewriting his report.13 MR. HUNGAR: It doesn't preclude it either, Your14 Honor. There's a longstanding practice --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it does because it -- it16 goes on to say that due regard shall be given to the17 circumstance that the special trial judge had the18 opportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact19 recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed20 to be correct. But if those findings of fact are simply21 the same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of22 the -- the panel on, it just makes no sense at all.23 MR. HUNGAR: The Tax Court judge cannot report24 in -- in the opinion that is issued by the Tax Court, he25 cannot say I'm adopting the opinion and findings of the301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 special trial judge if the -- if the Tax Court judge does2 not agree with those and the -- and the special trial3 judge adheres to his original decision. The only way it4 is possible for there to be a change is for the special5 trial judge himself to determine, in the exercise of his6 responsibility as a judicial officer, that he made a7 mistake.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What report goes to the chief9 judge?10 MR. HUNGAR: Originally the original report goes11 to the chief judge.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a report. Is that not a13 report?14 MR. HUNGAR: It is a report, Your Honor.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't that -- why isn't16 that required to be -- to be made public?17 MR. HUNGAR: Because if -- because the --18 because the Tax Court has determined that it will not be19 made public, that it is part of internal deliberation.2021 says that 22232425JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a report.  The statutethe reports have to be made public.MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is a report.MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it goes to the --311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?          MR. HUNGAR:  With respect, the tax -- the -- thestatute says a report of the Tax Court must be madepublic.  A -- a report --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the rule -- the rulesays that the first report, the document 1, has to begiven deference.  Whether it's presumed to be correct.          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, Justice Kennedy, if I may,I'd like first to finish my response to Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Sure.          MR. HUNGAR:  The statutes -- the -- thedisclosure requirement applies only to reports of the TaxCourt.  It is perfectly clear that a report, the originalreport, or any report of a special trial judge is not andcannot be the report of the Tax Court unless it is firstadopted and approved by a Tax Court judge, and then goesthrough the next step of -- of being submitted --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, it's -- it's very hardto understand how appellate review can function if thatfirst report of the special trial judge is neverdisclosed.  I just don't see how the appellate review canfunction properly.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And how do we know that it was-- that it was presumed to be correct under the rule?321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.  How does the appellatecourt know whether deference, as required by the rules,was given unless the appellate court can see it?  It'ssuch a strange procedure.          Why, in answer to Justice Ginsburg, does thegovernment take the view it does?  Wouldn't you like tosee it if it went against you?          MR. HUNGAR:  We submit, Your Honor, that thereis no evidentiary or probative value in an initialconclusion that the -- that the person who reached thatconclusion has abandoned, has concluded was wrong.Special Trial Judge --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, the rule --          MR. HUNGAR:  -- Couvillion rejected --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- the rule -- the rule 183does provide for a certain degree of deference to be givento those findings of the special trial judge.          MR. HUNGAR:  To the recommended findings of thespecial trial judge.  And I submit that if the specialtrial judge has concluded that his initial recommendationswere mistaken because, based upon further consideration asa judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, hehas realized he made a mistake, I submit it would bebizarre to require a Tax Court judge to give some sort of-- of deference to --331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hungar, do you --          MR. HUNGAR:  -- abandoned findings.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you see somewhat of aproblem, that we are not dealing here with therelationship between peers?  Judge Dawson is appointed,what, for a 15-year term.  The special trial judge isappointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the TaxCourt's grace.  And if you have compared in your briefthat relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues,I think it's worlds different.          MR. HUNGAR:  Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawsonactually is a senior judge who was recalled.  So hedoesn't have the 15-year term protection.          But it's true that special trial judges are --are appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Courtjudges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawsonwasn't, in a sense, his -- his appointing, employingofficial.          But more to the point, special --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He has had a special -- a --a long term and he is well-known and respected as a TaxCourt judge who was appointed, as all other members of thecourt were appointed.          MR.special trialHUNGAR:  Well, Judge Couvillion has been ajudge, I think, for nearly 20 years.34Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 But the point is special trial judges are bound2 by the code of conduct. The Tax Court has adopted for3 both Tax Court judges and special trial judges the same4 code of conduct that applies to Federal judges under5 Article III, which --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me --7 MR. HUNGAR: -- obligates independent decision-8 making.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me that it's very10 much like, if you have to compare it with something, the11 relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district12 court judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a13 report, findings, and a recommendation. What's the14 difference between those two?15 MR. HUNGAR: Well, one difference is that the16 district court judges, as I understand it, appoint the17 magistrate, not the chief judge.18 But a more significant difference is that the19 statute and rules applicable to magistrates require20 disclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part21 of the internal deliberative process. The Tax Court has22 determined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of23 the original report, then have exceptions and have that24 whole process followed that they used to follow. They25 have determined that they will treat the Tax Court --351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425excuse me -- the special trial judge's report --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So where does it say that?Where does it say that?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  They're not requiring the --this case doesn't involve the question of whether they canmake objections to the finding in -- in the specialreport.  It's just whether it's disclosed.          MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  But the -- butthe Tax Court has determined not to disclose it.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I understand.  But yourargument about how it would make the proceeding morecumbersome, it seems to me, is -- is misplaced.          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, it certainly would be morecumbersome if they followed the procedure that they usedto follow, which we submit, although the record is -- theydid not specifically state --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they're not asking forthat.  Am -- am I wrong on --          MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, that's true, Your Honor.  Whatthey're asking for here, what they say they want is merelydisclosure of the original report.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And it's a particularly strongargument in a case -- in several of the issues.  Iremember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibilityof oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 -- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility2 on one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me3 that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant4 to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility5 determinations were made by the person who heard the6 witnesses.78 witnesses 910 wrong. 111213 what was his -- what was the basis for his original14 position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid15 argument to make on appeal?16 MR. HUNGAR: Under that rationale, Justice17 Stevens, every time a district court judge changes his18 mind, after giving further thought to a case --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, no, no.20 MR. HUNGAR: -- before he issues his final21 opinion --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Only if he is required by a23 rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed24 report to someone else.25 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, the -- the rule does371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. HUNGAR:  But the person who heard theis Special Trial Judge Couvillion.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Has been convinced that he wasMR. HUNGAR:  Yes.JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the question is, well,￼1 not preclude the practice. It is a common practice --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't forbid it. You're3 right. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just4 wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair5 way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know6 what the basis for decision was and who thought what about7 the witnesses and so forth?8 MR. HUNGAR: Absolutely, Your Honor. If the --9 in a -- when a -- when a court has a collegial10 deliberative process involving more than one person that11 is involved in the decision-making -- certainly this is an12 unusual process in that -- and there is no identical13 analog, but we see no due process problem.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I don't see what is15 consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as16 producing the report and the presumption of correctness in17 the rule. The rule presumes that some original document,18 which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a19 presumption of correctness, and I don't see the20 consistency between provisionality and deliberate21 character 2223 not state24 presumption of correctness. It doesn't even say that --25 that any report shall receive a presumption ofon the one hand and presumption on the other.MR. HUNGAR:  If I may, Your Honor, the rule doesthat the, quote, original report shall receive a381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425correctness.  It says the findings of fact recommended bythe special trial judge.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And aren't those findings offact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chiefjudge in the report that is made to the chief judge beforeit is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?          MR. HUNGAR:  Not if -- not if the tax -- if thespecial trial judge has abandoned those recommendations,withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But he hasn't abandoned them atthe point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and ifthat's what this is referring to, then the presumption ofthe -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply towhatever the document is that's delivered to the chiefjudge.          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, it applies to the report, butI submit that if the special trial judge withdraws inorder to correct an error in the report, what he submitsas the corrected report is then the, quote, report.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're -- you're --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't that explained inthe rules, if that's the process?          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- have a conditionsubsequent.  It seems to me that you're saying, Mr.Hungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HUNGAR:  The -- the credibility -- the dueregard and presumption of --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  The presumption.          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, it's important to understandalso that, in fact, it would violate the Internal RevenueCode.  This rule must be construed to be consistent withthe Internal Revenue Code.  The Internal Revenue Codemakes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that theTax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is thedecision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds ofcases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute.  This Courtso held in Freytag and the -- and the statute makes thatvery clear.  So it would violate the statute to construethis, as petitioners do, to require some sort ofdeferential clear error review.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you're saying the ruleitself in that respect is invalid?          MR. HUNGAR:  If construed as petitioners wouldhave it, yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, how else could youpossibly construe it?  There's no presumption operating atall on your reading.          MR. HUNGAR:  In the tax context, Your Honor, the-- there is a presumption of correctness that attaches toassessments and deficiency notices issued by --401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying there is2 -- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate3 with respect to the report that goes first to the chief4 judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would5 violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-6 finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge.7 And therefore, I think the implication of what you're8 saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.9 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, presumption of10 correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error,11 deferential review. That's my point.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not even getting to13 whatever the standard of review may be. I presume the14 word presumption means something other than it's there15 unless you want to change it later after the person who16 employs you objects to it. It's got to mean something17 more than that.18 MR. HUNGAR: What the presumption of correctness19 means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency20 determinations and the like, is that the burden of going21 forward is on the party seeking to change what -- what --22 the determination that is presumed correct.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But there's no party who is24 seeking to change at this point because the parties don't25 know what's in it. They're not going forward. This is,411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 as you point out, an internal process that is going on2 here. So that definition can't apply.3 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. If -- there --4 there are two processes that go on. The Tax Court judge,5 quite appropriately, we -- we assume and have -- have no6 reason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the7 special trial judge. If -- if in the course of that8 discussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion9 that something is wrong in the original report and if the10 special trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has11 the option of withdrawing his original report, submitting12 a corrected report, and having the presumption of13 correctness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected14 report. If -- if --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in that discussion, does16 the Tax Court judge have to give great weight to the17 findings of fact of the -- of the special judge?18 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, not great weight19 because, again, that would violate the statute.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Any weight?21 MR. HUNGAR: He is to give due -- the due regard22 provision we think is essentially precatory, as the -- as23 the Seventh Circuit said. It reminds the -- the Tax Court24 judge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility25 determinations. But again, that's not what happened here.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So I -- I think your -- I thinkyour answer then is not that this is invalid.  It issimply unenforceable.  It is precatory language, looksokay, but there's no way to police it.          MR. HUNGAR:  It's certainly not enforceable inan appellate court.  That's correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Judicially it cannot beenforced.          MR. HUNGAR:  That's correct, because otherwiseit would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningfullimitation.          But again, it's important to understand here theTax Court judge did not exercise his authority in thiscase to reverse or set aside the special trial judge'sfindings.  He could have done so --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do they -- do they ever?  Imean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled --the -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of thespecial trial judge.  Are there Tax Court cases where theTax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies thedecision of the special trial judge or the court rejects,in whole or in part, the report of the special trialjudge?          MR. HUNGAR:  We cite --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do Tax Court opinions come431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 out that way?2 MR. HUNGAR: We cite in footnote 4 a small3 number of cases from prior to the last rule change in4 which that occurred. In addition, there are at least a5 couple of cases since the rule change in which the Tax6 Court judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the7 findings. We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax8 Court judge has rejected the findings, but there are other9 cases -- Little against Commissioner, 103 T.C. 285; Walker10 against Commissioner, 101 T.C. 537 -- in which the Tax11 Court judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the12 opinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to13 decide the case in the manner he or she thought --1415 rule this16 that goes17 Tax Court18 adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would19 expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that20 whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference21 between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in22 combination with the special trial judge or without, would23 say, action on the report -- action on the report, which24 is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or25 it is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean --441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because if one were just to-- read this rule straight:  first, the reportto the chief judge, and then it says that thejudge may modify it, reject it in whole --￼1 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, that assumes that the2 -- that the -- the rule compels the interpretation that3 the special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing,4 correcting, and resubmitting his report. I submit it does5 not compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The rule -- the rule doesn't7 say anything about this consultation that you've8 described. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why9 isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it10 instead of being deceived by reading here is the special11 trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do12 is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?13 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think it -- I mean, I14 don't think it's -- it's deceitful, the -- the possibility15 that a court --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Misleading. Because when I17 just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we18 have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court19 judge, and that judge does something with it, and that20 something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject21 in whole or in part.22 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, when the Tax Court23 adopted its present procedures in 1984, it -- it certainly24 did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. But25 the question is whether it violates the statute or due451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 process for it to do what it has done.2 Let me just -- we've been spending most of our3 time talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court --4 the special trial judge is permitted to change his report5 under rule 183. That's not even one of the questions in6 the questions presented. The only rule 183 question in7 the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear8 error review. We submit the answer to that is no because9 it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. So this --10 this question about whether the report permits -- whether11 the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one12 of the questions presented.13 The courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the14 premise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge15 and the trial -- the special trial judge to engage in the16 deliberative process and for the special trial judge to17 revise his findings as he did --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think there's any --19 any question they can change the report, but the one --20 the one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of21 information. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the22 possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned23 may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive24 further evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen25 that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether or not to go along with the recommended findings,that he will direct oral argument?  Does that ever happen?          MR. HUNGAR:  I don't know the answer to that,Your Honor.  I'm not aware of that, but --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because if he did, it wouldseem almost necessary for him to disclose to the partieswhat the report they're arguing about would say.          MR. HUNGAR:  Again, I -- this is a holdover fromthe prior version of the rule in which the exceptionsprocess was followed, and again, it may be that had theTax Court given it further consideration, they might haveviewed that unnecessary.  But we're not aware of thathappening.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it certainly seems tocontemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case isassigned about whether or not to accept the report anddeliberation which might be informed from input -- inputfrom the parties.  That's a fair reading of the rule, Ithink.          MR. HUNGAR:  If --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Maybe it's not practiced.          MR. HUNGAR:  -- if the Tax Court judge sodetermines, yes.  The rule certainly allows that, but itdoesn't obviously require that.JUSTICE STEVENS: And if he did then ask for 471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 further briefings, do you think that there would then have2 been a requirement to disclose the report?3 MR. HUNGAR: Well, presumably it would be a4 waste of everyone's time unless he -- I don't know that he5 would have to disclose the report, but he would need to6 direct their attention to the issue he would like them to7 brief.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the author9 of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the10 possibility of disclosure of the report.11 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, this12 language was adopted at a time when they followed the13 exception --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: When they followed a different15 procedure, and the question is to how much -- how much did16 they intend the -- to change that prior procedure.17 MR. HUNGAR: Well, we know that the Tax Court18 has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice19 it followed here because it said so. And it would be20 quite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse21 the Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable22 deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all,23 the Tax Court has exclusive statutory authority to24 promulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to25 this issue about whether the special trial judge can481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 change his report, since that was not even one of the2 questions presented.3 If I may turn to -- back to the statutory4 question. Section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of5 the Tax Court. The special trial judge report is not the6 report of the Tax Court. Indeed, even a Tax Court judge's7 opinion and report does not become the report of the Tax8 Court.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the statute you just10 quoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call11 this first draft something other than a report?12 MR. HUNGAR: The statute doesn't --13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, would -- would14 the rule go further than the statute?15 MR. HUNGAR: The statute does not prohibit the16 disclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not17 require the disclosure of reports. The Tax Court in 198418 amended the rule to make perfectly clear that -- that19 initial reports of special trial judges are not to be20 disclosed. The Tax Court said in its orders in this case21 the reason for that is that those are now internal22 deliberative processes. The Tax Court has made clear that23 its rules permit exactly what it's doing here.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, you started to say25 that -- that even the opinion of a -- of a Tax Court judge491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is not a report of the Tax Court.          MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  How does that work?          MR. HUNGAR:  Page 2a of the appendix to the graybrief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) providesthat the report of the division -- and the Tax Court isnow and has for many years been divided into one-judgedivisions.  They used to sit en banc or --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I was -- I was going to ask youwhat -- what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Courtand its divisions.sat in --MR. HUNGAR:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  It also is referred to there.MR. HUNGAR:  For a brief period of time, theyin panels.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.MR. HUNGAR:  But they -- the -- the press ofwork force them to -- to divide into one-judge divisions.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's a single judge is adivision of the Tax Court.          MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, that's correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the publicity ofproceedings does say -- it does say that all reports ofthe Tax Court          MR.--HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor.50Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And all evidence received by2 the Tax Court and its divisions, meaning its single3 judges.4 Well, what happens with -- with a single judge's5 opinion?6 MR. HUNGAR: He -- he prepares it and submits it7 to the chief judge under rule -- under statute -- under8 the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the9 division shall become the report of the Tax Court within10 30 days after such report by the division, unless the11 chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court.12 So -- so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the13 report of the Tax Court. Surely the report of the special14 trial judge is not either.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's like an en banc. I -- I16 have written decisions for a panel in my years on the17 court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my18 opinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything.19 And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have20 the --21 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the opinion22 is not made public. In fact, the statute precludes it23 from being made -- made a part of the record. The last24 sentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page25 3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 of the record in any case in which the chief judge directs2 that such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court. And3 that's a very important point. Congress has mandated by4 statute essentially the same procedure that the Tax Court5 follows here.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, no. No, no, no. How7 often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so8 that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that9 judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's10 initial position was?11 MR. HUNGAR: The -- the Tax Court judge12 certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special13 trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation14 under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a15 -- on a report if he doesn't agree with it. If he doesn't16 agree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the17 obligation, the ethical obligation -- and we presume he18 follows it -- to say I don't agree. This is my report.19 If you --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he -- then he can21 publish his -- he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax22 Court judge can?23 MR. HUNGAR: No, but he can preclude the Tax24 Court judge from doing what the Tax Court judge did in25 this case, which is simply adopting his report. If the --521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if the special trial judge refuses to change his report --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then we still won't knowwhat his report is.  Yes, he can say, I won't sign this.Tax Court says, fine.  This rule says I can reject yourfindings in whole or in part.  I don't need your name onthis decision of the Tax Court.          MR. HUNGAR:  Justice Ginsburg, if -- if thatwere the case here, obviously our arguments would be moredifficult.  But that is not what happened here.  If --if --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm asking you just as the --the judge who disagrees with the -- the full court canpublish his dissent, can the special trial judge whodisagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?          MR. HUNGAR:  In the -- the one case involving achange in the opinion, where the Tax Court judge said, Idon't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trialjudge, there was no published opinion of the special trialjudge.  So I don't believe there's a procedure for thedissent.          But the point is the court of appeals --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has there ever been?  Hasthere ever been?          MR. HUNGAR:  A published dissent by a specialtrial judge?  Not that I'm aware of.531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 But the point is the court of --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how -- how often does the3 -- is there a dissent when there's -- when there's a full4 court review decision?5 MR. HUNGAR: Well, there's often a dissent.6 It's -- it's hard to know from the standpoint of a7 researcher when -- when it is that the judge who heard the8 evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting,9 unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because10 again, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court11 judge who first heard the case. That's kept confidential12 by statute, which again is an important point.13 Congress has mandated confidentiality of the14 initial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it15 has given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate16 rules governing special trial judges. It is hardly17 surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or18 Due Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar19 process for special trial judges.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Except that the -- the21 relationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax22 Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the23 same boat with respect to what they know about or can know24 about law and what they can know about the evidence and25 the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is2 assigned is -- is quite different because only one of them3 has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of4 conclusion about fact.5 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. It's identical.6 The -- the full Tax Court --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: It certainly is not identical8 in -- in the sense that the -- the Tax Court judge then9 goes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the10 whole point.11 MR. HUNGAR: Well, neither does the full Tax12 Court when it --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Neither does the full Tax14 Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one15 judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the16 same boat. They have access to the same material. Their17 limits are exactly the same in each case. That is not18 true in the relationship between the single Tax Court19 judge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax20 Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can21 find facts based upon the evidence that he heard.22 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the tax --23 the full Tax Court doesn't go back and -- and hold a new24 trial, just like the individual Tax Court judges --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I am quite aware of that.551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That's not -- that's not the point.  I'm -- I'm sayingthat you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and fullTax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize therelationship between one judge and a trial master.  Theyare in different positions.  They are not in parallelpositions.          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, then if -- if I understandthe point you're making, it's a point of the -- the --it's the hierarchy issue, if that's -- if that's the pointyou're making.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's the knowledge issue.  Thespecial Tax Court judge heard somebody.          MR. HUNGAR:  So did the Tax Court judge --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Nobody on the Tax Court did.          MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.  That's incorrect.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, they're --they're sitting hearing witnesses?  They are -- they areredoing the trial?  Surely not.          MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, in a review -- if a TaxCourt judge -- most Tax Court cases are tried by Tax Courtjudges.  Tax Court judges are trial judges, and if a TaxCourt judge tries a case --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But we are talking aboutsituations in          MR.which the trial judge is the special judge.HUNGAR:  Well, I'm talking about the full56Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Tax Court, Your Honor.  If the full Tax Court reviews anindividual Tax Court judge's decision, the Tax Court judgehas presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just likethe special trial judge here, and then the full Tax Courtjudge reviews it.          That's exactly what happened in the Estate ofVarian case, which is in our briefs, out of the NinthCircuit.  The parties complained that they wanted accessto the original judge's report because he had beenreversed -- been reversed by the full court after trial onan -- on an evidentiary issue, and the Ninth Circuit saidno.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Hungar, I think weunderstand your answer.          MR. HUNGAR:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Shapiro, you have about 4minutes left.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SHAPIRO               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. SHAPIRO:  The question came up whether rule183 forbids disclosure of this report.  The answer is itdoes not forbid disclosure of the report.  It is silent onthe point.  But the press release the Tax Court issued in1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said thatthis simply meant that it would not automatically be571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425disclosed.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why does 7461 require its --its disclosure?  Because it does say that the -- it's onlythe decision of the Tax Court.          MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That reports of the Tax Courtthat have to be disclosed.          MR. SHAPIRO:  Our view is that of -- of the TaxCourt means any report emanating from the Tax Court.That's the literal meaning of that language.  It doesn'tmean final.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that -- that would meanthat -- that you would have to make public the -- thereports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then goon to the full court.  And that's not done, is it?          MR. SHAPIRO:  There's an exception for the enbanc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc,not the factual issues.  And there's an opportunity todissent.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but it doesn't matter.It would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don'ttake that language literally.  If you say any reportcoming out of the institution is a report of the TaxCourt, you would have to make public the reports of theindividual Tax Court judges, which is not done.581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, we say there's a special2 statute dealing with the en banc situation that -- that3 governs in that situation. And that the publicity --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? What -- what5 statute is that?6 MR. SHAPIRO: That -- that's the en banc7 provision that counsel referred to that said that when the8 case is heard en banc, the trial -- the -- the single9 judge's report is not made part of the record. Congress'10 assumption there was that there would be a new -- new11 report issued. People would be able to dissent if they12 disagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues.13 There is no presumption of correctness.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not a -- that's not a15 de novo -- they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc16 Tax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.17 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, but it addresses legal18 issues. It's not a device to second guess factual19 determinations, and there's a special statute that deals20 with that, which does not apply to this STJ situation,21 where there's a presumption of correctness applicable to22 what the trial judge does. And there is the general23 disclosure statute that applies there.24 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if I'm getting --25 so that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 disclosure because they've interpreted it differently2 within their -- within their discretion. Statute3 doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require4 it. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see5 exactly the implications. So I'm nervous.6 And now, the reports -- he says, go read7 7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then --8 and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read9 it more broadly than that. And what about all evidence10 received by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of11 course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript.12 And -- and so maybe that word evidence can be read more13 broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript14 of the stenographic report.15 MR. SHAPIRO: I think you're right, and --16 JUSTICE BREYER: You think I'm right just17 suddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of18 this?19 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think that the intent20 of this provision -- and I know Your Honor consults the21 legislative history. The intent was to make all of the22 steps in the adjudicative process transparent, including23 the evidence, including the -- the stenographer's report,24 and all reports from the Tax Court.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's -- there's a very601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 careful use of language. It says all reports of the Tax2 Court and all evidence received by the Tax Court and its3 divisions. So it's only the evidence that -- that's4 received by the individual judges has to be made public,5 not the reports.6 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we believe that the word all7 is a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied,8 as Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has9 to be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal10 effect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk11 memorandum. It has legally operative effect.12 Congress' purpose here was very broad, to have13 transparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in14 the Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are15 arbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at16 the Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements,17 they said18 and it --1920 get into any of that if we accept your argument about21 7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner22 and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.23 MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely, Your Honor. There --24 there are three separate bases for ruling in our favor.25 One is the appellate review statute. The other is the611111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOsecrecy is a vicious practice in this context,it should be avoided.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we -- we don't have to￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425disclosure statute.  The third is due process.  And dueprocess should inform the construction of these statutes.This Court tries to avoid serious due process issuesthrough its interpretation of legislation.  Judge Cudahysuggested that was the right way to decide this case andwe agree that it is.          We thank the Court.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40062Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
