Clark.      Mr. Meyer.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MEYERON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. MEYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      In cases of foul acts done in secret wherethe child is the party injured, the repelling of theirevidence entirely is in some measure denying them theprotection of the law.      That 254­year­old passage, I think, quiteaccurately predicts the situation we find ourselves inin Ohio following the decision of the Ohio Supreme Courtin this case, we believe, misapplying the SixthAmendment Confrontation Clause to these facts.      We believe the Ohio Supreme Court erred intwo fundamental ways.  First, when it held that privateparties who are acting with no police involvement byvirtue of their mandatory reporter's status aretransformed into law enforcement agents or agents of thegovernment for purposes of the Confrontation Clauseanalysis.3Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:of the government for the Confrontation Clause to kickin?MR. MEYER: Based on this Court's post­Crawford decisions, we believe that that is the primary analysis that should be conducted.JUSTICE SCALIA: Not primary. I'm asking, is it ­­ is it exclusive that no person who's not an agent of the government can trigger a Confrontation Clause protection? I mean, that's clearly not true. I mean, you ­­ you can have a cross­examination in a civil case, a lawyer in a civil case has somebody on the stand.MR.

MR. MEYER: Well, going ­­ going back toCrawford itself and what this Court explained was thepurpose behind the Sixth Amendment, when the framersadopted it, was to prevent a very specific kind ofabuse.  And that's government agents who areinvestigating crimes for purposes of a criminalprosecution.  And when you reduce it to the level of athree and a half­year­old child talking to histeacher, I would submit that that is far ­­Official￼daycarewhethernature? MR. MEYER: Yes, Justice Sotomayor, that ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So whether it's given to a private individual or a police officer is irrelevant. The question is, was it intended to substitute for testimony to be used later.MR. MEYER: That is the test that this Court has announced in ­­ in Davis certainly. But we have submitted, I think, perhaps a threshold formulation maybe, before you get to primary purpose, and this Court has consistently applied it to law enforcement actors. When you talk about private persons, I think that is an5JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. MEYER:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:        Doesn't the ­­­­ removed.                                Isn't the testthe statement is intended to be testimonial inAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 easier test, coming from this as a boots­on­the­ground2 trial prosecutor and trying to predict the way that3 primary purpose test is going to be applied, I would4 suggest the private party analysis as a first step would5 lead to more predictable results. Certainly ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Meyer, could you7 explain one anomaly in this case? The child, three and8 a half years old, is incompetent to appear in court as a9 witness. How can the substitute be permissible? If the10 child is incompetent to testify in court, why isn't the11 child incompetent to testify out ­­ make the same12 statement out of court?13 MR. MEYER: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,14 I think it would be a mistake to say that his15 incapability, his incompetence for purposes of the16 courtroom setting means that nothing he's ever said on17 planet Earth could be taken as a reliable statement.18 Any parent knows that talking to their three year old,19 certain things they say can be relied upon.20 The Ohio rule, evidence rule 807, which is21 modeled, I think, off of this Court's opinion in Idaho22 v. Wright somewhat applies very rigorous factors to23 determine reliability.24 And so I think the ­­ the choice for a25 prosecutor is not between live testimony and hearsay. I6Alderson Reporting Company6 but how7 Justice8 whether9 could acould this child ever have the intent thatSotomayor described?  Which is the test ofparticular evidence is testimonial or not.

I mean, you could ­­ you could have5 an exception to your ­­ to your hearsay rules. But ­­10 intent?11 MR. MEYER: I don't think he can. And I12 think, looking at this Court's emphasis in ­­ in both13 Davis and Bryant on the declarant's purpose, if you view14 it from that standpoint, and Crawford ­­ Crawford's15 requirement that the person bear testimony, he's just16 incapable of doing so.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's ­­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then they can talk about19 testimonial and I think we should, and I don't want to20 take argument in another ­­ suppose that this is not21 testimonial. Suppose you prevail on that. Isn't there22 still a question as to whether or not this is hearsay23 that is so unreliable that it violates the Confrontation24 Clause slash ­­ and/or the Due Process Clause and we25 remand for that?7Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      If we ­­ if we rule in your favor that thisis not testimonial, that at the end of the case theirstatement comes in or do we remand?  Or is it before usto say, part two, we think this is inadmissible underother hearsay principles that are so well settled thatit's a violation of either the Confrontation Clause orthe Due Process Clause?MR. MEYER: I don't think question is one for the Confrontation think the reliability question is one Process Clause. And so if ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And has addressed here or is that still open?the reliabilityClause.  I dofor the ­­ the Duethat beenMR. MEYER:JUSTICE KENNEDY:MR. MEYER:I think that's ­­      We ­­ we remand for that?Official￼                        I ­­ I think that's still open.And if you have a situation where the States aredesigning their rules for the deliberate purpose of ­­of avoiding having live witnesses come to court, a shamrule, that would be a very arbitrary rule under the DueProcess Clause, but I don't think the ConfrontationClause is what that was designed to address.Certainly ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the Due ProcessClause?  Do we ­­ have ­­ have we adopted hearsay rules8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 under the Due Process Clause?2 MR. MEYER: Not that I'm aware of, Justice3 Scalia. What I meant ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was up to the5 States, let it in and let the jury take it for what it's6 worth. I'm not sure we've ever ­­7 MR. MEYER: What I meant to say ­­ and I8 think this Court did say this in Crawford ­­ was that9 the reliability question is one for the States and their10 democratic processes. And ­­ and they should have some11 leeway in formulating their hearsay rules. And so12 unless the ­­ the hearsay rules themselves rise to the13 level of a due process violation, the reliability14 question as this Court has explained is not for the15 Confrontation Clause. Otherwise, I think we're16 backsliding towards the Ohio v. Roberts analysis and the17 constitutionalization of all hearsay rules.18 JUSTICE KAGAN:19 JUSTICE KENNEDY:20 JUSTICE KAGAN:21 back to what you said before in answer to Justice22 Scalia? We can all obviously agree that three year olds23 don't form any kind of intent to make testimonial24 statements. But ­­ but that would suggest that there ­­25 the Confrontation Clause just doesn't come into play at9Alderson Reporting CompanyMr. Meyer, can I go back ­­  Or of some hearsay rules.Sorry.  Can I ­­ can I go24 testimonial evidence.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:You're forgetting ­­Official￼1 all with respect to any people with diminished capacity,2 without the capacity to form that kind of legal intent.3 And that seems ­­ that seems not right to4 me. That it seems as though there ought to be some5 other inquiry that substitutes for the intent inquiry6 when we're talking about people with diminished capacity7 in order to decide whether a statement that they make is8 testimonial.9 MR. MEYER: If you disagree with my10 formulation that private parties is the first step, this11 Court has consistently said that there's three key12 inquiries. The intent of the declarant, I think, has13 been this Court's focus, but also the intent of the14 questioner, and the circumstances of the questioning.15 And at the outer margins, I suppose there could be a16 situation where the intent of the ­­ the questioner17 might tip the balance. But in this case, the Ohio18 Supreme Court seemed to put all of its emphasis on the19 possible speculative intent of the questioner, and I20 think that's fundamentally wrong. If the intent of the21 declarant isn't to do anything other than respond to the22 basic questions asked like the declarant in Bryant, like23 the declarant in Davis, I don't think you have10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 you're forgetting the circumstances prong of it. Were2 the questions here by the interrogator for purposes of3 law enforcement or were they for the purposes of the4 ongoing emergency, the abuse of5 MR. MEYER:6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:7 MR. MEYER:8 the questioner's standpoint, the teacher was just simply9 that. And I think a helpful way to look at this,10 Justice Sotomayor, is to remove this reporting11 requirement and ask if the questions would be any12 different. And I submit they would not.13 These are just the basic questions that a14 teacher would ask when a three year old comes to school15 with a bruised face. It's a concern the teacher has for16 their student and to say that that teacher is17 stepping into a role of a law enforcement officer, I18 think, is ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that goes to20 reliability, and that goes to whatever the finder of21 fact, whether they take that approach or they take22 another. But the point, I think, that Justice Kagan is23 making in deciding the intent of the declarant, you have24 to look at what everyone else is doing and who they are.25 MR. MEYER: Well, I think that ­­ it ­­ it11Here ­­So ­­I thinkthe ­­ the intent fromAlderson Reporting Companythe child?Official￼1 may go to reliability, but more fundamentally, it goes2 to the function that these actors are ­­ are performing.3 And if these aren't law enforcement people, if there's4 no direction by the police, this is just a teacher and5 student.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose this, Mr. Meyer.7 Let's take the ­­ the diminished capacity out of the8 equation. Let's just presume a 13­year­old kid rather9 than a 3­year­old. And the 13­year­old kid comes in10 with welts or bruises or whatever it is, and the teacher11 says to the 13­year­old, Listen, Joe, I want to know12 what happened, but I want to tell you that I'm under a13 statutory reporting obligation, so everything you tell14 me, I'm going to tell the police, and I'm going to write15 down everything you tell me just so I can get the facts16 straight.17 Would you think that that is testimonial18 such that it's a violation of the Confrontation Clause19 if that comes into a case without the opportunity for20 cross­exam?21 MR. MEYER: It ­­ it may be, and if I could22 explain.23 If both the intent of the questioner and the24 intent of the declarant both acknowledge that, in some25 way, this is going to the police and the circumstances12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of the discussion is for the police, that's a much2 closer question, and I would ­­3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that seems to me then,4 is then ­­ it suggests that the way to do this is5 actually more the way the S.G. suggests, that we should6 just ask in every case whether there ­­ whether a7 statement is testimonial rather than to draw the very8 sharp distinctions you want us to with respect to9 private parties.10 MR. MEYER: Well, I think the Solicitor11 General in Ohio's opinion are ­­ are harmonious in that12 they agree in their brief that in almost every13 circumstance, a private discussion is not going to be14 testimonial because it's just not for law enforcement.15 And maybe the better way, if the Court agrees, is to16 view it as a threshold determination before you even get17 to the question of purpose. And I would agree at the18 outer margins of some of these hypotheticals, you have19 to look at purpose to sort out difficult facts.20 To say that, like the Ohio Supreme Court21 did, we just look at the foreseeability of the statement22 reaching law enforcement is fundamentally wrong.23 Everything that you see in life that you might have to24 testify about as a private person may make its way to25 law enforcement, but that's not the intent, I would13Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 submit, of the framers when they adopted the2 Confrontation Clause.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you remind us, the4 young people who ­­ who heard this child's utterances,5 what ­­ did their statements come in? The6 grandmother ­­ was it the grandmother, the aunt, the7 social worker, and the police, what happened to their8 statements?9 MR. MEYER: Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth10 District Court of Appeals ­­ those statements did come11 in at trial. The Eighth District Court of Appeals ruled12 that their admission violated Ohio evidence rule 807.13 And so while they were heard by the jury, they14 were ­­ they were not, according to the intermediate15 Ohio appellate court, proper evidence.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the teachers didn't17 violate ­­ the teachers ­­ that was an hearsay18 exception; is that right?19 MR. MEYER: The Eighth District analyzed the20 teacher's statements exclusively on the Federal21 constitutional question. There was no discussion of22 Ohio rule 807.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then what ­­ if all24 the others were ­­ were inadmissible under Ohio's own25 hearsay rule, why wouldn't the same thing apply to the14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 teacher? What's the difference between the teacher and2 the social worker?3 MR. MEYER: Well, first ­­ first off,4 Justice Ginsburg, I think this is a ­­ a purely Federal5 constitutional question. But if you look at ­­ if this6 were to be remanded to the Eighth District for7 consideration of that issue, you ­­ you would have to,8 and the Eighth District would be required to look at9 very specific factors that I think distinguish the10 child's statement to the teachers, to those of ­­ the11 social worker and the police the next day.12 The teachers asked the questions very close13 in time to when the injuries occurred. It was within14 hours. They also asked very open­ended questions.15 There were only two real questions: Who did this? And16 what happened? These are all factors you can look to to17 assess the reliability of the statement under Ohio18 evidence rule 807.19 But more fundamentally, both the Eighth20 District and the Supreme Court of Ohio have said as a21 per se matter, these are testimonial statements and that22 we disagree with.23 I would ask to reserve the balance of my24 time for rebuttal.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼123 ON 456 it please the Court:7 The Ohio Supreme Court did err by viewing8 the teachers here as equivalent to police. And if I9 could turn first to Justice Sotomayor's concern there, I10 think that it is significant that these were teachers11 and not police officers; teachers who were not acting as12 surrogates for police, but in their normal, ordinary13 role as care providers for this child.14 Teachers aren't in the business of15 prosecution. They're not in the business of collecting16 evidence, and as such, this Court can generally presume17 that when they inquire of their students as to how they18 got hurt, they are asking out of a concern for welfare,19 safety, and out of their normal, routine role, not as a20 means of collecting evidence.21 It's also significant that when you take22 away, you strip away that view of the teachers as23 equivalent to police, the conversation viewed through24 that lens takes on a very different character. Instead25 of scrutinizing each question and answer to determine16Ms. Eisenstein, welcome.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ILANA EISENSTEINBEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING PETITIONERMS. EISENSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 whether this is an emergency on the one hand, or whether2 it is a ­­ a need to address a criminal violation,3 instead there is a whole range of reasons why these4 teachers, out of care for the student, would be asking5 what happened and how the child got hurt.6 And fundamentally, the type of fluid,7 informal, spontaneous conversation between the teachers8 and the students is far from resembling the type of core9 Confrontation Clause testimonial statements. It lacks10 the type of formality, the solemnity, and it also11 reflects that the teachers were addressing a present12 purpose in trying to understand how this child was13 injured.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: But what happens,15 Ms. Eisenstein, really along the lines of the16 hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Meyer where it's pretty17 clear to both the teacher and the student that back of18 that conversation, is the presence of police. In other19 words, the teacher will say, I'm under a reporting20 obligation, or maybe the kid will bring it up. If I21 tell you, does that mean it's going to the police? And22 the teacher says, Yes, it23 when ­­ when that arises?24 MS. EISENSTEIN:25 is a much harder case fordoes.  You know, what happens   Justice Kagan, I think thattwo reasons.  One is from the17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 declarant's perspective, which is where I believe this2 Court generally starts. The declarant is now3 recognizing that this teacher is essentially a direct4 conduit to police in a way that a 3­year­old child here5 certainly did not.6 And secondly, the teacher is expressly7 recognizing her role as, in some respects, a surrogate8 for police. Now, not in all respects. And that's ­­9 you know, an important point as to one of the special10 concerns with prosecution and police questioning is that11 there is an additional concern with the police that they12 may, for one thing, shade the nature of the13 conversation. It's also a concern where there is a14 level of structure and formality, that simply the15 conversation would tend to resemble testimony or the16 taking of evidence.17 None of that would be present in this kind18 of informal, spontaneous interaction between a ­­ a19 civilian who frankly the ­­ the teachers who initially20 questioned the student and elicited the statement that21 Dee did it, did so ­­ did so prior to their supervisor22 recognizing an obligation to call ­­ to call in. And23 even then, in your hypothetical, one further distinction24 is that the teachers here and the obligation here was to25 call social services, not police. While it certainly18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 may have been foreseeable from an objective standpoint2 whether there was the subjective view here ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was4 either ­­ that the school teacher could notify either5 the social worker or the police.6 MS. EISENSTEIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they7 can notify either. But when the police are notified,8 then the next step is for the police to call in social9 services, and the first responder at the agency charged10 with investigating primarily child abuse especially in11 the very immediate moments, as was the case here, is the12 social welfare agency, the social services agency not13 the police.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so I have it clear.15 Social services, if they're selected to ­­ to get the16 information, I assume they have the obligation to advise17 the police. Am I wrong about that?18 MS. EISENSTEIN: I ­­ in terms of there19 is ­­ there is a cooperative structure, at least under20 the Ohio statute. And nationally, in these reporting21 structures there's ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a legal requirement23 in Ohio that social services report to the police?24 MS. EISENSTEIN: I'm not sure the extent,25 Justice Kennedy, of the sharing of information and the19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 degree to which social services in this particular2 statutory scheme must report all information to police.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, would I be right to4 think that where there is any kind of serious injury,5 police are involved as a routine matter?6 MS. EISENSTEIN: Well, Justice Kagan, I'm7 not sure about that. At least one of the amici cites8 that in a majority of cases of reported child abuse, it9 is social services alone who investigates the case.10 Clearly, in this case, the police got involved, but I do11 know that the police did not get involved until two days12 later when the second social worker came to the house13 and discovered a much more serious circumstance than was14 presented initially at the daycare.15 JUSTICE ALITO:16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:17 JUSTICE ALITO:18 circumstances where a ­­ a person seems to be under a19 threat, maybe ­­ may have been hurt, seems to be under20 a ­­ an ongoing threat. Someone questions that21 individual and the person who makes the statement, as22 well as the person who asks the question, may have in23 mind immediate safety concerns and also the possibility24 of criminal prosecution.25 How realistic is it to try to break that20Alderson Reporting CompanyThere can be a lot of ­­        Go ahead.Okay.  There can be a lot ofOfficial￼1 down and determine which of the two is the primary2 purpose?3 MS. EISENSTEIN: I think that is a challenge4 and the test, but it's less challenging in the context5 presented here where you have a ­­ a ­­ an ordinary6 citizen questioning a small child. It may be a more7 difficult circumstance that the cases like Bryant and8 Davis where you have police who have a duty, one of9 their primary duties, to collect evidence and forward to10 prosecution to ­­ to try to parse that out.11 I think this Court can comfortably believe12 that it is the hearsay rules that should govern the13 interactions at issue here and not be governed by the14 Confrontation Clause.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you had ­­16 maybe this is just a specific example of what Justice17 Alito is talking about, but what if you have the teacher18 who did this to you, Dee, the teacher knows there's19 nobody in the immediate vicinity named Dee, and then she20 asks, Well, has he done this before? I mean, is that21 something that's not subject to the Confrontation22 Clause? It's not related to the immediate concerns or23 immediate safety but seems to be designed to compile a24 case.2521MS. EISENSTEIN:Well, Your Honor, to theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 extent to which the teacher is asking that question, I2 think that one of the ­­ the presumptions here is that3 it's not to gather, to collect evidence for a case4 because she's not thinking police prosecution, and5 there's good reason why ­­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know7 that? Maybe she is ­­ you know, we've got to protect8 the child. The way we do is to get the person who did9 this locked up, so she wants to confirm who is it.10 Doesn't need to know that for the immediate safety of11 the child.12 MS. EISENSTEIN: Well, and the immediacy ­­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, sorry, wants14 to know whether he has done it before.15 MS. EISENSTEIN: The immediacy here is not16 whether ­­ if I'm understanding your hypothetical, not17 immediate in terms of at the school, but in this18 particular case, there is the immediacy that, as was the19 case here, the defendant was the one who picked up the20 child and took him home at the end of the day leaving21 him, as it turned out, in a far worse position when the22 social worker finally tracked him down. So that is23 often ­­ I think that's one of the motives, frankly, for24 these mandatory reporting statutes is because of the25 recognition that there is an urgency involved when22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 children ­­ when there is suspected abuse. And so ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what am I supposed3 to ­­ what are we supposed to do if we think 50 percent4 of the motivation was to comply with the statute and ­­5 and ­­ and her duty as a teacher not to send this kid6 home, and 50 percent was in order to fulfill the7 reporting obligation to the police. Then ­­ then what8 do we do?9 MS. EISENSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, I think10 you still have to the look at the three parts that this11 Court has addressed: the declarant, the questioner's12 intent, and the circumstances. And this Court has13 looked at those in tandem, and when you look at the14 perspective of the declarant, which they ­­ Ohio Supreme15 Court, in my view, erred in ignoring, he's not going to16 see his daycare teacher as an evidence collector. And17 when you look at the circumstances like the18 circumstances here of a spontaneous and informal19 encounter in the classroom, it has no resemblance to the20 type of abuses the Confrontation Clause is meant to21 address.2223 you. 2425If there are no further questions, thankCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher?23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER2 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT3 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it4 please the Court:5 We are not here today asking for any sort of6 rule that would ban prosecutors from using statements7 like LPs in criminal prosecutions. All we are asking8 for is for the State not to be allowed to have it both9 ways, introducing such evidence while at the same time10 prohibiting the defense from any form of confrontation11 whatsoever. And you don't have to look any further than12 the facts of this case to see the grave dangers that13 such a system would present to the accuracy of criminal14 prosecutions. The only ­­15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the ­­ the16 ­­ the judge said this witness is not ­­ this child is17 not competent to testify as a witness, and you've read18 the transcript. How ­­ how can there be a question of19 cross­examining a 3­year­old? The ­­ this person is20 incompetent as a witness because the ­­ the testimony is21 unreliable?22 MR. FISHER: Well, two things, Justice23 Ginsburg. Remember, first of all, the State is taking24 the position, by necessity, under its own hearsay law,25 rule 807, that what the State said ­­ I'm sorry, what24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the ­­ what the child said when he was, in effect,2 interviewed by the teacher, was particularly likely to3 be trustworthy. And so it seems to us quite impossible4 for it to take the position that 6 months later the5 child cannot, in the words of the Ohio evidence rule6 601, quote, "relate events truly."7 So we think it's utterly incompatible, but,8 Justice Ginsburg ­­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, just let me stop10 you. Part of your answer I don't follow because one11 thing is the child is asked immediately, on the spot,12 close to the time to when this occurred. The trial is13 months later, and one of the problems with 3­year­olds14 is they don't remember.15 MR. FISHER: Well, that ­­ that ­­ that is16 an issue. Of course, the Court's Confrontation Clause17 jurisprudence squarely holds that even if a witness has18 difficulty with memory, that does not impede19 confrontation or defeat the defendant's rights to20 confrontation.21 But I think you're also asking, you know,22 what good would cross­examination do in this setting,23 and so let me answer that in two ways. First of all,24 there are innumerable reasons ­­ and perhaps, Justice25 Kennedy, when you've talked about reliability, some of25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 these were in your mind ­­ as to why we might doubt the2 veracity of LP's initial statements. The teacher3 herself said, I'm not sure he understood me, she fed him4 a line, is it Dee? Is it Dee who did it? The child,5 LP, knew that his three older siblings had already been6 removed from his mother's custody because she had abused7 them, so he would have had an incentive and knowledge of8 how the system worked when he was answering that9 question.10 So there are numerous reasons we might be11 very concerned. All we're saying ­­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, you start by13 saying she fed him a line. I understood that she asked14 him who did it and he said Dee, and she didn't know what15 Dee meant.16 MR. FISHER: Yeah, she said, Dee, Dee, is it17 Dee who did it. That's what I meant, Justice Sotomayor.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but it wasn't as19 if she got Dee out of thin air.20 MR. FISHER: Fair enough. Fair enough.21 But if I could turn back to ­­ I think the22 other thing you're asking, Justice Ginsburg, is how23 would cross­examination be useful here. And let me be24 clear, all we're asking for is something; more than25 nothing. You know, the State itself, after getting the26Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 allegations from the teacher, the social worker2 testified, I had to go out and ask this child myself to3 see whether this was true, to see whether it4 believable.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY:6 MR. FISHER:7 JUSTICE KENNEDY:8 not ­­ not Ohio. There's a mandatory reporting duty to9 the social services by the ­­ by the teacher, and the10 same facts. And I'm the trial judge, and this statement11 is offered, and I say, does the defense want to examine12 the 3­year­old or the 4­year­old, and provide some means13 2 or 3 months later ­­ 2 or 3 months after the Dee14 statement, to cross­examine the child maybe in the15 clinical setting that you suggested in your brief.16 Any problems with that? What ­­ what if ­­17 if we're saying what the rule should be in that kind of18 situation, that kind of State, what ­­ what guidance can19 you offer?20 MR. FISHER: I ­­ I think you would start21 with Maryland against Craig where the Court has held22 that confrontation of children can be more flexible to23 accommodate child's perceptions, understandings and24 abilities.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:27     May I ask thisThat's all we want.     Suppose I'm in­­State X,Alderson Reporting CompanyThat ­­ that case, thewas1 child was held competent as a witness.Official￼2 MR. FISHER:3 JUSTICE GINSBURG:4 MR. FISHER:5 creature of the State's own making. It can ­­ many6 other States, and we've provided an amicus brief from7 three illustrative States ­­ Arizona, Iowa, and8 Connecticut ­­ like many others, deem all children9 competent in this setting, at least competent to give10 testimony. We think that's a much better rule and it11 gets me back to Justice Kennedy's question, I believe,12 which is, we think it would be perfectly acceptable to13 have testimony, if necessary, and if proper findings14 were made taken outside of a courtroom, perhaps even15 through an expert, I think a very strong argument could16 be made, if it were necessary to be made to this Court17 or any other, that if by interviewing the child outside18 of a courtroom in a more therapeutic setting is more19 likely to be able to enable the child to tell his storyThat's right.  Now, remember ­­      This ­­­­ competency, though, is a20 and to answer questions, then21 is all about.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY:23 happened, would the statement24 MR. FISHER: Yes, of course, because once25 you have confrontation, then you can bring in any prior28Alderson Reporting Companythat's what confrontationAnd if ­­ but if thatto the teacher come in?Official￼1 statement, and that's the essence of our position.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But by confrontation you3 mean the ­­ you ­­ you have a therapeutic expert, but as4 the defendant's witnesses, you're not ­­ I don't think5 you suggested that the Court could appoint its own6 expert and the defendant would be out of it. I mean,7 this is ­­ the way we do things in our adversary system8 is you're a partisan expert, you're the defense expert.9 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think10 the defense would have to have some inclusion in this11 questioning. We cite an Arizona case in our brief where12 a child interview specialist conducts the interview, but13 she has an earpiece with the defendant's lawyer in14 another room that's able to direct questions for.15 Her. So I think the defendant would have to16 be participating, but I'm not sure it would be an17 irreducible requirement that the defendant's lawyer be18 asking the questions.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:20 MR. FISHER:21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:22 your basic premise. I know that you're attacking the23 competency question a lot. But what is it about the24 statement that makes it testimonial? Is it the rule25 that the State ­­ that she's a mandatory reporter, as29       Mr. Fisher ­­And Certainly the Court ­­Alderson Reporting Company­­ I want to go back toOfficial￼1 the Ohio court thought?2 Tell me what you think. Is it any3 out­of­court statement? What ­­ what is it that makes4 it testimonial?5 MR. FISHER: Well, you start with the rule6 the Court laid down in Davis and repeated in Bryant,7 which is: If the primary purpose of the statement is to8 establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a9 criminal prosecution, then you have a testimonial10 statement.11 And I think a helpful way to analyze this12 particular statement is to start with Justice Kagan's13 hypothetical. If the teacher had said to a student ­­14 and, as in this case, there's nothing spontaneous about15 what happens here ­­ pulls the student aside and says,16 "You" ­­ says, "I need to know ­­ tell me what happened17 and who did this so I can tell the police," I think the18 other side, if ­­ almost conceded that that would have19 to be testimonial.20 But on the facts of this case, that is, in21 fact, precisely what you have when you conduct a proper22 objective totality of the circumstances.23 JUSTICE ALITO: There's ­­ there's an24 awful ­­ a ­­ a great distance between Justice Kagan's25 hypothetical and what happened here.30Alderson Reporting Company      MR. FISHER:the Declarant shortly?      JUSTICE ALITO:      MR. FISHER:about the teacher.Can I say one more word about   Sure.And then I'll respond to youOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      First of all, there's the age of theDeclarant.  Do you really think a three­year­old or athree and a half­year­old can have any conception thatthe thing that the ­­ that this child is saying is goingto be used in court to prosecute somebody for a crime?MR. FISHER: No, Justice Alito. I don't think it's ­­JUSTICE ALITO: All right. So the Declarant is out. And then you have the teacher, and the teacher isn't saying anything about gathering evidence for a criminal prosecution. I would think the first thing on the teacher's ­­ I ­­ I don't think the teacher probably broke it down that way. The teacher is concerned about the safety of this child, period.      I absolutely concede that a three and ahalf­year­old doesn't have sophisticated knowledge ofhow the criminal justice system works, but I think athree and a half­year­old does understand when he'sasked to ­­ whether somebody did something wrong to him.Again, remember that LP's three older siblings had all31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425been removed from the home already for his mother'sabuse and neglect.  I think he would have understood hewas being asked ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a big assumption, to know that this child understood the criminal process at three years old.MR. FISHER:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:before had the ­­      MR. FISHER:process."     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:removed?     MR. FISHER:process."  And ­­ and all I want to make the point is,is that if we're going adjust for the age of children,we also need to adjust across the board.  And I think itwould be enough, to the extent we're looking at thedeclarant's purpose, to understand that he was beingasked to make an accusation of ­­ of wrongdoing.      Now, turning to the teacher's purpose, Iwant to talk about four things that are very important:First, the nature of the injuries; second, the teacher'straining; third, the teacher's actions; and fourth, Ohiolaw, because when you put them all together, you end up32I ­­ Justice Sotomayor ­­       And when ­­ how long­­ I didn't say "the criminal       ­­ children beenI didn't say "criminalAlderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR.

Don't give that child back to a potential abuser.      So the teacher, I would think, is notthinking about prosecution down the road:  What can I doto assure the safety of this child right now?MR. FISHER: Right. So ­­ so I think that does lead me right to what I was about to try to say.      First of all, the injuries were very serioushere, and the teacher quite well knew that they didn'toccur in the classroom.  They had occurred outside theclassroom, and so the ­­ and one of the teacherstestified, only once ­­                                Why did the teacherbother saying that she wanted to make sure that it33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 wasn't another child?2 MR. FISHER: The teacher never testified to3 that, Justice Sotomayor. The closest you have is this4 quote the State pulls from J.A. 60, where the teacher5 said, "I asked whether Dee was big or little."6 But the teacher, in the very same paragraph7 of testimony, says the reason why she asked that8 question is she was wondering whether it was an older9 brother or sister. So the teacher knew it ­­ it wasn't10 something that occurred in the classroom. Of course, LP11 had just gotten to school. And as I'm trying to say,12 one other teacher had said, "Only once in nine years13 have we seen something like this."14 So, secondly, that leads me to the teacher's15 training. We've cited to the reference for educators16 that Ohio gives to all teachers. It's at page 37 of our17 brief. And the teachers are told to look out for child18 abuse, they have a special duty to look out for child19 abuse, and when they see it, they're supposed to ­­ and20 I'm going to quote page 31 ­­ they are supposed to21 gather, quote, "information which might be helpful to22 establishing the cause of the abuse."23 They're told to gather information that24 would be helpful to establish the cause of abuse. So25 she is gathering evidence. That's what she's told to34Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. FISHER:JUSTICE GINSBURG:      But before we ­­­­ that training ­­Official￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425do.  And, quote, "the identity of the perpetrator."      Later on in that reference guide, it tellsthe teacher that a local prosecutor will then decidewhether to prosecute.  And then, understanding ­­                               ­­ get to the prosecutor,is this child going to be returned to this person whothe child has identified as ­­ it seems to me that ­­that there is a concern immediately with the child'ssafety, and there is also, down the road, the potentialprosecution.  But the ­­ if you have to divide what isthe prime purpose, it seems to me that the well­being ofthe child has got to be the first thing in the mind ofthe teacher.MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what Justice Ginsburg has said is completely consistent with your No. 3. She wants to find out the cause. She wants to know if there's something happening at home where this kid should not go back home that day.MR. FISHER: That ­­ that's right. We don't dispute that a teacher has a protective purpose, partly, in mind. And I think it's absolutely natural that the teacher would.35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 But the problem is, and our position is,2 that is inextricably intertwined with criminal3 prosecution as well. That's what the Ohio Supreme Court4 said, construing Ohio law, is that one of the chief5 methods of protection is prosecution. And ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Much too late.7 MR. FISHER: Well, it might be too late.8 But, Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't make it that much9 different than the situation you had in Hammon involving10 domestic violence. It doesn't make it ­­ that much11 difference in a situation you have with a police officer12 or someone else trying to get a drug dealer off the13 corner, to try to get a white­collar criminal to stop14 embezzling money.15 All of those things are ongoing crimes, but16 gathering statements that help both stop the harm that's17 occurring and useful in the criminal justice18 proceeding, we think, still are testimonial when that19 criminal incentive and purpose is intertwined with the20 protective purpose.21 Even my adversary, I think, acknowledged22 that even if it were nothing other than the teacher23 trying to get information for protective purposes ­­24 that is, removing LP from the custody of an abuser ­­25 that's a civil case and civil process, which I36Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425wholeheartedly agree would still trigger theConfrontation Clause.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Fisher, you ­­ in Davis, when a abused woman is separated from the abuser, she can voluntarily say, "I don't want to go back." She can make her own choices.      How does a child make those choices?MR. FISHER: I think it's ­­ obviously, it's more difficult, Justice Sotomayor. I think the true dynamics of domestic violence don't make that choice terribly easy.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I know for many women it's not ­­ they don't perceive it as a real choice. I'm not naysaying that.MR. FISHER: Right. But there are other ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I think there is a difference in terms of protecting a child and protecting an adult.MR. FISHER: There are differences, but again, I would give you my drug­dealing­on­the­corner hypothetical. There are numerous innocent victims that are going to be harmed by the distribution of those narcotics until the person is taken off the street, but we don't therefore say that when statements are gathered to do that as quickly as possible, that they're37Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 non­testimonial.2 JUSTICE ALITO: Let's suppose that everybody3 who could have possibly done this to the child was4 immune from criminal prosecution. They're all5 diplomats. They all have diplomatic immunity. Would6 the teacher have done anything different?7 MR. FISHER: Perhaps not, Justice Alito.8 I ­­ I'm just not sure what that tells us, because even9 if the teacher was gathering evidence for a civil legal10 process, then I think you still have a testimonial11 statement.12 JUSTICE ALITO: The Confrontation Clause13 applies in civil cases?14 MR. FISHER: Well, it applies in the same15 way Justice Scalia was adverting to earlier. I think if16 somebody made a civil deposition, I think that ­­ the17 Confrontation Clause doesn't apply in that setting, but18 if the statement were tried to be used later in a19 criminal prosecution instead of testimony ­­20 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but all these people,21 they are immune from prosecution, from criminal22 prosecution. Would the teacher have done anything23 different?24 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure she would ­­25 they ­­ they would have.38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that would be the end2 of the question, isn't it?3 MR. FISHER: I don't see why it is.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Because then the teacher has5 no purpose of gathering evidence for use in a criminal6 prosecution.7 MR. FISHER: Well, the purpose is gathering8 evidence for use in serious legal proceedings, and I9 think that would be enough, if I had to make that10 argument. I don't have to make anything like that11 argument. Let me tell you now about Ohio law that's12 hanging over this interaction. And, Justice Kennedy,13 you asked about the social ­­ the relationship between14 social services and the police. Ohio law quite15 explicitly and unambiguously requires the social16 services agency to share information of any possible17 abuse, criminal abuse with the police, and also the18 Cuyahoga County's own guidelines which we cite in our19 briefs. So there's no doubt those two things are20 intertwined.21 And secondly, the independent ­­ the22 mandatory reporter statute along with Ohio Rule 80723 expressly make these statements admissible in criminal24 court proceedings. So you put all this together and25 it's ­­ it's ­­ I just think it's frankly undeniable39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that the criminal process is hanging over this. And so2 really, the only hard problem is I think the one Justice3 Ginsburg is asking is, how do you disentangle that or4 how do you weigh that against the protective purpose,5 which the teacher must have had as well.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. ­­ Mr. Fisher, can I ask7 a question that steps back a little bit? Because it8 seems to me that the strongest part of your case goes9 something like this. This is a statement that's going10 to come in and is going to have great consequence in a11 trial. It's going to function as the most relevant kind12 of testimony imaginable, it's an accusation. In a case13 like this, there are two potential parties that could be14 accused. Essentially, this is fingering one of them,15 and it's being done by a three year old.16 And ­­ and the question of whether that's a17 particularly reliable way to choose between which of18 these two potential people did it is like a little bit19 scary. And then you're not being able to question it,20 you're not being able to do the things that you normally21 do.22 Okay. So all of that, seems to me, that's23 your strongest case. And it seems to me that it doesn't24 fit very well with the test we have and what the25 questions that we're supposed to ask. In other words,40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 all of what I said seems to be ­­ or most of what I said2 at least ­­ seems to me kind of irrelevant to the3 question that we ask under the primary purpose test and4 what do we do with that lack of fit?5 MR. FISHER: I think I can answer that6 question while also going back to the question I posed7 before you asked the question, which is what do you do8 when it's too difficult to pinpoint a purpose? The9 Court has also described in its cases the very helpful10 inquiry of whether the thing ­­ the statement when it's11 introduced in court functions as an in­court substitute12 for trial testimony. That is exactly what the13 testimonial test is designed to answer and I think part14 of the power of the ­­15 JUSTICE KAGAN: You see, I think I don't16 think it really does. I mean, the way I've always17 understood the primary purpose test is that it's not18 whether it functions at trial as testimony or how the19 jury understands it; it really is how the declarant20 understands it, maybe leavened by some ­­ you know, what21 does the questioner think and what are the22 circumstances. But it seems to be mostly about the23 purpose of the person who's making the statement24 which ­­ which fits, you know, not very well with these25 kinds of concerns that you're talking about.41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the linkage2 between the two is that when a statement is made outside3 the courtroom for the primary purpose of establishing4 facts that might be relevant to a later criminal5 prosecution, then when it's transported into the6 courtroom, it does perform the substitute of trial7 testimony, which is exactly why you so accurately said,8 there was such power in this statement. The prosecutor9 at closing said ­­ just as she would have said if LP had10 taken the stand ­­ she said when this child of three and11 a half years old is asked who did it, she said Dee did12 it, he said Dee did it. And so the way the prosecutor13 presented it to the jury was as a precise perfect14 substitute for in­court testimony. And it's not I think15 dis ­­ disjointed from the fact that outside the16 courtroom, the statement was made to establish a fact17 relevant to prosecution. It's difficult.18 JUSTICE ALITO:19 hearsay is a substitute for20 test you just gave us seems21 hearsay, doesn't it?22 MR. FISHER: No. I think a jury would view23 a stray remark to an acquaintance, as the Court has put24 it, as a piece of evidence, relevant evidence perhaps,25 but not as testimony. It wouldn't make sense to42Alderson Reporting CompanyBut all ­­ all admissiblein­court testimony.  So theto me to encompass allOfficial￼1 describe somebody's ­­ I think this Court has put it2 this way ­­ somebody's stray remark to an acquaintance3 or somebody's cry for help, later on as somebody's4 testimony. But here, this is exactly LP's testimony.5 That's what it is functioning as.6 And if I could turn to one other piece of7 Ohio law that I think is important to have before you.8 We've talked about Ohio rules of evidence. They're9 both ­­ both the relevant rules are in the appendix to10 our red brief. On 2A, it is Ohio rule of evidence 80711 that is very unusual. And Justice Kennedy, you were12 asking earlier about this, I think.13 First of all, this is a rule of evidence14 that no State had any rule of evidence like this until15 1982. This was a brand new thing that came up only16 after Roberts. And the entire purpose of this law is to17 gather out­of­court accusations and to use them as a18 substitute for trial testimony. So let me point you to19 two aspects that show that.20 First of all, the only thing that the21 State ­­ that the hearsay law gathers up are statements,22 quote, "describing any sexual abuse or physical abuse23 directed against the child." So the sole target of this24 hearsay law is to get out­of­court accusations of25 criminal conduct. And then odder yet, looking at the43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 first sentence, it says, "An out­of­court statement made2 by a child who is under 12 years of age at the time of3 trial, making such an accusation," ask yourself why the4 words "at the time of trial" are in this hearsay rule?5 If it were designed to pluck out reliable statements6 from the world, it ought to be asking some question7 about the world when the statement was made. But it's8 conditioning admissibility on some fact at the time of9 trial, which is still further evidence that what Ohio is10 doing is gathering up these statements to use them as a11 substitute for in­court testimony.12 And so the pedigree of this hearsay rule in13 contrast to innumerable other well­established rules14 that the Court has dealt with in the ­­ in the past show15 the problem here. And even Justice Thomas has talked in16 his separate writings about evade ­­ you know, a State17 system that would evade the confrontation right. If18 there's ever a State system that would evade the19 confrontation right, it's taking this rule and then20 coupling it with Ohio rule 601, which automatic ­­ which21 presumes that all children under 10 are incompetent to22 testify.23 So it's telling the State you can ­­ you can24 gather up selectively these out­of­court accusations,25 using the reporter requirement, teacher training, all44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the rest, and then you can go into court and introduce2 those statements and at the same time completely bar the3 defense from any form of cross­examination whatsoever.4 The defense has no right to compulsory process. He has5 nothing.6 And Justice Kagan, you asked about the facts7 of this case, and this is where I was speaking at the8 beginning, I don't know if you could have a more vivid9 example of the true danger of a wrongful conviction than10 the facts of this case, whereas the Ohio court of11 appeals said the only direct evidence are LP's12 statements.13 And LP is found incapable of relating true14 events. And the circumstances under the statement ­­15 under the making of the statement that I described give16 you great ­­ I hope would give the Court great pause17 before condoning a system. And I want to emphasize that18 word "system" that would allow convictions like this.19 Because you don't have to look further than the back of20 our red brief where we reference the ­­ the Texas21 attorney general's own manual that it's issued to22 teachers.23 Under Texas, they already have the rule that24 in effect Ohio is asking for here. Statements that are25 made to social workers and police officers are deemed45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 inadmissible. But statements first made to teachers are2 not. And so what does the Ohio attorney general's3 office tell its teachers? Please gather up as much4 accusatory evidence as you possible ­­ as you can ­­ as5 is possible; otherwise, important testimony might be6 lost. So you have already a system set up for7 prosecution by out­of­court statement ­­ out­of­court8 accusation.9 And that is exactly what the Confrontation10 Clause is designed to ­­ to prohibit. And I ­­ believe11 me, I ­­ I understand the Court when it gets down into12 the weeds of the primary purpose test and says to13 itself, boy, it's really hard to ­­ sort of looking in a14 vacuum to ask what is the primary purpose here? But if15 you have that difficulty, draw the lens back a little16 bit and ask yourself whether this prosecution comports17 with anything relating to the spirit of the18 Confrontation Clause.19 I submit to you, I just don't see how it20 can. Let me put the point another way. I know that,21 obviously, in some of the more recent decisions applying22 the Crawford case, some of the Justices on the Court23 have developed some misgivings about the full breadth of24 that decision. But I ­­ I want to really forcefully25 tell you this is not the case to cut back on Crawford.46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 If you applied the old Roberts regime, it2 would be an absolute lay­down for me and my client3 because of the unreliability of the statements Justice4 Kennedy has noted.5 So it's not Crawford v. Roberts that's6 driving the discomfort here. I really think that if7 anything is driving discomfort here, it's the discomfort8 we have with putting this young child on the stand, and9 for ­­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But ­­ but isn't ­­ but11 doesn't that indicate that the testimonial inquiry is12 somewhat ­­ somewhat awkward and formalistic?13 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Kennedy ­­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And ­­ there's ­­ just to15 follow up, it's almost the same one, that there are16 States in which every citizen has a ­­ has a duty to17 report abuse; is that not correct?18 MR. FISHER: That is correct. It's not19 Ohio, but it is correct. But we don't rest our case20 solely or even primarily on the mandatory reporting21 requirement. There's the whole constellation of other22 facts, involving the injuries, involving the teacher's23 training, involving Ohio law, the way it's written and24 the like that ­­ that make us far different than any25 other ordinary mandatory reporting.47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 use the primary purpose test at all. Maybe it doesn't3 fit as has been suggested, but what of the information4 that a few of the briefs conveyed, that in most of these5 cases, the abuser is not criminally tried. There is an6 attempt to provide for the safety of the child and maybe7 there is family counseling, but in most cases ­­ most8 cases, a criminal prosecution is not waiting at the end9 of the road.10 MR. FISHER: Let me say two things, Justice11 Ginsburg. First, that's because most cases don't12 involve injuries as serious as this. My client got13 30 ­­ almost 30 years in prison because of the14 seriousness of the injuries here. And so, I don't think15 there was any ­­ any possibility this wasn't going to be16 a criminal prosecution. And, in fact, the Cuyahoga17 County guidelines that we cite tell social workers to ­­18 to divide up cases between the really serious ones and19 the less serious ones, so criminal prosecution is the20 really serious one.21 But even if ­­ even if I took your premise22 to apply even on facts like this, imagine a State that23 said, most drug cases we're going to put into a24 divert ­­ a noncriminal diversion program. I can't25 imagine, then, that it would take the ­­ that that would48Alderson Reporting CompanyDid we ­­ I'm going toOfficial￼1 take statements alleging drug use or drug possession or2 drug dealing out of the realm of the Confrontation3 Clause, because everybody would know that criminal4 prosecution was still intertwined with that system.5 And I think that's where I would leave you,6 is that if you struggle with the primary purpose test7 here, look at the overall setting and look at the way8 this is used at trial.9 JUSTICE BREYER: To be fair to you, I don't10 think the misgivings come so much from ­­ they come from11 the fact that you don't want ­­ I don't want to see the12 Confrontation Clause swallow up the 30 exceptions to the13 hearsay rule, and therefore you have to draw lines.14 This case is tangential. This case involves tragedy15 either way. It's a tragedy to abuse children. It's a16 tragedy to put the wrong person in jail on the basis of17 unreliable testimony.18 Now, with that kind of tragedy, it seems19 tailor­made for the Due Process Clause, allowing States20 to experiment, allowing the bar to work out some of the21 things you say. What's at issue here to me, is the22 problem of not having that Confrontation Clause swallow23 up the 30 exceptions which are necessary in many24 instances for the justices of a trial. That's at a25 general level, since you asked.49Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FISHER: Yeah. No, please, I'm glad. Justice Breyer, that, I hope, gets me back to rule 807, though, which is that shows the extreme unusualnature of the hearsay law except at issue here. So we're not doing anything that would touch other hearsay laws; those could be other Crawford cases down the line.      So you have a highly unusual hearsay lawdesigned to evade the Confrontation Clause.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you've ­­ but you haven't raised a Due Process argument.MR.

Whether thisOfficial￼wouldissueStatefighting the unreliability here, but you're not raisingthe right challenge.or would not be an excited utterance is anotheraltogether under ­­ depending on how strict thedefines that.

All I'm asking for is that before youput somebody away for 30 years, give them at least whatthe State has.  The State itself is already conductinginterviews of these children in advocacy centers or withtheir own personnel.  Give the defense at least the sameopportunity.  It's no additional ­­ it's a marginaladditional effort and trauma on the child.  And we do along ways to protect against these kind of wrongfulprosecutions and convictions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Meyer, you have five minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MEYERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MEYER: Thank you.One key point of disagreement I have with mycolleague is the issue of Ohio law.  And specifically,Ohio law does not impose upon any mandatory reporter aduty to investigate.  And if it did, I think that wouldbe a fundamentally different analysis.  Because thekinds of abuses this Court has told us the Confrontation51Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Clause was designed to address, are government abuses.2 And where you have a situation where mandatory3 reporters, who are simply people who interact with4 children in their day­to­day lives, are required to5 report to the social services agency what they learn6 just going about their business, that is fundamentally7 different than, let's say, the Marion magistrates who8 are going out collecting affidavits and submitting them9 in criminal trials as evidence.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in Ohio the teacher11 satisfies his or her duty by just phoning social service12 and then, "There's a kid with terrible bruises in my13 class, good­bye." That's it?14 MR. MEYER: That is it. Now, the issue came15 up, and I think it was pointed out, that you can also16 satisfy your duty by reporting the ­­ the abuse to the17 police. The statute then, in turn, requires the police18 to notify children's services. So we have a regime19 that's set up to protect children.20 And I'd also point out that in many of21 Ohio's 88 counties, you don't have a children's services22 agency set up to go out and deal with these emergencies,23 let's say, in the middle of the night. You call the24 person who is equipped to deal with it, and that's going25 to be the sheriff most often.52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 In response to the indication that the2 accusation is the most important component of this, I3 would say certainly the ­­ there was an accusatorial4 element in the declarant in Davis. Even the victim,5 Covington, in Bryant as he lay dying, I think, could6 understand that, when he's telling the police that7 so­and­so shot me, there's an accusatorial element8 there. The Dutton case, which this Court referenced in9 Crawford, and the statement by the prisoner, "If it10 hadn't been for that son of a bitch, Alex Evans, we11 wouldn't be here," that is an accusatorial statement.12 But that does not transform it magically13 into testimonial statements for purposes of the14 Confrontation Clause. Ohio's teachers, I think, are15 horrified to learn that the Supreme Court of Ohio used16 them no different than cops when they're talking to17 their child ­­ the children in their classrooms. That18 is fundamentally not the type of analysis that ­­ that19 any court should be conducting when it comes to20 testimony ­­ whether statements are testimonial.21 So in closing, I would reiterate my prayer for reversal22 and point out that this three­year­old child, when these23 bruises were being described to his teacher, is just24 fundamentally unlike the ­­ the treasonous conspiracies25 of unknown scope aimed at killing or overthrowing the53Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425king, which is the Sir Walter Raleigh case.
