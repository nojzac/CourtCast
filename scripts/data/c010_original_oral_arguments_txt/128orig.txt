FRANKLIN                ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF          MR. FRANKLIN:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          Because title to lands underlying navigablewaters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty,this Court has long held that there is a strongpresumption that each State receives title to such landsat statehood.  Under the Court's precedents, the UnitedStates cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress hasdefinitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwisemade that intention very plain.          Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case,the United States asserts that it received title to thesubmerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but thereis no express statement, an unambiguous statement byCongress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title.          To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) ofthe Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute theUnited States identifies as ratifying the purported3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains2 with Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the3 proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would4 otherwise have been transferred to the State under the5 main clause. And this is important. In this case it is6 undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special7 Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included8 within the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore,9 did not --10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, counsel, you --11 apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the12 uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section13 5 --14 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes, Your Honor.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of the statehood act.16 MR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely.17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And why was Federal title to18 the monument not sufficient to retain title to the19 submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e)20 at all?21 MR. FRANKLIN: Because of section 6(m), Your22 Honor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides23 that the Federal Government retained all of the property24 it previously possessed with one important exception,25 except as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here.2 Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and3 thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all4 the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus5 those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put6 Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the7 States.8 Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different9 set of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer10 to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of11 property, property that was used for the purposes or12 solely -- for the sole purpose of -- of fish and wildlife13 conservation under three designated statutes. Those are14 the State -- local-State fish and wildlife conservation15 statutes.16 Again, here it was -- it is undisputed that17 Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause.18 Therefore, the --19JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- problem, as -- you just-- that the main clause is very, very narrow,told by the Government that no wildlife20 said that21 and we're22 reservation would come within that main clause, so that23 there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.24 MR. FRANKLIN: The Government is incorrect, Your25 Honor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were2 otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the3 proviso.4 And here's why the United States is correct on5 that. They argue in their brief that those properties6 were not included in the main clause because they were7 created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the8 Alaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are9 the exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply10 restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that11 means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the12 Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the13 purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the14 then-existing version. These refuges were created in 194115 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So16 those are two properties.17 And -- and actually the legislative history --18 we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative19 history because the statute is plain and also because20 there's a clear statement rule. But the legislative21 history does indicate that Congress was specifically22 concerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai23 and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is24 approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut.25 And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might notbe able adequately to manage those properties.  But therewas no such concern expressed with the monument that's atissue here because it was never going to be transferred tothe State under the main clause.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Why -- why shouldn't we lookto the tests set out in the Idaho case here?          MR. FRANKLIN:  We are advocating the tests setout in the Idaho case, Your Honor.  That test is a two-pronged test.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.MR. FRANKLIN: First, you have to look and see if there is a --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Whether Congress has noticeof the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation,which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?          MR. FRANKLIN:  That's -- that's relevant to thefirst prong, Your Honor.The second prong --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And second, whether thetransfer to the State would undermine the purpose of thatreservation.  Should we look to that?          MR. FRANKLIN:  If the Court were examining the-- the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factorsmight be relevant.  Here, though, the test is set out in7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and thatis that there has to be an explicit action by Congress.And Idaho applies that.  Idaho looked very carefully forsome action by Congress ratifying the reservation in thatcase.          Here, we need an action by Congress.  The UnitedStates has identified what they contend is the action ofCongress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of theAlaska Statehood Act.  That proviso, though, just does notcover these lands.JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say explicit? I -- I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really might matter.MR. FRANKLIN: In --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What it says -- the language Ithink is -- or definitely declared or otherwise made veryplain.MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. In the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?  There's nothingthat says explicit.  Right?          MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, Your Honor, in the Alaskacase -- and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997Alaska case.  There the Court said that Congress must,quote, explicitly recognize or that Congress hadexplicitly recognized the resignation in that case.  So8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the -- the Court --JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that simply meanthat if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.          MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it doesn't mean that itmust be explicit in every case.  Isn't that correct?MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I -- I think explicit --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  You don't have to be explicitto make it plain.  It's a great way to do it, but that's-- it's not the only way.MR. FRANKLIN: It has to be definitely -- Justice Breyer, you're correct. It has to be --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.          MR. FRANKLIN:  -- definitely clear or otherwisemade plain.  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  If I'm correct, then -- if I'mcorrect, then I guess the main argument I thought is herewe have a national park and we want to keep the nationalparks as the United States, which you'd expect.  It's anational park.  And of course, they want to keep the wholething.  I mean, it's obvious.  You don't have to writeeverything that's obvious.  They no more want to give allthe water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to givethe gamekeeper's part to Alaska.  A house, or maybethere's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 either, but it's just obvious that unless there's2 something very special about the water, that the water in3 the park is part of the park.4 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, there is something special5 about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has6 recognized. The water is a State -- an essential7 attribute 89 it's likeof State sovereignty, and just to --JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. But I mean, saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're10 giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's11 even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I12 think is -- would be is this like that, and the argument13 that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need14 this water in order to study the glaciers because there15 are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora16 and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it17 isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's18 good enough. Now, what's your reply?19 MR. FRANKLIN: First of all, the geysers are not20 included because we're talking about navigable --21 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. I'm using a22 funny example to --23 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. Navigable waters.24 (Laughter.)25 MR. FRANKLIN: But let me -- let me just assure10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-2 owned submerged lands within national monuments. The3 reason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the4 President to designate national monuments, was enacted in5 1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the6 Union. Therefore, any national monument created in those7 45 States8 submerged9would necessarily have included State-ownedlands unless there had been some conveyance.And let -- let me give Your Honors a -- a10 concrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided11 by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel12 Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national13 monument off the coast of California, included State-14 owned submerged lands because even though the reservation15 order was asserted to have included those lands, there was16 no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the17 State's title.181920 a river I 2122 before the State of Wyoming and --23 JUSTICE BREYER: No. But I mean, does the State24 or the Feds own the -- the river that goes through it?25 MR. FRANKLIN: One would need to examine theAnother --JUSTICE BREYER: Like in Yellowstone. There is think. Who owns that?MR. FRANKLIN: Well, Yellowstone was created11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 particular reservations and statutes there.2 JUSTICE BREYER: What about in Yosemite? I3 think there's a river down there too. Is the river in4 Yosemite owned by California or by the -- the Feds?5 MR. FRANKLIN: I'm not familiar with that, but I6 will give you an example that I am familiar with.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, Mr.8 Franklin, is -- is the rule that -- that we're operating9 under that Congress had to have made it clear --10 1112 rule that13 it?1415 Honor. 16171819 doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not20 make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?21 MR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Right, but normally you assume,23 I guess, that Congress does what is -- tries to avoid24 things that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park,25 I guess the question would be is that included. I mean --12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that it reserved, or is theit is clear that Congress ought to have reservedMR. FRANKLIN:  No.  It's the former rule, YourJUSTICE SCALIA:  It's the former.MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the mere fact that it￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FRANKLIN: It's not --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- can you read it this way?  I-- I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?          MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, first of all, this is notthe ordinary -- in this case we presumed the -- theopposite.  In fact, there's a strong presumption.          But let me give you the other example that I wasgoing to refer to you.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.          MR. FRANKLIN:  There's something called theCalifornia Coastal National Monument.  That extends theentire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea.In that monument, the -- the lands, the submerged lands,are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they aremanaged cooperatively.And that's what we are seeking to do here. And importantly, the fact --submergedJUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Franklin, are -- are theselands covered by navigable waters?MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is it that the Governmentif they owned the submerged lands, by way ofcould do,protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they wantto do, that they cannot do simply by -- by reason of -- ofhaving jurisdiction over the navigable waters?13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FRANKLIN: There are a few things,2 presumably very localized activities that the State would3 have the exclusive authority in. Importantly though, the4 Federal Government, even though the State owns title here,5 will retain all of its constitutional authority under the6 Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that7 affect interstate commerce that --8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but just as a practical9 matter, tell us what you're arguing about. What does10 Alaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier11 Monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical12 matter?13 MR. FRANKLIN: As -- as a practical matter,14 there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing15 that are important to the State. There are issues16 relating to local uses of the bay. But more17 importantly --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could -- could you be19 concrete? I mean, there -- I don't know what you mean.20 What are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?21 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, one explicit example is I22 think the State would prefer to have more local23 subsistence fishing in the bay. And the Court -- to -- to24 move out a bit, the --25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So the State would permit14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 more fishing than the U.S. would allow --2345 and there 6MR. FRANKLIN: I think --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as a practical matter. MR. FRANKLIN: As a practical matter. And -- -- there --JUSTICE SCALIA: But couldn't Congress forbid7 that under -- by reason of its control of the navigable8 waters --9 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, if --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it really wanted to?11 MR. FRANKLIN: If Congress really wanted to,12 Congress could -- could affect activities relating to13 interstate commerce.14 But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really15 is a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over16 anything that happens in its navigable waters which17 its sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is18 have its views being considered.19 Right now -- and I'll give you a concrete20 example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in21 in the next count that I'll discuss. For some time22 ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and23 dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside --24 or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of25 Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005are tothe -- cruise￼1 Federal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of2 Congress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress3 to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge4 out in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska5 finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress6 every time something comes up on its navigable waters that7 it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with.8 Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State9 under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to10 do that.11 I think we also need to keep in mind what waters12 we're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The13 waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the14 region. They are central to the economy, the history, the15 society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live16 there and who travel there.17 Just to take an example, there are still today18 very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the --19 the towns and the cities like the -- the State capital of20 Juneau historically were accessible only by the water.21 This is an area -- the water in particular is an area that22 is of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to23 confirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think24 we have set forth in quite detail why --25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there -- there are big16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425differences between the -- the analysis concerning thebays that you assert and Glacier Monument.  I thinkthey're quite different.MR. FRANKLIN: Well, the -- the tests are different. The Glacier Bay test involves -- needs to have an explicit reservation -- explicit ratification by Congress of a reservation and --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  You're lumping them alltogether, but I think the tests are quite different.          MR. FRANKLIN:  The tests are different.          What I was trying to explain is, in answer toYour Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska.  Itmatters quite a deal.Bay --JUSTICE BREYER:  But in -- in respect to GlacierMR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: -- I -- I mean, is the only -- you said, for example -- is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?          MR. FRANKLIN:  There are two issues.  I thinkit's fishing and also to allow more local people to visitthe area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Service. There was -- but just to assure Your Honors --2 JUSTICE BREYER: How could they do that? You3 mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water4 there, but they couldn't get off the boat?5 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, that's normally what --6 what people do is they just visit the --7 8 9JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.MR. FRANKLIN:  -- by boats.But to assure Your Honor, there -- for example,no mineral interests here anywhere in the10 there are11 picture.1213 the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat14 and to go up along the waterway and to look at theJUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So if -- if15 glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the16 United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska,17 for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left18 of the park. I mean, it would be like -- you see, if it's19 essential to it.20 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, that's not true, Your21 Honor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it22 included the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no23 more unusual --24 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I understand that, but I25 mean, it's the way of visiting the park.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes, but I just mentioned, for2 example, the two monuments in California. The Channel3 Islands National Monument this Court held included the --4 the submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other5 way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse6 State-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are7 few national parks in this country you can't get to8 without going across State lands.9 I think there's another important point here and10 that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also11 allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on12 lands that abut national parks to the extent that they13 might affect park activities.14 But here what we need is an expressed statement15 by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay.16 Without that, Your Honors -- and the -- the precedents are17 clear. Without that, the presumption is -- in fact, the18 strong presumption is -- that these are State-owned lands.19 And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is20 part of our Federal system. It's the way that these21 monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the22 President first got the authority. It's the way that23 Glacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we24 intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government25 to resolve any issues that might remain.19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at thetable.  We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealtwith because they are the owner.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the -- in the '97 case,was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)?Because this --          MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.  The -- the Court expresslystated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in theabsence of any contrary argument.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It -- it made an assumption.MR. FRANKLIN: The Court made an assumption, but in fact --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But was it in fact?          MR. FRANKLIN:  I think there would have been asubstantial -- had that -- had that issue been litigated,there would have been a substantial argument that it wasnot within the main clause.  But again, there was noargument on that point before the Court.  The Court atpages 60 to 61 expressly stated -- again, it was anassumption, but the Court expressly stated that the landswere within the main clause.  Apparently the Court wasconsidering the fact that the application for ANWR did, infact, reference the purposes that were set forth in themain clause, the Alaska Game Law.The important point of that case for this case, 20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the2 construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here,3 namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal4 Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise5 have been transferred to the State under the main clause.6 There simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an7 intent --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we had left that9 open. I thought we --10 MR. FRANKLIN: I think what I said is that the11 Court embraced that position, and it was actually an12 essential attribute of the -- essential premise for the13 Court's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the14 -- the decision, what the Court made clear is it was15 concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso,16 all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would17 have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was18 one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was19 covered by the proviso. No such concern is present here.20I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if Ithe count I, which is the historic waters count.United States asserts that at statehood thesoutheast Alaska were riddled with isolated21 might, to22 There the23 waters of24 enclaves of international high seas that were wholly25 surrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 record, though, belies that contention.2 At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States3 took what this Court has described in the Mississippi4 Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as5 the publicly stated policy that the waters of the6 archipelago were inland and that the political boundary7 ran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States8 took -- consistently based a discriminatory enforcement9 regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I10 mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed11 U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the argument on the other13 side, as I understand it, is that the -- the assertion of14 authority15 It has no16 doctrine.17to regulate fishing really is -- is relevant.necessary implication for the historic waters What -- what is your answer to that?MR. FRANKLIN:  That's the assertion.  My answer18 is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 197519 decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202,20 and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the21 Court said there is it examined an incident in which a22 Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general23 area, and the Court said -- and I quote -- that incident24 deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel25 more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and,2 quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the3 waters in question.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what page was that?5 MR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202 --6 201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of7 the blue brief.8 What the law was at statehood is that the United9 States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce10 discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign11 vessels.12 Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that13 is that the law has changed. The law has changed since14 1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a15 200-mile -- what's known as an exclusive economic zone16 that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory17 fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that.18 But -- and we have quoted a UN study. In fact,19 the UN study that we have quoted -- and that is noted at20 page 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's21 called the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that22 this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases,23 has used as the authoritative statement of the law. That24 study quite clearly states that if a -- if a country25 enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 vessels outside -- that that manifests an assertion of an2 historic inland waters claim. And what we have here --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: On -- on this point, it seems4 to me there -- unlike the first point you were discussing5 where I think the Federal Government can work its will6 anyway, on this point there is really a significant7 Federal interest involved. That is to say, if the United8 States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland9 waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights10 in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.11 MR. FRANKLIN: No. Your Honor, they assert12 that, but they don't provide any specific examples. And13 the reason they can't provide a specific example of any14 instance abroad where it would affect their position is15 that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own16 facts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not17 render it historic waters.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you say a19 determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply -- is20 simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.21 MR. FRANKLIN: It is a claim to the -- to the22 waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with23 discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other24 statements in this case, including the California brief to25 this Court. There has to be an -- excuse me --24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before2 one can conclude that waters are historic waters. These3 ones are. Other waters would not be. The United States4 has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely5 these constellation of facts. So its -- its position is6 basically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I --7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not the United8 States that will be making the judgment about what areas9 are controlled. It would be the country abroad. And I --10 I think the argument was, what the United States does11 other nations will copy.12 MR. FRANKLIN: Right.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they will decide what14 looks like the Alaska --15 MR. FRANKLIN: Right.16 What the United States does, Your Honor, is17 follow the well-settled international law on historic bays18 -- historic waters. Those are set forth in the19 convention. Each state will have the same authority where20 its facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been21 a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the22 acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as23 historic waters. But it has to be done based on a -- an24 examination of the particular facts of the case.25 And one thing else -- one thing other that is25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a2 nation can always close it off using article 4 straight3 baselines. That is permitted under the convention. The4 U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are5 fully able to do that.6 I think that if the United States is going to be7 arguing that there is some international precedent here8 that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a9 particular body water abroad that it believes this case is10 going to affect.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it make that12 suggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of13 the United States.14 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, it -- it needs to explain15 more specifically then, other than just stating we think16 it might affect our position. The -- the facts and17 circumstances -- the Court, for example, applied the18 historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the19 Mississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in20 which that precedent was ever used adversely and the21 United States has not identified any -- any instance.22 But more importantly, what this Court did in the23 Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it24 said is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court25 concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court follows.2 At this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining3 time for rebuttal.456789 it please1011 Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park.12 Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the13 statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that14 the United States intended to retain the submerged lands15 in Glacier Bay. For this --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- before you go into17 that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?1819 helpful. 20212223 the -- the introduction to it is -- is not listed,24 I mean --25JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, Mr. Franklin.Mr. Minear.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P.

It -- it just says all real and -- what about all real and personal property? Is there an intro that says there is hereby -- there is hereby granted to the United -- to Alaska?          MR. MINEAR:  Well, 6(e) I think begins statingthat this -- these are exceptions to section 5 which isthe retention -- the general retention provision of theUnited -- for United States lands.But if we look at 6(e) itself, it's --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say they're exceptions. How -- how are the exceptions introduced? I mean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all -- what about all real and personal property of the United States? There has to be some introductory language. What is it?MR. MINEAR: No. Actually there doesn't, Your Honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal property -- then you skip down, about halfway down -- shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency. So it is -- so this is complete in terms of --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Okay.  You're right.          MR. MINEAR:  But if I could walk you throughthose provisions because I think they're quite important.28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The first provision says, as you say, all real and2 personal property which is specifically used for the sole3 purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall4 be transferred to the United States.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.6 MR. MINEAR: It's followed by another provision7 here.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to Alaska.9 MR. MINEAR: To -- to Alaska. Excuse me.10 And it's followed by another proviso which says11 that the United States will continue to control fish and12 game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has13 certified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that14 proviso is not a subset --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Minear, before you get too16 far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that17 was raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that18 section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the19 United States retains title to its own property, that the20 response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged21 Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?22 MR. MINEAR: No, I don't. I don't believe --23 let me frame the -- your -- your question, if I may, for24 you. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain25 all of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m)29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the -- to2 the -- to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there3 are some lands the United States would continue to retain,4 provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands5 Act.6 The particular exception we're concerned about7 here is the expressly retained exception, in other words,8 if lands are retained by the United States. This Court9 said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts10 the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands11 Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States12 would be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an13 express statement. It simply requires that it be made14 plain.15 Now, our view is that these lands would be16 retained by the United States, quite apart from 6 -- the17 6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary18 judgment. And if you denied our motion for summary19 judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions20 that are applicable.21 But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e)22 and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic23 Coast decision made clear that 6(e) -- and I quote --24 reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote,25 to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife -- or reservations for the protection of wildlife.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't have this issue before us. Let -- let me --          MR. MINEAR:  Yes, we did.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- let me -- why don't you goback to your argument?  You said that the first proviso onits face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).MR. MINEAR: Yes. It's an example how provisos do not need to be --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not the proviso atissue here.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The proviso at issue here isthe second proviso which begins provided that suchtransfer shall not include lands.  Such transfer.  Now,this is -- the word such refers you back to something.What -- what possible transfer could it mean except theend of the introduction, which says shall be transferredand conveyed to the State of Alaska?MR. MINEAR: Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, anybody reading thatwould -- would think that proviso refers to that transferor at least it is not clear that it provides to -- that itapplies to every transfer in -- in the whole act.31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. MINEAR: I disagree with you, Justice2 Scalia, for these reasons.3 First of all, the such transfer simply tells you4 what's not included. That language tells you -- this is5 outside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows6 necessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was7 doing here, by making clear that these lands were not8 transferred --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the such refer to?10 MR. MINEAR: It does refer to the transfer11 before. But what follows here, refuges and reservations12 for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within13 that -- that main clause. It's obvious they don't because14 the only things that fit within the main clause are those15 lands and real property specifically used for the sole16 purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife.17 What we're talking about here -- wildlife18 reservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used19 solely for -- for the purpose of conservation. The20 purpose of the first provision here was to transfer21 vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State22 would need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the23 point of -- of that first provision. But Secretary24 Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative25 history that what he was doing was drawing a line between32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425those -- those facilities and equipment that are used by aState in its traditional game management and drawing acontrast with the matters that would be retained by theUnited States.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Where is the language that saysthat the submerged land that fits the proviso is retainedby the United States?          MR. MINEAR:  We          JUSTICE BREYER:what Justice Scalia said.          MR. MINEAR:  Wethat expresses --JUSTICE BREYER:do not need --What the proviso says is justdo not need express language No, no, but where is theimplication in that?          MR. MINEAR:  The implication is that we areretaining all of the reservation. And this is what the Court said in the Arctic Coast decision. It saw that this was --          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's -- it -- Imean, in -- in -- I take it in the Alaska case we wereconsidering a transfer that did fall within the mainsentence of (e).MR. MINEAR: Justice Breyer, neither party made that argument. This issue came up in a letter that was written after. The -- the language --33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Were we or weren't we?          MR. MINEAR:  You were not considering that.          JUSTICE BREYER:  We weren't.          MR. MINEAR:  That -- that was -- simply neitherparty suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision.And it doesn't.  It's clear that it doesn't.  It was notland that was specifically used solely for conservation ofwildlife under these three listed statutes.  The ANWRreservation at that time was set apart.  It was BLM land.It was also used for mining and other activities.the CourtLikewise, the other matters --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court did assume -- did assume that.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. MINEAR: It made that assumption with no but it did that with regard to the second issuebriefing,that was presented there.  The issue that people werefighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was thisland properly set apart or not for purposes of theproviso.  And that's where this discussion takes place.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then --          MR. MINEAR:  It's an afterthought that simplyreinforces.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then at best Alaskais a neutral.  Because we didn't think it, we're operating34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 as a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay.2 Now, what's bothering me about the case is just3 what Justice Scalia said, that -- that why I -- if I sell4 you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping5 gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my6 camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation7 of mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has8 nothing to do with mess kits.9 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, but that's -- it's10 clear that what this is -- this is more along the lines if11 someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that12 transfer shall not include the detached garage.1314 that. 151617 next -- 18MR. MINEAR:  In that case --JUSTICE BREYER:  But it doesn't mean that theMR. MINEAR:  Yes, but it was not a part of theJUSTICE BREYER:  Fine, and then it doesn't go in19 house. 202122 providing23 the proviso is to provide clarification.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is an abundance of25 caution?JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.MR. MINEAR:  You know, that's -- it's justclarification, just that one of the purposes of35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MINEAR: In other -- that is exactly right. And we can tell that from --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If it's anabundance of caution, where's the other language thatalmost reserves it so we need the caution?indicatesMR. MINEAR:  That would be section 5.  Itthe general retention for lands of this sort.JUSTICE BREYER:  But 5 is subject to theLands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings youSubmergedback to the reservation has to be explicit. And then -- see, that's --          MR. MINEAR:  Well, Justice Breyer, again, if Ican just complete the point --          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why I was talking aboutYellowstone.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I was looking for somethingthat would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant totransfer.  He comes back and says, well, very often Statesdo control the water.          MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I just need to make apoint.  I think it's very important for you to understandthis point.  First of all, that at page 57 of the ArcticCoast decision, this Court was clearly reading thislanguage, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it2 was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that3 these particular items that are discussed there are not a4 part of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example5 of that is the third thing that's being transferred,6 facilities that are utilized in connection with general7 research activities related to fisheries and wildlife.8 Now, that is not going to be something that's9 specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and10 protection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It11 makes quite clear that our construction is correct. The12 subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are13 here are not things that fit within the main clause. What14 Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why -- why doesn't (m)16 supersede that argument anyway? Let's -- can't we say17 that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause18 of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?19 MR. MINEAR: Then you have to explain what20 happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to21 retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main22 provision. And that is because Congress was making --23 because this Court concluded that Congress was making24 clear that wildlife lands are very important and they25 wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 be transferred. And even a provision that could be2 misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in -- in Arctic3 Coast -- could be misconstrued to contain some of these4 lands, we need to make adequate assurance that -- that the5 courts that read this realize a clear division is being6 made. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Minear, I'm -- I'm not sure8 I agree with you that -- that that language, facilities9 used in connection with general research activities10 relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the11 earlier -- of the earlier grant, namely property used for12 the sole purpose of conservation and protection of13 fisheries and wildlife. Surely one -- one can readily14 regard general research activities relating to fisheries15 or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and16 protecting fisheries and wildlife.17 MR. MINEAR: But we're talking about a facility18 here. So a facility that might conduct some -- some19 research tangentially related to wildlife is not a20 facility that's used for the sole -- specifically used for21 the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a22 clear difference here. These two -- these two sets do not23 overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife24 refuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are25 used for multiple purposes.38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          At the time of statehood, the -- the regulationsin place, the fisheries regulations and wildliferegulations, made clear that permits could be issued forpurposes apart from wildlife conservation.  And thisCourt's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized thatone of the -- the refuges that Alaska cites as beingincluded in the main clause was being used for oil and gaspurposes.  It was not being used solely for the purposes-- specifically used solely for the purposes ofconservation.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Minear, you know, I -- I amjust overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terriblemess of a statute.  I can't figure out what it means.MR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and it seems to methat's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.MR. MINEAR: Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are arguments here, thereare arguments there, but it -- it does not dawn upon methat -- that anything is clear about this at all.          MR. MINEAR:  Well, this -- we believe thestatute has been clear for 50 years.  That's why theseissues have only arisen recently with regard to GlacierBay National Park.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Minear, what do you say 39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 are the practical consequences from the Federal2 Government's perspective of going -- of disagreeing with3 the U.S. position? What harm is done? Can the U.S.4 protect itself in any event under other clauses?5 MR. MINEAR: We agree that the United States has6 the regulatory authority to protect -- to limit vessel7 entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not8 what our concern is.9 Our concern is with the actual use of the10 submerged lands. This is a laboratory. This is a11 laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use12 the submerged lands for that purpose. That includes such13 things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze14 its historic features. We've installed a 5-mile cable15 with a hydrophone on the -- on the submerged lands so we16 can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the -- the17 volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that18 migrate through there.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you do that on -- on dry20 land in some States?21 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, in order to hear22 vehicle traffic --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't your authority under24 the Commerce Clause or under -- under -- over navigable25 waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, we think that -- that Alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use and study. And in fact, I would point out that the park superintendent's affidavit --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are they likely to do that?          MR. MINEAR:  What?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are they likely to do that?  Isthis a real problem?          MR. MINEAR:  There are 900 papers, scientificpapers, that are cited in the affidavit of the parksuperintendent. This is exhibit number 8 on And of those describing the type of research Glacier Bay National Park --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought --          MR. MINEAR:  -- scores and perhapsthose involve submerged lands.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Givensaying -- and I -- you're not accepting thisI -- well, there is language in this act which maintainsin the United States title to the park.          MR. MINEAR:  That is correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, I would havethought when you get title to the park, you mean the park,and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005count IV.we do inhundreds ofwhat you'reI think, and￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425park.MR. MINEAR:  We --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And therefore, if you have apart of the park which is the only part of the park wherepeople look at the park, and it's the only part of thepark that brings them into the park, and it's the onlypart of the park where you do the research, et cetera,that's the park.  Just as if I were to sell my house and Ilist the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchenis an essential part of the house.MR. MINEAR: That's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now -- now, once I made thatargument, he said that's a very clever argument, butreally, there are all kinds of instances where States havereserved submerged land inside national parks and it'sworked fine.MR. MINEAR: But those are instances -- JUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to allthis?          MR. MINEAR:  The instances -- the examplesthey're giving are cases in which we've created thosenational monuments or parks after statehood.  And in thosecases, we cannot acquire those lands because they havealready been transferred to the State at statehood.JUSTICE SCALIA: It hasn't resulted in a -- in a 42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425disaster. That's the point that Justice Breyer is making. MR. MINEAR: But in this case --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has not resulted in adisaster.          MR. MINEAR:  But in this case, it is going toimpede the -- the activities we have there.          And a good example of this is in the amicusbrief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to ourauthority to control fish and wildlife.  The Alaskalegislature has passed a statute in which it refuses toassent to our authority to control fish and wildlifewithin the park.  This gives you some sense of the type ofdifficulties that we're going to encounter.JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. --MR. MINEAR: And our chief concern --JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Minear, may I ask you? Atthe time the statute was passed, was the nationalGovernment conducting these activities?MR. MINEAR: Yes, it was. It was created as a national monument. Now, in terms of what degree of activities, the record is not clear, but we're --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Maybe you were monitoringpassages through to see whether the whales were going tobe interfered with and doing that sort of thing.  Were youtaking core samples?43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MINEAR:  We were definitely studying the bedof the lake, and our -- our briefs below explain.  We havean affidavit from our glaciologist which describes thetype of research that was being done.JUSTICE SOUTER: So in -- in other words, you -- you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the passage, this would have been on the congressional mind, going back to Justice Breyer's --          MR. MINEAR:  It -- it definitely would have.And also I want to point out that when we created the national monument, we also preserved such things as the interglacial forests. These are forests that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go forward over these submerged lands. The glacial forests are in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of it. As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those should remain a part of the park. That was part of the purpose, was to study those --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Should.  Now, you're not -- howfar are you prepared to go?  You can't go more than yourbrief and your facts justify.  Are you prepared to saythat this water is an essential part of the park?          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes?44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. MINEAR: Yes. Certainly --2 JUSTICE BREYER: Have you said that before this3 minute?4 MR. MINEAR: Not only have we said it, but the5 Park Service at statehood said that this is a water park6 when they were describing these lands and saying why they7 should be retained. They told Congress -- the -- the park8 superintendent or the -- the director of the Park Service9 said this is a water park that's mostly -- this is, after10 all, Glacier Bay National Park.11 And in that -- with that respect, I'd like to12 point out this --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they keep the other 8014 percent then?15 MR. MINEAR: Excuse me, Your Honor.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they keep the other 8017 percent?18 MR. MINEAR: Well, the --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I gather only 20 percent of it20 is water.21 MR. MINEAR: It's slightly more than 20 --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: They should have given away the23 rest.24 MR. MINEAR: We haven't given away. We have all25 of these lands. The -- the uplands here are the glaciers45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the2 water. You cannot reach these areas. There are no roads3 in this park except for the park visitors center, and4 beyond that --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then make it a water park. I6 mean, you want to say it's a -- it's a water-accessible7 park, fine.8 MR. MINEAR: Yes. But, Your Honor, the --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: 20 percent of the park is under10 water. Right?11 MR. MINEAR: More than 20 percent. Roughly 25.12 I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is -- within the13 park boundaries is submerged lands.14 But there's another point I'd like to make with15 regard to the establishment of the park. This park was16 created under the Antiquities Act, and under the17 Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to18 create national monuments, but they cannot be19 disestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress20 could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to21 give up the land. It could have disestablished some part22 of it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another23 indication that Congress was intending to retain these24 lands.25Now, I would like to move on to the other two 46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 counts we have here, unless we have further questions2 about -- about Glacier Bay. But I -- I think one thing3 that I do -- one thought I want you -- to leave you with4 with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are5 essential to the park. They are understood to be6 essential at the time that the park was created. And the7 -- the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one8 with regard to this park. Those lands are -- continue to9 be used -- the submerged lands for scientific research10 that is vitally important.11 Now, I'd like to point out that the master also12 correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits13 are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska14 failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test.15 This Court specifically failed to show a continuous16 assertion of -- of sovereignty to exclude vessels that17 have -- that are18 innocent passage19 foreign nations.20 During21 nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel22 based on -- merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska --23 Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we24 unambiguously did so. The only --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Alaska is arguing, as I47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005visiting the park or passing through inor to indicate any acquiescence ofthe past 150-year period, neither Alaska￼1 understand it now, that the -- the exclusion for purposes2 of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a3 matter of international law, which is a point that you4 disagree on. What -- what is your response to their5 response to --6 MR. MINEAR: The answer is in order to establish7 a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a8 vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage.9 Fisheries is not -- engaging in fishing activity under the10 convention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an11 exclusion12 rise to a1314 authority 15based on fisheries can never -- can never give claim of --JUSTICE SOUTER: And what's -- what's your best for that?MR. MINEAR: Well, our best authority is the 16 convention itself. The convention makes clear under17 article 14 that fisheries is -- that fisheries activities18 are not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is19 merely transit through from one point to another.20 Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they21 describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not22 satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland -- the23 historic inland waters test requires.24 And finally, it also didn't satisfy the25 acquiescence test since the British Government protested 48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the seizure of the ship.2 And finally on top of that, this vessel -- we3 don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that4 it was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the5 master was unable to determine whether that -- the ship6 was in -- 78 juridical9 matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine itinside or outside the 3-mile limit.Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the-- juridical bay claim as well.  This is a10 would address on rebuttal.11 The master correctly rejected Alaska's12 extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be13 turned into two large -- large juridical bays. And14 basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland15 on an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of16 the convention. The only way that it can establish a bay17 headland or -- or closing point is by showing that it's on18 the mainland. In order to establish that this is on the19 mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of20 water. And as the master recognized, these bodies of21 water are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case22 of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on23 average 4 and a half miles wide. It's -- simply those24 intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish25 that this is -- is part of the mainland.49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, whichis a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage forinternational navigation.  That too precludes it frombeing ignored and treated as dry land.          The failure of those two assimilations by itselfis sufficient to establish that -- that these -- thatthese juridical bays do not exist.          And even if that were not enough, the masterwent on to say that this would not be a well-markedindentation, that even if you were willing to assimilatethese lands, it's still the case that the bay itself wouldnot be -- the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska hascreated here would not be recognizable to a mariner who ispassing by.          For all those reasons, the juridical bays hereare -- are simply not well founded, and the master wascorrect in rejecting them.So what we see --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Minear, could I go back to Glacier --          MR. MINEAR:  Certainly, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- Park again for a momentand ask why the Government decided to base its claim tothe lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murkyprovision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425set out in the Idaho case?MR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you -- do you not rely on that standard --MR. MINEAR: Quite --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of analysis?MR. MINEAR: Quite honestly we thought thatunder the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required tocreate absolutely new -- no new law.  It had alreadyinterpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e)applied to this case.          We think the Idaho provisions provide anotheropportunity for us to establish it.  It's quite clear thatthe purposes of the -- the lands here, the submergedlands, are so essential to the park that it's simplyinconceivable that Congress would have intended for thoselands to pass out of ownership.However, we relied on --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you -- would you tell usagain why, if you do not prevail on this argument, youstill go back before the -- the Special Master to showcertain facts?          MR. MINEAR:  Well, first of all, Alaska has notmoved for summary judgment.  We moved for summary judgmenton some of our theories.  Other theories would require51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 some factual development. One of the theories that we2 would -- we would go forward with is that these lands are3 occupied under a claim of right, and that's another4 exception under the Submerged Lands Act.5 In addition, we would renew the argument with6 regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an7 area and authorizes the President to set it aside under8 the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be9 disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's10 a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain11 those lands.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, given the absence of a13 summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.14 MR. MINEAR: No. You would not have -- we -- we15 believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not16 think that he foreclosed it.17 But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the18 relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's19 important and worthwhile. We think that this case falls20 squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in21 particular we relied on it primarily because it provides22 an actual textual basis for showing that the -- the United23 States retain those lands. We do not need to go further24 and show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on25 the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 example of why retention is -- is required in this case.2 The master agreed with us. He analyzed the3 Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the -- the4 proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent5 retention clause. There's no other way to understand the6 Arctic Coast decision except on that basis.7 And we think that's the right interpretation,8 and we think if we -- if you focus on what the Court said9 on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement10 that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test11 is an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a12 statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce13 the conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a14 basis for -- for departing from that. And in fact, as I15 hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't16 make any sense, that they're simply -- all of those lands17 that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall18 within the main clause.19 The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple20 purposes. It's -- the two wildlife refuges that they21 point to both the record shows were used for multiple22 purposes. They were not used solely for conservation23 purposes. And in addition, they were -- to the extent24 that those refuges adverted to any lands at all -- any25 statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not --53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 not the 1943 statute.2 Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we3 believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has4 no answer for. One -- one of those refuges, in5 particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes6 within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other7 areas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We8 think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly9 that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that10 this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did11 intend to 1213 Secretary14 stated in15 note 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations16 -- the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was17 aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to18 reserve both land and water.retain these lands.That was the point that -- that this proviso, asChapman himself indicated, and in fact, he-- the excerpt appears in page -- on page 47,19 Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back20 and look at the big picture here. The United States'21 position overall results in a very sensible division of22 submerged lands in this case. We have not contested23 Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands24 here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest.25 Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Government interests are paramount.          First of all, with regard to drawinginternational -- developing international principles toestablish baselines, which creates these bays and -- andpockets, that's a necessary consequence of what ourforeign policy requires.          Secondly, where the United States has clearlyreserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay NationalPark.  This park was set aside for the benefit of theentire Nation.  We think that the Court should adopt themaster's report in full.          Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Minear.          Mr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a halfminutes.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN                ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF          MR. FRANKLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.          To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact,advocating the principles of that case.  It is notsufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservationthat might include submerged lands.  Congress has to takesome action to explicitly ratify that.  That was whathappened in the Idaho case, according to the Court.  Andthe United States has identified one statute and one55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 statute only that it asserts can -- ratifies the bay, and2 that's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain3 language to section (e) -- 6(e) is dispositive in this4 case.5 We are operating here under a clear statement6 rule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption7 is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the8 reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended9 that the submerged lands -- title to submerged lands be10 defeated.11 There was -- the statute says such transfer12 shall not include. There simply was no need for Congress13 to have included -- to have specified that such transfer,14 the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged15 lands when they were not included -- or excuse me -- shall16 not include properties that were not included in the first17 place. That includes Glacier Bay.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you respond to19 the -- to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case20 decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?21 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, my -- my first response is22 even the master, who ruled -- who -- who decided against23 us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and24 indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 6025 and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the proviso. Therefore -- excuse me. The main clause.2 Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held3 that lands that did not fall within the main clause were4 included by the proviso.56 that even7 it is not8 is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule9 cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.It is important, though, to -- to note this,if the statute is ambiguous -- and we think that-- Alaska still prevails here because a -- there10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the argument is that11 it is clear because the reservation without the12 reservation of the waters would be crazy.13 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, it --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- I mean, what's --15 what's the answer?16 MR. FRANKLIN: We dispute that for the following17 reason, Your Honor, that -- that the -- the point of the18 monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the19 glaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the20 submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose.21 But I think their sky-is-falling argument really22 falls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is23 the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba24 diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom.25 There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would 57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- would prevent scientists who want to study this --2 these lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all3 of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they4 have a good reason for doing it. We hope to work5 cooperatively with the Federal Government on this.6 The -- the idea that Alaska is somehow going to7 be less receptive to scientific research here I think8 demeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal9 structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands10 is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones11 principally affected by the activities that go on there.12 We are not planning on -- on preventing scientists from13 scuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the14 time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because15 there -- there really wasn't any scuba diving going on.16 But to -- to move on -- I see my time is up.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Franklin.18 The case is submitted.19 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)21 22 23 24 251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40058Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
