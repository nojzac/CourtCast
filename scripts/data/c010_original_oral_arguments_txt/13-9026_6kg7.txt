United States.      Mr. Carpenter.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER      MR. CARPENTER: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      The basic bank robbery offense underSection 2113(a) requires the robber to use force,intimidation or violence against another person.Section (e)'s forced accompaniment provision is designedfor much more extreme conduct that Congress viewed asroughly on par with murder.  And yet the governmentwould have that provision and its ten­year mandatoryminimum apply any time that a robber forces someone totake a single step with him in the course of a robbery.      That single step rule isn't justified by thetext of the statute, and it isn't necessary to ensurejust punishment for bank robbers.  In this case ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it justified by the text?MR. CARPENTER: Your Honor, it's notAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial4￼1 justified by the text, first ­­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can ­­ I can accompany3 my ­­ my wife to her table when we go to a dinner party,4 and we're ­­ we're seated at different tables. Isn't ­­5 isn't it proper to say I accompany her to the table?6 MR. CARPENTER: Your Honor, our view is not7 that it is technically improper, but that it is ­­ it8 would not be an ordinary and natural usage of the word9 "accompany," for example, to say ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is, I just gave you an11 ordinary and natural use. I accompanied my wife to her12 table.13 MR. CARPENTER: Our view is that it is not14 an ordinary usage to say were you accompanied, for15 example, from this side of the lectern to this side,16 which is the amount of movement the government believes17 is ­­ is covered. Or, for example, to say, will you18 accompany me, Justice Scalia, from your chair down to19 yours.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You ­­ you think there's a21 spatial component to ­­ I mean, what ­­ I don't22 understand why you say it's ­­ it's not normal usage,23 unless you say there is a spatial requirement that24 you ­­ to accompany somebody, you have to walk a longer25 distance, and I ­­ the example I just gave you suggestsAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial15 there16 don't17 1819 know,20 statute. But ­­ but we apply what ­­ what Congress21 thought was not foolish.22 MR. CARPENTER: Well, Justice Scalia, first,23 whether there's ambiguity is determined not by looking24 at the word "accompany" in isolation. But as the Court25 said last year in the Utility Air context ­­ or in thebe ambiguity.  And accompany means accompany.  Isee any spatial component to it.MR. CARPENTER: Well, Your Honor ­­ JUSTICE SCALIA: And the rule here is, yougarbage in, garbage out.  It may be a very foolishAlderson Reporting Company5￼1 otherwise.2 MR. CARPENTER: Your Honor, our view of3 the ­­ in the ordinary usage it is used in the sense of4 going to a destination, to the theater, to the ballpark.5 But even if there is some question ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: To my wife's table.7 MR. CARPENTER: Well, even if there is some8 question about whether the usage of just a movement of a9 few feet is an ordinary usage, where there are multiple,10 possible meanings of a term, we look to the statutory11 context and the statutory structure ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm asking you whether13 there are multiple possible ­­ listen, I'm very big on14 the rule of lenity, but the condition for it is thatOfficial1 Utility Air case, the words of the statute are2 interpreted in their context and with a view towards3 their place in the statutory scheme. Here the place4 that the word "accompany" serves in the statutory scheme5 is to set off a set of extreme conduct that Congress6 viewed as roughly on par with murder. Its association7 in Section (e) with the killing offense tells us under8 the Noscitur principle that Congress viewed a forced9 accompaniment as akin to murder.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: 20 steps ­­ 20 steps is11 horrible enough for Congress to have believed it's12 enough of an accompaniment? What? Half a mile? What?13 MR. CARPENTER: Well, we don't14 believe there's going to be a bright­line rule based on15 the number of steps or the number of feet.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't insist on a17 bright­line rule. I insist on some rule. What ­­18 what is your ­­ what is your rule? Does it have to be19 outside the building? Does ­­ does the bank robber have20 to take the person as a hostage outside the building?21 MR. CARPENTER: We think the best way22 effectuate the structure of the scheme is to have23 finding of substantiality. And we would instruct24 or a fact­finder in our Rule 29 motion, first and25 foremost, to say that a substantial movement istoaa juryAlderson Reporting Company6￼Official7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something more than a de minimus or a trivial movement.If the district court or this Court wants to go furtherthan that, we believe that the court ­­ the jury ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a ­­ that's a very different rule than in your brief.

Again, looking at first the Noscitur ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's say we disagree. Where would you find "de minimis"?MR. CARPENTER: If you disagree with that, then I think you would look ­­ you could just apply a de minimis principle and say that movement of just a few feet within a person's own home is ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How much is a few feet?MR. CARPENTER: Well, in this case, it's about 4 to 9 feet, which is approximately from where you're sitting, Justice Sotomayor, to where you're sitting, Justice Scalia. That is approximately ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the record was different. I thought the record was 14 to 20?MR. CARPENTER: It's not. The government in its brief asserts that it is 20 feet from the front doorAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 of the house ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 was right. Go ahead.4 MR. CARPENTER:5 government asserts that it was 20 feet from the front6 door all the way back to the room. But, first, the7 record also suggests that she was ­­ met Mr. ­­8 Mr. Whitfield while she was coming out of the hallway.9 So the movement wasn't the 20 feet from the front door.10 It was from the threshold of the hallway into the11 computer room.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it contextual?13 In other words, is 20 feet in her home different from14 20 feet in the bank?15 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. Well, I think 20 feet16 all within a single building is almost never going to17 qualify because that cannot be so significantly18 different from the conduct that is covered by an19 ordinary (a) offense that Congress would have viewed it20 as extreme enough to justify a ten­year mandatory21 minimum penalty.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it seems ­­ the23 reason I ask is that it ­­ it strikes me that it makes a24 difference if it's in part of the robbery itself. I25 mean, it seems to me to tell the teller to go to theAlderson Reporting Company    I'm sorry.  8 ­­ no.  IIf you look at the ­­ the8￼Official15 MR. CARPENTER:16 JUSTICE SCALIA:17 MR. CARPENTER:18 view would be satisfied by the hypothetical ­­ or by19 the ­­ not a hypothetical ­­ by an actual case that we20 see in Wilson, for example, which is cited in the21 government's brief where the bank robber goes to a bank22 employee's home, forces them to come with him from their23 home to the bank to facilitate the robbery. That's24 absolutely an accompaniment in the commission of the25 offense. I don't think anything in the statute suggestsAlderson Reporting CompanyI ­­ I believe ­­ The answer is yes, right?Well, that language in our9￼1 vault or something. That's what happens in a bank2 robbery. If on the other hand, the ­­ the defendant3 takes the teller from the bank to the car and then, you4 know, they ­­ they block the car, that strikes me as5 something different even though the distance might be6 the same.7 MR. CARPENTER: Well, you're right and we8 agree with you on the ­­ that it is a contextual9 inquiry. So taking the ­­ the person out of the bank10 and into the car is very likely going to qualify.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the statute12 says "both in the course of or in fleeing from." So it13 obviously envisions an accompaniment in the course of14 the bank robbery, doesn't it?Official101 that there must be some category of accompaniment within2 the walls of the bank only.3 JUSTICE ALITO: If the test is ­­ if the4 test is that there must be something that's substantial,5 how would you instruct the jury?6 MR. CARPENTER: We would instruct the jury7 first to say it must be more than de minimus or trivial8 movement. You could go further than that and ask the9 jury to consider factors such as the amount of distance10 that was covered, whether the person was moved into or11 out of a bank or another building and whether they were12 ultimately transported to a different place or location13 than where they were found.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: But your first ­­ when you15 just said it's not de minimis, is that your primary16 argument? You just want a non­de minimis rule?17 MR. CARPENTER: We believe that resolves18 this case. Yes. We think that ­­ as we use19 "substantial" in the briefs, it is the flip side of de20 minimis. So we think that de minimis is what happened21 here. Movement with ­­ inside a person's own home only22 for a few feet is de minimis. We think the way to23 effectuate that ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: The woman died from a heart25 attack, didn't she? That wasn't de minimis.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialMR.

CARPENTER: Well, we don't know the17 latter aspect of that in that no one ­­ including the18 government under the current iteration of the U.S.19 Attorneys' Manual before this case ­­ has been looking20 at the question of whether a person was moved a single21 step ­­ again, from this side of the lectern to that,22 from this side of the counter to that ­­ in the course23 of the bank robbery. But we know if the ­­ if this24 Court ­­25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This case ­­ this case￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425didn't involve a single step.  But you say whatever itwas, nine feet, it's de minimis.  If you are right aboutthat, then this charge never should have gone to thejury because is ­­ is the jury supposed to say what isde minimis or is the judge supposed to say that?MR. CARPENTER: Well, the judge will always address that in the first instance under a Rule 29 motion. But, Justice Ginsburg, you are absolutely correct. Our view is that this should not have went to the jury on the forced accompaniment count.      But I would return to Justice Scalia'squestion ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, you ­­ you say there is ­­ there is no proper instruction to a jury that would allow this case to go to the jury?MR. CARPENTER: That is correct. We do not ­­JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't de minimis. That's ­­ I mean, don't you accompany a person as well when you stay with them in the room, and did he?MR. CARPENTER: Well, the ­­ the government even agrees with us here that this isn't a confinement statute, and that goes back to the ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. So ­­ so a person ­­ does it make no difference that they ­­ they take theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial141 teller or they take the woman, you walk ten feet down to2 a room, he says, sit there, and he stays with her to3 make certain that she won't pop her head up so someone4 can see? I think that's probably what happened here.5 All right. If that's what happened here, the6 accompaniment was not just walking, it was also staying7 and walking back perhaps.8 MR. CARPENTER: The problem, Justice Breyer,9 is that that converts this into a confinement provision,10 and Congress pointedly did not write a confinement11 provision. We know first that accompany, by its12 dictionary definition that the government agrees with,13 means to go with, not to stay with.14 JUSTICE BREYER: That’s a very peculiar15 statute. You kidnap a victim as a hostage. You walk16 them two feet into the car. You quickly disguise the17 car and have them lie on the floor, and ­­ and that18 isn't covered by the statute. Or you have outside, I19 don't know, there is a closet, you go, you walk them in,20 and push them in the closet, that is not covered. It is21 covered if you ­­ if you go 30 feet down the corridor22 with somebody else. I can't ­­ I don't understand,23 then, how this statute ­­24 MR. CARPENTER: I will agree with you that25 Congress could have written a much more precise statute￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial15￼1 here, but we think that it ­­ given the penalty2 structure and the increased ten­year mandatory minimum3 that would apply here in so many bank robbery cases ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure5 what ­­ if you were going to draft the statute to reach6 some of this conduct where people are forced to7 accompany the robber, how would you have done it?8 MR. CARPENTER: I think if Congress wanted9 to adopt the government's interpretation of this10 statute, it should have said forces someone to accompany11 him for any distance whatsoever. Because that modifies12 the word accompany which, in our view, in its ordinary13 usage implies something more than the movement of a single14 step.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In an ordinary use it16 doesn't. Justice Scalia gave one example. Suppose I17 were to say, the nurse accompanied a patient as she18 walked around the Intensive Care Unit. That's an19 ordinary use of the ­­ of "accompanied."20 MR. CARPENTER: Well, again, we don't21 disagree that it's a permissible usage. We ­­ for the22 reasons set out in the brief ­­ don't think that it is23 ordinary usage, and we certainly don't think it is24 ordinary in the way that Congress used it.25 Again, if you look at the usages of the wordAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial161 "accompany" in the code in 1934, Congress never used it2 to cover this type of short distance movement. It's3 also consistent with this Court's usages in the 1930s4 which they ­­ virtually all of them in the 1930s5 referred to long distance movements. And we think that6 is consistent with the structure of the statute ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because that was evident8 from the rest of the statute, right?9 MR. CARPENTER: And I think it's ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, all the statutes11 you cite, they make it clear that ­­ that you are12 talking about accompanying over a long distance,13 kidnapping or whatever else. But here there's no such14 indication, and presumably where ­­ where you have an15 indication in some statutes, you do not have it here, it16 presumably does not apply here.17 MR. CARPENTER: Well, Justice Scalia, I18 disagree with you that we don't have the other19 indications in this statute, and I would start with the20 noscitur principle under Section (e). Congress put21 forced accompaniment in Section (e) because it viewed it22 as akin in terms of the defendant's culpability to23 murder. It made it more serious than Section (d). We24 know from Section (d) that Congress viewed ­­ endangering25 a person's life with a gun or knife as only a minor￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial171 aggravating factor that didn't warrant any mandatory2 minimum at all.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It ­­ it didn't ­­ it4 didn't make it comparable to murder because the5 provision itself says that the ­­ the accompaniment6 shall be ­­ a person accompanied shall be in prison not7 less than 10 years or if death results, shall be8 punished by death or life in prison. So it's ­­ you are9 talking 10 years.10 MR. CARPENTER: Well, the death results11 language was added in 1994 as a conforming amendment to12 bring the statute in line with this Court's13 jurisprudence. If you look at our brief at pages 25 and14 26, we have the original text of the statute. Under the15 original version passed in 1994 ­­ or 1934, forced16 accompaniment and killing carried the exact same17 statutory penalty. Both required a mandatory minimum of18 10 years. Both required or made it ineligible for the19 death penalty.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which ­­ which statute was21 your client prosecuted under, the old one or the current22 one?23 MR. CARPENTER: Well, certainly under the24 current one.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, well ­­￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial21 JUSTICE GINSBURG:22 to stop you for a minute.23 the killing was one thing.24 there ­­ didn't the judge say you didn't ask for ­­ what25 was it ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyBut the ­­ the context is    I'm sorry, I would likeBecause I thought that the ­­But it ­­ it wasn't ­­18￼1 MR. CARPENTER:2 still the same in ­­ in the relationship with the3 killing offense.4 And I would go back to your earlier5 question, Justice Scalia. This statute, through the6 killing offense, gives the government the tools it needs7 to hold Mr. Whitfield directly responsible for the fact8 that Mrs. Parnell died. Mr. Whitfield was indicted for9 a killing offense. Over our objection, the District10 Court interpreted that provision as a felony murder11 provision that did not require any intent ­­ intent12 above and beyond the intent necessary for the bank13 robbery itself. And based on the evidence, the jury14 rejected that count and held him not responsible for her15 death.16 It makes little sense to stretch the meaning17 of a forced accompaniment so broadly that it allows the18 government to hold him indirectly responsible for her19 death when the jury, who we rely on to make these kinds20 of determinations in our system ­­1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

CARPENTER: But that is a separate offense. As interpreted by the Fourth Circuit, there are three offenses under Section (e), killing, forced accompaniment, and the third is forced accompaniment resulting in death. The third is the one that wasn't charged and was thrown out. Even under it, we still have the antecedent question of whether there was a forced accompaniment in the first place.But he was properly indicted on the killingoffense. It was interpreted by the District Court as a felony murder provision. And based on the evidence, the jury held that Mr. Whitfield was not responsible for killing Mrs. Parnell.Alderson Reporting Company19￼Official                          20If the test is more than de￼1 JUSTICE ALITO:2 minimis, what does the judge tell the jury if the jury3 says we don't understand what de minimis means?4 MR.

CARPENTER: Well, in our view, this is11 the easy case in that it's only a few feet and it's12 entirely within a person's own home. The ­­ we think13 the way to effectuate that is through a substantiality14 finding which juries make all the time in other ­­ under15 other criminal statutes.16 JUSTICE BREYER: You want to know what, I17 mean, that's exactly the same question. Look,18 substantially ­­ you tell the jury substantial, they19 have no idea in this context. I mean, I wouldn't. I20 would have thought yeah, moving a person ­­ I don't see21 what it has to do with her home or somebody else's home.22 I don't see what that has to do with it. And a few feet23 sounds, yeah, it sounds substantial to me. I know24 nothing about it, you see.25 So is there anything else you want to say inAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial211 response to what Justice Alito said? Because that ­­2 think of my problem. It's not your client that is the3 problem, but it's not the main problem. The main4 problem is to write a standard so people can understand5 it. And what do you want the words of that standard to6 say?￼78 back to the jury instruction that I set out earlier. We9 believe the jury could be charged in determining whether10 the movement is substantial or whether the movement is11 more than de minimis. You could consider the amount of12 distance that was traveled, whether the person was taken13 into or out of the home or another building and whether14 they were ultimately transported to a different place or15 different location ­­16 JUSTICE ALITO: The problem is we don't ­­17 the jury would not know and the court would not know18 what you are looking at, what ultimately you're19 concerned about. You have a number of factors. But I20 assume the point of this statute is to impose a severe21 penalty in cases in which Congress thought there would22 be great emotional distress for the person who is forced23 to accompany that person.24 Now, that could depend on lots of things,25 not just the distance traveled. So to ­­ applying aMR. CARPENTER: Justice Breyer, I would goAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial221 purely spatial test to that just doesn't make any sense.2 You can't say is it substantial in relation to the thing3 that this statute is getting at. That is what I have a4 problem with.5 MR. CARPENTER: Well I think in part you are6 over reading what Congress was trying to do here by7 suggesting that if the person was put in particular fear8 or danger or trauma9 That’s – That’s not10 know ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO:12 Why a heavier penalty for a case where there is13 accompaniment it it's not that there is greater ­­14 across the whole category, greater likelihood of trauma15 to the person who is involved?16 MR. CARPENTER: We know that Congress viewed17 the forced accompaniment provision as similar to18 kidnapping, which under the Federal law at the time19 required transportation entirely out of State and under20 common law required transportation out of the country.21 Under even the common definition of kidnapping at page22 30 of our brief required more than a confinement or a23 false imprisonment.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do I know – How do I25 know ­ Congress considered it equivalent to kidnapping?￼that that would justify any charge. what he was looking at. Because weAlderson Reporting CompanyWhat is the reason for this?Official1 How do I know that?2 MR. CARPENTER:3 do consider the legislative4 JUSTICE SCALIA:5 MR. CARPENTER:6 ­­ I think, Justice Scalia,7 context, and particularly from the association that8 Congress made in Section (e) between forced9 accompaniment and killing. It made both of those crimes10 eligible for the death penalty at the discretion of the11 jury. And if you look at the broader code at that time,12 there were only a handful of offenses that carried the13 potential for the death penalty. Among them were murder14 and kidnapping.15 So I think that is one very good reason why16 we know that Congress would have been thinking of17 accompaniment as something akin to kidnapping, which it18 had in other19 JUSTICE BREYER: To do that you had to crossprovisions of the code ­­20 State lines.21 State lines,22 State lines.23 MR. CARPENTER: No, absolutely not, Justice24 Breyer. We're not suggesting that Congress intended to25 incorporate the elements of Federal kidnapping here. Well, for those of you whohistory, there are ­­ No, I don't know it at all.So you may not know this butyou do know it from the  The kidnapping statute, you had to crossand you don't even argue you have to crossAlderson Reporting Company23￼Official1 But what we are saying ­­ to go back to the question2 about what we're trying to distinguish here, we believe3 that forced accompaniment and the instruction that we've4 suggested for the jury allows the jury to distinguish5 cases of confinement on the one hand ­­ where the6 movement is incidental to a confinement, you are keeping7 a person in their home, you are keeping the person in8 the bank ­­ it distinguishes those from cases that we9 would in a nontechnical sense think of as a kidnapping10 or an abduction where you are taking someone from the11 bank with you on the getaway, which was the John12 Dillinger scenario we discussed in the briefs, or the13 opposite scenario that I talked about from the Wilson case14 a few minutes ago, where you take the bank employee from15 their home to the bank. That kind of situation is, we16 believe, the heart of what Congress was trying to get17 to.1819 it's20 this21 right? It thinks about a particular case, it has an22 idea in its mind of the sort of conduct that they mean,23 which is this John Dillinger example, but then when it24 gets down to drafting the words it writes words that are25 broader than that, that include things that are not inJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, you might be right thatthe heart of what Congress was trying to get at, buthappens all the time when Congress writes statutes,Alderson Reporting Company24￼Official25￼1 the front of their minds, like this one.2 MR. CARPENTER: Well, I think when you put3 the words they use in the context in which they use4 them, it limits it to that kind of scenario. And even5 the government has never thought that these kinds of ­­6 a few steps of movement inside the bank qualify as a7 forced accompaniment. I would point to the cases cited8 in our reply brief at pages 12 and 13, all of which were9 charged under (a) or (d) and all of which clearly10 involve movement that would easily satisfy the11 government's single­step rule here. Yet in each of12 those cases, based on the guidelines, based on the 3553A13 factors, the district courts imposed sentences well14 below the 10­year mandatory minimum that would apply15 under a Section (e) charge.16 We know that if the Court here blesses the17 single­step rule that the government is now advocating,18 which has never been present in the United States19 Attorneys' Manual before, the default principle under20 the Justice Department's charging guidelines will be to21 include a Section (e) count in every bank robbery where22 the prosecutor can allege and prove a single step of23 movement that occurred in the course of the robbery.24 That surely cannot be what Congress intended in the25 structure of this statute where it designated SectionAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial261 (e) as an offense that was so much more serious and so2 much more extreme ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here it wasn't a4 single step. And it seems from what happened that this5 case presents the very danger that (e) wants to guard6 against. That is, the woman was terrified and she had a7 heart attack.8 MR. CARPENTER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I9 disagree that ­­ and the government actually agrees with10 us at page 40 of their brief ­­ with the notion that11 dangerousness by itself can convert something into an12 accompaniment that’s not. We believe first that in13 Section (a) Congress required as an element of a basic14 offense force, intimidation, or violence. What that15 tells us is that in every bank robbery, there is going16 to be danger presented to everyone present. And under17 Section (d), Congress used danger as the jumping off18 point for an aggravated offense under Section (d). It19 escalated the statutory maximum in cases where the20 robber used a gun or a knife to put someone's life in21 danger. So I think the dangerousness by itself doesn't22 get us to an (e) offense.23 And also ­­ so one more thing before I24 reserve my time, which is that reversing this conviction25 and rejecting the government's single­step rule is in no￼Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425                                                       27way going to allow Mr. Whitfield to walk away from thisunpunished. Even under our view, his sentence would be 12 to 13 years, which is approximately four times the amount that a bank robber receives ­­ that a first­time offender like Mr. Whitfield receives for a bank robbery offense. That factors in his post­robbery conduct during his flight and gives him adequate punishment for that. So the (e) charge is unnecessary to ensure that he receives the punishment he needs.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Carpenter.     Mr. Fletcher.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHERON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:     Section 2113(e) prescribes greaterpunishment for a bank robber who forces anotherperson to accompany him in committing the robbery or inattempting to avoid arrest.When Petitioner invaded the Parnell home andforced Mrs. Parnell to go with him to a different room where they could not be seen by the police, he violated that statute because the forced movement fell squarely within the ordinary meaning of the word "accompany." InOfficialAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial281 everyday speech it is both proper and common to say that2 one person accompanied someone else from one room3 of the house to another, and Congress chose to use that4 broad non­technical term in framing Section 2113(e). It5 didn't include any qualifying language requiring that6 the forced accompaniment traverse a particular number of7 feet, cross the threshold of a building or otherwise8 cover a substantial distance.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but all the10 definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with11 somebody as an associate or companion. Yes, it is12 certainly a permissible use and a common use in context13 to say I accompanied someone –you know ­ across the hall.14 But when you are in the context that this present one is15 of bank robbery, the point of associate or companion, I16 think, takes on greater weight. Obviously, an unwilling17 one.18 MR. FLETCHER: I think you are right,19 Mr. Chief Justice. I think the connotation of20 "accompany" focuses very much not only on movement but21 also on movement together. But as you say, it doesn't22 have to be a friendly association or a voluntary23 association.24 I think this Court's opinion in Oregon v.25 Elstad, which involved essentially the reverse of the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial3 get dressed4 living room5 met before.6 of long­standing one or a voluntary one. But it's still7 natural in those circumstances to describe two people8 moving from one room to another with the term9 "accompany."10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, you take11 two bank robberies. One, the robber comes in, waves a12 gun, pistol whips five people, grabs the money and13 leaves. Okay? In another the bank robber comes in,14 just gets the bag of money, says, you walk over here 215 feet with me, so he can get the bag of money and leaves.16 The first one you could get probation. I mean, you're17 not going to, but there's no minimum sentence. And18 the second one you get at least 10 years. That doesn't19 make any sense.20 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think it does make21 sense because I think Congress understood, and I think22 in practice we would see that the first bank robber in23 your first hypothetical is not going to get probation.24 He is going to get a very, very substantial sentence.25 And we know that Congress contemplated ­­and accompany them, this Court wrote, to the to answer questions. I assume they hadn'tI assume that the association wasn't a sortAlderson Reporting Company29￼1 movement in this case ­­ the police encountered a2 suspect in the bedroom in his house and directed him to6 they7 more89 goodsaid, forcing someone to accompany you is so much serious that you get at least 10 years.MR. FLETCHER: And I think that they had reason to do that, but I also just want toOfficial301 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they didn't care2 exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the3 sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a4 higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year5 because of extenuating circumstances, whatever. But,￼10 highlight that the 10­year mandatory minimum that they11 set for the forced accompaniment offense is right in the12 middle of the range for a completely unaggravated,13 unarmed bank robbery in violation of Section 2113.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Range where?15 MR. FLETCHER: Of the statutory range of16 zero ­­ probation to 20 years. The statutory maximum is17 20 years and Congress set the limit for a nonaggravated18 bank robbery. For an armed bank robbery under 2113(d),19 the statutory maximum is 25 years.20 And so when Congress established a mandatory21 minimum penalty for Section 2113(e) at 10 years,22 absolutely it did that because it regarded 2113(e)23 violations as culpable conduct that merited enhanced24 punishment a deterrence. But it also made clear that it25 understood that there were going to be unaggravated bankAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 robberies and armed bank robberies that warranted2 greater punishment than forced accompaniments and it3 left room for sentencing judges and now, with the4 guidelines, for sentences to be framed in a way that5 took account of the type of aggravating circumstances6 like pistol whipping the victim and threats and things7 of the nature that you described that don't trigger a8 statutory enhancement but that obviously sentencing9 judges would consider.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think there's ­­11 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem ­­ the problem12 is there is a set of cases where you can think it's13 serious and a set of cases where you just think it14 isn't. The bank robbery ­­ there are more in the bank15 are the ones that concern me that it isn't.16 robbers are in the bank, there are a couple17 customers walk in and one of them says will18 walk over here with me for a second. Okay? They walk19 two feet to get him out of the way. That doesn't sound20 as if that is a lot worse than pistol whipping somebody.21 And you can multiply those cases.22 And what is worrying me about it is, since23 it's a mandatory minimum, the prosecutors have a choice24 about whether to ­­ to indict or not on that ground, and25 a person who is coming in and who is represented and ­­Alderson Reporting Company  The bankof otheryou please31￼Official321 what is his choice? You know, you either plead guilty2 or I put this in, too, because you moved one of the3 customers 10 feet.4 Now, that's ­­ that's the ­­ it's the ­­5 that's the nature of the mandatory minimum which is6 disturbing and calls, I think, for some kind of lenity7 when there is openness of interpretation. But on the8 other hand it's very hard for me to distinguish how to9 separate the cases that seem comparatively trivial10 taking place within the bank from the ones where you11 really are injecting fear, special fear, into the mind12 of the person who is told to accompany you, and that13 could take place even if it's like one foot, because14 he's been singled out.15 Okay. Is there any way to do it? Is there16 any way that you could reassure me that in these lesser17 cases this will not be used as an instrument towards a18 guilty plea or an instrument where these minor things19 that he's been talking about nonstop, your brother over20 here, that they'll certainly turn out to be charged21 routinely?22 MR. FLETCHER: Yes, absolutely. I think ­­23 I would like to say a number of things. I think the24 first one goes to the charging question that you asked25 and that my friend referred to. He pointed to the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial331 cases, the four cases that he cites at pages 12 and 132 of his reply brief as examples that would fall under our3 definition of forced accompaniment but that weren't4 charged as such in this case. But I think ­­ or in5 those particular cases.￼67 that8 that9 Seventh Circuit and one was in the Eleventh Circuit andI think what is important to highlight aboutis that three of the four cases arose in circuits have already adopted our rule. One was in the10 one was in the Ninth Circuit, and the Seventh and11 Eleventh Circuits have specifically said that movement12 within a bank, our rule here, you don't have to move13 anyone a particular distance, you don't have to move14 them out of the building. And so the fact that they15 weren't charged in that case reflects an exercise of the16 government's charging discretion, not the fact that the17 rule that we're asking you to adopt today had been18 blessed by those circuits.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's what you are20 going to lead it to, Mr. Fletcher, it's just going to be21 prosecutorial good22 case that's, like,23 feet.24 MR. FLETCHER:25 it and I do think it's important to highlight thatjudgment that's going to separate thecould you come with me a couple ofAlderson Reporting CompanyWell, I think that is part ofOfficial341 the ­­ the charging guidance that my friend points to2 does permit the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to3 determine individual cases.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. I guess I'm asking5 you is there anything else. Would you ­­ you think that6 there should not be a de minimis exception at all.7 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I guess I don't8 understand my friend to be really asking for a de9 minimis exception, but let me ­­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm asking about a de11 minimis exception.12 MR. FLETCHER: Well, the reason why I don't13 think de minimis, although we could talk about very￼14 short movements and15 talk about, I don't16 should be excluded.17my friend likes to ­­ and we canthink that de minimis movementsI don't think it's reasonable to ­­ JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even the one step?1819 step.20 reasonable to exclude those is that this statute only21 applies to forced movements, and it's that element of22 force that I think my friend likes to ignore and focus23 just on the step or two steps. But every time a robber24 violates the statute, he does it because he's forced25 someone ­­MR. FLETCHER: Yes, Your Honor, even the one And the ­­ the reason why I don't think it'sAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficialJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I'm walkinga bank robbery where they have about ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Step over there or I'll your head off is what he says.MR. FLETCHER: Yes, and I imagine a10 blow 1112 request ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER: My ­­ my example was meant14 to encompass a polite, but armed, bank robber.15 (Laughter.)16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is the17 idea of someone whose bank is being robbed not being18 forcibly compelled to accompany someone is fanciful, and19 all you have to do, again ­­ I guess it's repeating the20 question ­­ is you got two feet and the prosecutor is21 armed with another 10 years automatically in his pocket,22 and then you use that to extort a plea bargain of, you23 know, six years, somebody who might otherwise wanted to24 go to trial.25 MR. FLETCHER: Well, we know that CongressAlderson Reporting CompanyYou know, I thought that35￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 was the case, which is why I didn't understand Justice3 Breyer's question where he said the amiable bank robber4 says, would you please step – what do you say?5 Would you6 please step over here?78 into 9Official361 drafted the statute as a mandatory minimum provision.2 We know that it used broad language that encompasses3 even very, very short movements. And I think the4 discussion that ­­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that begs the6 question, I think.7 MR. FLETCHER: But, well, I was going to try8 to get to the answer, which is that the reason why9 Congress did that and I think the discussion today10 highlights is because, number one, it's very, very hard11 to separate out the cases that drive at the heartland of12 what Congress was concerned about, the human shield and13 the hostages situations, with any sort of rule based on14 distance.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your U.S.16 attorney's manual does just that. It says you prosecute17 these when anyone forcibly abducts another during the18 commission of any offense. That seems to me to be19 trying to take out those walked two feet. That's not a20 forcible abduction.21 MR. FLETCHER: I ­­ I'm not sure that is22 correct, Mr. Chief Justice. The U.S. attorney's manual23 does refer to the Section 2113(e) offense in a24 one­sentence description as covering forcible abduction.25 But I don't think ­­ it's perfectly sensible and courts￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial371 have used the word abduction to describe moving someone2 from one place in a bank to another one.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so you think4 when the manual says forcibly abducts, it means the5 two­foot situation.6 MR. FLETCHER: Potentially, yes. The7 guidelines ­­ the sentencing guidelines use the word8 abduction, for instance, Mr. Chief Justice ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: What about that ­­ why don't10 we say that? Say that what this statute covers is11 forcible abduction, and there we are. That's not12 perfect. But it's – it at least my polite ­­ armed bank13 robber who asks the person to move over hasn't abducted14 him and in many of these de minimis cases there won't be15 an abduction. Why not just pick up those words and say16 indeed, the government uses that when it explains it.17 MR. FLETCHER: Well, Congress used very,18 very different language. Congress didn't incorporate19 the common law of kidnapping. It didn't refer to an20 abduction. It used the word "accompanying" which has an21 everyday meaning that encompasses short movements.22 But also, I think ­­ I understand the23 impetus that some of your questions suggest that24 abduction carries up or connotes long movements, but25 that's not the way that it's used in the U.S. attorney's￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial38￼1 manual and it's not the way that it's used in the2 provision of the guidelines which provides an3 enhancement for a bank robbery or for any robbery that4 involves the abduction of a victim.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the manual is6 read ­­ forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to7 move two feet. That's an abduction?8 MR. FLETCHER: Yes. They don't view it as9 limiting the charges under Section 2113(e) to require10 movement of any particular distance.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so the manual12 which ­­ the other provision in the manual which is that13 you should charge as large an offense as possible means14 that in the case where somebody is forced to move two15 feet, you charge the ­­ that as a forcible abduction.16 MR. FLETCHER: No, that is not correct and17 in part that is because the manual doesn't say you18 always charge the most serious offense. It says you19 charge the most serious offense that's consistent with20 the nature of the conduct at issue and that that21 permits, and in fact requires, an individualized22 assessment of the defendant's conduct.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is two feet24 consistent with the conduct at issue?25 MR. FLETCHER: Well, I think ­­ I thinkAlderson Reporting Company19 what 2021 this22 yes?232425 the same thing if it were still a capital offense?Official391 there is a reason and I ­­ I do think there's a reason2 why Congress covered even very short movements, and3 that's in part because every time a robber forces4 someone to go with him he exposes that person to a great5 degree of trauma, to physical danger, and I think also6 Congress reasonably decided not to try to write in a7 limitation to use a term that includes movements as8 short as a few feet because it's so difficult to draw a9 line. It's difficult to draw an administrable line at10 all. And any of the lines that have been offered to you11 by my friend, by the amicus briefs, by the lower courts12 that have tried to cabin this statute by departing from13 its text, all of them would exclude cases that would14 give rise to exactly the sorts of dangers that Congress15 was concerned about, which are robbers using victims as16 human shields, or robbers holding the gun to the head of17 the victim and dragging them around the bank during the18 offense. I think all of those are at the heartland of￼Congress was concerned about.JUSTICE KAGAN: When Congress first drafted accompanying language, this was a capital offense,MR. FLETCHER: Potentially, yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I mean, would you sayAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficialAlderson Reporting CompanyWe would.  We think the ­­   Of course that wasThe ­­ imposing the deathThat's correct.  The Court  For even ­­ even40￼1 MR. FLETCHER:2 the offense had the same meaning then and now. And I3 think part of the reason why we'd say that is, first and4 foremost, that the statutory language we think5 "accompanying" has a plain meaning that includes those6 sorts of movements.7 But also I think it ­­ it's true, my friend8 likes to point out that it was potentially death9 eligible, but the sentencing range in the 1934 statute10 was a minimum of 10 years to a death sentence if the11 verdict of the jury shall so recommend.12 The murderer statute at ­­ in 1934 in13 contrast said that if you murder someone it's a14 mandatory death penalty or life imprisonment. I15 think ­­16 JUSTICE SCALIA:17 unconstitutional, right?18 penalty for this.19 MR. FLETCHER:20 later held ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 kidnapping, you know, taking the person away when you're23 fleeing. It was unconstitutional to apply the death24 penalty, so we really don't ­­ don't have to take that25 into account, I suppose.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     MR.

FLETCHER: And I think Congress probably understood that a jury would be very unlikely, in fact, almost certain not to recommend the death penalty in a case like that.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, no.

Meaning why don't we leave it to the jury to decide when a movement is inconsequential, it’s trivial? We're worried about telling them what that ­­ what that is, but we use the word de minimis all the time, and all we tell juries is you don't have to find this if the movement was really trivial and inconsequential.MR.

FLETCHER: You're right. De minimis ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know why that can't be true in the criminal area either.MR. FLETCHER: De minimis is a general principle of law. I, like you, have not found a caseOfficialAlderson Reporting CompanyWhat's wrong with de42￼Official431 where this Court has applied it in the criminal context.2 I think in part that's because it's ultimately about3 deciding what Congress intended to prescribe.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if we were going to5 apply it I guess what we would apply is was there6 significant fear or trauma induced? I mean, that's ­­7 that's what the statute's about. Threatening people,8 causing them such excitement that they may have a heart9 attack, as happened here. I don't know that the10 distance is what is de minimis. It's how much you put11 the person in fear, I suppose.12 MR. FLETCHER: I do think that that's right13 and I think that points up that crafting any sort of a14 de minimis or substantiality requirement that tried to15 get at the concerns that Congress had in passing the16 statute would be extremely hard to do. And I think the17 jury that asks, as Justice Alito suggested, what do you18 mean by de minimis? How are we supposed to determine19 whether or not a movement is de minimis? It would be20 very, very difficult to give that jury a reasonable ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but you could say de22 minimis did because of the language that you point to,23 accompaniment. That's what I criticized you earlier as24 just being too vague. But where movements are small,25 this is ­­ where movements are small ­­ in considering￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialI would say though that even if you agree with that,that's notits terms.     And Ito suggesta reason to read it other than according tothink, Justice Breyer, my friend likes           that if you go our way on this you really aregoing to open up this discretion for prosecutors tocharge the 2113(e) offense in a vast number of cases.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's true.MR. FLETCHER: Respectfully, though, I don't think he's been able to substantiate that with any kind of evidence. As we pointed out ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, 95 or ­­ over90 percent of all the criminal charges in the countryAlderson Reporting Company44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425de minimis you can consider that where movements are small, the absence or presence of the kind of fear that is connoted by the word abduction, which ­­ that's a little tough. But I see your point there.     But the alternative is just this sort ofvast discretion in bank robbery cases where ­­ wherethere has been nothing more like an inch or it reallyhad nothing to do with the abduction concern and thedistances were miniscule.JUSTICE SCALIA:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR.

FLETCHER:4 JUSTICE BREYER:5 lots of criticisms of people pleading guilty because6 they are afraid that in the absence of the guilty plea7 the sentence will go way up. I don't know how true that8 is, I haven't seen the studies, but I'm certainly9 familiar with literature that says that.10 MR. FLETCHER: I understand the concern but11 it arises only to the extent that forced accompaniments12 of short distances are common in bank robberies.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. That is14 exactly where the prosecutor needs another ace in his15 hand. In other words, if he's waving a gun, if he's16 assaulting the people, if he's shooting them, fine, he's17 got enough leverage. But when he hasn't done any of18 that and all he's done is asked the teller or whoever to19 accompany him for ­­ of forced, I'm sorry, the teller to20 accompany him for a few feet, that's where the21 prosecutor says I, you know, it's a good thing I've got22 these 10 years or otherwise he might go to trial.23 MR.

When9 you have these cases, he says I'm going to charge you10 with a 10­year minimum, and the guy says, my gosh, I11 can't risk that, I'm going to plead guilty to 6 years or￼I don't see how that pattern could show up in of statistics.FLETCHER: Well, for one thing, I mean,17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would not be a18 reported case because he would have pled guilty.19 MR. FLETCHER: But even guilty pleas can20 give rise to reported cases that describe the facts of21 the offense if there's an appeal relating to sentencing,22 as there often is. And we just don't see the government23 bringing this charge in part because most bank robberies24 do not involve forced movement. The classic bank25 robbery ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial3 just4 have56 include waivers of appeal rights. So I'm ­­ I7 understand the point that many guilty pleas wouldn't8 show up in reported cases, but I think we also provide9 statistics about the number of ­­ guilty pleas thatlimited to the State systems or not ­­ don't theyto waive their rights to appeal?MR. FLETCHER: In some cases guilty pleas do10 would still be sentenced according to the sentencing11 guidelines and we provide statistics that say that ­­12 and ­­ and would show up in the FBI's bank crime13 statistics.14 We provide statistics suggesting that15 most ­­ the overwhelming majority of bank robberies are16 limited to the teller area. They don't involve moving17 someone to the vault. The classic bank robbery ­­ we18 cite to the secondary literature as well ­­ involves19 someone walking up to a teller and presenting a demand20 note or making an oral demand. And I think once a21 robber goes beyond that and begins forcibly22 orchestrating the movement of people around the bank,23 that's stuff that ­­ conduct that's typically24 accomplished with a weapon or with physical ­­ direct25 application of physical force to compel people to moveAlderson Reporting Company47￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When they plead2 guilty don't they have to ­­ I don't remember if this isOfficial481 around the bank. And I think Congress correctly made a2 judgment that that's significantly aggravated conduct3 that separates those offenses from the mine­run bank4 robberies.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem is that6 there is some fortuity in this. Some bank robbers will7 tell people, tellers, move to that corner and lay down8 on the floor and they'll just point the gun. There is9 no accompaniment. Some of them may say move, and move￼10 with 1112 that13 time14 being forced to move around the bank with the robber is15 materially worse and materially more dangerous to the16 victims than being ordered to move to the other side of17 the bank by the robber.them. There is ­­MR. FLETCHER: There's ­­ there's no doubt there's some fortuity. That's going to happen any Congress frames a broad rule. But I do think that18 If the robber comes into the bank and pulls19 a gun, everyone in the gun is going to be ­­ everyone in20 the bank is going to be frightened. And if he directs21 everyone to go over to one side of the room, that's22 going to be frightening, too. But if he picks out a23 teller and says, You're coming with me and we're going24 to the vault, that teller is going to be the most afraid25 in the bank, the most traumatized. That person's goingAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial491 to be in the greatest danger, at the greatest risk of2 further violence from the robber, and that person is3 going to be in the worst possible place if the police4 respond, if an armed guard responds, or if some sort of5 confrontation breaks out.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I just don't7 see that as a common sense proposition. If you're a8 teller, when are you more scared, when the guy has a gun9 pointed at you and says get the money or when the guy10 does not have a gun so far as you can see and says you11 better come with me over to the vault?12 MR. FLETCHER: So I think potentially in ­­13 in the case with a gun, but a couple of points on that.14 One is the vast majority, as far as I can tell, 2113(e),15 forced accompaniment offenses, almost always involve16 weapons. I think the parties cite, you know, 6 or 817 lower court cases that have involved the ­­ the question18 at issue here. How far do you have to move in order to19 be a forced accompaniment. In all of them except this20 one, the person had either a gun or knife. And I think21 that makes sense because if you're going to be trying to22 direct the people ­­ the movement of people within the23 bank, you're going to do that by means of a gun or a24 knife.25 The second thing that I'd say is that I do￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial50￼1 think that the teller who is forced to move with the2 robber, even if we hypothesize the unusual case of a3 robber who doesn't have a weapon, that teller is still4 sort of at risk of further physical force unarmed by the5 robber himself; that person is still in danger in the6 event that an armed confrontation breaks out with7 someone else. That person is still in a very, very bad8 position.9 I think Congress reasonably decided that it10 wanted to deter bank robbers from involving innocent11 people in their offense. And I think it sensibly made12 the decision to deter that sort of conduct at the very13 first step by writing the statute in a way that14 prohibits forced accompaniment, a term that as our briefs15 demonstrate, readily encompasses the type of movement at16 issue here from one room to another. And I think also17 readily encompasses even movements as short as a few18 steps.19 The example that my friend gave earlier was20 moving from one side of the lectern to another, and he21 suggested that movements of that order aren't ­­ aren't22 sensibly described as accompaniments. I think to the23 contrary, if Mr. Dreeben had joined me when I came to24 the lectern to present my argument a few minutes ago, we25 would very easily say that he accompanied me to theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 lectern to present the argument.2 This Court used the word "accompany" to3 describe a movement of just a few steps in Washington v.4 Chrisman where the issue was a police officer5 accompanying a college student from the public corridor6 of the student's dorm into the student's dorm room. And7 I think by choosing to use that term, Congress made the8 judgment that forced movements with a robber present9 enhanced dangers, present greater trauma to the victims,10 and that it was appropriate to deter and punish that11 conduct with a broad rule, because in every instance12 where it arises, it presents some dangers. But also13 because to try to draft any line that excludes some of14 the types of hypotheticals that the Court has proposed15 today would be very difficult to do, would produce an16 arbitrary and hard to administer standard and would17 inevitably rule out some18 meant to include when19 If the Court has ­­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY:21 evidence that prosecutors were using the threat of this22 extra charge in order to obtain guilty pleas, very23 substantial evidence, would that be a basis for us to24 rule that the statute is either inoperable altogether or25 that it should be interpreted in a way consistent withitof the cases that Congressdrafted the statute.Alderson Reporting CompanySuppose we had substantial51￼Official52￼1 what the Petitioner argues?2 MR. FLETCHER: I don't think so. I don't3 think this Court has ever suggested that the charging4 decisions with respect to a particular statute should5 inform the way the statute is interpreted.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think that concern7 is simply irrelevant to the interpretative task that we8 face.9 MR. FLETCHER: I think the Court has said10 that the interpretative task in interpreting a statute11 is to give the words of the statute their ordinary12 meaning in the context in which they're enacted. I13 don't think that is considered ­­ a charge of questions14 is ­­ of charging discretion would play into that15 inquiry.16 I understand why such a hypothetical pattern17 of prosecutorial abuse would give the Court pause and18 would be of concern, and I think that's why it's19 significant that to the extent that those concerns do20 arise, we don't have evidence of that here in the21 circuits that have adopted our rule or something very22 much like it. And I don't think there's any indication23 that prosecutors are departing from the instruction to24 consider the circumstances of individual cases in25 bringing charges.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     If the Court has no further questions, we'dask that the judgment below be affirmed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.     Mr. Carpenter, you have four minutesremaining.   REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CARPENTER: Thank you. I would offer the Court first a twist on the old adage fromJustice Holmes, which is to say that sad facts sometimes make very bad law. The facts of this case are undoubtedly sad, but the broad rule that the government seeks to apply here would cover cases where the facts aren't as sad and aren't ­­ aren't tragic at all.I would go to your point, Justice Scalia,about whether we should somehow interpret the statute to cover cases where there's particularly heightened trauma. On that issue, there was trauma here, but it had nothing to do with the movement from one room to another and it had everything to do with the fact that he invaded her home. So it can't ­­ this case can't turn ­­ the application of this provision can't turn on the happenstance of whether she was sitting in her room when he walked in or whether she happened to be standing at the hallway and he asked her to move into the room.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial54￼1 Also, the government repeatedly points out2 all the bad conduct that can happen even where there is3 movement of only a few feet, and it's inside the bank,4 but it can be accompanied with physical assault, et5 cetera. I would point the Court to the government's own6 brief at page 23 where my friend cites a series of cases7 that he described as the most egregious examples of8 forced movements over a short distance.9 In each of those ­­ in three of those cases10 they were decided under the guidelines, Davis, Lewis and11 Reid. In each one, based on the guidelines and based on12 the 3553(a) factors, the district courts imposed a13 sentence well below the statutory maximum that was14 available for an (a) offense. What that tells us is15 that the enhanced statutory maximums under (e) aren't16 necessary, even in these egregious cases where the17 movement is accompanied by physical assault and where18 it's of a short distance in the bank.19 On the flip side, though, the government's20 broad, single­step rule is going to be tremendously21 harmful in the mine run of bank robberies where you have22 only a few feet of movement and which present the23 problems that many of you have touched upon about the24 exercise of prosecutorial discretion.25 It's important to point out that in hisAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial551 presentation today, my friend mentioned that well, the2 guidelines ­­ the guidelines charging manual doesn't3 actually provide a limit here because abduction means4 even movement of a single step. So we know that the5 government isn't disavowing the single­step rule. It6 continues to advance it before this Court.7 And the government has also pointed to8 problems with line drawing. There's no doubt that it is9 not easy to draw a line in a case like this. But that10 doesn't justify the Court or the government in throwing11 up its hands and saying there's no line at all. I would12 say that the rule of lenity should have special force in13 the context of mandatory minimum provisions like this14 one, both because of the notice that a criminal15 defendant should receive that his conduct is so severe,16 that he's going to face the mandatory minimum penalty as17 severe as this one, and because of the harm to the18 system that flows from a broadly applicable mandatory19 minimum that gives the prosecution the ability to20 threaten these charges in otherwise ordinary bank21 robbery cases.22 If there are no further questions, we'd ask23 the Court to reverse the (e) conviction and send this24 case back for resentencing.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial56￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
