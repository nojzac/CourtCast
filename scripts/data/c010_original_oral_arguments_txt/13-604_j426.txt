North Carolina.Our first case thisOfficial￼      Mr. Fisher.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court.      In a country dedicated to the rule of law,governmental officers should be presumed to know the lawat least as well as the citizens are.  That being so,when questions about individualized suspicion ariseunder the Fourth Amendment, they should be addressedagainst the backdrop of the correct interpretation ofthe law, not simply any plausible reading an officermight have.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So suppose that this State, North Carolina, did have a good­faith exception to the exclusionary rule. What would you be arguing today?MR. FISHER: We would be ­­ still be arguing, if that were the case, that not only the Fourth Amendment was violated, but that the good­faith exception didn't apply. But you wouldn't have to reach3Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that question in this case, and I ­­ and I would concede2 to you, Justice Kennedy, that would be a debatable3 argument under this particular ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why would it be any5 more debatable than the argument you're making here?6 I ­­ I ­­ I've more or less anticipated your ­­ your ­­7 your answer. I think that has to be ­­ I ­­ I think you8 have to tell us even if the good­faith exclusionary rule9 applies, a mistake of law just doesn't count.10 MR. FISHER: Well, that's not exactly what11 this Court's jurisprudence holds, of course. In Krull12 and Davis, the Court has held that reasonableness of13 mistakes of law can be taken into account at the remedy14 stage, and I think that would be ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then ­­ and then ­­ but16 then that question is why isn't that a problem for you17 when you say there cannot be a reasonable mistake of18 law? We know there can be.19 MR. FISHER: Well, there's a difference,20 Justice Kennedy, between rights and remedies in the21 Court's jurisprudence. When you ask the question about22 what is reasonable as to whether or not the Fourth23 Amendment was violated, both in its Fourth Amendment24 jurisprudence in criminal cases and in qualified25 immunity cases, you would do that assessment against the4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 correct interpretation of the law.2 Now, in Leon ­­3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in connection ­­4 we're talking about whether as a ­­ as a categorical5 matter, as a jurisprudential matter, we can have this6 dichotomy known as a reasonable mistake of law, a7 difficult and interesting question. But it seems to me8 that you have to make the same argument here or in ­­9 in ­­ in the case where they have a good­faith10 exception, as you're making here, and that you have a11 problem with Davis and Krull. And if you don't have12 a ­­ if you have a problem with Davis and Krull, then13 that undermines your categorical argument.14 MR. FISHER: No, I really don't think so,15 Justice Kennedy. If ­­ I think the best exposition of16 this problem in the course of jurisprudence is actually17 in the Anderson against Creighton case, the qualified18 immunity case, where the Court wrestled with this notion19 that how can something be reasonable in one sense and20 unreasonable in another.21 And the answer the Court gave is that when22 we ask whether the Fourth Amendment was violated, we do23 not take mistakes of law into account, but the24 reasonableness of a mistake of law can go to the remedy25 question. This is the premise from which Leon, Krull,5Alderson Reporting Company1234 the ­­ 56 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, I have a preliminary question.Official￼and Davis all derive, which is that there was a FourthAmendment ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Would you just submit that      Even if you ­­ you're right about mistake oflaw, isn't it a moot question in this case because, as Iunderstand it, the traffic stop ended with a warningcitation.  So the traffic stop was over.  And at thatpoint, the police officer asked if he can inspect thecar, and the answer is yes.  Why isn't the consent tothe search the end of this case?MR. FISHER: Because it would be the fruit of the poisonous tree, Justice Ginsburg, if the stop was illegal. There would have never been an opportunity to ask for consent. And I think that's why the State and Solicitor General haven't made any argumentthat the consent wipes away the Fourth Amendmentquestion here.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the officer had said, all right, I'm giving you a warning. You're free to leave now. But by the way, may we ­­ may I search your car?MR. FISHER: I ­­ I think that's more or6Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425less what the officer did say here, Justice Alito. JUSTICE ALITO: And you would say then, evenin that situation, that that would be the fruit of thepoisonous tree?MR. FISHER: Yes. Because the stop wouldn't have taken place. The ­­ the Court's cases, Prouse and all the rest, say that a traffic stop is a seizure. And so upon pulling Mr. Heien over, the officer needed to have reasonable suspicion to do so. And the only argument for reasonable suspicion is the mistake of North Carolina law as to the brake light in this case.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood you to say earlier that you don't take ­­ distinguishing the exclusionary rule in qualified immunity, you don't take reasonableness into account when it comes to a mistake of law?MR. FISHER: What ­­ what I ­­ I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. What I ­­ I think I said is that you ­­ you don't take the reasonableness of mistake of law into account when you ask whether the Fourth Amendment was violated.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the Fourth Amendment ­­MR. FISHER: You do sometimes ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, go ahead.7Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FISHER: Forgive me.      You do sometimes when you ask about theremedy, and that's what he did.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the ­­ but the Fourth Amendment itself protects only against unreasonable searches and seizures by its term. I don't understand. It would seem to me that there's a stronger argument for taking the reasonableness of the officer's actions into account when you're talking about a mistake of law, because that's what the Fourth Amendment says, as opposed to remedies and qualified immunity.MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, the Court rejected that precise argument in Anderson, that textual argument that the word "reasonableness" means that the Fourth Amendment incorporates mistakes of law, and because of a deep common law rule, which is that when we ask ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just pause.MR. FISHER: Yeah.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we said exactly that in Herring, though, where we said that even though we're going to look at it in terms of remedy, that was not to say that the reasonableness didn't go to whether there was a substantive violation of the Fourth8Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Amendment.2 MR. FISHER: My understanding of Herring3 would be that would be a mistake of fact case, whether4 or not there was a warrant outstanding for5 Mr. Herant's ­­ Mr. Herring's arrest would have been a6 factual question, not necessarily a legal question.7 In Anderson and Krull and Leon ­­ in Leon,8 Mr. Chief Justice, the Court said the officer in that9 case acted exactly as a reasonable officer could and10 should have acted. And time and again in the Court's11 exclusionary rule cases, they've said the officer acted12 reasonably because at the reasonableness stage, you can13 take into account whether the officer reasonably14 misunderstood the law.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you put16 aside ­­17 MR. FISHER: But at the right stage ­­18 forgive me.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just saying,20 putting aside our discussion of Prouse and ­­ and21 Herring, why does it make sense to say that you don't22 take reasonableness into account when the Fourth23 Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches24 and seizures?25 MR. FISHER: I think for three reasons,9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Mr. Chief Justice. There's a practical reason, a2 theoretical reason, and a jurisprudential reason.3 Now, I'll start with the theory because4 that's where I was just describing. The deep common law5 heritage in this country that we have always followed,6 and the best exposition of that is in the Court's Cheek7 case, is that the criminal law is presumed to be8 definite and knowable.9 So in all kinds of settings, whether it be10 punishing somebody for violating the law or any other11 actions citizens or the government engages in, we always12 assume a correct understanding of the law, even if it's13 later construed by a court in a way that wasn't exactly14 predictable or foreseeable.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it strange that you're16 citing Cheek for that proposition? Didn't the Court17 hold in Cheek that under the ­­ in that ­­ in the18 circumstances there, ignorance of the law would be a19 defense?20 MR. FISHER: Because of a special statutory21 exception that Congress had written. The beginning of22 part two of Cheek is what I'm relying on, Justice Alito,23 where there is a paragraph or two that sets out with24 numerous citations this principle Justice Holmes25 described, and many others, that the criminal law is10Alderson Reporting Company      MR. FISHER:questions in there.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:sees the contraband.MR. FISHER:Well, I think there's two     And then ­­ and then hePardon me?   And ­­ and then he seesOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425presumed to be definite and knowable.      And once you take that presumption and putit into the police officer's mind, in this case or anyother governmental actor who acts on a mistake of law,then there is no reasonable suspicion because wepresumed them to have known the law when they acted.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the officer stopped the driver here and said, you know, I've been going to night law school and we don't know about this one light/two light thing. There's an intermediate court of appeals that's hearing a case, it sounds like they're going so say only one light is necessary, but I don't know what the law is. You better get this fixed.      JUSTICE ALITO:the ­­ in the course of this conversation, he sees thecontraband.MR. FISHER: Well, I think there's two questions embedded in there. One is whether the officer can look to court decisions or other third party sources to help him do his job. Now, again, that is what the11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Court has said in the Krull and Davis cases, that you2 take into account things like police manuals, court3 decisions, and the rest. The Court has embraced that in4 its remedy jurisprudence, but in Whren has said that is5 off limits as to the Fourth Amendment.6 Now, I think there's also an element of your7 question asking about what if ­­ all that the officer8 was worried about was the safety on the roadway. That9 would be a very different case. Again, I'm going to10 turn the Court to Whren, where the Court said that if11 there's a stop done for reasons aside from probable12 cause, then the purpose of that stop, such as the13 community caretaking function, might kick in. But of14 course the State hasn't made any argument in that15 respect in this case because the record is quite clear16 the officer was performing a criminal investigation.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But Mr. Fisher, we ­­ we18 don't review opinions. We review judgments, we review19 results. What you're complaining about here is the20 admission of what was discovered in the search of the21 car, right?22 Now, what difference does it make whether23 that was lawfully admitted because it was a24 constitutional search or it was lawfully admitted25 because the remedy of excluding it would not be applied12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 if there was a mistake of law, a reasonable mistake of2 law?3 I mean, the constitutional problem is the4 admission of this evidence. And it seems to me whether5 it's properly admitted because the Fourth Amendment6 wasn't violated or whether it's properly admitted7 because the remedy for that violation is not ­­ is not8 exclusion of the evidence, you lose either way, don't9 you?10 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, nobody11 has addressed the question of remedy in this case12 because nobody needs to address the good­faith ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we need to if we14 find, as you urge us to find, that it violates the15 Fourth Amendment to make the search. We would then have16 to ­­ in order to decide whether this judgment is17 lawful, we would have to decide whether the remedy of18 excluding that evidence has to be applied. And you know19 the answer to that ­­20 MR. FISHER: Well, with ­­ forgive me. With21 respect, Justice Scalia, I'm not sure the Court needs to22 do that. Of course, I think the Court can vacate and23 remand the judgment just as it does innumerable other24 times where it finds a problem with the lower court25 decision and therefore sends it back. Even if this were13Alderson Reporting Company24 JUSTICE SCALIA:25 from us is a remand?So the most you can getOfficial￼1 purely a Federal case, Justice Scalia, I think I'd be2 saying the same thing, which is nobody has briefed or3 argued the good­faith exception in this case. So you4 would need ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have. I mean,6 you have and you acknowledge that it applies to7 remedies.8 MR. FISHER: No. No. No. Here's what I've9 acknowledged, Justice Scalia. And I guess this is10 important. We've acknowledged that the question of11 whether the mistake was reasonable would be relevant, if12 at all, at the remedy stage.13 So what you would do is you'd ask the14 question, if this were a Federal case where you had to15 reach the question, you'd ask whether the officer's16 mistake of law in this case renders suppression17 inappropriate.18 Now, I would ­­ I would add that holding19 that it did render suppression inappropriate would be an20 extension of the Court's current good­faith21 jurisprudence, which thus far has held that good­faith22 doctrine applies only when an officer relies on binding23 law from a third ­­ from a legislature or a court.14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FISHER: That's right. But I do think2 it's just like any other ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just let the North Carolina4 law ­­ court decide whether ­­ whether the remedy of5 exclusion should have been ­­6 MR. FISHER: That's right. For example,7 Justice Scalia, I'm not sure it's any different if I8 said it was a constitutional violation that I may or may9 not be entitled to a remedy for under Chapman because10 the error was harmless or not. Those are the kinds of11 situations where the Court would always resolve the12 constitutional question that the lower court addressed13 and then send it back down for the question of remedy.14 And that's all I ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know why,16 following up on what Justice Scalia is saying, he's17 saying we don't give you a remedy unless we believe that18 one is warranted under the Fourth Amendment. And since19 we apply ­­ it doesn't matter what North Carolina20 applies, good faith or not ­­ what we apply in terms of21 determining whether a Federal violation or a22 constitutional violation is subject to any type of23 remedy for you is the good­faith exception. So why do24 we have to remand? I think that's Justice Scalia's25 question and I'm not quite sure you've answered it.15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FISHER: The reason to remand is because2 the lower court hasn't addressed any question of remedy.3 And so in the first instance, you should send it back to4 the lower court for a full adversarial briefing subject5 to waiver and ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But North Carolina has a7 rule, I thought, that if you violate the Fourth8 Amendment, that's it. We don't ­­ we don't have a9 good­faith exception.10 MR. FISHER: That will be our position on11 remand, Justice Ginsburg. But The State may try to12 persuade the Court of something else.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that ­­ isn't14 that ­­ isn't that what the North Carolina law is now?15 So it would be futile to send it back for them to answer16 the good­faith exception since they have none.17 MR. FISHER: It wouldn't be futile, Justice18 Ginsburg. I think ­­ I think the analogy that I gave19 earlier about Chapman is more or less on point. The20 Court has held that if the Constitution is violated,21 that the defendant in a criminal case doesn't get a22 remedy unless he satisfies that test.23 Now, all of the time in criminal cases you24 would just decide the constitutional issue and then send25 it back for remedy analysis if the lower court hadn't16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 addressed it.2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 because they would be applying Federal law. They would4 be answering the question that you want us to leave5 unanswered; namely, whether the Constitution requires6 that this evidence be ­­ be stricken from the case.7 MR. FISHER: Well, let me say ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if indeed they're not9 going to ask that question when we send it back, it10 seems to me we have to answer that question here before11 we are able to reverse or affirm the North Carolina12 court. It's a Federal question.13 They are not going to ­­ they are not going14 to get to that, but you're asking us to invalidate this15 conviction on the basis of Federal law. And it seems to16 me we cannot do that unless there has ­­ even if there17 has been a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy18 must be exclusion of ­­ of the evidence. That's a19 Federal question. I think we're going to have to decide20 it. If we send it back to North Carolina, they're not21 going to decide it. Are they?22 MR. FISHER: No, I don't believe they would23 or should. But I ­­ but just if a State had adopted a24 rule saying we're going to have a more favorable25 jurisprudence of constitutional error and give automatic17Alderson Reporting CompanyThat's because ­­ that'sOfficial￼1 new trials, the Court wouldn't be prohibited from2 deciding a constitutional issue and sending it back down3 to the State.4 In the retroactivity sphere, Danforth v.5 Minnesota is another case where the Court has said that6 States can choose for themselves to have more favorable7 remedies and the Court simply deals with the Federal8 question.9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's no question10 that if ­­ if North Carolina applied a State11 constitutional analog to the Fourth Amendment, they12 could have a more extensive remedy than is recognized13 under our Fourth Amendment cases. But your argument is14 they can adopt a State law rule for Fourth Amendment15 violations that is more protective of defendants than ­­16 than Federal case law provides. That would be your17 argument, right?18 MR. FISHER: I don't need to make that19 argument. I think that would be an interesting question20 and I think the State may be able to do that. But what21 the Carter decision in North Carolina says is that22 violations of the State Constitution cannot be23 overlooked on good­faith doctrine.24 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was this decision25 based on the State constitution?18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FISHER: No. It was based on the2 Federal Constitution, so we would send it back down.3 And we have preserved an argument that under State law,4 the violation of the Fourth Amendment also violates the5 North Carolina Constitution.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're asking us to7 reverse it on the basis of Federal law and you're asking8 us to send it back to a State court which is not going9 to ­­ to inquire any further into Federal law, even10 though Federal law, arguably, you will concede says that11 even if there is a Fourth Amendment violation, if12 there's a good­faith reasonable belief that the law was13 violated, the remedy of exclusion will not be imposed.14 That's what the Constitution requires. And15 you're asking us to say, oh, no, there's ­­ there's been16 a violation of the Constitution and we're going to17 reverse this judgment, even though we haven't inquired18 into whether the remedy that ­­ that you want is19 required. And it seems to me ­­ I don't see how we can20 do that.21 MR. FISHER: Well, I don't want to keep22 saying the same thing. I'll try and say it one more23 time. I think it's fully customary24 have a case from State courts where25 a ruling on Federal law. There may19for this Court toa State court issuesbe many other issuesAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the case, Federal, State, whatever, but if thequestion of Federal law the State court decided isincorrect, this Court can reverse that judgment, say yougot Federal law wrong, we're going to send it back down.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it ­­ but it chooses to decide based on only half of the Federal law or three­quarters of the Federal law. Can North Carolina more or less set us up this way?MR. FISHER: There is ­­ there is a Federalism element ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:Justice Scalia's concern ­­This is consistent withMR. FISHER: Forgive me.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:Justice Scalia's question.­­ which is a follow­on toOfficial￼      JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, they didn't get Federallaw wrong.  Their opinion got Federal law wrong, but theirjudgment did not get Federal law wrong if indeed a goodfaith mistake of law does not require the exclusion ofthe evidence from the trial.  The judgment did not getFederal law wrong if that's the case.MR. FISHER: Well, I think that their analysis got Federal law wrong for the reasons we've described.JUSTICE SCALIA:We don't review analyses.20Alderson Reporting Company25 doing.Official￼1 We review judgments. You're ­­ you're urging that this2 conviction has to be set aside. That's what we're3 reviewing, the conviction, not the opinion.4 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, if you5 want to decide the good­faith question that has not been6 briefed by any party, I ­­ I suggest you might want to7 tread carefully.8 Now, we've given you ­­ maybe what I need to9 do at this point before I sit down and reserve my time10 for rebuttal, is explain to you why, even if you did11 feel like you needed to get to that question, which I12 don't think you need to, but if you did need to get to13 that question, why you should say that the good­faith14 doctrine doesn't apply.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to take16 up your rebuttal time, but your argument this morning17 has confused me on something I thought I understood. I18 thought that your ­­ I thought the reason why you've19 argued this case the way you have, trying to convince us20 to draw a very sharp distinction between right and21 remedy is because you believe that North Carolina has22 the right under State law to devise its own version of23 the exclusionary rule. If you're not ­­ if that's not24 your argument, then I'm really puzzled by what you're21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FISHER: Functionally, that's the way2 things work in North Carolina, Justice Alito. I think3 the only thing that ­­ that maybe I need to make more4 clear is that the reason why it works that way in North5 Carolina is because the State has held that violations6 of our State constitution cannot be subject to a good7 faith exception. The States have also held ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO: The State constitution is9 irrelevant because you're arguing about whether there is10 ­­ whether there can be mistake of law in determining11 whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth12 Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.13 Whatever we hold on that, North Carolina can do whatever14 it wants on the same question with respect to the State15 constitution.16 MR. FISHER: That's the next thing I was17 going to say, is in theory you're right, Justice Alito,18 but what North Carolina has said is that we construe19 article 1, section 20, which is the State counterpart,20 to be coterminous with the Fourth Amendment. So that's21 not the way the Court goes about its business. So22 functionally in the State of North Carolina where you23 are is that Fourth Amendment questions run exactly24 parallel to State substantive constitutional law25 questions, and if there's a violation, you ­­ you22Alderson Reporting Company      MR. FISHER:missed that.      JUSTICE KAGAN:Oh, if it were.  I'm sorry, I   Is there any difference?If it were a Federal case, itOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425suppress.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. ­­ Mr. Fisher, supposethis were a Federal case and we had available to us, ithad all been briefed, two alternative holdings in orderto support the conviction.  And one holding was this isnot a violation of Fourth Amendment law in the firstinstance, and the other holding was this is a violationof Fourth Amendment law, but the exclusionary ruleoperates and so the ­­ the good­faith exception to theexclusionary rule operates and so the evidence comes in.Is there any difference between those two holdings?MR. FISHER: I think the difference between those two holdings, if the Court remanded, may well play out differently in North Carolina.JUSTICE KAGAN: No, no, no. But I mean, if it were a Federal case ­­      MR. FISHER:would be functionally the same holding as to the outcomeof that case.  But I think ­­ if I could.JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, please.MR. FISHER: But there would be important reasons nonetheless, even though that would be a23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 functionally identical holding for the parties in the2 case, there'd be very important reasons nonetheless to3 make sure that you render that holding as to remedy4 jurisprudence, not as to the Fourth Amendment itself.5 And one reason is what I opened with and6 I've tried to say a couple times, that the government7 should be presumed to know the laws. It would undercut8 public confidence in law enforcement and the common law9 rule upon which the criminal law is built to say the10 government doesn't have to be presumed to know the law11 when it acted.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you say that, but some13 people say that the existence of a rule­remedy gap14 undermines public confidence in the law. So why should15 we take that argument any more seriously than the ­­16 than the rule­remedy gap17 MR. FISHER:18 from academic literature19 Court's jurisprudence, where people have argued that you20 shouldn't suspend remedy and the Court has rejected and21 said, no, as Judge Wilkinson wrote in the law review22 piece that I cited in the brief, there's an important23 reason to announce the right even if you're not going to24 give a remedy.25 Now, there are practical reasons for this as24problem in law?Because that argument comesand my argument comes from theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 well. Even in the Court's good­faith jurisprudence, the2 Court has given leeway to officers only to the extent3 the officers are relying on a clear directive from a4 third party, like a legislature or a court. This is5 very different. This is like the Johnson case from6 1982, where the Court held that if the officer acts on7 his own view of a, quote, "unsettled" rule of law, that8 we not only find a Fourth Amendment violation, we9 suppress. Even if I have to argue this case ­­10 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute that this was11 a reasonable interpretation of State law?12 MR. FISHER:13 were asking in sort of a14 statute was sufficiently15 been read this way. But16 viewed as a reasonable mistake under the good­faith17 doctrine, because the good­faith doctrine deals with18 directives from third parties and officers relying on19 third parties. Johnson that I was just citing to you20 says that unsettled questions of law ­­21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't mean to ­­ I22 don't mean to ask this in the context of any other body23 of the Court's case law, just in the common sense24 understanding of the term. Was it reasonable if a ­­25 even an attorney sat down and read the ­­ the relevant25I ­­ I would dispute if youChevron sense, that ­­ that theambiguous that it could haveI don't think it should beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 North Carolina statutes, do you think it would be2 reasonable for that attorney to conclude that you have3 to have two functioning brake lights and not just one?4 MR. FISHER: I think in the common sense5 way, I could concede that that would be reasonable. But6 there's a legal way of asking what is reasonable and7 what is not, Justice Alito. Let me say two things about8 that. One is to just remind you that the Court has9 never taken into account ambiguity or ­­ or the10 possibility for error in asking whether a governmental11 officer gets the law right.12 And secondly, you have to define the concept13 of reasonable. So even if you look at the facts of this14 case and you think, well, this mistake was reasonable,15 the other side hasn't given a definition of what it16 would say would be a reasonable mistake of law. There's17 a reference to qualified immunity jurisprudence in the18 State's brief, and the Solicitor General describes ­­19 uses language to say a foothold in the statutory text.20 I'm not sure what definition actually would21 apply here, but one thing I do know from the Court's22 good ­­ qualified immunity and EDPA jurisprudence, you'd23 have to define that concept, and the definitions that24 exist in the law right now are very, very broad. And I25 think that goes to the practical reason that I was going26Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to describe to the Court why you shouldn't hold that the2 Fourth Amendment was satisfied here. Because if you say3 that anything that's reasonable, as the Court has4 defined it in other cases, susceptible to debate, you5 vastly expand police officer discretion to conduct6 traffic stops.7 As the Court has noted already, officers8 have enormous discretion both by the nature of the9 traffic laws and under the Whren decision. If ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, let me ­­ let11 me try my problem just one last time before your time.12 You ­­ you assert that ­­ that we ­­ we should not13 decide the remedy question because it hasn't been14 argued. But wasn't it your responsibility to argue it?15 You're asking us to set aside a judgment of the North ­­16 North Carolina court. That judgment can be set aside17 only if, number one, the Fourth Amendment was not18 violated or, number two, it was violated, but the remedy19 does not have to be exclusion of the evidence.20 It's ­­ it seems to me it's your burden to21 establish not just that the Fourth Amendment was22 violated, but also that ­­ that exclusion was necessary23 under the Constitution. And it is no answer to say,24 well, that hasn't been argued. You haven't argued it.25 That's the problem.27Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FISHER: Well, if I need to argue it, I would refer you to the part three arguments in our opening brief, which explain why even if you move good faith into the right ­­ those ­­ those would be my arguments, Justice Scalia.      The only other case that comes to mind isthe Court's Ayolta case several years ago, where therewas a takings question brought to the Court, and theCourt divided that Federal law question into two pieces.And when the lower court had only addressed the firstpiece of the case, the Court reversed on that firstpiece of the case and sent it back down.  So I thinkwhat I'm asking for isn't terribly different.JUSTICE SCALIA: Sent it back down for that court to decide the other piece. But this Court will not decide the other piece, as you acknowledge.MR. FISHER: If a State makes that choice that it's going to give a more favorable remedy, then federalism should respect that choice, Justice Scalia.      And so I'd like to reserve the rest of mytime.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Fisher.      Mr. Montgomery.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. MONTGOMERY.28Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR. MONTGOMERY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please          the Court:The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches andseizures, but it does not require that police officers be perfect. Because the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, all that is required is that a police officer have a reasonable view of the   facts and apply those facts to a reasonable       understanding of the law.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When will we ever get an understanding, the right understanding of the law? Meaning as I read the North Carolina Supreme Court decision, it still hasn't told me whether it's one or two brake lights, and the next police officer who wants to stop someone won't know that either.MR. MONTGOMERY: In North Carolina ­­ excuse me.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, he may be bound by the appellate court decision, but that won't help clarify the state of the law.      Isn't what you're doing going to leave thecriminal law unclear?  It's one thing to say that youwant to not subject officers to civil liability.  It'sanother to say you want to leave the law unclear in a29Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 criminal prosecution.2 MR. MONTGOMERY:3 Carolina, controlling4 intermediate court of5 our supreme court might not reach a different decision6 some day. But for now, police officers would be bound7 by what the North Carolina court of appeals decided.8 So the law has been decided. An officer who9 goes out and makes a stop tomorrow because one brake10 light is out would be acting unreasonably under that11 decision, so it doesn't leave criminal law uncertain.12 It ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it will for the14 appellate decision if it's now taking your view that it15 can just find out whether the reading, the officer's16 reading of the law is reasonable. It basically means17 that any open question, police officers will rule in18 favor of their right to search.19 MR. MONTGOMERY: It depends on whether the20 question is an open question and whether that21 interpretation by the officer is reasonable. It22 certainly may be an unreasonable interpretation. It23 would have ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:25 it unreasonable?30       Well, Your Honor in Northprecedent does come from theappeals.  That's not to say thatAlderson Reporting CompanyDefine what would makeOfficial￼1 MR. MONTGOMERY:2 unreasonable if there was plain language of the statute3 that no one could reach a different interpretation about4 at all if it was plain, or if there was a definite5 decision by an appellate court it would be unreasonable6 for officer to interpret it in his own way.7 And the whole standard would be a reasonable8 person standard. Would a reasonable person be able to9 take this view of the statute?10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very broad11 definition of reasonable. I understand the idea that12 when, you know, 99 people out of a hundred think you13 have to have two brake lights, like you do everywhere14 else in the country, that it's reasonable for the police15 officer to think that.16 But it sounds to me like you're adopting the17 same standard that we apply in qualified immunity, which18 gives the officers quite ­­ quite broad scope, and19 that ­­ that's troubling.20 MR. MONTGOMERY: It's not ­­ it's not the21 same as qualified immunity in that qualified immunity22 looks also ­­ it looks ­­ it protects the plainly23 incompetent. We're not saying that is the standard24 here, that ­­25 JUSTICE KAGAN:31Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, it would beNo, I think it doesn'tOfficial￼1 protect the ­­2 MR. MONTGOMERY:3 protect the plainly incompetent.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. So I think what the5 Chief Justice is asking you is to describe a case for us6 where the officer would receive qualified immunity but7 it would not count as reasonable for these purposes.8 MR. MONTGOMERY: One of the things that this9 Court has said in Wilson v. Layne is that this Court and10 courts can look beyond just the officer's interpretation11 like this. It can look to other matters. There could12 be an officer who ­­ who had an unreasonable13 interpretation of the statute, and yet he may still have14 qualified immunity, for instance, because he was told by15 a judge or by the attorney general or by someone that16 this was correct, and that was a complete17 misunderstanding of the statute.18 It may be that that officer would still be19 protected by qualified immunity, but for the ­­ for20 Fourth Amendment purposes, that would not be a21 reasonable interpretation of the statute.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would not give a23 pass ­­ I mean, let's say the case is flipped here and24 the most reasonable reading of the statute is that you25 only need one brake light.32Alderson Reporting CompanyI'm sorry.  It doesn'tOfficial￼1 And so someone's driving around with one2 brake light. You pull him over. He's going to say: I3 reasonably thought that, you know, I ­­ I only ­­ I only4 needed one. And the Court comes out and says, I needed5 two.6 In that case, ignorance of the law would not7 save him, would it?8 MR. MONTGOMERY: No, it would not. But the9 flip side of that is that an officer's belief that you10 needed all of your brake lights, and that is not11 actually the law, does not mean that that person is12 guilty.13 In other words, in this instance, this ­­14 this driver ­­ excuse me, the defendant here or driver,15 actually, could not be held liable for the brake light16 violation. So it's not that the fact that an officer17 thinks reasonably that the law is something. That18 doesn't make it the law, just like if a citizen does not19 think that's the law, that does not mean that he can20 escape liability.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a problem,22 however ­­ I'm sorry. The police officer wasn't23 stopping him because of the brake light. The police24 officer was involved in criminal interdictions and25 admitted that this was a pretext, a lawful pretext, he33Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425thought.      So he wasn't there just to tell him ­­ if hehad just stopped him and said, you know, fix your brakelight, and drove away, there would never be a lawsuit,correct?MR. MONTGOMERY: That's correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how many citizens have been stopped for one brake light who are asked to have their car searched? And is that something that we as a society should be encouraging?MR. MONTGOMERY: Well, there ­­ wholly innocent people are stopped quite often because of mistakes of fact, for instance. That's part of the whole Terry ­­ how Terry works and those types of brief stops. There turns out times that citizens have not committed any kind of offense, and yet they are stopped.      This is just another example of that, inwhich an officer acted reasonably, just as with areasonable mistake of fact, and it turned out that thiswas not actually a violation.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like to focus again on your definition of reasonableness. Let's say you have two court of appeals decisions. One says you need two brake lights; the other says you need one.      Is it reasonable for the officer to pull34Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 somebody over when one of their two brake lights is2 burned out?3 MR. MONTGOMERY: If you have conflicting4 rulings from the court of appeals, it would be5 reasonable then for the officer to decide which he6 thought was the better rule, if there were two different7 decisions from the court of appeals, which is not8 supposed to happen in our system.9 But if that did happen, then it would be10 reasonable for the officer to rely on either one of11 those.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Montgomery, I take it13 that one of Mr. Fisher's arguments, maybe his primary14 argument, is that this just looks like a remedies15 question, it does not look like a rights question, it16 focuses on the culpability of the officer in the way we17 do when we think about immunity or when we think about18 the exclusionary rule.19 So why isn't that exactly right, that to the20 extent that this conviction ought to be upheld, it ought21 to be upheld on remedies reasons rather than rights22 reasons to fit in with our basic understanding of what23 remedies and rights do and do differently in our law?24 MR. MONTGOMERY: Well, certainly this court25 looks at different things when it looks at the right35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 versus the remedy. Reasonableness is important in the2 rights stage. In the remedies stage, that may be3 considered, but also the culpability of ­­ of the4 officer, whether he was deliberately disregarding the5 law, those types of things.6 This Court has addressed mistakes of law7 both in the rights and the remedy stage. And so it8 would be important to address it in the rights stage9 here in this particular case because then we don't get10 into the sorts of things that wouldn't be necessary in11 the remedy stage, if that answers your question.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about ­­ what about13 the dissenter in the North Carolina court of appeals who14 said North Carolina has no good­faith exception, and so15 all that this decision does is it allows the police to16 get around the absence of a good­faith exception?17 Wasn't that the position of the dissenter,18 that allowing for a reasonable mistake of law to support19 a warrantless stop is the functional equivalent of a20 good­faith exception?21 MR. MONTGOMERY: That was the position of22 the dissenting justices at the North Carolina Supreme23 Court, one of the things that they said.24 But again, this again gets back to25 reasonableness as the standard for the Fourth Amendment.36Alderson Reporting Company      MR. MONTGOMERY:      JUSTICE SCALIA:so much of our time.      MR. MONTGOMERY:That's correct, Your Honor.Okay.  I'm sorry to wasteWell, we did not make thatOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And that is what this Court has said is important atthat stage, is whether an officer is acting reasonably.      There are other considerations that takeplace at the remedy stage.  So the State was asking fornothing more than simply whether this violated theFourth Amendment, and not about remedy.  And ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, maybe you have the answer to all the questions I was asking of ­­ ofMr. Fisher. And ­­ and I guess the answer is you haven't argued that point, right?MR. MONTGOMERY: The remedy?JUSTICE SCALIA: You did not ­­ you did not assert in your ­­ in your brief or you haven't asserted it in oral argument, thus far, anyway, that even if it did constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy did not have to be exclusion of the evidence, and that remedy is indeed subject to reasonable mistake of law, and therefore, the decision has to be affirmed.But you didn't make that argument. You want to put all your eggs in the basket of whether it's a violation of Fourth Amendment. Am I right about this?37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 argument below in the North Carolina Supreme Court. And2 Mr. Fisher is correct in that it is our State3 constitution that says that there's no good­faith4 exception.5 If a defendant had only raised a Fourth6 Amendment question in our courts, the good­faith7 exception would still be available if that defendant did8 not make a claim under the State constitution.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure it10 makes good prudential sense to allow the North Carolina11 Supreme Court to put to us what is basically an abstract12 question.13 MR. MONTGOMERY: The question of ­­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: To ­­ to give an answer15 without reference to the fact that, as Justice Scalia16 indicates, part of the Fourth Amendment is the17 good­faith exception. It bears on reasonableness.18 MR. MONTGOMERY: That's correct. And ­­ and19 this ­­ this Court has, in cases like Rodriguez dealt20 with mistake of law just in the rights stage rather than21 the remedies stage, and that's all that it ­­ has been22 briefed in this instance. That's correct.23 And one of the things that is different24 about this from Krull and Davis is that we're not25 talking about ­­38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 just doesn't wash. Yes, in other cases we just decide3 the ­­ the right and ­­ and don't have to decide the4 remedy, but this is a case in which, unless ­­ unless5 the remedy is exclusion, there's no basis for us to set6 aside the judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court.7 Unless ­­ unless the remedy is exclusion. It seems to8 me that's part of the case to reverse. If ­­ if we9 can't say that, we have no business reversing. But if10 it hasn't been argued, I guess we can do that. I guess.11 MR. MONTGOMERY: That ­­ that has not been12 argued here or below, that's correct. A difference13 between this case and Krull and Davis is that this case14 does not ­­ this involves a mistake of law as to a15 substantive statute rather than a mistake of law as to16 the Fourth Amendment itself. And the difference in that17 is that a reasonable violation of the Fourth Amendment18 is still a violation of the Fourth Amendment.19 There ­­ if there's a statute that gives an20 officer the opportunity to make a seizure on less than21 what is required by the Constitution, less than probable22 cause or less than reasonable suspicion, even if the23 officer is reasonable, that is still a Fourth Amendment24 violation, which is why this Court would have to go to25 the remedy portion to decide whether the exclusionary39Alderson Reporting CompanyExcuse me.  I mean, thatOfficial￼1 rule applied.2 In this instance, this case, it was a3 mistake as to a substantive statute that was used by the4 officer to ­­ as part of the facts and circumstances of5 this case. As part of the totality of the circumstances6 of this case, the officer considered what he thought was7 the correct law.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why does it ­­ why should9 you draw the line between if he gets the Fourth10 Amendment wrong, the Fourth Amendment is violated, but11 if he gets the statute wrong, then the Fourth Amendment12 is not violated?13 MR. MONTGOMERY: Because the officer only14 needs to act reasonably and the fact that he gets the15 statute wrong does not mean that he acted necessarily16 unreasonably.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the fact that he18 made a mistake about what the Fourth Amendment requires19 could also be reasonable.20 MR. MONTGOMERY: It could be, and that would21 be proper to consider, as this Court has, in the22 remedies stage rather than in the rights stage. In the23 DeFillippo case that this Court decided, there was a24 situation in which a statute, a substantive statute was25 found unconstitutional and void for vagueness, and yet40Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this Court found that there was probable cause in thatcase for the officer to make an arrest based upon thatstatute.      So that was one case in which this Courtlooked at it at the rights stage as a mistake of lawrather than at the remedy stage.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you think if DeFillippo came up again today, with all the cases that have been decided since then, that we would decide it the same way or do you think we would conceptualize it now as a remedies question?MR. MONTGOMERY: I think the Court would decide it the same way. And this Court in Arizona v. Evans said that if the case is even decided before the good­faith exception are still viable in terms of the Fourth Amendment analysis.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:law did the police officer makesaid exactly what he thought itWhat kind of mistake ofin DeFillippo?  The lawsaid.Official￼MR. MONTGOMERY: That's correct, Your Honor.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:as a mistake of law question?Why do you classify thisMR. MONTGOMERY: I believe the ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We said it was presumptively valid and he acted according to a statute.41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. MONTGOMERY:2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 officers to ignore the law.4 MR. MONTGOMERY:5 different from this case, but there was still ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. This is a7 mistake of law; he wasn't following the law, presumably,8 according to the appellate decision.9 MR. MONTGOMERY: That's right. The10 DeFillippo case is important because you had someone who11 was acting wholly innocently; he was not committing an12 offense at all, as ­­ as in this case you had someone13 who was acting wholly innocently and was not committing14 a violation of the law. So in DeFillippo, this Court15 said that even though the conduct was wholly innocent,16 there still was probable cause despite the mistake of17 law, and that's all that we're saying in this case.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't there another19 difference between DeFillippo and this case? The court20 in DeFillippo talks a lot about how there's a21 presumption of constitutionality for any statute and we22 don't want officers to go around questioning the23 constitutionality of statutes. But here, that's not the24 case. Here, there's a statute and an officer is not25 supposed to read it as broadly as possible. An officer42Alderson Reporting CompanyThat's correct.   You don't ask policeThat is correct that it's      MR. MONTGOMERY:It has a subsection (d).      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR.

MONTGOMERY: It is different, but we do want officers to enforce the law. We don't want them to just sit back and not enforce ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: We want them to enforce the law fairly and as written and ­­ and not to push every statute to its ­­ you know, to the furthest, furthest, furthest it could go without being found, you know, utterly unreasonable.MR. MONTGOMERY: That's correct, Your Honor. But we do want them to act reasonably and still enforce the law, not to turn a blind eye to what may be a violation.JUSTICE SCALIA: How ­­ how does the statute read here? What are the exact words from the statute.43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 appendix to the Respondent's brief, appendix pages 1 ­­2 appendix pages 1 through ­­ actually through 5, has all3 of the relevant portions of the statute.4 Subsection (d) involves rear lamps and says5 that, "every motor vehicle shall have all originally6 equipped rear lamps or the equivalent in good working7 order." That's the relevant portion of subsection (d).8 Subsection (g), which is on page 3 of the appendix says,9 "No person shall sell or operate on the highways of the10 State any motor vehicle manufactured after December11 31st, 1955 unless it shall be equipped with a stop lamp12 on the rear of the vehicle." That is the language that13 the North Carolina Court of Appeals said when it said "a14 stop lamp," that meant that only one was required.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: That ­­ that seems to be16 what it says.17 MR. MONTGOMERY: The confusion comes in ­­18 the confusion comes in, Justice Scalia, in the last19 sentence of subsection (g) on appendix page 3, which20 says, "The stop lamp may be incorporated into a unit21 with one or more other rear lamps." Where the confusion22 comes in is that sentence would seem to imply that the23 stop lamp is a rear lamp, that it can be incorporated24 into a unit with one or more other rear lamps.25 And if you go back to subsection (d), that's44Alderson Reporting Companythere's some conflicts      JUSTICE SCALIA:to all rear lamps, thelamps.      MR.

So there ­­the other lamps, of course, it would say lamps.MR. MONTGOMERY: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner.ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES    AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTMS. KOVNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      Since the founding, the probable causestandard had allowed ­­ has allowed police officers tomake stops when there are reasonable grounds to believethat a person committed a crime even if the officerlater turns out to have been mistaken about either thefacts or the law.  And as Justice Kennedy observed at45Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the start of this argument, given that this Court'scases recognize that there can be a reasonable mistakeof law, an officer who makes a reasonable mistake of lawmay have a reasonable grounds to believe that a personcommitted a crime.      If I can go to a question that Justice Kaganasked about why this question is more appropriatelyaddressed at the rights stage than the remedies stage,we think there are three main reasons.  The first has todo with history.

Those cases, the probable cause reasoning that the Court has followed in those cases is what the Court has doneat the merits stage of the Fourth Amendment analysis.So this Court has routinely cited cases under those customs statutes as illuminating the meaning of the probable cause standard, and is therefore illuminating ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you disagree with Justice Story when he looked at those cases and made the point I just made.Official￼MS.

KOVNER: I think we agree with each of20 those descriptions of a reasonable ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you agree22 with those then what about this case? Because after23 all, it does say a stamp light ­­ a stop light. What's24 the difficulty of construing that to mean a stop light?25 MS. KOVNER: So we think that the North48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Carolina Supreme Court and the court of appeals wereright that an officer could reasonably interpret thestatute to require ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Only after a careful scrutiny and serious difficulty in construing the law does it turn out that the officer was wrong.

And ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: But that includes the stop light and any other lights. Okay. A stop light, the turn lights, the back­up lights.      So you had to use the plural for those otherprovisions.MS. KOVNER: Agreed. It's not the plural. It's the fact that all originally equipped rear lamps need to be working, which means that if a car was originally equipped with multiple stop lamps, as cars now are, then when one of them is broken, one of the originally equipped rear lamps is not working.So that's the difficulty. And that's why49Here ­­    It stays a stamp ­­ a stopHere, the difficulty is in theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 none of the courts that considered this question thought2 this was anything other than a very hard question of3 statutory interpretation.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So where do you come5 out in my hypothetical of the two court of appeals6 decisions? Is that reasonable for the officer to say,7 "Well, I'm going to pick this one and follow that?"8 MS. KOVNER: So if the officer is in a9 jurisdiction whose court of appeals has decided the10 question, we think the officer is bound by that11 interpretation, even if other courts of appeals come out12 differently. But if the officer is in a jurisdiction13 where the question is undecided and different courts14 have come out differently in other jurisdictions, then15 we don't think the fact that one court has decided it in16 one way is dispositive. We think then the court looks17 to this question of is it a really difficult ­­18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, now I forgot one19 thing, which may be obvious to me. We're not talking20 about a difficulty in construing the Fourth Amendment21 itself? We're talking only about a difficulty in22 construing a criminal statute, where, in fact, the23 reason for the stop or seizure is based on a violation24 of criminal law.25 MS. KOVNER: That's right. I think the50Alderson Reporting Company12 precedent that forecloses what13 to protect only those who were14 everybody except for those who15 JUSTICE GINSBURG:the officer does in orderacting ­­ to protectare clearly incompetent.The one argument that isOfficial￼1 probable cause standard allows for an officer to act2 when he has reasonable grounds to ­­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is your standard4 differed from qualified immunity standard of5 reasonableness?6 MS. KOVNER: Sure. We think that an7 officer, in order to have reasonable grounds for a stop,8 needs to be able to point to something in the statute9 that affirmatively supports his view, whereas the10 qualified immunity standard seems to require essentially11 the opposite. It seems to require that there's a16 in your brief that I didn't follow is that the17 importance of holding the way you recommend is so that18 when you get this question solved, you tee up the19 question, what is the rule, one light or two lights.20 But yet in this case, it was consent. The21 evidence that came in had nothing at all to do with the22 traffic violation, so we wouldn't need to ­­ the Court23 wouldn't need to decide the traffic violation, say ­­ it24 was consent. I think the North Carolina Immediate25 Appellate Court said it was a legitimate consent. It51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 was consent, and this evidence comes in, and we never2 had to deal with what the traffic regulation was.3 MS. KOVNER: That's correct, Your Honor.4 And this question comes up in two contexts. Sometimes5 it would be litigated in the suppression context, and6 sometimes it would be litigated because the officer7 actually issues a citation. And our concern expressed8 in that portion of the brief is that if the Court takes9 the position that whenever an officer is wrong about the10 law, he has violated the Fourth Amendment, it's going to11 deter officers from making stops where there are12 arguments on both sides.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you ­­ do you agree14 that if there is an illegal stop, that this consent is15 the fruit of the poison tree?16 MS. KOVNER: We think that would be a17 difficult question. We don't necessarily agree with18 that. This Court has said it's not simply a but­for19 test. So even if the stop was a but­for cause, that20 doesn't necessarily mean that the evidence was fruit of21 the poisonous tree. But the question wasn't argued22 below by the State and it hasn't been briefed here. So23 we've addressed simply the question of ­­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kovner, you started your25 argument by saying you were going to give us three52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 reasons why this should be a rights question rather than2 a remedies question. You said history, which frankly,3 you know, I think your history probably doesn't say as4 much as you think it says. So I want to know what is5 number two and number three are.6 MS. KOVNER: Sure. The second is an7 administrability reason. We think that this is the8 simplest standard. You simply ask officers to decide9 whether ­­ you simply ask courts to decide whether an10 officer could reasonably think that a person had11 committed a crime, and you don't separate was this a12 question of law or a question of fact and treat one in13 the rights section and one in the remedies section.14 And the third is that we don't think there's15 a normative reason to treat mistakes of law and mistakes16 of fact differently. When an officer makes a stop in17 this situation, he can just as reasonably be confused as18 to what the ­­ the law is under these statutes, as19 confused as to what the facts are. And if we're going20 to treat mistakes of fact as part of the rights21 analysis, it makes sense to treat reasonable mistakes of22 law in the same way.2324 you. 25If the Court has no further questions, thank53CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Mr. Fisher, you have three minutes left.2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER3 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER4 MR. FISHER: Thank you. I'd like to make5 four points if I could. To start with the6 administrability question of what would reasonableness7 mean, Mr. Chief Justice, I think your hypothetical of8 two differing court of appeals opinions in a State,9 I think under the analysis that I just described, would10 mean that it would violate the Fourth Amendment and half11 the State to conduct the stop and not in the other half12 of the State, because each would be binding in its own13 component of the State.14 And that shows why in Whren, and many other cases, this15 Court has rejected that kind of analysis at the rights16 stage and cabined it only to the remedies stage. If you17 want to ask ­­18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in this ­­ in this19 case, didn't the dissenters in the North Carolina20 Supreme Court say that the interpretation adopted by the21 court of appeals was surprising? So all we would have22 to say on reasonableness is that if it's not ­­ if it's23 surprising, if the correct interpretation is surprising,24 then the contrary interpretation is reasonable. Would25 we have to go further than that?54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. FISHER: I think you do because you have2 to just give a little more teeth to it. What the3 Solicitor General said is that it would have to have4 foothold in the statute. And I think that's more or5 less what was recited today,there was a recent D.C. Court6 of Appeals opinion that holds that a police officer7 could ­­ could argue from a foothold in the statute that8 all license plate frames are illegal.9 Now, they rejected that under their code,10 but it's just one of innumerable arguments that a law11 enforcement officer might make and that this12 reasonableness test would give grave ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I mean, it would14 be one way, one way. One court one way, one way the15 other way. The officer loses because, you know, it ties16 ­­ it has to be unusual. It has to be ­­ you heard17 what ­­18 MR. FISHER: Well, I think, Justice Breyer,19 the problem with that is that it's the core presumption20 that the officer needs to understand the law as it21 existed, as it was later construed.22 And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked, I think,23 about the ignorance canon. The State's response was,24 well, if somebody is reasonably mistaken about the law,25 we would convict him.55Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And the reason why is because we would2 assume he knew the law. We would assume that somebody3 at the court of appeals split and this Court divided4 5­4, the person is still convicted because we assume5 they knew the law when they acted.6 And all we are asking for today is for the7 exact same assumption to apply to police officers. And8 with due respect to the Solicitor General, the founding9 ­­ the cases they describe don't help them. They're10 only remedy cases, and they reinforce our point. And11 even when the Court has cited these cases, they're all12 in the pre­Leon context where this Court didn't13 distinguish rights from remedies.14 If you want to look at the founding, the15 controlling rule would be the common law rule. And as16 we said in our brief, with no ­­ with no disagreement17 from the other side, the common law rule dating back18 centuries was that ignorance of the law on the police19 officer's part, even if it was perfectly reasonable,20 didn't justify the stop.21 And if I could say one last thing to Justice22 Scalia about the colloquies we were having before, with23 all due respect, I really do think there is nothing24 unusual about a party litigating a case up through the25 courts. It may arise in Federal court or it may arise56Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in State court, but they can choose the arguments theychoose to raise.      And when we got a judgment in our favor fromthe North Carolina court of appeals, it was up to theState at that point to choose what arguments it wantedto pursue further in this case.  So just like a Statemay ­­ a party may ride the First Amendment instead ofthe Second or a rights question instead of remedy, wethink that's all that's happened here.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
