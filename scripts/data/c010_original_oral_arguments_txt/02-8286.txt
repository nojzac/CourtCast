Doug Dretke. Mr. Kendall.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:This case presents three issues, two arising from purposeful and recurring misconduct by the trial prosecutors, and a third from constitutionally deficient defense counsel. Prior to trial, the prosecutors promised to disclose discoverable material to the defense. They knew that Robert Farr would testify as a key witness at each phase of trial, and they knew that he was an informant and had been paid for his services.Mr. Farr did in fact take the stand at both phases of this trial. He denied he was an informant. He denied he received any consideration for his work. He denied tipping off the authorities that Mr. Banks would be taking a trip to Dallas. He denied setting up Mr. Banks for arrest. The prosecutors knew that when Mr. Farr gave his testimony it was not truthful. They did not rise to their feet and ask Mr. Farr to correct this testimony.3Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And it - is it your contention that2 this is a basis simply for setting aside the sentencing3 phase of the trial?4 MR. KENDALL: We have asked this Court to affirm5 the district court, who - who did grant relief on death6 sentence. We're not asking for relief on guilt innocence7 on - on the Mr. Farr claim.8 QUESTION: All right. I'm - I'm - I'm somewhat9 puzzled by that, but you have three different claims to10 discuss here and I don't want to take too long. It - it11 wouldseemtomethat,ifit-if-ifthisisthe12 evidence at trial, that - that there's no additional13 obligation or special obligation at sentencing where that14 becomes really a secondary matter.15 MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, the reason why we take16 that position is that his testimony at the punishment17 phase is absolutely critical for the state to get the18 death penalty in this case. The district court recognized19 that. The Fifth Circuit in this case said that that20 testimony was crucial. What he told the jury was that Mr.21 Banks had returned to Dallas to get a gun so that Mr.22 Banks could on the return trip commit armed robberies and23 take care of and eliminate witnesses.24 There was no other testimony that came close to25 matching that at the punishment phase, and the state had4Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.2 Banks would be a danger in the future. If they didn't3 satisfy that -4 QUESTION: Well, but - but you - you have the5 burden, don't you, to show that the outcome would have6 been - would have been different had the - had the state7 come clean at the beginning? And as I understand it, you8 - you assert that - that he would not - a jury would not9 have judged him as harshly if the jury had known that he10 was going to get the gun in order that Farr could commit11 robberies with - with apparently his assistance, rather12 than what Farr had told them, namely that he had gotten13 the gun in order that he would commit future robberies,14 right? And you think that would have made the difference,15 whether he's getting the gun to let somebody else kill or16 getting the gun to kill himself?17 MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, Mr. Banks denied at18 trial that he had any intent to commit any crime￼19 whatsoever with regard to this robbery. And Mr.20 made it clear -21 QUESTION: Understand. But - but - but22 saying he admitted that - that he got the gun so23 could commit robberies, right?Farr hadyou're that Farr24 MR. KENDALL: We think there's a world of -25 QUESTION: And that would have - would have -5Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 would have tapped a wellspring of mercy in the - in the2 jury's breast? I - I don't really see how it would make3 that much difference.4 MR. KENDALL: No, Your Honor. The point is - is5 that the - the state could not ask the jury to impose the6 death sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable7 doubt that Mr. - there was a strong likelihood that Mr.8 Banks would commit acts of violence in the future. We9 think there's a clear difference, and the trial10 prosecutors recognized this, between Mr. Banks going to11 get a gun so that Mr. Banks could rob and kill, as opposed12 to providing instrumentality.13 But more importantly, Your Honor, Mr. Farr14 recanted that testimony at the Federal hearing and that15 recantation was found credible by the district court.￼161718 anybody. 192021 stand that he had finally agreed to accompany Mr. Farr to22 Dallas to get a gun. But Mr. Farr denied - Mr. Banks23 denied that he had any intent whatsoever to commit any24 crime, and he flatly denied that assertion. Mr. Farr -25 this was a ruse that Mr. -QUESTION: Recanted what testimony?MR. KENDALL: No one had the intent to rob That was a ruse that Mr. Farr used - QUESTION: Banks admitted that himself.MR. KENDALL: No. Mr. Banks admitted on the6Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200059 10 11QUESTION: Oh, that - that explains -MR. KENDALL: - to -QUESTION: - why Farr got it. It doesn't explain got it.MR. KENDALL: But that was not the theory thatQUESTION: What - what - what was - what was the to be obtained for? Self-defense?MR. KENDALL: It was -QUESTION: These people were being -MR. KENDALL: - it was a ruse -QUESTION: - threatened by somebody?MR. KENDALL: Justice Scalia, it was a ruse that12 gun going345678 Mr. Farr used that was not true -12 why Banks 1314 the case - that the prosecutors asked the jury to conclude15 beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Farr would - that Mr.16 Banks would be dangerous in the future. The district17 court granted relief on that and we think that clearly we18 have shown materiality on that point.19 QUESTION: As to materiality -20 QUESTION: But he - I take it you do not agree21 that you have to show that the result would have been22 different?23 MR. KENDALL: We - we do not agree with that. In24 fact, we believe that this Court has not retired the25 Alcorta and Napue standard, and - and it shouldn't use￼7Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 this case. The - the standard in Alcorta and Napue that2 says if the Government puts up perjured testimony, that if3 there's a possibility that that testimony affected the4 judgment or if the judgment is reversed. We do5 acknowledge that this Court in Brecht did provide a rule6 generally for habeas corpus that is different from that7 rule. But it said in footnote 9 of that decision that8 where there are cases where there was a pattern of9 misconduct, that the Brecht rule might not apply. There10 is clearly a pattern of misconduct by the Government in11 this case.12 QUESTION: Well, you have to show cause and13 prejudice, and I thought that under Strickler, the - the14 necessity of showing prejudice requires that you show that15 there is a reasonable probability that the sentence would16 have been different.17 MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we've not -18 QUESTION: You - you don't think you have an19 obligation to show reasonable probability -￼202122 different. 2324 court -25MR. KENDALL: We do. We do, and - and - QUESTION: - that the sentence would have beenMR. KENDALL: We do, Your Honor, and the district QUESTION: You - you acknowledge that you have to8Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

KENDALL: On - on cause, we do, Your Honor,and we - we - we've met that clearly. So it's our submission here that Mr. Farr's testimony was critical - QUESTION: Alcorta was a case on direct review? MR. KENDALL: It was a habeas case, Your Honor,but the Court has not distinguished between -QUESTION: But decided long before a lot of ourother habeas cases, which have somewhat limited the relief?MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor, but the Court, since Brecht, in - in subsequent cases, in - in Kyles and in Strickler, has continued to refer to the fact that there's this category of misconduct that has always been treated differently, and we do not see why it shouldn't be applied here. However, we believe that, given the importance of Farr in this case to the state's case that we meet the reasonable probability standard, or whatever the - other standard the Court would impose on us.The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court -QUESTION: May I ask you whether the record shows that counsel for Banks and Banks thought Farr was an informant back in 1980?MR. KENDALL: There was repeated effort by trial9Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 counsel to answer that question. At a pre-trial hearing,2 counsel specifically asked the chief investigator, who's3 your informant? And the investigator said, I'm not going4 to tell you. When Mr. Farr was on the stand, both at the5 guilt phase and at the sentencing phase, counsel asked,6 are you working for the state, are you an informant?7 QUESTION: Well, so there was a suspicion of that8 back in `80?910 -111213 were - 1415 was under16 weren't easily available.17 MR. KENDALL: Your - Your Honor, there was - it18 was very difficult for us to obtain this proof. We - we19 had every right to belief the - given the fact that the20 prosecutors had said, Mr. Farr has been truthful with you21 in every way, that whoever the informant was in this case,22 it was not Robert Farr.23 We only began to think differently about this24 when we finally got access to another of the critical25 state witnesses, Charles Cook, who told us in 1992 that10Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. KENDALL: And I think after trial, given theQUESTION: But then 16 years went by.MR. KENDALL: Yes, Your Honor, because thereQUESTION: And - and this wasn't evidence that lock and key. There were witnesses. They just￼1 some of his testimony was not truthful.2 QUESTION: Suppose we find that the - or - or3 conclude that the defense counsel was not as diligent as4 it ought to have been on this point. Is that somehow5 excused by the prosecution's failure to present the Brady6 material?7 MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, we think that we acted8 reasonably and diligently in post-conviction. We were9 misled by the state, and in fact, we used that state10 habeas-wefiledin-in-in1992theclaimon11 information belief Farr was an informant in this12 QUESTION: Well, it's - there's perhaps13 difference in being misled and simply a - a case14 the prosecution does not come forward with Brady15 There - they may be some distinction in the two.16 the standard that you would have us apply in this case to17 rule for you with reference - if - if we base that ruling18 on the prosecution's failure? Is it just a standard19 Brady?20 MR. KENDALL: That would be under Strickler. Ourcase.a slight in which material.￼21 view is that because of the misrepresentations in22 case, we were - we were allowed to rely on those23 misrepresentations. We wanted to litigate Farr's24 informant status in the state habeas proceedings,25 couldn't get the evidence to prove that.11Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

KENDALL: Were that Farr had - had - had denied that he was a paid informant. He was a paid informant, and the prosecutors in their closing arguments told the jury that he had been completely -QUESTION: Okay.MR. KENDALL: - truthful in every way with you. QUESTION: Had they also not given, or - orbefore trial had they not also said, we'll give you everything in the file?MR. KENDALL: They said, you don't have to file a discovery motion, we will disclose to you material that is discoverable, and this clearly was discoverable material -QUESTION: Okay.QUESTION: - when they put him on the witness - QUESTION: But they didn't - the defendant didn'task to discover anything. The prosecutor said, you know, everything is available to you.MR. KENDALL: He -QUESTION: What did - what - what did he ask for? What did defendant ask for?MR. KENDALL: He filed a standard discovery motion, but the - the Government long before that said,12Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you don't have to file a motion, we'll provide material that's discoverable to you. And there's no argument - the - the state has tried to say that it, even by calling an informant, it does not have to reveal -QUESTION: Did - did -MR. KENDALL: - that status.QUESTION: - did - did the defendant get anythingafter the prosecutor said, you don't have to file any formal motion, we'll give you everything you're entitled to?MR. KENDALL: It - the prosecution revealed prior convictions on its witnesses. It did not disclose Mr. Farr's informant status or arrangement. It did not disclose with regard to Charles Cook.QUESTION: Were there documents -QUESTION: Okay, but -QUESTION: Were there documents or arrest reportsto show Farr's informant status, or was this just a - a - a circumstance where the prosecution should have said orally that this is his status?MR. KENDALL: When we finally obtained what was represented to us to be the full prosecution file in this case, there was not one notation in there with regard to Mr. Farr, identifying him as an informant. They were obliged to -13Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

KENDALL: That's correct. They -QUESTION: You're complaining that the - that - that a statement was not made by the prosecution?MR. KENDALL: That - that we believe the law required them, once they decided to put this informant on the stand, to disclose that factor to the defense.QUESTION: Because it was Brady material? MR. KENDALL: Because it was Brady material. QUESTION: All right. Now, may I go back toJustice Ginsburg's question? You - you - you gave us some examples of - of material that was turned over to you under this policy in - in which it was not necessary to file a motion. Was that material turned over you in response - to you in response to a specific request from you, or did they simply come up with this and say, this is the material that you could get if you moved for it?MR. KENDALL: It was turned over after a general discovery motion was filed, but that discovery motion was never taken up at a hearing. This was disclosed -QUESTION: All right. Did the general discovery motion refer specifically to what they gave you, or was the motion simply, give us everything we're entitled to?MR. KENDALL: It - I believe it said give us14Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 prior convictions. And -2 QUESTION: Well, then that was what they gave3 you.4 MR. KENDALL: And that's all that they provided,5 that's correct.6 QUESTION: I mean, the problem that I'm - I'm7 havingwiththisis,Ithoughtat-and-andI-I-I8 got into this myself, I realize, but I thought they had9 said, in effect, we'll give you everything you're entitled10 to. Now we're getting down to greater detail, and I think11 the problem is mine, but I want to follow it through.12 They apparently said, you don't have to file a specific13 motion. Justice Ginsburg raises the question, well, what14 did you ask for even though you didn't have to file a15 specific motion?16 You say that you filed a general discovery17 request that specifically did ask for prior convictions.18 They gave you prior convictions. My concern is that the19 understanding between counsel was, we'll give you what you20 ask for, but we are not volunteering by our representation21 to give you anything you don't ask for. If this is22 correct, then the only reason you would be entitled to23 this would be an affirmative Brady obligation, whether you24 ask for it or not.25 Is it the Brady obligation or do you think they15Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425had undertaken something more extensive than Brady required?MR. KENDALL: I think that they assured counsel that whether it was - whether they had to disclose something under state law or under Brady, that there was no need for litigation. They would provide Brady material -QUESTION: But did they assure counsel that counsel would not have to ask for it?MR. KENDALL: The letter - the letter says, you do not have to file a motion, we'll provide you with material that the law requires us to disclose -QUESTION: That the law requires us to disclose? MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor. QUESTION: Material. I - I would take that tomean documents that we have that you're entitled to, and we don't know that there are any documents reflecting - reflecting Farr's informer status, do we?MR. KENDALL: But, Your Honor, it said in lieu of a motion, and so I think it was fair for counsel to include that there needed to be no litigation about discovery -QUESTION: Well -MR. KENDALL: - that the Government understood what state law and Federal law required.16Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

KENDALL: Well, Your Honor -QUESTION: Tell me. Did you ever ask that?MR. KENDALL: I think after these assurances, Ithink counsel -QUESTION: Please answer that question.MR. KENDALL: I'm sorry.QUESTION: Did you ever ask the prosecution whether Farr was an informant?MR. KENDALL: At trial, there's nothing in the record where the prosecution was specifically asked. It's state habeas. We pled a - a claim on information belief that he was a paid informant. That required the government lawyer who was - who was one of the trial prosecutors to respond, we believed, truthfully. He did not respond to that, and that -QUESTION: Now, when was this?MR. KENDALL: That was in state post-conviction proceedings, and the - and he has was required to respond truthfully to that, and under state law that -QUESTION: He didn't respond falsely. He just didn't respond.MR. KENDALL: But under state law that is a no, that is a denial.17Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

KENDALL: But he -QUESTION: A failure to respond is a no, ratherthan - than a yes?MR. KENDALL: Any - any factual allegation of petitionthat is not addressed specifically in the answer is treated as -QUESTION: So as a -MR. KENDALL: - a denial.QUESTION: And - and in addition -QUESTION: It was more than that though, wasn'tit? It-they-in-infact,thestateputitina general denial. It denied each and every allegation of the complaint, including the allegation that Farr was an informer.MR. KENDALL: Well, it's clear that when you read their answer that the state had denied our allegation that Mr. Farr was a paid informant in this case.QUESTION: And they had in effect at trial in the jury argument vouched for his truth, as I understand it.MR. KENDALL: On - on both at the guilt innocence phase and at the punishment phase.QUESTION: Yeah.QUESTION: That - that's the most shocking thing. Do - do we know that - that counsel who allowed Farr to18Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425lie on the stand, and indeed went on to argue to the jury about Farr's testimony, do we know that counsel knew that that was a lie?MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, there aren't -QUESTION: I mean, you - well, you can argue it was his responsibility, you know, but I'm not talking about whether it was his responsibility.MR. KENDALL: Mr. Elliott gave an affidavit in state post-conviction that said that he was aware of all the facts pursuant to the investigation and the presentation of evidence in this case. I would think that, given Farr's important status in this case, there's no doubt that he knew. At the Federal evidentiary hearing, he did not in any way try to say that he did not know that Farr's - was - had this informant status until much later at the trial.QUESTION: In 19 -QUESTION: This is a bit of an aside, but do you know whether any disciplinary proceedings were ever brought against the prosecutors?MR. KENDALL: There have been absolutely no disciplinary proceedings whatsoever.QUESTION: Can I ask you about -QUESTION: But there's a - a number - you have BanksandItakeit-tell-youwanttotalktousabout19Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Cooksey in the - in - in the sentencing phase.2 MR. KENDALL: Let - let me - we - let me go to3 the Cook claim if I could. There was another very4 troubling due process claim raised in this case, and that5 was at the key guilt phase witness. Mr. Cook had6 testified pursuant to a deal and that the state had7 withheld impeachment material on him. Three months before8 the evidentiary in the hearing in this case, we received9 for the first time a lengthy pre-trial statement that had10 all kinds of impeachment material in that and that showed11 beyond any doubt that Mr. Cook had lied in his testimony12 before the jury that he had not in any way, shape, or form13 rehearsed his testimony with the state.14 From the time of that disclosure until the15 evidentiary hearing, it was clear that this transcript16 would serve as evidence for us to prove up our claim that17 the state had suppressed material, impeachment material,18 on Mr. Cook. And Mr. Elliott, the trial prosecutor -19 QUESTION: What - what did Cook testify to that20 was - that was essential to the - to the sentence?21 MR. KENDALL: This was the - the key guilt phase22 witness, Your Honor. He was the - the entire narrative of23 the crime in the -24 QUESTION: Yeah, but you're - you're - you're not25 asking for the guilt to be - to be overturned. You're20Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 asking for the sentence to be.2 MR. KENDALL: With regard to the - Mr. Farr,3 we're asking only for sentence relief. With regard to4 Cook, we're saying he was the crucial guilt phase witness.5 QUESTION: So you're asking for reversal of the6 conviction on the basis of Cook?789 essential1011 - the prosecutor in his opening statement told the jury,12 Mr. Cook is our critical witness, you have to believe him13 for us to win this case. He said that over and over14 again. Cook presented the confession -15 QUESTION: Well, he testified that the defendant16 confessed to him several times, didn't he?17 MR. KENDALL: He - he was the only person who18 provided information that Mr. Banks had confessed. He was19 the only person that tied Mr. Cook to - Mr. Banks to any20 other evidence in this case. The trial prosecutor21 portrayed him accurately. He was the critical witness for22 the Government at the - at the guilt phase of trial.23 QUESTION: And - and what do you say the state24 withheld with regard to Cook? That it had gone over his25 testimony in - in advance?21Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. KENDALL: That's correct, Your Honor. QUESTION: Okay. What - now, what - what wasto the conviction that - that he testified to? MR.

KENDALL: Well, what he was asked, the first question on cross-examination was, who have you talked to about your testimony? He said nobody. He said, you haven't talked to any about this case? I haven't spoken to anybody. That was a bald-faced lie.QUESTION: Well, it's on its face incredible anyway. You think the jury believed it?MR. KENDALL: Well, Your Honor, the -QUESTION: They think the prosecutors can just put him on without even asking him what he was going to testify about?MR. KENDALL: Well, they certainly would - they certainly would have believed that if the Government would have disclosed this transcript that showed that three days before trial Mr. Cook had a very difficult time keeping his narrative about this crime straight.QUESTION: How - how does that work? When this occurs and - and this - these questions are set forth in footnote 4 of your brief - when this occurs, does a Brady obligation arise at that point?MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, I think that -QUESTION: I'm the - I'm the prosecutor, I'm sitting there, I hear this guy say that he's never talked tomeandIknowthathehasandIknowthatIhave71or 74 pages of notes. Do I now have a Brady obligation?22Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KENDALL: Your Honor, for decades the Court2 has said that when a government witness lies, the3 government attorney has the obligation to correct that.4 The Brady obligation continues, it's pre-trial and it's5 during trial. It can arise during trial depending on - on6 what the government witness says, and it's clear that7 after Cook gave that answer, that the Government was8 obligated, one, to have him correct his testimony, but9 certainly not, after he'd given that testimony, to get up10 in front of the jury and say, Mr. Cook was completely11 truthful.12 QUESTION: But my question is, is there a Brady13 obligation?14 MR. KENDALL: There is a Brady obligation,15 absolutely.16 QUESTION: Well, now, is your point - your point17 is more than just that he said it, he didn't admit that he18 had talked to other people before trial, is it?19 MR. KENDALL: No, no, no, because it - it was20 clear that what the defense was trying to show was that21 Mr. Cook should not be believed because he's really been22 worked over by the prosecutors to get his story together.23 And that's exactly what the transcript that wasn't24 disclosed demonstrated. He was mocked during this pre-25 trial statement by the prosecutors who were preparing him23Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 because he was making so many mistakes and getting things2 all out of order.3 They didn't believe he was a credible witness4 three or four days before trial, and the only reason that5 he was, or might have appeared credible, was because of6 this session. This was classic impeachment material. The7 Government had this in their briefcase at trial. They -8 they disclosed the - the brief statement that Mr. Cook had9 given four minutes before but not this one.10 QUESTION: But you lost on this point in the - in11 the Federal court?12 MR. KENDALL: Unfortunately, Justice Ginsburg, we13 did not lose on it. The district court did not adjudicate14 that claim.15 QUESTION: But your time - your - your light's16 flashing, and I - when you come back, I'd appreciate your17 asking - answering one factual question I have on this.18 In 1996, you're in Federal court with five witnesses about19 Farr being a - an informant. In 1992, you say you learned20 from Cook information that led you to think you'd find21 those witnesses. In 1992 and `93, you are in state22 habeas. Why did you not either engage in that kind of23 discovery in state habeas or find those witnesses for the24 state habeas court?25 MR. KENDALL: Because we - efforts were made, we24Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 could not find Farr. But we - efforts were made, and we2 could not find Farr, but we went right to the horse's3 mouth. James Elliott, the prosecutor in this case, knew4 that he was a paid informant. When we raised that claim5 in our petition, he had an obligation then to - to tell us6 honestly was he an informant or was he not, and he did not7 doso.8 We wanted to litigate his status, Farr's status9 in the state court. We were prevented from doing so10 because of the lack of candor and the lack of discovery11 from the prosecutor. He could have made this very simple12 and said, yes he's the guy, let's litigate this in state13 court. He didn't do so.14 Let me turn briefly to the ineffective15 assistance claim. The district court granted relief on16 that claim after hearing information that this Court has17 said time and again is relevant to the capital sentencing18 process. The Fifth Circuit overturned that grant of19 relief by making a - two legal mistakes. First, unlike20 the district court, and - and not following the decisions21 from this Court, the - the Court vulcanized its review of22 our mitigating evidence instead of looking at it in its23 entirety and weighing that against the aggravation.24 It broke this evidence up into three categories25 and said, looking at each one, weighing these on the25Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

BUNN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please19 the Court:20 From 1983 to 1996, Banks filed three separate21 state habeas applications raising numerous claims, but22 Banks failed to diligently pursue his current Brady and23 Strickland claims during these state proceedings. He24 elected instead to expend his efforts pursuing other25 claims. It wasn't until Federal habeas proceedings that 30Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 he turned his efforts to developing the instant claims.2 QUESTION: Did - did the state deny in one of3 these habeas applications, deny that Farr was an4 informant?5 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, the state never denied6 it. It did fill -7 QUESTION: Well, now wait a minute -8 QUESTION: Then explain to me what was -9 QUESTION: - in - in - in the state habeas10 proceeding, the state submitted a response to the11 petitioner's petition and denied all the allegations in12 the petition, which included the assertion that Farr was a13 paid informant and that the state had withheld that14 information from Banks. The state denied that, did it15 not?16 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. It is not our17 interpretation of the record that it did, because this18 single sentence found in a 145-page petition was buried in19 a - basically a laundry list of claims of prosecutorial20 misconduct, at the end of that section containing a great21 number of other allegations, which the state responded to22 specifically by saying, first a number of them had been23 addressed in other sections of the brief, including the24 Swain claim, and another Brady claim that was fully25 developed. And then it responded to the remaining claims31Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425by saying defaulted objection.deny eachthat they were all procedural - procedurally based on the lack of a contemporaneousQUESTION: Ms. Bunn, did not the state say, we and every factual allegation in this complaint? MS. BUNN: Yes. There was a general denial atthe beginning of the - the state's answer to the 145-page brief. However, the context -QUESTION: You better be careful what you deny, don't you think? I mean, each and every would include that, even if it's buried in, you know, if it's buried in a lot of other stuff. I mean, you could have said, you know, everything's so buried we can't tell what's what, but you didn't say that. You said, we deny each and every.MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and it does appearthat -QUESTION: Is it that the case that - do you now concede that Farr was paid something for his information -MS. BUNN: Yes.QUESTION: - by the state.MS. BUNN: Yes. Well, not for information. Hewas paid to assist police in obtaining the murder weapon. QUESTION: Yeah. And did the state prosecutorever disclose that during the trial, even though he said,32Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425no, everything's perfectly truthful here?MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. The state never - QUESTION: He knew - he knew that Farr wastestifying falsely and he - he let that testimony go, and indeed relied on it in his summation to the jury?MS. BUNN: What the trial prosecutor knew - there's nothing in the record to indicate the trial prosecutors actually knew about the money that Bank - that - that Farr was paid several months before the trial in this case by - by police investigators.QUESTION: But isn't he charged with knowledge of what the organization as a whole did?MS. BUNN: In the - in the Brady disclosure context, certainly he is.QUESTION: Wasn't it representative of the police there at the trial the whole time to assist the prosecutor?MS. BUNN: Not that - not that I'm aware of that the police were at the - at - really have testified in the trial. But I believe the rule was invoked in the trial, so he did not sit in on - on Farr's testimony or any of the other state's witnesses' testimony. But -QUESTION: Well, I assume we have to take this case on the - the premise that the state somehow knew that the state had paid the money to Farr, and I guess also had33Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 promised some kind of a break not making certain criminal2 charges?3 MS. BUNN: There is no evidence of any inducement4 of that kind to Farr in this case, no evidence of any kind5 of inducement whether financial or a break in - in any6 convictions for his testimony, contingent upon his7 testimony in this case. That's what distinguishes it from8 cases like Bagley and Giglio.9 QUESTION: But are you saying that because he was10 paid to help get the gun back rather than to testify11 falsely?12 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. That is correct.13 QUESTION: So that he was paid for a critical14 role in the scenario that led to the indictment, rather15 than post-indictment false testimony.16 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. That is correct.17 But again, as far as the cause issue goes, and there is no18 dispute that the claim is procedurally defaulted to - due19 to Banks' failure to develop it in - in the state court.20 The dispute is whether he has established cause, and the -21 the basis - the focus of the inquiry in cause is the22 petitioner's conduct, and in this case, the state record23 makes clear that Banks was aware of this claim and24 actually alleged the claim in the petition itself.25 QUESTION: Well, does the petitioner's awareness34Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that there is a - a claim supersede the prosecution's2 obligation to disclose Brady material, and to disclose the3 fact that one of its own witnesses lied on the stand?4 MS. BUNN: Not that it supersedes the obligation5 under Brady, but it does preclude a finding of cause in a6 case like this where the nondisclosure -7 QUESTION: So the prosecution can lie and conceal8 and the prisoner still has the burden to - to discover the9 evidence? That's your position?10 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, because in a case11 like this, unlike Strickler, unlike Amadeo, this is more12 like - more like McCleskey, where the nondisclosure,13 whether in trial court or in state habeas, did not prevent14 the petitioner from developing the claim.15 QUESTION: But it didn't prevent it absolutely,16 but it made it pretty tough, didn't it? I mean, the -17 sitting there in January, the prosecution has been not -18 been denying nonstop that Farr has been paid anything,19 they're beginning to get some information maybe that isn't20 true. The prosecution is still denying it by denying the21 allegation, and they think they're going to have to find22 somebody who will prove - who will say that, and they23 can't find Farr.24 So what are - what were they supposed to be25 doing? They were looking for witnesses. They couldn't35Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 find Farr. The prosecution isn't telling them the truth2 apparently. And so, what - what is it that they should3 have done?4 MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, this case does not5 present a situation where there is a record developed on6 what efforts Banks expended on this case. There's nothing7 in the record to indicate that Banks' counsel pursued this8 claim, that they sent investigators out to try to find9 Farr. There's absolutely nothing -10 QUESTION: I didn't say that. What I said was, I11 was repeating what he said, that - and when they filed it12 in January - I don't want to repeat it again, you heard13 what he said too - and he said they're just learning from14 Cook some time in 1992 that it might be possible to get15 evidence that would show what the prosecution was saying16 was false.17 So I want your opinion. You say it's quite18 clear that they should have investigated this further.19 Really? Because?20 MS. BUNN: Because they were obviously aware of21 the claim, aware of the potential existence of the claim.22 They requested no investigative assistance regarding the23 claim. They investigated no discovery regarding the24 claim. They - while they - what they did do was expend25 what at that point were pretty extensive resources36Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 pursuing and developing their Swain claim and another2 Brady claim.3 QUESTION: But you want us to say that the - that4 the defendant relies on his peril, at his peril, on the5 representations of the - of prosecution?6 MS. BUNN: At - in - in a case like this where,7 unlike Strickler, where the evidence, the - the8 nondisclosed evidence was not in the sole possession of9 the state. It was discoverable as - as actually10 ultimately have it in habeas, in - in Federal habeas11 proceedings. Banks was able to procure this evidence.12 QUESTION: No, but you are - are - aren't you13 arguing, just as Justice Kennedy suggested, that what they14 should have done in this case is to go to the court and15 say, we want further resources to investigate, and what16 specifically we want to investigate is an issue which, if17 we are correct, the state is affirmatively lying about.18 We want investigative resources to prove that state's19 counsel is lying. Isn't that your position?20 MS. BUNN: Well, yes, Your Honor -21 QUESTION: And for failure to do that -22 MS. BUNN: - that would be -23 QUESTION: - for failure to do that, they're out.24 Isn't that your position?25 MS. BUNN: That is part of our position, that37Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 essentially the absence of that, the absence of a request2 for investigative assistance, the absence of any -3 QUESTION: But, in the - in the - in the face of4 the state's representation. In other words, if - if they5 asked for it, I assume the state would have said, well,6 we've told them that there isn't anything to this. And -7 and - and you would - you're saying that they should have8 pursued it in the face of that for the purpose, among9 other things, of proving that state's counsel was lying to10 them?11 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, they - there was an12 obligation from them to pursue the claim further, yes.13 QUESTION: Why wasn't there an obligation on the14 part of the prosecutor, having deceived the jury and the15 court, to come clean? Why is the burden on the defendant,16 who was subjected to false testimony? Why is - and the17 prosecutor knows it - why isn't it the prosecutor's burden18 to come clean at any stage, rather than let this falsehood19 remain in this record?20 I just don't understand why it becomes the21 defendant's burden when the prosecutor is best situated to22 have the information, was this true or not, did we pay23 this informant or not. Why isn't that a continuing24 obligation on any lawyer who makes a representation that's25 false to a court?38Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first - first it is not - that's not the question. It is the habeas petitioner's burden to allege and prove - provide evidentiary support for his claim.QUESTION: Well, but it is the question if - if Justice Ginsburg is right, that prosecutors have a continuing obligation.MS. BUNN: Well, that obligation is essentially triggered by materiality, so you have that working as well. But that does not - the - the state's continuing obligation does not basically preclude a finding of - of - of no cause in a case like this.QUESTION: Well, if I were a defense counsel, I could think of a - of a - no more damaging material of cross-examination in this case than to show Farr was paid money to come up with the story.MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, that - that was not the - those are not the facts of this case. There's no evidence and - and Farr has not said in post- conviction that he was paid for testimony.￼what -QUESTION: Yeah, that's true, but I - I mean,QUESTION: But I think it's even -QUESTION: - what bothers me about your position is, if we were to say that a defense counsel behaves39Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 unreasonably when he relies upon an explicit statement of2 the prosecutor's, such as I deny the allegation, that's to3 say that the justice system lacks integrity, and indeed it4 might contribute to that lack of integrity to impose this5 kind of obligation and thereby excuse a prosecutor under6 circumstances like this.7 MS. BUNN: But to find cause in a case like this8 would essentially be to hold that a Brady claim can never9 be defaulted because -10 QUESTION: Of course it can. All that it11 requires is that a prosecutor who says, my files are open,12 who says that we do not, in fact, deny that we paid money13 for a related purpose to the witness, all it requires is14 that he be telling the truth.15 MS. BUNN: And I want to focus also on the - on16 the record itself and what Banks - Farr was never asked17 specifically whether he was a police informant, so he18 never denied that allegation. At the guilt innocence19 phase, starting - it - it's in the joint appendix at page20 37 - in the middle of questioning by defense counsel at￼21 the guilt innocence22 and his drug habit,23 have you ever taken24 And he answered no.25 This was a false statement, but not to bephase about his drug - prior drug use he - Farr was asked the question, and any money from some police officers?40Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 construed as necessarily as a denial that he was a police2 informant, particularly given the context of the3 questioning. Later in the guilt innocence, he was asked -4 QUESTION: May I just interrupt with one5 question? But isn't it even more significant that his6 real role in the - in the whole story is that he was the7 person used by the police as an excuse to go up and get8 the gun back two weeks after Banks had left it there,9 whereas the record left the impression that Banks himself10 wanted that gun to commit future robberies, without any11 explanation of the fact that the - that two weeks went by12 without any such request?13 And then when Farr gets in the picture, they go14 up to get the gun, and then Farr says, because Banks15 insisted on it, which is not only false, but improbable16 and terribly prejudicial at the - at the sentencing17 hearing.18 MS. BUNN: Again, though, the - the materiality19 of Farr's - of this nondisclosure has to be - there are20 several factors that have to be assessed in that - in that21 issue. First, the fact that Farr wasn't paid for his22 testimony, and the impeachment value of the informant23 status itself is limited to the mere fact that Farr had24 acted as a police informant in this case and had assisted25 police in obtaining the murder weapon. But that41Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 impeachment did not extend to any inference that Farr had2 testified3 financial4 5favorably for the state because he had anyor any other kind of incentive to do so. QUESTION: What - what -QUESTION: But it - it was diametrically opposed6 to the notion that he wanted to get the gun to commit7 robbery, as whereas the real purpose of the whole venture8 is to get910 undermine11 the punishment phase -12 QUESTION: Banks' intent as revealed in Farr's13 testimony, which is the only evidence in supporting that14 theory that Banks was dangerous for that reason.15 MS. BUNN: The difference is, Farr's testimony16 was - indicated that Banks was - had the intent himself to17 participate in the robberies, and Banks limited that to18 being willing essentially to - to abet Farr in - in19 committing those robberies.20 QUESTION: What - what page of the transcript21 that you - you cited page 37. Is that in the joint22 appendix?23 MS. BUNN: Yes, joint appendix. That's the -24 QUESTION: And that is the - that is the25 confession of - I'm sorry - that - that is the perjury -42Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the gun to give to the police.MS. BUNN: But Farr's subjective intent did not Banks' intent, and Banks actually admitted at￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that's the only perjury that's supposedly -MS. BUNN: That's the - that's one instance thatthey - that - that's the only one dealing with money. What police officers -QUESTION: Of course, this doesn't - this doesn't deal with whether he has - was a police informer. It - it deals with whether the police officers promised you anything.MS. BUNN: Yes, yes, that's correct. And that - the denial of that, of course, is - is not fault, because there's nothing in subsequent testimony to indicate that's - that's untrue.QUESTION: Have you ever taken any money from some police officers? No.MS. BUNN: Yes. That is a false statement. However, it can - it's - it is far afield to interpret that as a denial of being a police informant.QUESTION: Where - where - where is that? Have you ever taken any money from police officers?MS. BUNN: That is at joint appendix 37. QUESTION: It's three lines down from the top. MS. BUNN: In the middle of the questioning about- about Farr's prior drug use, defense counsel asks, and - and have you ever taken any money from some police officers? There is further -43Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Thirty, thirty-seven, my God, reading2 -oh,Igotit,Igotit,okay.3 MS. BUNN: Further, he's asked, what police4 officers did you talk to about this? I have talked to no5 one about6 referring7 8this outside of when they called us downto the case -QUESTION: Yeah. We got it.MS. BUNN: - which again is a false test - is a9 false statement, but does not specifically deny police10 informant status.11 QUESTION: Now, it does seem to me that the12 Cooksey report that the - Ithinkit- theCook-the-13 MS. BUNN: Cook.14 QUESTION: - the witness Cook -15 MS. BUNN: Yes, Charles Cook.16 QUESTION: - that the - that the report of his17 interviews with - with the police was - was very, very18 strong and helpful impeachment material. Do you want to19 comment on - on the claim that relates to his testimony?20 MS. BUNN: Certainly, Your Honor. The lower21 courts did not consider that claim to be properly before22 the court because Banks failed to present it in his23 Federal petition, failed to present it in any amended and24 supplemental position, and the - and there's nothing in25 this - in this record to indicate - that would support a44Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425finding of implied consent, or the trial by consent. QUESTION: Well, you said, I mean, the - the Fifth Circuit didn't think that Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 15(b) applies in habeas, right?MS. BUNN: That was a basis of its holding, yes.That's correct, on debatability.QUESTION: Is - is that absolutely clear?MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it's not, and it -QUESTION: Well, if it's not absolutely clear, then - then it seems to me they should have - they should have granted the - the certificate of appealability.MS. BUNN: The issue actually before the Fifth Circuit, the issue that it resolved, was whether - whether it was debatable - the district court - whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the 59(e) motion, because, in fact, the district court never considered 15(b) because it was never raised to the district court, that - that particular argument. So -QUESTION: Well, that wasn't the basis that the Fifth Circuit relied on. I thought it relied on the basis that there's huge - there's just no question that 15(b) doesn't apply in habeas.MS. BUNN: That was part -QUESTION: And there's a lot of question about that, it seems to me.45Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. That was part of the2 holding. The stated -3 QUESTION: So maybe we should remand at - at4 least on the, you know, on the - on the Cook claim to have5 the - the Fifth Circuit decide whether a COA -6 15(b) question and then decide the Cook claim.78 course on9 concedingdecide theMS. BUNN: I believe that would be anthis issue, and in this - we are notthe debatability of the general applicability of10 15(b) in the habeas context. What we do not find to be -11 what we do not believe to be debatable is the12 applicability in this case, that essentially there's no13 factual predicate for the application of 15(b) in this14 case, given that there's - there's simply nothing in the15 record to show that any party beside Bank himself,16 including the judge - the lower court judges, had any17 inkling that this issue was properly before them.18 QUESTION: But the Fifth Circuit passed on it,19 didn't it? Didn't the Fifth Circuit pass on the question20 of whether 15(b) applied?21 MS. BUNN: The Fifth Circuit, after - after22 noting that what the Fifth - that - that the district23 court's findings regarding the failure to raise the claim,24 the failure to raise it in an amended petition, did hold25 that it was - that it - that 15(b) did not apply in the46Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005appropriate -weare￼1 habeas context.2 QUESTION: There was one position you took in3 your brief and you said that - that the state is not4 obliged to reveal the identity of an informer. That's not5 correct, is it, if the informer is called as a witness?6 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, that is our position7 that essentially a prosecutor's duty to disclose whatever8 information is triggered by the - the potential9 materiality of that information. And particularly in a10 case like this, where the informant is not - was not paid11 for testimony, was not given any sort of break for his12 testimony, that there's no specific inference that can be13 drawn regarding an incentive for testifying favorably for14 the state, that that is not -15 QUESTION: What authority - what authority do you16 have? What case holds that when the Government puts an17 informant on the stand, it does not have to divulge that18 capacity?19 MS. BUNN: There - I know of no such authority20 for that particular proposition, but there's also nothing21 - there's also no opinion from this Court saying that a22 witness' informant status is per se material, which is23 essentially what - what that would -24 QUESTION: Isn't there - isn't there a Texas rule25 of evidence that says, this is 508(c)(1) of the Texas47Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 rules, an informer's identity must be disclosed if he2 appears as a witness for the public entity?3 MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, again, even - even4 assuming a breach of a Federal rule of - state rule of5 evidence, that would not implicate the constitutional due6 process concerns at issue here. And under Brady -7 QUESTION: Well - well, it certainly goes to8 whether or not the defendant is - is entitled to rely on9 what the prosecution's course of conduct is with reference10 to the informer.11 MS. BUNN: But again, there's nothing in this12 trial record to indicate that trial counsel specifically13 requested14 he - that1516 the defense counsel has to say, now, will you comply with17 all of the rules that are in the Texas statutes?that information prior to going to trial, that trial counsel himself didn't pursue -QUESTION: So you say at the outset of the trial￼18 MS. BUNN: Well, there is an obligation from - on19 - upon defense counsel to pursue the remedies he's20 entitled to, and to - to specifically request the21 informant status of any witness, yes, there is an22 obligation in a case such as this. And the fact that23 trial counsel did not do that, at least precludes a -24 QUESTION: Why is there such an obligation if the25 state rules require it? This - we supposed to say we want48Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 to be sure you've complied with all the state rules that2 govern prosecutions?3 MS. BUNN: But even assuming that - that4 violation, that is not - that does not support itself a5 finding of cause to the procedural default of Banks'6 failing to develop this claim for years even though7 knowing of its existence.89 that this 1011 factors - 1213 guns on that.14 (Laughter.)15 MS. BUNN: Several factors play into that issue.16 Again, just - just the pure impeachment value itself was -17 was weakened by the fact that there was no incentive. But18 also the fact that Farr was heavily impeached already and19 that the informant status, weak as it was, was - was20 really merely cumulative. Defense counsel had brought21 out, both on direct and then again on cross, his prior22 drug abuse, track marks, his denials during cross-23 examination, refuted by the defense witnesses, which24 included a denial that he acted as a police informant in -25 in another case for another jurisdiction.49Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Ms. Bunn, do you have any argument might not have made any difference?MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, and again, severalQUESTION: I - I suggest you might train your￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: This isn't - this isn't what the prosecution told the jury, was it?MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. This is - this is from defense counsel. And third, even without Farr's testimony, the significant evidence of Banks' future dangerousness. Banks admitted at punishment that he was willing to abet Farr's commission of future armed robberies by providing him with the weapon. In fact, he was willing to drive.QUESTION: But he did - is - is it correct that but for Farr there would have been no testimony that Banks would participate in those robberies, and there would have been no testimony that Banks and his accomplices would use the gun to eliminate any trouble that might come up during that. Is that correct?MS. BUNN: Yes. That is correct.QUESTION: That's pretty damning testimony, isn'tit?MS. BUNN: It is a piece of - of - of the state's puzzle, but it - but given what is left, not material.And again, the fact that he was -QUESTION: It's not material because it would not have, in effect, raised a serious question about the - the integrity of the result or the fairness of the trial?MS. BUNN: Yes. It would not have put the50Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 state's punishment case in such a different light as to2 undermine 34 defendant5 the state6 this is a7 went rather to the heart of the sentencing question.8 MS. BUNN: It was definitely favorable evidence9 to the state's future dangerousness case, but it was notthe verdict.QUESTION: Well, but don't - didn't you have a here without a prior criminal record, and - and is trying to prove future dangerousness and that really bad actor. I would have thought that10 all that was there.11 QUESTION: Well, you have there as well Mr.12 Jefferson, who said that Banks whacked him or hit him hard13 and happened to omit that he himself, Mr. Jefferson, had14 attacked Mr. Banks' sister, which could be a reason why he15 had hit him.16 MS. BUNN: Well, the - Vetrano Jefferson's17 testimony, though he did amend his version of the incident18 in post-conviction proceedings, he did not recant his19 testimony that Banks hit him across the face with a gun,20 but only that - and not that he had attacked Banks' wife,21 but that he had - that he had had a verbal altercation22 with her. And there was no physical - no physical threat23 whatsoever that Banks responded to by hitting him across24 the face with a gun, and this happened a week prior to the25 murder.51Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 And again, this testimony indicated that Banks2 was known to carry a weapon on a regular basis in the3 weeks before the murder. And the murder itself, the4 unprovoked nature of it, the fact that Banks essentially5 lured a 16-year-old kid to a - an abandoned and secluded6 park near his home and shot him three times to steal his7 car.8 And then - and then the fact that though -9 though Farr's testimony was - was crucial on the limited10 issue of Banks' willingness to participate himself in the11 armed robberies, it still - still the fact that Banks had12 it - and himself admitted - admitted at punishment that he13 was willing to abet Farr's commission of murder and had,14 in fact, been willing to drive what would have been a six-15 hour round trip to Dallas in the middle of the night to16 procure that weapon to - to aid those -17 QUESTION: He didn't admit that - that he was18 willing to abet murder. He just admitted he was willing19 to get the gun for robberies.20 MS. BUNN: Yes.21 QUESTION: Did he say specifically, in order that22 somebody can be killed? He didn't say -23 MS. BUNN: He did - he did testify in - in24 response to cross-examination by the prosecutor that he25 was willing to provide what could potentially be a death52Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 weapon in a robbery case. And in the light of this future2 dangerousness evidence that remains, as well as the3 incremental impeachment value of Farr's informant status4 within the context of the trial, former's informant -5 Farr's informant status wouldn't have put the state's case6 in such a different light as to undermine confidence in -7 in the jury's verdict.8 Again, the state's duty to - to disclose in9 these cases is triggered by the materiality of the10 evidence, and in this case, Farr's import - Farr's11 informant status was not that kind of - of evidence. It12 was not material evidence.13 Unless there are no further questions. Thank14 you.15 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bunn.16 Mr. Kendall, you have two minutes remaining.17 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE H. KENDALL18 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER19 MR. KENDALL: Thank you, Your Honor. Very20 briefly, on the Charles Cook claim, I - Ms. Bunn has21 conceded that jurors of reason would find debatable the22 rule 15 issue. We would ask that if the Court agrees with23 that, that we not go back just to the Fifth Circuit, that24 the case be sent back to the court in Texarkana, the25 district court, for fact-finding on the underlying claim.53Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
