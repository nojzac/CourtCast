KAPLAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. KAPLAN:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          I received word that the Court is interested in46 U.S.C. 801, and I intend to focus my attention on thatbefore I get into my argument.          46-801 is referred to as the Shipping Act, andit was enacted in 1916 and the amendment in 1918.  At thattime, the United States Government was involved in a warand we were interested in developing the merchant marinefor purposes of transporting cargo, equipment, and peopleback and forth.  And so the amendment that was filed wasfashioned after exactly 1 U.S.C. 3, but it had someadditional features involved, one of which was that avessel that was under construction was included as part ofthe act, one of which was if the owner intended to use thevessel for transportation, it was included.  It is underno circumstances affecting a Jones Act claim because theJones Act requires, number one, a vessel in navigation andit can't be on the dock or being under construction, andif it was under construction, it wouldn't have a crew.3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 So under the circumstances, with all due2 respect, it is our judgment that we -- we would win on3 both sides. The Super Scoop would indeed, qualify under4 that act as well as under 1 U.S.C. 3. But we think that5 this goes a little too far and not appropriate.6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is the Super Scoop7 practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?8 MR. KAPLAN: It is more than practically9 capable, it actually is -- actually transports its10 equipment and its personnel at work and its --11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Didn't it come from the west12 -- did it come from the west coast originally?13 MR. KAPLAN: Indeed, it did. It came through14 the west coast, unmanned, however. It came from the west15 coast through the Panama, through the Gulf, up the east16 coast, and, sir, if anything had occurred on that trip, that17 -- that would have been considered a vessel. However, when18 it came in to Boston --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was nobody on it in20 that trip.212223 no one on 24254Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. KAPLAN: Sorry.JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nobody -- there was it --MR. KAPLAN: In fact, it's unmanned.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to be injured.￼12 unmanned, 34 there has5 considered a vessel until this case that we appear here6 now.7 Of course, I'm here to seek to have you overrule8 the decision that was rendered. But more importantly, we9 are having a morass in the lower courts, and I'm here toMR. KAPLAN:  There was nobody injured andyes, indeed.But what -- what I'm saying is historicallynever been a decision in which a dredge was not10 try and persuade this Court to establish, once and for11 all, that there is a standard, that there is a definition12 for the use of the word vessel under the Jones Act.13 Now, in 1920, when the Jones Act was enacted,14 there was no reference to the use of the word vessel, and15 we know that when that happens, we have to seek to find16 what was the meaning, what was the established meaning at17 that time. And the way we do that is to look first to18 statutory law, and in addition we look to case law.19 The statutory law is clear. In 1873 in the20 revised statutes it makes it very clear that section 321 describes a vessel is any watercraft that -- or other22 artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, for23 transportation on water. With that standard in 1873, this24 Court in 1907 tried the case of Ellis v. the United States25 and did apply that revised statute and decided that the5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 dredges that were working in the city of -- in the Boston2 Harbor were indeed vessels and that the --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, that -- that4 definition, used or capable of being used -- right, now.5 After one of the hurricanes, I saw a -- a6 tugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the7 Gulf. What if somebody -- some enterprising person had8 fitted that out like a -- like a diner, you know, a -- a9 restaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're10 serving the meals off of this boat? Now, the boat, apart11 from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland,12 is capable of being -- still capable of being used. Are13 the employees of that diner covered by the Jones Act?14 MR. KAPLAN: Very interesting question, Justice15 Scalia. However, this Court --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it goes to whether we17 want to use, you know, section 3 as -- as our definition.18 MR. KAPLAN: This Court seemed to have focused19 right on point in the cases of Cope in -- Cope was early,20 1903, and in the case of Evansville in 1926 when they21 added the two words, practically capable. The Cope case22 was a dry-dock and it was run into by somebody and they23 sought damages. And the Court -- this Court said, wait a24 minute. In that case, that's a dry-dock. It goes up and25 down. It doesn't navigate. It doesn't transport people6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425or cargo over water.  So they said it's not practicallycapable of fulfilling under the revised statute.          The easiest case is 1926 when this Court againin Evansville made it very clear that a wharf boat, whichon occasion was taken out.  Once a year, I think theevidence is, they would take it out and move it back.  Butit was affixed to the land.  It had its telephone.  It hadits sewage.  It had all connections to the land.  And thisCourt again used 1 U.S.C. 3, but did say that it wasn'tpractically capable of performing.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is that what we would sayabout all these gambling casino boats that are parked onthe side of the Mississippi River?MR. KAPLAN: Your Honor, these are a problematic case, and the whole thing is determined on whether or not it's in navigation. If a vessel is --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's your answer? There are lots of these gambling boats that are parked --MR. KAPLAN: If the --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- along the side of theriver.          MR. KAPLAN:  If the gambling boat has lost itsability to be in navigation, if it's affixed to the land,if it has connections to the land, if it doesn't expect togo into navigation, it is out of navigation.  It's owner7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425has taken that vessel from a navigable vessel into out ofnavigation.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then what is the standardyou use, the definition to use to get to that result?  Isthis your practically point again?          MR. KAPLAN:  Say that again, please.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You've given us the answer.What's the standard that you use to get to that answer?Do you go back to the definition that it -- it cannotpracticably be used?          MR. KAPLAN:  Well, the standard that I'm seekingto have the Court employ is 1 U.S.C., section 3,says, any -- a vessel is any watercraft or otherartificial contrivance used, or capable of beingwhichused --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then -- and thenriverboat -- it depends on how -- how permanently it'saffixed to the land.  Suppose it stays there for 10 years.It -- it can go anytime, but it stays there for 10 years.          MR. KAPLAN:  If in fact it stays there for 10years and it does not move, that's evidence that the ownerintended that vessel to lose its position in navigation.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So there's an intent componentto your test now?          MR. KAPLAN:  There -- there -- technically onecould say break the bonds that hold it to the dock and8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the￼1 then take it out and use it because once a vessel, always2 a vessel? The answer is no. According to this Court,3 this Court said --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kaplan?5 MR. KAPLAN: -- when it's not practically6 capable of doing it.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kaplan, you said two8 things and I -- I'm wondering whether these are separate or9 they're really one concept. I thought your answer was10 going to be to the boat that is used as a diner or to the11 casino that's tied up to the land, that it's not in12 navigation. It may satisfy the 1 U.S.C. definition of13 vessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by14 the Jones15 something1617 not qualify if it's removed from navigation. Once the18 vessel is19 situation20 used as a21taken out of navigation, as in Justice Scalia's where that vessel is on the land, it is being completely different --JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say it is a vessel. IAct. So I thought that's what you would -- that's taken out of navigation would not qualify. MR. KAPLAN: The answer is no. It -- it does22 thought your answer before was that it was not a vessel23 because it's not practically capable of being used.24 MR. KAPLAN: I say it's not a vessel. It's out25 of navigation.9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I like Justice Ginsburg'sanswer better.(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: It is a vessel but it's not in navigation. Then you could stick with the -- with the section 3 definition. It's capable of being used, so it's a vessel, but --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then the question iswhether or not it's in navigation at the time of theaccident.MR. KAPLAN: And that only applies --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and that is a rulethat, I take it, you do not wish us to adopt, or maybe youdo.          MR. KAPLAN:  I'm trying to establish that ifit's in navigation, then it is a vessel.  If the owner ofthat vessel removed it from any chance of navigation, madeit a different kind of a vessel, it is no longer innavigation.  It remains a vessel, but it's not a vessel innavigation.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but doesn't -- doesn't thatput you right back in the problem, the original problem,with -- with the riverboat?  If all it is is tied up, itisn't permanently taken out of navigation.  It isn'tprecluded.  All they've got to do is cast the lines off10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 and it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the2 vessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.3 MR. KAPLAN: Justice Souter, if on that4 situation where all they have to do is cast the lines off5 and go out to sea, then of course it remains a vessel, and6 it remains in navigation. And it is -- it fits all the7 elements of the requirements. But if that --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying -- and I -- I9 don't mean to disagree with you. You're saying, yes,10 there are going to be a few tough results under this11 definition.12 MR. KAPLAN: There may be, but there's got to be13 some practically capable influence that this Court has14 already focused on to say whether that particular vessel15 is practically capable of being in navigation. If it's16 out of navigation, it's never going to be back in17 navigation, and there's nothing more that's going to18 happen to that as a vessel, then of course it's no longer19 a vessel that would qualify.20 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what is -- I see the21 First Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question22 you're raising, which is I think difficult.23 MR. KAPLAN: Yes.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it seems to me fine,25 let section 3 apply. No problem so far with me. But that11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 is so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my2 garage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's3 capable of being used in navigation, if worst came to4 worst. And now you're trying to narrow it to get out of5 that absurd result. Well, so did the First Circuit.6 That's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up7 in it.8 But that's -- so -- so what -- that's why I9 think we're struggling with the words, and -- and perhaps10 practically -- if you mean by practically that it is not11 practically capable of navigation, even though it really12 is, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long,13 long time and has connections to the land like Jimmy's14 Harborside probably or -- or --15 MR. KAPLAN: Like the establishments from the --16 JUSTICE BREYER: What?17 MR. KAPLAN: -- pier 4, yes.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, or one like that.19 But is -- are those the words? Do we need some20 other words as well? We say practically capable but21 practically capable has a technical meaning here that it22 means if there's a close to permanent connection to the23 land, it doesn't apply?24 MR. KAPLAN: Justice Breyer, we're talking25 primarily of Jones Act.12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.MR. KAPLAN: Jones Act requires a relationship between the worker and the vessel. So --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So could we say -- could we saythat, as well, it must be unlike my garage door?  A, itmust be a -- a structure that normally would have a crewor that -- a significant amount of the time.  We wouldhave a connection to the water.  It would be capable ofhaving a master or crew.  What about that?MR. KAPLAN: This Court has already established --          MR. KAPLAN:  -- what the standards are for JonesAct, whether a person qualifies.  There are filtersbetween whether a person is a Jones Act seaman or not.For example, there has to be a vessel.  There has to be avessel in navigation.  There has to be a economicrelationship between the worker and his vessel and he hasto contribute towards the mission or to the function ofthat vessel.  He has to, more importantly, have a     substantial relationship to his vessel,     to duration and with respect to nature.               JUSTICE SOUTER:  When you say     the vessel, do you mean the function of     transportation function?               MR. KAPLAN:  Yes.13Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOboth with respectthe function ofthe vessel in itsWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that would be the answer tothe riverboat problem.  You'd say sure, if the -- if theriverboat is capable simply of being let go in the waterby casting off lines, the riverboat is a vessel.  But youdon't have to worry about turning all the -- the croupiersand the waiters into seamen because they're notcontributing to the transportation function of the vessel.          MR. KAPLAN:  Precisely.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, is that the way out ofthe problem?JUSTICE SCALIA: Precisely? So then the --          MR. KAPLAN:  There is a safeguard between thevessel and whether a person qualifies as a Jones Actseaman on that vessel.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- you think that theperson who operates the dredge, since he's not navigatingthe vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?          MR. KAPLAN:  Oh, I do not.  I do not, indeed.  Isay --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You do not what?  Do not thinkhe's covered by the Jones Act?MR. KAPLAN: I say he's covered by the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  He is covered.  Well, then whyisn't the croupier covered?MR. KAPLAN: Why isn't what? 14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't the croupier covered,you know?          MR. KAPLAN:  Is the croupier contributing to thefunction of the vessel?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That vessel's function isgambling.  He sure is.          MR. KAPLAN:  It is.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does -- look, does the -- doesthe person in charge of the dredge control this process ofpulling against anchor lines that moves it 8 feet orwhatever it is?MR. KAPLAN: The manner in which the dredge -- this dredge worked -- by the way --yes or noJUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but if you can give me aanswer, give me a yes or no answer.MR. KAPLAN:  Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. KAPLAN: That man controls not only --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that's why he's differentfrom the croupier then, isn't he?          MR. KAPLAN:  The croupier does not controlthe motion.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right, and the -- the guy incharge of the dredge does control the movement of it.MR. KAPLAN: Absolutely. 15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if you have a very     complicated dredge and it takes two people?  One of them     does nothing but -- but operate the steam shovel that     pulls up the goop and puts it in the -- in the barges.     Okay?  And the other one moves the dredge.  You say the     one is -- is covered by the Jones Act and the other one     isn't?  No, it can't be.  If the function of the vessel is     dredging, anybody who is performing that function of     dredging is covered by the Jones Act.  Don't you believe     that?               MR. KAPLAN:  I do believe that.JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you do. So the croupier is --(Laughter.)               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then what do you -- then what     do you do with the croupier?  You can't have it both ways.               MR. KAPLAN:  Well, if the croupier is     participating in the navigation of the vessel, we don't     care anymore.               JUSTICE SOUTER:  He's not participating in the     navigation of the vessel.MR. KAPLAN: Well --               JUSTICE SOUTER:  He's doing whatever croupiers     do.  I don't know.(Laughter.)16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼123 tell you. 45 really is6 whether or not there is a vessel, and I'm suggesting that7 1 U.S.C. clearly describes what a vessel is and should be8 for Jones Act purposes.9 The second part of the issue is whether or not10 the individual qualifies and is warranted to have the11 Jones Act coverage. So as to the vessel -- as to this12 coverage, we know, through Wilander and through Chandris,13 this Court has established some very sensible and good14 standards by which a person can or cannot be a -- a Jones15 Act seaman.16 Now the only thing that's necessary is we have17 to round the circle up to determine what is a vessel forJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --MR. KAPLAN: They don't hand me any money, I'llWhat I'm trying to establish here is that therea distinction between the law applicable to18 Jones Act 1920 case this21 This vessel is -- carries -- it has a 1290 ton itself and22 it carries cargo of 466 ton. It is -- it has navigation23 lights. It has to be ballasted. It has to be load-lined.24 When it goes to work, the way in which it moves is aspurposes.  1 U.S.C. seems to satisfy it.It's important to note that in this particularis a Coast Guard-certified, inspected vessel.25 follows. The tugs take the anchors out 50 feet. Now, as 17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the operator is using that bucket to dump into the scows,2 he's also handling the -- the vessel is also moving3 through its own deck winches. They spool up on their own4 winches. So in addition to where he's digging, they're5 also moving so that instead of just digging a hole,6 they're digging the trench.7 So under all the circumstances, this Super8 Scoop, because it has a crew, a captain and a crew of 10,9 because they have to wear lifesaving devices, because they10 have a -- a standby vessel for safety purposes right there11 by order of the Coast Guard, because it is exposed to all12 the weather and navigation problems that exist in the --13 in Boston Harbor, because the risks are inherent in this14 kind of work, this man qualifies as not only a vessel but15 as a Jones Act seaman.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the scow a vessel too?17 MR. KAPLAN: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The scow. The --19 MR. KAPLAN: Oh, the scow.20 MR. KAPLAN: Well, what happened in this one, if21 Your Honor pleases, is when -- this was a collision at sea.22 Client was aboard the scow when it collided with the Super23 Scoop and he was tossed down a 10-foot --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know the circumstances of25 the accident. And you're -- you're discussing whether18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Super Scoop was a vessel. I'm asking if the scow where2 the injury occurred is a vessel.3 MR. KAPLAN: Oh, indeed. The scow is -- is what4 they put the fill in, and as differentiated from a barge,5 a scow has the ability to open up its bottom to let all6 the fill out when they get out to sea.7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you haven't told us8 whether you think it was a vessel or not.9 MR. KAPLAN: Pardon?10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Was -- was it a vessel?11 MR. KAPLAN: The scow is a vessel.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: The scow was.13 MR. KAPLAN: The scow is absolutely a vessel.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, that's not even close.15 MR. KAPLAN: Not even --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it carries all this17 goop somewhere else to -- to dump it. Right?1819 somewhere 20212223 that counts. If it's a vessel and it is in fact the place24 where he was injured and it was moving, it -- that would25 be an easy case, but somehow you have to deal with theMR.

KAPLAN:  Well, the Super Scoop was notmoving at that moment, but the scow was moving --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't you just saythe scow was a vessel?  End of case.  The scow was avessel.  It was moving.  That's where he was injured.          MR. KAPLAN:  I would take that, Your Honor, butI would like to extend it to get a status -- a statementfrom this Court so that we can remove the indecisions, thesilly tests that the lower courts have been creating forwhat is a vessel and what is not a vessel.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Kaplan.  Thankyou.  Your time is up.          MR. KAPLAN:  Oh, my.  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Blatt.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,        AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and mayit please the Court:               Justice Ginsburg, I take it     scow was not relied on is because the     99.9 percent of his time on the Super     never made the argument that he had ascow.20Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOthe reason that thepetitioner workedScoop and petitionerconnection to theWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But this case, the dredge, the Super Scoop, wasa vessel in navigation and it's an easy case under bothstandards because it remained in service as a means ofcarrying its workers and equipment as it moved along theBoston Harbor.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think we need to use the word practical or practically in section 3?MS. BLATT: Yes. I mean, you've -- you've read it in into Evansville and Cope, the -- the dry-dock case, but it's -- it's basically referring to any mobile watercraft that is practically capable of moving either cargo or people.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that reading anything in? I mean, do -- do you think if -- if you were not practically capable, you would be capable?MS. BLATT: I don't -- I don't think it much --JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't regard that as a reading in at all. I mean, capable means capable. You're either capable or not. If you practically can't be moved, your're not capable.MS. BLATT: That's fine, and I think -- like I said, this is an easy case. If I could address some of the -- the --JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why is this an easy case? Because, after all, the First Circuit is struggling21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 with the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use2 section 3. That's fine. But you know that the garage3 door is not a vessel, and you also know that Jimmy's4 Harborside is not a vessel. And you also know that5 Justice Scalia's beached scow or something is not a6 vessel. And I take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied7 up for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and8 one day they take it out to sea and -- because they want9 to move it across the harbor. I guess that10 vessel. Is it? Or maybe it is. So why is11 Because the First Circuit --12 MS. BLATT: Justice Breyer, the --13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- tries to make14 distinctions.isn't athis so easy?those15 MS. BLATT: Right. The -- I respectfully16 disagree. The First Circuit was way off base. It did not17 use section 3 of title 1.18 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's say it's19 wrong about that.20212223 there. 2425 to me, we22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MS. BLATT:  What it did is it --JUSTICE BREYER:  Now let's take section 3.MS. BLATT:  Okay, let's --  okay, let's go fromJUSTICE BREYER:  And taking section 3, it seemshave the same problems.￼1 MS. BLATT: Let me -- let me answer your2 question.3 JUSTICE BREYER: And I'd like to know your4 answer and you just said to Scalia what I thought --5 Justice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't6 because I thought that word practical, as co-counsel7 recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get8 rid of a lot of these. Now you're saying no, it doesn't.9 MS. BLATT: I think the -- the -- you look at10 the physical characteristics and the surrounding11 circumstances of any type of watercraft, and if it's out12 there moving, I -- I think that really is an easy case.13 What I think is bothering -- what was bothering the First14 Circuit is that this vessel clearly had a stationary15 purpose. It had two essential and indispensable purposes,16 one of17 barge.1819 U.S.C.20 vessel. The Coast Guard regulates them as vessels, but if21 they have no function to transport people or things -- and22 the best example is our country's battleships. They're23 basically retired vessels. They're museums. And there24 are some casino boats that function the same way. They25 have no transportation function. They've been withdrawn23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005which was stationary and one of which was a mobile   The types of cases that raise problems under 13 is you have things that meet the definition of￼1 from navigation.2 If you want a legal standard for what in3 navigation is it's this. It's what the Court said in4 Chandris, which is it's the status of the ship, and that5 means does it have some -- is it still servicing as a6 ship.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that goes to in8 navigation --9 MS. BLATT: That's correct.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not to whether it's a vessel11 or not. It is still a vessel even if it's beached up on12 land so long as it is capable of -- of floating. It's13 just not in navigation, isn't it?14 MS. BLATT: I agree. The only types of cases15 where a vessel would lose its status as a vessel if it's16 been basically -- there -- there are basically two kinds17 of cases where the casino boats or the museums or hotels18 have lost their status. And there are basically -- there19 are two examples. They're boats in a moat. They've been20 basically landlocked in through concrete or landfilled and21 they can't go anywhere. And the other one that's --22 that's equally as common is pipes and stuff have been23 driven through the hull of the ship, and they're not24 practically capable of transporting anything. They'd have25 to be overhauled.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Your -- your view of the word2 in navigation does all the work here. And so a -- a3 concert ship, which exists, which say is docked at a dock4 for, let's say, 300 days of the year or maybe 360, and5 those other 5 days they -- they move it from one town to6 the next town where it stays for another 4 months, that is7 in navigation or not?89 have a --MS. BLATT:  We think it's in navigation.  If you10 11 1213 -- the --14 covered by the Jones Act even though, by the way, none of15 them has ever moved whatsoever.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then --MS. BLATT: If it's --JUSTICE BREYER: -- the concert master and the all the orchestra players and everyone else are16 MS. BLATT: No, no. That's not correct. It17 just means it might be a vessel in navigation. You have18 cruise ships, military ships, pleasure crafts that sit all19 the time, some for years, but they're still ready for20 another voyage when and if they're needed. Those are21 still in navigation. Now, if you have --22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's so, that's --23 MS. BLATT: I'm going to answer your question on24 the seaman. If you've got a worker that never goes to sea25 on a vessel in navigation, the place to deal with that is25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 not by saying it's not a vessel or not that it's not in2 navigation. But this Court emphasized in the Harbor Tug3 and Barge case, as well as the Chandris case, that there4 has to be a substantial connection not only in duration5 but also with respect to nature. And the Court in Harbor6 Tug said that -- that inquiry will concentrate on whether7 the employee's duties take him to sea.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In the case of the steam9 shovel operator on the dredge, do we say that -- that he10 contributes toward that function because it can't move11 unless he dredges first, so that the -- the whole object12 of moving across the harbor to dredge includes the -- the13 dredging part?14 15 1617 McDermott18 need not aid in the navigation of19 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's20 MS. BLATT: Bartenders,21 et cetera on cruise ships are all22 holding of McDermott v. Wilander.23 Now, there's still a separate question ofMS. BLATT:  No.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that the way we do it?MS. BLATT:  There's -- there's a decision inv.

BLATT: Well, I just said that they may not be covered, but they --JUSTICE BREYER: Because?MS. BLATT: They may not be covered --JUSTICE BREYER: Because?MS. BLATT: They may not be covered if they failthe last requirement --JUSTICE BREYER: But it says --          MS. BLATT:  -- of Chandris.JUSTICE BREYER: -- in terms of both its duration and its nature, i.e., a connection to a vessel --          MS. BLATT:  Vessel in navigation.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in navigation.27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. BLATT: Right, and I -- Harbor Tug v. Barge,2 which is a later opinion, explains that that test will3 look at whether the employee's duties take him or her to4 sea.5 Now, in this case the dredges operate not only6 -- only on the water, but they're out there usually away7 from shore and are engaged in regular movement over8 navigable waters. And the workers on that dredge, such as9 petitioner, are subject to the traditional perils of10 navigation which include not only collision with ships,11 but even capsizing.12 Barges such as dredges are particularly13 susceptible to capsizing because their distance between14 the deck of the barge and the water, which is known as the15 freeboard, is low. In this case it was only 5 feet, and16 they have a high center of gravity because of those17 derricks or cranes that are holding the bucket ship. And18 if it's operating in poor weather or for some reason it's19 overloaded, they can tip over and you have a marine20 incident or even casualties. And this worker was exposed21 to the perils of navigation like other traditional seamen.22 And this Court -- we think it's pretty telling23 that the Court basically in two decisions has resolved24 this case. You have already used 1 U.S.C. 3 in the Norton25 case in defining what is a vessel for purposes of the28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 seamen exclusion in the Longshore Act. And then in the2 Ellis decision, this Court has already held that a dredge,3 including the scows that were accompanying that dredge,4 were vessels for purposes of 1 U.S.C. 3 and that the5 workers were seamen and that they were basically called6 upon to perform the duties, more or less, of ordinary7 seamen. And every other court that had looked at the8 issue and passed on it had equally held that9 vessels for a variety of maritime purposes.10 seamen's liens, limitation of liability, and11 overtime -- overtime laws in the Ellis case.12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Blatt, the -- there was a13 brief filed by Signal I think that argues that a Jones Act14 vessel has to provide food, care and lodging to be15 covered.16 MS. BLATT: Right. With due respect to the17 author, I think that approach is novel, it's radical, and18 it's unsubstantiated. Never has the definition of vessel19 turned on 2021 computing 22whether the watercraft has sleeping quarters.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there problems inmaintenance and cure in a case like this one?MS. BLATT:  It's usually governed by the23 collective bargaining agreement. I think it's something24 like $40 a day, and this petitioner was a union laborer.25 And it's -- it's usually governed --29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005dredges wereThat was-- and the￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it were just left2 up to the law. Are there problems in computing what cure3 and maintenance --4 MS. BLATT: There used to be, but in -- there5 used to be a debate, which I think most of the cases the6 Signal brief is relying on, in how long maintenance and7 cure goes for and it was a rather kind of arcane, tricky8 thing, but basically this Court resolved it in 1930. It9 goes to maximum cure, until the seamen can no longer be10 cured. And there used to be a debate about should it just11 go to the extent of the wage contract or to some longer12 point, and the Court resolved that.13 But there is no case that has ever even14 discussed the fact that a vessel turns on whether it has15 sleeping quarters. And we think that brief is also16 fatally undermined by the decision in Ellis and all the --17 decision in Ellis already holding that vessels -- or the18 workers were seamen, and there was never been a discussion19 in those dredge cases about whether they had sleeping20 quarters. Several of those cases -- the most oft-cited21 one is that Saylor v. Taylor case out of the Fourth22 Circuit, was a maritime lien case, and those are exactly23 the type of workers that this Court in McDermott said were24 seamen who were intended to be covered under the Jones25 Act.30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          If there are no questions, we would ask that theFirst Circuit's decision be reversed.JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.          Mr. Connelly.        ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK E. CONNELLY, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. CONNELLY: Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          This Court in Chandris and in Harbor Tug statedthat the basic point of trying to be reached is to separate lien-basedemployees from sea-based employees. This Court also stated that was Congress' goal in passing the Jones Act. The Court wrote: the Jones Act remedy is reserved for employees whose work regularly exposes them to the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to the sea in ships are subjected. The First Circuit's ruling is much more likely to get to that result. The goal that this Court stated was Congress' goal then is section -- excuse me -- 1 U.S.C., section 3.          Justice O'Connor, your first question had to dowith the casino boats, and that is a point that I wasgoing to raise.  Those casino boats are traditionalvessels plying the rivers and used mostly in the Midwestand -- and the Great Lakes.  Those States have recently31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425over the last 3 or 4 years changed their law.  The law hadbeen that they had to go up to -- out into navigation.They've now changed them and said, no, you must staydockside.  All they are is tied up dockside.  They can beuntied and moved out at any time.          The cases that -- and you're probably going tohave some before you -- are dealing with dealers andwaiters and waitresses who go aboard the casino boat andmaybe fall down in the kitchen or something and areinjured.  They have never been on the boat while it wasmoved and it hasn't moved for the last several years.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, that might affect thedecision of whether they are seamen covered under theJones Act.  It might still be a vessel.MR. CONNELLY: Well --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there may be other aspects of the test that aren't met --MR. CONNELLY: But breaking it down --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- when the thing is tied up. MR. CONNELLY: Breaking it down, Your Honor, ifthe petitioner has his way, those tests are met.  Thefirst test is whether it's a vessel.  It is a vessel.Second test, whether it's in navigation.  The Governmenthas just told you, and it states in its brief, any vesselthat had any transportation purpose at all that is still32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 not -- unless it's mothballed -- and I think they said2 today either pipes driven through it or in cement -- is a3 vessel in navigation. So it is a vessel in navigation.4 We know that the --5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I think it might be a vessel,6 but probably not in navigation while it's tied up or in7 mothballs.8 MR. CONNELLY: Again, Your Honor,9 tied to the pier. The Government has taken10 as has petitioner, in their briefs and here11 it's still in navigation if it can be used.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think13 Government has said is that though it's in navigation, we14 have a case that says that the -- that the seaman's15 connection to the ship has to be related to the16 functioning of the ship in navigation. He doesn't have to17 navigate it, but he has to be working at what the ship18 does in the course of its navigation, and a dredge19 operator does that.20 MR. CONNELLY: Well, I don't think a dredge21 operator does that any more than the waiter on the casino.22 The dredge operator -- the dredge is there to do23 construction work. It is there to dredge. The casino is24 there to have people gamble and serve them drinks.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't that the33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005all it is isthe position,today thatwhat the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point?  The dredge is there necessarily to move.  Thecasino is not there necessarily to move.MR. CONNELLY: Well, it is our position -- and as shared by some of the First Circuit -- that the movement of the dredge was incidental. Once --JUSTICE BREYER: Should we clarify that? Because I don't -- I didn't read the case saying what Justice Scalia just said or what you -- what it says is that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial -- in terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in navigation.          MR. CONNELLY:  Correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Obviously, a croupier has sucha connection.          MR. CONNELLY:  Correct, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say anything aboutbeing connected to the navigating part.          MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct, and this Courthandled that in Wilander, Your Honor, that it said in --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not to the navigating part butto what the vessel is doing in the course of its being innavigation.          MR. CONNELLY:  If the term,navigation, had the bite that I thinkwe may not be here today at all.  The34Your Honor, init should have, thenFirst Circuit wasWashington, DC 20005Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 actually looking at the actual transportation function,2 assuming that it had to be into navigation. What the --3 what the petitioner wants is 1 U.S.C., section 3 which4 looks at theoretical transportation, a mere capability.5 And Your Honor, I understand what you said,6 Justice Scalia, that to you, they're the same, practical7 capability or capability. But to the petitioner and the8 Government, they are far different. In both of their9 briefs, they have said that without the Evansville change10 in the language of the statute which adds practical11 capability, both have agreed that it is overly inclusive a12 statute, 1 U.S.C., section 3. It includes everything and13 including Justice Breyer's garage door.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as Mr. Kaplan pointed15 out, all -- the fact that something is a vessel doesn't16 mean there's Jones Act coverage, and I think Mr. Kaplan17 was getting to the perils of the sea. Someone18 working on a boat that is not in the water day19 out is never exposed to the perils of the sea.20 MR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, the21 the sea, which this Court discussed at length in the Papai22 case, we -- we say that -- that is further evidence that23 Mr. Stewart is not entitled to Jones Act remedies. Mr.24 Stewart was on a construction site. It happened to be a25 work platform in site of land. He was never more than 50035Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005who'sin and dayperils of￼1 yards off the coast. The dangers that he was up against2 were more akin to that of a construction worker or, at the3 very least, a harbor worker or a stevedore. They were not4 the same perils that are normally faced by a true seaman.5 Now --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One peril was a collision7 with another vessel, and that's exactly what happened8 here.9 MR. CONNELLY: We disagree with that, Your10 Honor. This was a situation where the Super Scoop was --11 was moored. It was anchored and stationary, again as a12 stationary work platform. The scow was just being brought13 from one side to the other alongside -- attached to it at14 all time by -- by cables and by the crane. The -- the --15 he got jostled and he fell. No different16 workers and stevedores face everyday when17 unloading ships and working on harbors.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there19 suppose there had been very rough water --20 MR. CONNELLY: They would have sent everyone21 home.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and -- and the crane23 operator was the -- was operating it and the water came24 over the freeboard and it capsized. That's -- that would25 be the perils of the sea, wouldn't it?36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005than harborthey'rehad been --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

CONNELLY:  Your --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So far.          MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, I think in that -- inthat -- using your hypothetical, it's a constructionplatform right off the coast.  They'd send everyone home.If there was any trouble with the sea, the -- the greatestperils that are discussed in the petitioner's brief -- andthey list them all -- one of them is isolation and faraway from home and far from aid.  Those don't apply to Mr.Stewart.  Mr. Stewart would be sent home if there was toomuch -- the weather got bad.  He would be sent home in a-- in a minute or 2.  He lived right in Boston.  He was in37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the middle of a large city. There was no major danger of2 isolation. That -- the Super Scoop was inspected3 regularly by the State, Federal, and Government officials4 and by the general contractor on the job. There was no5 isolation. All of the perils that have been listed6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and by the Coast7 MR. CONNELLY: The Coast Guard also. I'm8 sure they went out on a regular basis, but they did9 inspect the -- the Super Scoop at -- at some point.by --Guard.not10 There's no question about that.11 This Court --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not contending that13 anything that happens in a harbor is not exposed to the14 perils of the sea, are you?15 MR. CONNELLY: Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor.16 This Court in Cope and earlier cases has long equated a17 vessel with transportation. That's what the First Circuit18 did. They -- they needed a bright line. They chose a19 bright line, and the bright line was transportation. Is20 the structure primarily engaged in transportation or21 commerce? And navigation, transportation, and commerce22 are all intermixed, and -- and the definitions include23 each other. And they found that it was not primarily24 engaged in transportation. It was primarily a work25 platform doing construction.38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do you -- how can you2 possibly describe as a bright line test anything that says3 you have to identify the primary function? Plus, even if4 it's not its primary function, if it happens to be moving5 at the time of the accident, then there's coverage. That6 doesn't seem to me very bright line.7 MR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, what it is, I8 believe, is a bright line test with an exception. And the9 Stewart case talked about the DiGiovanni exception, which10 falls very closely to -- to what Justice Stevens wrote in11 his concurring opinion in the Chandris case, that it is12 unfair that somebody who was actually injured while a -- a13 vessel or -- or structure is in actual navigation does not14 get at least a second bite at the apple and that that15 person cannot be -- said to be a Jones Act seaman.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the identical17 accident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the18 vessel isn't moving.19 MR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, at no time20 during the 1 and a half years that Mr. Stewart was in the21 harbor, as far as we know from the record, was the Super22 Scoop in transportation. The incidental movement of -- of23 pulling forward a few feet with its anchors is not24 navigation or transport -- transportation. The First25 Circuit stated that the movement of the scow was both39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 immaterial because, as the Government has already2 admitted, he wasn't tied to the scow. His -- his time was3 spent on the Super Scoop, but also incidental, Your Honor,4 because it was just slight movement along the site. It5 wasn't transportation or navigation.6 At no point -- and -- and the petitioner has put7 their spin on this that --8 day he was out there moved9 not true. He was never instating that Mr. Stewart everyin and out of coverage.  That'sJones Act coverage.10 And Your Honor --11 JUSTICE SCALIA:12 you if -- if I believed that I had to look to the primary13 purpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was14 transportation. But what -- what do you do about gambling15 ships that, you know, they -- they sail out beyond the 2-16 mile limit and then come right back to where they left?17 Now, people get on board not to get transported. They get18 on board to gamble. And the purpose of the ship, the19 primary purpose of the ship, is gambling. You think that20 -- that -- the -- the seamen who -- who are on that ship,21 which regularly goes out beyond the 2-mile limit, you22 think that they're -- that they're not covered by the23 Jones Act?24 MR. CONNELLY: I think in that situation, Your25 Honor, it's -- it's a closer call, that they --40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005I -- I guess I could agree with￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it's close atall.  I think they're obviously covered by the Jones Act.MR. CONNELLY: That is a traditional trip -- ship and those people are engaged in a form of transport --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but that's not theprimary purpose of -- of the ship, just as the primarypurpose of this scow is -- of -- of this dredge is nottransportation.MR. CONNELLY: In that situation, Your Honor, it would be -- it would be a primary purpose, though, that transporting the people who happen to be gambling --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, a primary purpose?  Now,you're getting a little fuzzy there.  I thought you saidthe primary purpose.MR. CONNELLY: Well, in the First Circuit -- JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be a primary purpose. MR. CONNELLY: Well, in the Manuel court, theFifth Circuit actually uses the term, a primary purpose.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  A.  Oh.MR. CONNELLY: And -- and I think -- and to a degree that --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you think that's not fuzzy.          (Laughter.)          MR. CONNELLY:  It's an -- it's an oxymoron, Your41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Honor.2 But what -- what the First Circuit was doing in3 -- in the Stewart case is -- is similar to what this Court4 did in Chandris. It was looking at a temporal view. A5 worker -- and the temporal view used by this Court in6 Chandris was looking at what the worker was doing. What7 were his duties? He isn't going to be denied Jones Act8 coverage because he happened to be an office worker 29 months before if his duties had changed and he was now a10 Jones Act seaman, nor if he fell in the office, after he11 had been reassigned to the office, was he going to gain12 Jones Act seaman status just because he spent the last 213 years on the vessel.14 That is what the First Circuit has done in terms15 of the vessel as well, not just the work but in terms of16 the vessel. Do not look at what this vessel did in the17 past. Do not look at what it did -- might do in the -- in18 the future. It's transportation from California through19 the Panama Canal up the east coast is immaterial. You20 should look at the worker who is claiming Jones Act21 status, his relationship to the structure and what the22 structure's purpose was and business was during that23 relationship. During the 1 and a half years that he was24 associated with it, it wasn't transporting anything. It25 was used as a -- a work platform only, only a structure,42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 and it wasn't transporting anything during that time.2 The same thing with the casino boats, these3 individuals who go upon the casinos as a waitress and are4 never -- never leave the port, never leave the dock5 shouldn't be entitled to the special protections of the6 Jones Act. They face none of the perils of -- of the sea7 or of -- of perils of -- of navigation.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a difference to this9 extent, would you agree, that something that's just tied10 up to the dock and never moves is different from something11 that is actually in the water and whether you call it12 transportation, it is moving? It has to move to engage in13 the construction of this tunnel.14 MR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, this Court has15 decided, I believe it was in Chandris, that a -- a seaman16 doesn't lose his seaman status just because the vessel17 he's assigned to is now in -- in port. They wanted --18 they didn't want a person to go in and out too many --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm just -- let's focus20 on what is a vessel because someone -- it may be a vessel21 but the injured person may not be a seaman. Those are two22 different things. This is only the first step. So when23 you're bringing in what the worker does, whether it's a24 croupier or whatever, the only question that we are25 considering is, is this dredge a vessel? We're not43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 involved with the question of whether the worker is a2 seaman unless we pass that basic threshold.3 MR. CONNELLY: That's correct, Your Honor, but4 of course, the ultimate issue the Court is trying to5 arrive at is whether or not Mr. Stewart is a Jones Act6 seaman. And this Court has held for him to be a Jones Act7 seaman, it must be a vessel in navigation. I don't think8 that that can be separated, that just looking at a vessel.9 1 U.S.C., section 3, which the petitioner wishes, of10 course, everything -- everything that floats that is11 capable of transportation is -- is a vessel. The First12 Circuit has -- has used a much more narrow definition but13 focusing on the purpose and primary use of the structure14 because it is trying to get to where this Court was trying15 to get. Is it a vessel in navigation?16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it the vessel17 that's the problem? Why -- why do you focus on the18 vessel? It seems to me most of your argument has gone to19 whether it's in navigation. Can you be a vessel that is20 not in navigation?21 MR. CONNELLY: Yes, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you can or you23 wouldn't have the -- the combination of the two terms24 appearing anywhere. So why isn't the problem here not25 whether it's a vessel but whether it's in navigation?44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CONNELLY: Well, again, Your Honor, if -- if2 in navigation means what it should mean, which is an3 instrument for transportation or commerce over navigable4 waters, and not simply as the petitioner and the5 Government want it to mean that anything that once might6 have been in navigable waters and stays in navigable7 waters and isn't mothballed is still in navigation -- if8 it means what it should mean, then that's something I9 think the First Circuit is -- was trying to get to anyway.10 They -- they were looking at it in terms of vessel status,11 vessel in navigation versus just in navigation. They --12 they were trying to get there and that's why they used13 what is really a -- a temporal look and looked at what was14 the business use.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, exactly. And -- and in16 Chandris, this Court rejected the snapshot approach to17 determining what's a vessel and the First Circuit seemed18 to go back to that. And certainly what the First Circuit19 did seems in serious tension with this Court's cases. It20 just didn't follow the same line that we had outlined.21 MR. CONNELLY: The First Circuit does -- the22 First Circuit rule, Your Honor, in DiGiovanni and Fall and23 Stewart does have a snapshot exception.24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.25 MR. CONNELLY: There's the main rule which has a45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 bright line --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right, and that was rejected3 by this Court4 problem here.5 MR.6 are always --7 question earlier as well. There are always going to be8 difficult situations where some people, doing the exact9 same work, using the same equipment on the same structure,10 some are covered and some are not, a situation where one11 has the requisite connection 30 or 40 percent to a vessel,12 the other person doing the same work next to him only has13 10 percent. One is covered.14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it might be15 simpler to rely on 1 U.S. Code, section 3 and our16 definition, as we've described it there, and then17 with other situations within the framework of the18 definition of seaman and the other issues that arise. And19 it seems like the First Circuit went backwards from20 Chandris back to Giovanni which basically had been21 rejected. So that's the concern.22 MR. CONNELLY: Your Honor, again, I -- I think23 that if 1 U.S.C., section 3 is adopted, then every vessel24 capable --25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Congress adopted that.46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005in Chandris.  So I -- I think there's aCONNELLY:  Well, Your Honor, there -- thereand this is answering Justice Ginsburg'smuch-- ourdeal￼1 MR. CONNELLY: Well, I don't -- I don't agree,2 Your Honor. The way -- the way we look at the3 congressional intent -- this Court has already decided in4 -- in several cases that Congress left it to the Court to5 decide which persons are -- should be granted Jones Act6 seaman status. This is what the Court has said. Why then7 would the Congress in -- in the same statutes have sort of8 handcuffed the Court by saying it's for you to decide9 who's a Jones Act seaman and who's entitled to those10 special protections, but we're going to handcuff you and11 -- and say this is what you have to decide as far as12 vessel is concerned?13 1 U.S.C., section 3 was not followed. I should14 also point out that the petitioner is a recent convert to15 this position, and it -- it hasn't been followed in the16 circuits at all. There isn't a lot of cases out there17 where a lot of circuit judges have stated section 3 should18 be the definition for the Jones Act.19 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if you go -- I thought20 vessel -- the word vessel appears in our cases. It21 doesn't appear in the Jones Act. Am I right or not about22 that?2324 Act -- 25MR. CONNELLY:  It does not appear in the JonesJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we have a degree 47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of freedom on this. But -- but the -- the question then2 is, is it -- how -- I'm getting the impression from you3 and -- and from the SG that it's rather deeply embedded in4 the law, if we start reading the Fifth Circuit cases, that5 if we define X as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel6 in navigation, that the cases have said the word in7 navigation mean nothing, with one exception. The8 exception is if you actually have like a physical cemented9 connection to the land so they can't escape. Otherwise,10 if it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to11 sea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning. If it's12 a vessel, it's a vessel in navigation. If it's my garage13 door, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in14 navigation.15 Now, how accurate is that assumption I'm now16 making? What would I read in the law? Is that definition17 of in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really18 embedded in the law?19 MR. CONNELLY: It is pursuant to what -- the20 petitioner and the Government's view.21 JUSTICE BREYER: I know it is but what is your22 view?23 MR. CONNELLY: My view is that it shouldn't be,24 that it should have some bite to it. It should mean, as25 -- as I stated before, an instrument of commerce or48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 transportation over navigable waters. But that's not what2 it has come to mean in a lot of the circuits below. It3 has come to mean something that's just simply in navigable4 waters no matter how many years it has gone without --5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, would it help? Suppose6 we were to say it was -- had to be capable, at least, of7 having a captain and crew?8 MR. CONNELLY: I have never thought of that,9 Your Honor.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Then we better not do anything11 for the first time.12 (Laughter.)13 MR. CONNELLY: Your Honor, I think in that in14 that situation, there are -- there can be vessels involved15 with transportation, getting back to the Cope case and16 other cases, where there -- it's -- it's a barge being17 towed, but it's transporting things. We're not disputing18 that. I don't think it needs to have a captain and crew19 necessarily to be a -- considered a vessel in navigation.20 But you hit the nail on the head, Your Honor,21 and that's -- that's where the First Circuit was befuddled22 in -- in trying to come up with a regional -- reasonable23 test because they're dealing with this situation where it24 seemed like everything is a vessel in navigation. And25 yet, that doesn't serve Congress' intent of only persons49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 who face the perils of the sea are entitled to the special2 protections under the Jones Act.34 appear in5 Act.678 purpose of the vessel inquiry that we're involved in is to9 -- to say10 scheme or11 12is this person within one injury compensationanother.MR. CONNELLY:  Correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now why, in making thatJUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the word vessel doesthe Longshore and Harbor Workers CompensationMR. CONNELLY:  Correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And this is the -- the only13 inquiry, should the courts go off on their own and be14 inventive and come up with a definition when Congress has15 given a definition that can be used by default? If16 Congress thinks it should be other than the general17 definition they have provided, Congress can also do that.18 But in the meantime, why should the courts go creating19 definitions instead of using the one that's right there in20 the statute book?21 MR. CONNELLY: Because this Court effectively22 overruled the definition or decided not to use it in the23 Evansville case. It saw in that case that it would not24 just rely on the section 3 language. It would add the25 word practically, practically capable, and -- and not just50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 capable because the Court saw that in Evansville the2 wharf boat, which they determined was not a vessel, even3 though again not dealing with the Jones Act, it was4 capable of transportation, but it wasn't practically5 capable of transportation. So the --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the Court then --7 MR. CONNELLY: -- the Court has decided --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just construing --9 MR. CONNELLY: -- not to follow section 3.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just construing instead of11 not following, but say by capable, Congress must mean12 practically capable.13 MR. CONNELLY: Your Honor -- and I realize that14 is what Justice Scalia said earlier. The position of the15 petitioner, as he stated as he was standing here not too16 many minutes ago, was that they seek to have the Court17 employ 1 U.S.C., section 3, not the Evansville change to18 that section. They -- they see it as quite different and19 it's in both of their briefs, that Evansville did change 120 U.S.C., section 3. The petitioner's position is that this21 Court is bound by -- to follow 1 U.S.C., section 3 because22 Congress says so.23 It is our position that they're not so bound.24 If you're bound -- if you're not bound, why take a faulty25 definition such as section 3 and try to change it a little51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 bit? You're -- you're free to as -- as you are, to2 determine who is a Jones Act seaman. You're free to3 determine what is a vessel in navigation or a vessel4 pertaining to the -- the Jones Act.5 1 U.S.C., section 3 was never referenced in the6 Longshore Act. Congress at that time, many years before7 and many years after, has passed many statutes in which8 vessel is defined. Sometimes they reference section 3;9 other times they write in a definition. Sometimes it's10 similar to section 3, sometimes quite different. In this11 case -- for the Longshore Act, they decided to leave it to12 the courts.13 The Jones Act was passed in 1920. Its14 predecessor was the Act of 1915. That act did have a15 definition of vessel that was very restrictive and16 actually talked about actual navigation. In 1920, the17 Merchant Marine Act was passed and it -- that portion of18 it had a very large definition, which was already19 discussed earlier, the Shipping Act definition. The Jones20 Act didn't adopt that one and it didn't adopt the one in21 1915.22 The -- the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act was23 passed in 1927. Certainly by that point they knew that24 they had just jettisoned two definitions 7 years before.25 They chose again to leave it to the courts.52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 In 1972 and again in 1984, there were2 considerable amendments that Congress did to the Longshore3 Act. At that time, they certainly knew -- and there's4 always been heavy -- heavy lobbying going on in Congress5 every time that they try to touch the Longshore Act or --6 or the Jones Act. They knew by that point in time that7 the circuits were not using section 3 as the definition8 for Jones Act vessel. Again, they chose to leave it to9 the courts. They did not intercede and then reference10 section 3 or incorporate a definition like it or11 something. They again chose not to.12 In 1920, section 3 was certainly not the only13 definition of vessel. Benedict on Admiralty, which this14 Court has cited several times, which the petitioner has15 cited, had a completely different definition of -- of16 vessel, and that could have been the one that Congress had17 in mind.18 I realize it's always dangerous to mention the19 Congressional Record, but most of the people who spoke in20 1920 and again in -- mainly in 1927 were discussing21 traditional vessels and vessels on a voyage. If they had22 true seamen in mind, they probably had more of a23 traditional vessel in mind.24 Also looking at the record, when the House25 wanted to include everybody, all seamen, into the53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Longshore Act, they listed out various structures such as2 dredges and barges. Obviously, a compromise was reached3 with the Senate, and when the act was passed, they limited4 it, not just seamen and -- and but only to masters and5 members of crews of vessels. They limited it to that and6 left it, of course, to the courts7 entitled to the Jones Act status.8910 different11 stated is12 Longshore13 filed on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Hillsman writes14 that the lower court unanimously -- unanimously -- have15 decided that the definition of vessel for purposes of theIf I may have a second,The term vessel can andmeaning for the Jones Act, which this Court hasa vessel in navigation, than it does with theand Harbor Workers Act.  In his amicus brief16 Longshore17 the Jones1819 collect Longshore benefits only have to show it's a20 maritime nexus. There's no vessel requirement from almost21 all of the claims under the Longshore Act.Act is much, much more inclusive than it is forAct, and it has worked perfectly fine.Under the Longshore Act, most of the persons who22 Another point I wish to make is that both the23 First Circuit and the petitioner talked about a bright24 line test. The First Circuit, though, test is dealing25 with actual transportation, the actual use in business of54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005to decide who isYour Honor.often has had a￼1 the structure during the time that the person who is2 claiming special status is associated with it.3 More confusing is dealing with 1 U.S.C., section4 3, which although bright is also very broad and would5 include everything. Anything that floats or is capable of6 floating would be included under that.7 There are always going to be situations, no8 matter what definition the Court comes up with -- always9 situations where a person would have to be covered under10 both acts, and I realize in the Chandris case, it was the11 goal of the Court to say we'd like to make it clear as we12 -- we can. We don't want people going in and out of Jones13 Act status.14 However, as this Court saw in Gizoni, a perfect15 example -- in Gizoni, the person was a harbor worker.16 This Court sent it back to the lower court saying -- the17 lower court had said you're a harbor worker. That's your18 label. You're in the harbor workers' union. You're not19 entitled to -- for Jones Act status. This Court said no,20 send it back, let's take another look. The person,21 although a harbor worker, may have had the requisite22 connections to a vessel in navigation to be able to claim23 Jones Act seaman status. Obviously, in that situation,24 which is a perfect example, the -- the employer would have25 had to cover him under the Longshore Act and if -- if the55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 lower court changes or -- or the jury decides that he's a2 Jones Act3 the Jones45 exclusivity of the two acts is really in theory only and6 that there are always cases and will be dealing with the7 brown water seamen and brown water employees, harborseaman, would have had to have covered him underAct.Professor Schoenbaum has said that the mutual8 workers and longshoremen, where they're going to have to9 be covered under both anyway.10 Again, the First Circuit test, which does have11 an exception to it, which it clearly is -- is a snapshot,12 again to give someone another bite at the apple, which13 this Court thought, at least in the concurring opinion in14 Chandris, was a fair result, has that. But the test15 itself is -- is broad. It -- it is a bright line and it16 makes it clear, as this Court has stated in the past, that17 unless there's a transportation function, it's not a18 vessel in 192021navigation.Thank you.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Connelly.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the2223 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 242556Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
