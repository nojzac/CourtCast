Switzer.Mr. Owen.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWENON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. OWEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The issue before the Court today and theonly question litigated to decision in the courts below is whether a prisoner's claim that seeks only access to evidence for DNA testing may be brought in Federal court under the Civil Rights Act.The Fifth Circuit summarily answered that question "no," adhering to its long-standing view that any Federal claim that might conceivably set the stage for a subsequent collateral attack, however removed in time, must itself be brought via habeas. That rule so clearly cannot be squared with the decisions of this Court, especially since Wilkinson v. Dotson, that the Court should reverse and remand.I'd like to begin by describing the contours of the Heck rule, and -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you about -­3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Wilkinson was a parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't2 touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one3 does. So the cases are distinguishable on that basis.4 MR. OWEN: I -- Justice Ginsburg, the reason5 that we argue our case does not touch the conviction is6 that the relief that we are seeking, to have access to7 the evidence for testing, if we won, if we win in8 district court and we get that access, it does not9 necessarily imply -- which is the language this Court10 used in Heck and repeated in Dotson -- that the11 conviction is lawfully invalid.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I understand that13 argument, but there is the distinction of the type of14 case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence15 were never going to be questioned, only parole16 eligibility; where here, the discovery that you seek in17 1983 is not a destination. The destination is to18 further litigation that may or may not arise.19 MR. OWEN: That's true, Your Honor. We -­20 we don't see that as a distinction that compels the21 conclusion that Dotson isn't the model to follow,22 because in our view, what Dotson said -- again, the23 prisoners, as Justice Ginsburg says, were before the24 court seeking a declaration about parole procedures that25 Ohio planned to use in their cases. Those parole4￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 procedures had been adopted after those prisoners were2 sent to prison, and they complained that was an ex post3 facto violation.4 And Ohio argued, both in the Sixth Circuit5 and in this Court, that the fact that these prisoners6 expected at some point to come back to court armed with7 a judgment in their favor and seek a reduction in their8 sentences was enough to conclude that the case should be9 within the core of habeas.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem odd,11 though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument12 too much, because you have got planned out what you want13 to tell us. It does seem odd that if your suit for DNA14 testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that15 you asked for a stay.16 I mean, if it's not an attack on the17 sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision18 not to grant a stay or to grant a stay? It's -- it's an19 irony in your position.20 MR. OWEN: I think it's an irony -- I -- I21 accept the Court's point that that -- that that seems22 unusual, but I think that the reason that the Court's23 cases, at least as to the relief that we're seeking and24 not the stay that the Court entered in order to hear25 this case and decide the question, that the relief we5￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 are seeking does not necessarily imply the legal2 invalidity of the conviction.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we don't grant a4 stay in order to decide a question. We grant a stay5 because there's a likelihood of success on the merits.6 And that goes to the sentence. And now you're telling7 us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence. I don't8 see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view9 of the case.10 MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think -- if11 I -- if I was understood to say that, then I -- let me12 clarify.13 I think that our success -- when the Court14 applies the stay standard, it asks the question: What15 is the likelihood of success on the merits? Success on16 the merits, for purposes of our lawsuit, means getting17 access to the evidence. That's -- that's what it means.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If that's all it means, we19 shouldn't have granted a stay.20 MR. OWEN: I don't -- I don't think so, Your21 Honor, because I think once we had demonstrated that we22 were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, I23 think the Court was within, you know, appropriate24 judgment to -- to make sure that the case didn't become25 moot by Mr. Skinner's execution, because I do think that6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the demonstration that we had to make was not about2 whether his ultimate -- or whether, ultimately, he might3 get relief from his conviction, but whether we had a4 chance of prevailing on this civil rights claim that5 asks for access to the evidence.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that disconnects7 the irreparable harm alleged with respect to the stay8 and your claim that you now say -- you say now your9 claim is not going to necessarily affect the -- the10 sentence. The irreparable harm, if I remember, is quite11 obviously the execution. But it's -- there is no12 irreparable harm from your failure to get access to the13 DNA evidence, unless it's linked to the sentence.14 MR. OWEN: Your Honor, I -- I guess I don't15 have a better answer than the one I gave16 Justice Kennedy, and that is that I think that the stay17 standard doesn't have to link those two things. I think18 that if the Court finds that Mr. Skinner is going to die19 before he can litigate his claim and it finds he has a20 reasonable chance of prevailing on that claim, that's21 sufficient to -- to enter the stay.22 JUSTICE ALITO: In the real world, a23 prisoner who wants access to DNA evidence is interested24 in overturning his conviction.25 MR. OWEN: Absolutely.7￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: Do you deny that?MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE ALITO: And isn't the emergence ofthe Rooker-Feldman argument in this case an illustration of the absurdities that pursuing the 1983 path produces? Because habeas is not subject to claim preclusion, is it?MR. OWEN: No.JUSTICE ALITO: It's not subject to Rooker-Feldman?MR. OWEN: No, it's not subject to those,Your Honor.JUSTICE ALITO: But since you've squeezed this into 1983, now have you to deal with both of those issues.MR. OWEN: I think that the -- thereason that -- I think the reason the Rooker-Feldman issue has arisen at this juncture in the case is that the pleadings in the district court were not permitted to -- because of the sort of -- the fact that we were dismissed at a very early stage in the process, essentially on the threshold of the case, there was no opportunity to develop in full what the legal arguments are for both sides. I -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Except that at page 18 of8Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain2 your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue3 arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals'4 decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be5 so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying6 Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights.7 Correct me if I am wrong, but I think -­8 MR. OWEN: No, that's -­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought that's10 Rooker-Feldman to a tee. Correct me if I'm wrong.11 MR. OWEN: No, I think, Your Honor, that -­12 I -- I don't agree about the Court's reading of13 Rooker-Feldman if you think that -- if the Court14 believes that that would preclude it. And the reason is15 this: In the Feldman case itself, the -- the plaintiffs16 in that case, who were unsuccessful lawyers who are,17 what, a law school graduate and an attorney who was18 barred outside the District of Columbia, and were trying19 to get a waiver for a requirement for taking the bar20 here in the District of Columbia -- they filed a number21 of claims against the application of that rule by the22 District of Columbia Court of Appeals in their23 circumstances.24 But -- and this Court said those claims25 can't proceed. Those claims challenge the application9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 of the law to the facts.2 But this Court went on to say in Feldman -­3 the last paragraph of the opinion says they have also4 raised other claims, and those claims are that this5 rule, as authoritatively construed by the District of6 Columbia Court of Appeals, is -- is unconstitutional.7 It violates the Constitution. And the Court said, in8 Feldman, those claims may proceed. And -­910 read -- I'm 1112 rule that's13 challenging?1415 challenging16 construed the fault provision of the Texas DNA testing17 statute in our case, it created a wholesale18 classification that said everybody who falls into19 Mr. Skinner's situation who did not ask for testing at20 trial is forever foreclosed from getting testing. And21 -­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me how23 that's different than what Alaska did in the Osborne24 case that we upheld; their procedure? I thought that25 was one of the elements of the Alaska rule as well.10JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Owen, as I -- as I sorry.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What's the arbitrary and capricious that you're￼MR. OWEN: Your Honor, the rule that we are is that when the Court of Criminal AppealsAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. OWEN: I think -- I'm sorry.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That if you had an3 opportunity to ask for it and gave it up, that you lost.4 So how are we getting to that here? And how are you5 going to get past Osborne here?6 MR. OWEN: I think in Texas we have -- the7 difference, I think, Your Honor, is the difference8 between a substantive due process claim, as I understand9 it, and a procedural due process claim. That in Osborne10 the claim that was being made was that the State was11 denying a Federal right in denying access on that basis.12 Our argument is that the Texas -- the Texas13 statute was enacted to grant, essentially, protection to14 a class of inmates who were -- inmates who were15 wrongfully convicted and can prove that with DNA16 evidence -- and then -- and then interprets that statute17 in a way that needlessly chops a bunch of those inmates18 out, and that that's arbitrary, at least to the extent19 that it doesn't have reference to the specific facts of20 the case, the likelihood of innocence, the reasons for21 not doing the testing, and so on.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Osborne expressly23 considered both procedural due process and substantive24 due process.25￼MR. OWEN: But the reason, Your Honor, as11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 I -- as I read Osborne, that it did not reach a2 decision on the procedure, or it didn't -- that it3 rejected Osborne's procedural due process claim was4 because he hadn't tried at State court.5 I mean, that was the premise of Osborne,6 was he was -- I think the Court's language in Osborne7 was if he hasn't tried those procedures, he's in no8 position to complain about them in Federal court,9 whereas we did try the procedures, and it's precisely10 that that is the basis for our claim in Federal court.11 If I -­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -­13 MR. OWEN: I'm sorry.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- one of the15 criticisms by your adversary of your proposal to bring16 these actions via 1983 is a prospect that the courts17 will be used to collaterally attack convictions by all18 sorts of due process allegations concerning discovery19 disputes. Could you address that point, and why either20 you agree with them that that's what is going to happen,21 or if you don't, why not?22 MR. OWEN: I don't agree with them, Your23 Honor, and for a couple of reasons. First of all is24 that experience doesn't suggest that. The rule that we25 are asking the Court to adopt for the whole nation has12￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 been the rule for some time in six different circuits,2 and there's no evidence that in those circuits there3 have been a very large number of prisoners going into4 court under section 1983 and trying to leverage5 discovery under the circumstances that are suggested by6 Respondent's brief. So that's the practical reason.7 As a legal -- as a legal reason, I think8 that our claim turns on the existence of the liberty9 interest in the State statute for DNA testing that Texas10 has created, and that there is no statute in Texas for11 other kinds of general discovery; for example, access to12 the prosecutor's file, police reports, or other kinds of13 documents. That's not -- there's no legal hook for14 that.15 Our legal hook is the existence of that DNA16 testing statute and the existence under State law of17 opportunities to bring claims of actual innocence after18 the evidence is tested.￼1920 formulation21 difficult.22 verb points23 strikes me as a little less conclusive than you seem to24 think.25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The criticalin Heck, "necessarily implies," is a little I mean, the adverb points one way and the the other. And how -- "necessarily implies"MR. OWEN: I think -- I think if that word13Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 were in isolation, Your Honor, there might be more2 uncertainty about what "implies" means. But if the3 Court looks at the cases -- looks at Preiser, looks at4 Heck, looks at Edwards, looks at Nelson, looks at Hill5 -- what you'll see is the word "necessarily" is in all6 those cases. And, in fact, in Hill, I think -- or maybe7 it was Nelson; one of the two Florida cases -- the Court8 italicizes it twice in the same paragraph. And -­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you10 read "necessarily implies" to mean "conclusively11 establishes," right?12 MR. OWEN: Not that strong, Your Honor. But13 to finish, the other answer I was going to say is that14 in other cases -- I was going to say, "necessarily" is15 everywhere. "Necessarily" is in all the cases. But the16 Court also -- "implies" is not in all the cases. In17 Dotson, for example, the Court uses the word18 "demonstrate" -- "necessarily demonstrates" -- that the19 judgment underlying the custody is invalid.20 So I think that there is some -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are asking22 for an expansion of Heck from "necessarily implies" -­23 MR. OWEN: No, I think we are -- I think -­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to25 "demonstrates"?14￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think that -­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if "implies"3 doesn't mean the same as "establish" or "demonstrates,"4 give me an example of a case where the 1983 claim would5 not establish innocence but would still be covered by6 Heck.7 MR. OWEN: I think that -- I think Edwards8 is an example of that, Your Honor, where -- in Edwards,9 the defendant, the prisoner, was suing in Federal court,10 alleging that, in his words, the procedures that were11 used to deny him -- I think it was deny him parole or12 convict him of disciplinary offenses, but the procedures13 that had resulted in the disadvantage he was complaining14 about were unconstitutional.15 But when you looked at his complaint, what16 he said was this -- the reason those procedures are17 unconstitutional is because the decision maker was18 personally biased against me, which is less a complaint19 about the procedures and more a complaint about the20 merits of that adjudication. And if you believe it, if21 you credit that, and say, okay, we're going to win,22 fine, that's what happened, the adjudication was biased23 against you, that necessarily implies the invalidity of24 the judgment reached by that procedure.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Necessarily implies15￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 or conclusively establishes?2 MR. OWEN: I think necessarily -- with bias,3 perhaps that would be conclusively established, because4 I think there's no harmlessness test there. But I think5 that -- at least in an adjudication, there wouldn't be.6 But I think that "necessarily implies" is all that the7 Court needs to continue embracing in order to find8 that -­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would you do with10 the Brady violation? Is that a "necessarily implies" or11 is that more akin to your claim?12 MR. OWEN: For a couple of reasons, Your13 Honor, it's not akin to our claim. First is this:14 Brady is a trial right. And I don't mean necessarily15 that it arises at trial, because sometimes it arises16 at -- the discovery that makes a Brady claim colorable,17 you know, arises after trial. But Brady is a right to18 have certain evidence when you go to trial so that you19 can use it in an attempt to get the jury to find you not20 guilty.21 And, therefore, if that right is violated,22 if you don't get that evidence and it's discovered later23 that you were denied this stuff that you needed to have24 a fair trial, that implies the invalidity of the trial25 judgment, the judgment that results in the custody.16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 In our case, the judgment that we are2 challenging is the judgment of the Court of Criminal3 Appeals denying us DNA testing, which does not in the4 same way demonstrate or necessarily imply that the5 custody judgment in our case is legally invalid.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Owen, could I take you7 back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise? You8 said that what you are attacking is the judgment. I9 read your complaint as having an important strand where10 you were not attacking the judicial judgment, but11 instead were attacking actions of the prosecutor's12 office, independent of any judgment of the State courts.13 Are you abandoning that part of your14 complaint, or are you continuing to maintain it?15 Because certainly, if you talk about the judgment alone,16 it at least gets you into Rooker-Feldman territory,17 whereas if you talk about the prosecutor, it does not.18 MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, that we -­19 that we are in the territory of talking about the20 judgment. And I think for the reasons I've described21 earlier that that does not lead inexorably to a22 Rooker-Feldman bar.23 But I think that the nature of our claim,24 which follows from Osborne, what we understood the Court25 to be recognizing in Osborne, or acknowledging in17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Osborne, is that the State's administration of its DNA2 testing scheme is where a due process violation might3 theoretically arise, depending on how it's administered.4 So I think -­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't6 understand the argument you're making. Are you7 challenging the constitutionality of the Texas statute?8 MR. OWEN: As interpreted in our case, or as9 construed, I think is the right -- is the better word.10 As-­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, "as construed" -- I12 mean, it's their statute. I mean, you say somewhere in13 your brief that -- that they gave it an arbitrary and14 capricious interpretation. It's up to them how they15 want to interpret it. We don't -- we don't reinterpret16 State statutes because the State Supreme Court17 interpreted it strangely.18 It seems to me you're either challenging the19 statute or -- or you don't belong here.20 MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, we are21 challenging the statute. And I think once the Texas22 Court of Criminal Appeals says here is what the default23 provision means, that is the same thing, for the24 purposes of this Court's review, as if the legislature25 had written that in. So -­18￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Just so long as we're clear about that.MR. OWEN: Yes, sir. So that's what we are challenging. I certainly agree if we were saying they got it wrong on their own terms, that would be a Rooker-Feldman bar, because we couldn't bring that claim.JUSTICE BREYER: I assume that this whole case focuses on paragraph 33 of your complaint; is that right?MR. OWEN: There's been a lot -- yes, but -­ I mean, I think there's been a lot of talk -­JUSTICE BREYER: And what is the "but"?MR. OWEN: I think there has been a lot of discussion about the allegations in the complaint, particularly those paragraphs. I think that is maybe missing the larger point, which is this: As we said earlier, I think that the Federal rules permit complaints to be notice pleading. They permit amendment. They permit development of the issues.JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's -- look, 33 saysOfficial￼the District Attorney has violated law by refusing to give me the DNA do it.That's how I read 33.19my rights under the evidence, so make himAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. OWEN: That's -- that's the relief that we're asking for, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: But not the relief. That's your complaint.You explain why you think it violates Federal law for him not to do it. You ask him to do it. Is there anything else to this case?MR. OWEN: I think there is the constitutionality of the construction of the statute, because that is the basis on which the DNA -­JUSTICE BREYER: But that's why you are entitled to the relief.MR. OWEN: All right. Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else in the case that you want?MR. OWEN: No. We're not asking -- no. I mean, I think -­JUSTICE BREYER: You want the DNA evidence?MR. OWEN: We want the evidence. That's correct. We don't -- we're not asking this court, the Federal District Court, to release Mr. Skinner from custody. We're not asking them to accelerate the release date on his sentence, for which there is none. We're not asking them to modify the status of his custody.20Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425All of those things which are at the core of habeas corpus, as this Court has interpreted that phrase, none of those are requested by us.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you are -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what you say in the rest of paragraph 33 is that you want the biological evidence because by refusing to turn it over, he prevented you from gaining access to exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate he is not guilty of capital murder, which is usually what we -- what habeas corpus is for: To show you are not guilty of what you are in prison for.MR. OWEN: I -- I think ordinarily, Your Honor, if that were our -- if we knew today that this evidence in fact was exculpatory, if they had already done the testing and they mail us a report that says it has excluded your guy, then we wouldn't file a 1983action. We would seek clemency, State habeas petition. We would court would have the power to -­JUSTICE BREYER: You the Chief Justice just said, didwere nodding your head. (Laughter.)or we would file ado something where thedidn't agree with what you? I noticed youOfficial￼JUSTICE BREYER: He said, and I -­21Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. OWEN: That "necessarily implies -­JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if you agree with that, I guess there's nothing left of this case.MR. OWEN: I think -­JUSTICE BREYER: But I -- but do you agreewith that?MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think that -­ I think that "necessarily implies," as the Courtinterpreted that phrase in Dotson, means somewhere down the road you may come back to court and you may attempt to undo your custody, and that's not enough to put this case into habeas, that that -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand. But did I understand you to say that you -- different cases where people are seeking the DNA evidence might come out differently under Heck. In other words, if it's the type of DNA evidence that could conclusively establish he's innocent. I mean, there are types like that. It's somebody else's, you know, DNA and that's what's necessary for the conviction.And there's others -- other types of DNA evidence that doesn't. I mean, it just happens to be on the scene of the crime and it turns out that it's not him that was in the room, but, you know, he was somewhere else, and it might or might not mean he's22Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 innocent.2 In the former case, do you say that has to3 go under habeas, but in the latter it doesn't?4 MR. OWEN: I think when we are seeking5 access to evidence which has never been tested for6 testing, that could be brought under 1983.7 I think if the evidence has been tested and8 test results exist and are known and are exculpatory,9 that is a -- that's a different case and that's probably10 habeas, because then it's the fact that the results are11 known and we know they are exculpatory that does12 necessarily imply that there's something about the13 judgment that could be undone.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Owen, you're fitting15 your case into our decisions about the line between 198316 and habeas. But if nobody -- if you didn't know17 anything about that and you looked at what's presented18 here in a civil case, it seems as though you are19 splitting your claim; that is, you want discovery, and20 if the discovery is favorable, then you ask for relief21 from the conviction.22 So it's the -- it's quite unlike I'm23 complaining about prison conditions. Here, the whole24 purpose of your seeking this discovery is so that you25 will be able, if it turns out to be in your favor, to23￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 apply for habeas.2 MR. OWEN: The whole -- I agree, Your Honor,3 that the whole purpose for seeking this evidence and4 pursuing this lawsuit is so that Mr. Skinner can have a5 meaningful opportunity to pursue the liberty interest he6 has under State law in trying to secure release based on7 innocence. That is correct. But I don't think that8 leads inexorably to the idea that this lawsuit, which9 is-­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you have sought11 habeas? Is it 1983 is the exclusive relief, or could12 you have sought habeas relief?13 MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, that since14 our allegation is that the Court of Criminal Appeals15 decision denying us DNA testing, which is not the16 judgment that results in Mr. Skinner's custody, is the17 problem -- that's the bad, invalid judgment from our18 legal theory -- that could not have been brought in a19 habeas corpus proceeding, because I think that the20 relief that a Federal habeas court would have available21 to itself is limited to release, to accelerating release22 or changing custody status. I don't think that there is23 power in the Federal habeas court under that statute to24 say, even though this will not affect the judgment as to25 which you are in custody, I'm going to act on this way24￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 and order this person to do that or the other thing. I2 think that it wouldn't be available in habeas, Your3 Honor.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, couldn't the habeas5 court say the conviction was invalid because of the6 failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which7 was relevant to the defense and which was8 unconstitutionally denied? Why wouldn't that be a basis9 for setting1011 said -- and12 make sure I'm clear on that -- this Court has never said13 that it would be a constitutional basis for habeas14 relief if you could demonstrate that, factually, you15 were not guilty.16 So that's the claim that would have to be17 brought in such a Federal habeas. It's not presently18 available because this Court has never held that. And I19 think, given the constraints of the Federal habeas20 statute and the requirement of clearly established21 Federal law from this Court, before a prisoner can get22 relief, that's a necessary prerequisite for us seeking23 that relief. And -- and I'm sorry. I hope that is24 responsive, Your Honor.25 The -- the problem, I think, with just going25aside the conviction?MR. OWEN: Your Honor, this Court has never I know the Court's aware of this; I want to￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 to Federal court and saying give us discovery, I think2 it's the same problem as described earlier with the3 Brady framework. If we knew today that the -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll tell you what the5 problem is. The problem is Rooker-Feldman. That's -­6 that's why all of these things don't make much sense. I7 mean, it wouldn't happen because you had the opportunity8 to raise that in the State court, and now you're9 retrying what the -- what the State court did decide.10 MR. OWEN: I think to the extent, Your11 Honor, that the question goes to the opportunity that we12 had to raise this issue in State court, that's a13 preclusion issue, and there may be preclusion issues14 back in the district court. We may have a dogfight over15 whether or not this claim should have been raised in16 State court.17 But that's not the Rooker-Feldman question,18 as I understand it. I think the Rooker-Feldman question19 is: What are we asking the Federal court to review?20 And what we are asking the Federal court to review is21 the Criminal Court of Appeals' authoritative22 construction of the statute.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that would be an24 obstacle to habeas.25 MR. OWEN: Yes.26￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Because in habeas you'd be seeking to set aside -­MR. OWEN: That's right.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the State court judgment. Okay?MR. OWEN: That's right. Habeas would be -­ habeas would be our only route -­JUSTICE SCALIA: That's why it's so unrealistic to analyze it that way, it seems to me.MR. OWEN: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I'm -- I'm not sure I agree that it's unrealistic. I mean, I think that over time the courts who are wrestling with this issue in the wake of Osborne will identify what aspects of a State's statute and construction of such statutes violate due process or don't.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it a correct formulation of your answer to Justice Scalia to say what we are seeking is a determination that the State court's judgment, State court's decisions, State court's order was a violation of due process? If you say that -­MR. OWEN: That's -- that's a much simpler answer, Your Honor, and I will adopt that answer.(Laughter.)JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's Rooker.MR. OWEN: That's not -- no, Your Honor, I27Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425think, again -- and this is where we started, and I'm not trying to -- to bring us back full circle, but I think that our understanding of Rooker-Feldman is that that is not one of the things that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine prohibits. And, of course, this Court has emphasized in recent years, in the Exxon case and elsewhere, that lower courts have been reading Rooker-Feldman too broadly.Mr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the remainder of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Owen.Mr. Coleman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMANON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Chief JusticeRoberts, and may it please the Court:To decide this case, the Court only needs tomake two stops. First is paragraph 33 of Mr. Skinner's complaint.That complaint, that statement of his complaint clearly alleges against Ms. Skinner -- Ms. Switzer herself that she has withheld -- and the word he uses is "exculpatory" evidence -- and violated his due process rights through that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he says28Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he's2 not guilty. There's a lot of exculpatory evidence that3 might imply, necessarily imply guilt, but there's a lot4 of exculpatory evidence that simply is helpful and5 doesn't mean it will demonstrate. He says it could.6 MR. COLEMAN: There -- there are two points7 in response to that, Chief Justice Roberts, and the8 first is that this is the classic statement of a Brady9 claim. When you file a Brady claim, you don't know10 exactly what it is and whether it will definitely be11 exculpatory or not. You have learned information that12 makes you think that it would be, and you're able to -­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The substantive right in14 Brady was to have that material at trial, so that it is15 -- that's the substantive constitutional right. Here16 the substantive right that's been identified in Osborne17 is the liberty interest created by State law. And that18 only happens after the conviction. So it's not quite19 the same. It's not comparable.20 MR. COLEMAN: I'm not -- I'm not saying that21 legally that there isn't some difference to be made from22 Osborne. Osborne rejected the substantive claim that23 you could bring a Brady claim. What I'm saying is the24 language of the text of his complaint is a Brady25 allegation, and at page 19, footnote 6 of his own brief,29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 he acknowledges that Brady claims have to be brought in2 habeas and is left simply arguing that, one, that I can3 describe to the Court a different theory of my4 complaint, or that regardless of how I describe the5 complaint, I can break out the discovery aspects of that6 complaint and do it under 1983 and not in habeas. And7 part of the problem with that -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to win a Brady claim9 in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just10 that the -- that it was withheld, but that it was,11 indeed, exculpatory and could have affected the outcome12 of the trial. No?13 MR. COLEMAN: Yes. But that claim -- that14 showing is to be made, if at all, in habeas. And he has15 the opportunity -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't have to make17 that showing here. I mean, that's -- that's what he18 says distinguishes this case from habeas. In habeas,19 you would have to show that, indeed, it would justify a20 different outcome in the trial, whereas here he says I21 don't have to show that; I just want the evidence.22 MR. COLEMAN: There is some ambiguity. I'm23 not sure I fully understand what you mean by "here." He24 has alleged that that's what he is going to prove. What25 he -- what he says in his brief and what he stands30￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 before the Court today and says I'm going to show are -­2 are different things.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what he is going to4 do with it. But he doesn't -- he doesn't say that I5 need to show that in order to be entitled to -- to the6 relief I'm asking for, whereas he would have to say that7 in habeas.8 MR. COLEMAN: I disagree. With respect to9 the relief that he is ultimately seeking, the question10 is -- if you're saying that the 1983 suit is simply a11 retrying of the article 64 proceeding, then I -- I would12 have to concede that article 64 does not require the13 same showing as a habeas claim. But part of the -­14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, aren't -- aren't15 the -- the exculpatory nature of the evidence and its16 materiality elements of the Brady claim itself?17 MR. COLEMAN: Well, as -- as the Court and18 your concurring opinion in Osborne made clear, that -­19 that "exculpatory" is really defined as demonstrating20 that you're innocent and that it's material.21 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree think that sounds22 like -- I would interpret his complaint as what he wants23 is the DNA. He thinks it's going to be exculpatory. He24 doesn't know that till he gets it.25 So look at Dotson. Dotson says that you go31￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 into habeas if winning -- i.e., getting the DNA -- would2 necessarily spell speedier release. End of the matter.3 I'm reading to you from Justice Scalia's concurrence4 where he quotes my majority with great praise.5 67 Scalia also8 concurrence9 whether you(Laughter.)MR. COLEMAN: Justice Scalia -- Justice makes the point at the end of his Dotson that the question -- the real question is could make out this type of claim or this -­10 make out this type of proceeding in habeas. Ultimately,11 Preiser and Heck -­12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, not whether you -- what13 he's worried about -- he can speak for himself -- but as14 I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win15 and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed16 into habeas which don't belong there. And that may be a17 true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he18 has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or19 something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to20 you is the test.21 And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA22 does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all23 depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows. So why24 isn't that end of the matter?25 MR. COLEMAN: Because I disagree that the32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 two words "necessarily implies" are in fact sort of the2 end of the battle and the end of the test.3 As Justice Ginsburg noted earlier in the4 argument, the Court has dealt with these issues in a -­5 in a variety of cases, most of them being prison6 disciplinary or parole-type proceedings. And in those7 cases, the Court is trying to define the outer bounds,8 ultimately, of what we're going to say Preiser/Heck9 required to be brought in habeas and what may be10 brought. A couple of boundaries on those rules, but11 first, Preiser and Heck make -­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Coleman, if you could13 answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two14 phrases, "necessarily imply the invalidity of the15 conviction" and "necessarily spell speedier release";16 and either you think that your case fits one of those or17 both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon18 that standard.19 MR. COLEMAN: I don't think that that's20 true. I think that what the Court has always21 recognized, an article 64 proceeding is a motion in the22 criminal case. If you look at the docket number on the23 motion, it is a motion in the criminal case.24 What "necessarily implies" has always been25 used for is defining the outer bounds of the rule in33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 terms of prison disciplinary proceedings, parole, other2 things outside the criminal case itself.3 This is an attack on the -- the criminal4 proceeding. This is a post-conviction motion in the5 criminal case itself. It's like a rule 60 -­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Filed in the -- in the7 court of conviction?8 MR. COLEMAN: It's not only in the court of9 conviction; it's under the docket number of the case.10 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's a totally11 different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what12 we did do was go through every of these -- every one of13 the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part14 the attack, as you say, on prison procedure. And those15 cases where the attack on the proceeding would have16 restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the17 -- the length of confinement.18 In those cases where there was a general19 attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be20 carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't. You21 suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas. Where22 in the case law is this different rule that the rule we23 just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the24 case? That's basically what you are arguing. What25 should I read to show that you were right on that?34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. COLEMAN: I think Preiser and Heck both2 stand for the fundamental proposition that Congress set3 up habeas as a means of allowing collateral attacks.4 Nowhere else does Congress specifically permit5 collateral attacks on criminal proceedings. Then6 Preiser and Heck say what we allow from that is those7 things that may be brought in habeas should be brought8 in habeas because the congressional intent behind the9 habeas statute is that we expect the safeguards that10 Congress has put in place to respect comity and11 federalism interests as well as other interests to be -­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But how could this be13 brought in habeas? If Mr. Skinner wants this evidence14 and -- and we say you file a habeas petition, what would15 that habeas petition look like?16 MR. COLEMAN: Well, the habeas petition -­17 we know it can be brought in habeas because, one, he has18 already brought it. He brought a habeas petition based19 on ineffective assistance of counsel that is, as a20 matter of argument, indistinguishable from the no-fault21 arguments that he is making here. The complaint's22 against the no-fault aspect of the article 6423 proceeding.24 He can bring that. Many courts -- this25 Court has never fully said that you can, but many courts35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 do allow actual innocence-type claims to go forward, and2 so he can bring an ineffective assistance habeas, he can3 bring an actual innocence habeas, he can do discovery as4 part of that habeas; and when he does that -- when he5 does that, Congress says you must respect those criminal6 proceedings. You must show deference. You must require7 exhaustion.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Coleman, the habeas9 statute says, 2254(a), a Federal court can entertain a10 habeas petition only on the ground that the petitioner11 is in custody in violation of Federal law.12 Tell me how he can write a complaint that13 says the violation, due process violation of access to14 DNA, means that this defendant is in custody in15 violation of Federal law as opposed to having had a16 statutory right improperly denied him. Tell me how does17 he write that complaint to get into habeas?18 MR. COLEMAN: Well he -- he's stood before19 the Court today and explained how he would write that20 complaint, and as I mentioned to Justice Kagan -­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is he in custody22 in -- in violation of Federal law? Because of the23 improper -­24 MR. COLEMAN: Because he believed that he25 received ineffective assistance of counsel and that he36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 can make -­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not his claim3 here. His claim here is that he was denied DNA evidence4 improperly under State law -- in violation of Federal -­5 the Federal Constitution.6 MR. COLEMAN: That's correct. And the -­7 the last part of my answer to Justice Kagan I think is8 the answer to your question, and that is if you make out9 either an ineffective assistance claim or an actual10 innocence-type claim, the congressional intent that you11 observe and show deference and exhaustion and all those12 things require that to be given to every step of the13 process.14 JUSTICE BREYER: In the particular -­15 MR. COLEMAN: But the moment you file the16 complaint through discovery, through every substantive17 aspect of that -- what Mr. Skinner wants to do is say:18 I want to engage in artful pleading, and so I'm going to19 make attacks. Today they are on DNA evidence; tomorrow20 they may be a Brady claim; next week it may be a claim21 against procedures used in State habeas. But as long as22 I don't expressly ask that my custody be undone, I -- I23 expect those claims to be allowed to go forward in 198324 without any of the protections of habeas, and then -­25 then if it looks after a year that they are going pretty37￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 well, then I will flip it over to habeas and go forward2 with my habeas -­3 JUSTICE BREYER: I see your point, but I4 want to go back to try to understand this.5 And we have the Dotson point, and you said6 there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck. So what7 Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there8 wanted the shortening of his term of confinement. He9 wanted good-time credits to be restored. And as we read10 it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is11 what made it proper in habeas. But we added that if it12 hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration13 of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it14 would be 1983.15 In Heck, the same thing. They were16 establishing the basis for a damages claim that17 necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the18 conviction. Where that was so, there would be habeas.19 Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not20 demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal21 judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in22 1983. So as we read those two cases, they stood for the23 exact principle I described.24 Now, you want, perfectly fairly, to say:25 But we didn't read them correctly, or we shouldn't have38￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 read them as exclusively to say what I've just read.2 Fine.3 What is it, in your opinion, precisely, that4 we should have the principle of distinguishing the one5 1983 from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an6 exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in7 those three cases: Dotson, Preiser, Heck? What's your8 contrary approach?9 MR. COLEMAN: I -- I think the approach is10 if these things may be properly made the subject of a11 habeas corpus claim, then congressional intent and the12 habeas statute require that it be brought in habeas. I13 think that responds -­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are -- you are15 asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson16 formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear.17 It says: "Would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity18 of the conviction or the sentence." Wouldn't19 necessarily demonstrate, and the Petitioner is telling20 us, it may not demonstrate it at all. It may21 demonstrate that my client was, in fact, guilty. So it22 wouldn't necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the23 conviction.24 And I think to get -- to get -- to say that25 you should prevail, you would have to say: Court, you39￼Alderson Reporting Company15 not involve16 case is the1718 in the sense that if you look at Dotson, which was -­19 involved a specific claim for process -- which is not20 what they are asking for. They are asking for actual21 relief, not process.Official1 were wrong in using that formula, because here we have a2 petitioner who says, I'm not claiming that what I'm3 seeking would demonstrate the invalidity of the4 conviction.5 MR. COLEMAN: I -- I disagree with that,6 Justice Ginsburg. I don't think that we're saying that7 the Court is wrong. What I think I'm saying is that8 "necessarily implies" is not a magic words test that is9 the sort of complete and ultimate statement of the10 Preiser-Heck rule, but rather -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are asking for12 something in addition. You say: Court, don't just look13 at the words in Wilkinson v. Dotson. This is a14 different case, as I suggested originally. This does￼parole. The ultimate destination in this conviction and sentence.MR. COLEMAN: I think that that is correct,22 But you look at those types of cases,23 whether it's Heck, it's a civil case that went about24 attacking it, these cases on the periphery of what goes25 in and out of Heck, the "necessarily implied" language,40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 I think, is a good descriptor for what is at -- was at2 the periphery.3 But when you attack the core of the criminal4 proceeding itself, what his rule is simply -- is an5 attempt to take the two words or the phrase from Dotson6 and turn it back on itself and say -- says that, under7 Heck, I can attack motions in the criminal proceedings8 themselves, in the State habeas itself, as long as I9 stop short of asking for that ultimate relief.10 So Heck said the case is about avoiding11 artful pleading, but now what he wants to turn it into12 is a rule that encourages artful pleading and -­1314 mean, we've15 conceivable16 said in Heck and Preiser. I'm not sure, however, that17 what we ought to say is what you propose: That the test18 is whether it could be brought in habeas. You say it19 could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective20 assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that21 habeas.22 You can bring anything23 you can file a habeas petition. I24 could possibly win in habeas. You25 habeas with this claim because you41JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe we need -- I never had a case like this, and it'sto -- to me that we have to expand what we￼Alderson Reporting Companyin habeas. I mean, assume you mean you couldn't win in couldn't show that itOfficial1 would have affected the outcome. Isn't that so?2 MR. COLEMAN: Well, as you noted in your3 concurrence in Dotson, the question is not whether you4 win, but whether you could. And the question is, if5 it's properly the subject of habeas, then Congress has6 demanded that all of the safeguards and protections for7 habeas be in place. And that -­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, that doesn't9 quite give us the added formulation that some of the10 questions suggest we need, if we're going to adhere to11 Dotson and still rule for you. There has to be some12 slightly different qualification. I'm not quite sure13 what it is.14 MR. COLEMAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure15 exactly what you're angling for there. But at the end16 of the day, I think that there is also a -- a17 misunderstanding about what article 64 is.18 Skinner treats article 64 as simply: I19 asked for evidence, and I get evidence. And you denied20 -- you denied me the DNA. What article 64 actually is,21 it's a motion, as I mentioned, filed in the criminal22 case itself, that says: Judge, I want a ruling that if23 this additional DNA evidence were known at the time of24 trial, then I probably would not have been convicted.25 And the process for obtaining that ruling is42￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 to make an initial threshold showing that suggests the2 materiality of the DNA evidence. If you get over that3 threshold, then you move on to testing, and you get a4 hearing and an ultimate determination.5 But there are really only two results in6 article 64. One is a ruling that you probably would not7 have been convicted. Or, two, I reject your request for8 a ruling that you probably would not have been9 convicted. And that's what he got. It is a motion that10 goes to the core of the conviction itself.11 JUSTICE BREYER: But if -- in Heck itself,12 we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if13 successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any14 outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be15 allowed to proceed.16 Now, I take it what you're suggesting is we17 say that sentence is wrong or overstated, that there is18 another circumstance.19 MR. COLEMAN: Well -­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Even though it will not21 demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should22 not be allowed in 1983 if it is, quote, "related to" the23 criminal case itself. Something like that is what24 you're proposing. Or what is it you're proposing?25 MR. COLEMAN: What about -- where it -­43￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: Say what it is, then. Saywhat it is.OfficialJUSTICE SCALIA: What about where its only purpose is to demonstrate -- is to be able todemonstrate the invalidity of a judgment?MR. COLEMAN: Well, ultimately, the onlyreason it can be brought is to demonstrate the invalidity of -­JUSTICE BREYER: It's part of a process where you hope to demonstrate. Can you bring in habeas a motion, let's say, to examine police files?MR. COLEMAN: You could bring a claim in habeas, alleging, for instance, Brady.JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. This isn't Brady. What you say is I have a right under criminal law here that everybody has that I can go back and take depositions of the -- you have a reason for doing it. You want to take their depositions because you want to show that something wasn't followed. Can you do that in habeas?MR. COLEMAN: If you are alleging some underlying constitutional invalidity of your conviction and you need to -­JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a Federal law -­ is there a Federal statute that -- you can't say yet44￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether it's invalid. We don't know. What we want is to get the information that will help us make that decision. We think there is a law that entitles us to that right. Can you bring that in habeas or not?MR. COLEMAN: The discovery provisions of habeas allow you to seek that as part of your habeas claim, and when you do that, all the safeguards and protections of habeas apply.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that means FOIA requests, where your only purpose is to seek out the police files because you're hoping, just like you are in DNA testing, that those files will show exculpatory material. Then FOIA requests have to be brought in habeas as well?I--FOIA-­Official￼MR. COLEMAN: I think FOIA is different.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where -­MR. COLEMAN: You can ask for it. I for it. Chief Justice Roberts can ask for it -­ JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, take the case, Mr. Coleman -- I think there was one recently incan askthe Fifth Circuit where a prisoner asked for appellate slipopinions. And the prisoner said I want these slip opinions so I can write a better habeas petition.Does that also have to be brought as part of45Alderson Reporting Company7 opinions in8 from prison9order to be able to obtain a quicker release via habeas.MR. COLEMAN: I -- I would say no. But -­ JUSTICE KAGAN: No what? No what?101112 brought as a habeas. But, again, this is different.Official1 a habeas case, or can that be brought in 1983?2 MR. COLEMAN: I don't know the specifics of3 that claim, but -- but I would tend to think if -- if a4 person generally has access to slip opinions, then -­5 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, he said he didn't have6 enough access to slip opinions, and he needed more slipMR. COLEMAN: That that would not have to be13 14 1516 different?17 that he hopes will lead to a quicker release, although18 it has no certainty at all of doing so.JUSTICE KAGAN: Why is that different?MR. COLEMAN: Excuse me?JUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why is thatBoth the -- the prisoner is seeking a tool￼19 MR. COLEMAN: I think because there is no20 right specific to him -- for instance, if I seek DNA21 evidence, it's because I want to attack my conviction.22 And there is no other reason to do it.

I want to use the prison library, same example.MR. COLEMAN: Prison -­JUSTICE BREYER: I want to use the prison library 9:00 to 3:00, because that's when I work on my efforts to upset my conviction. Now -- I mean, it's the same as Justice Kagan -­MR. COLEMAN: That's a condition -­ JUSTICE BREYER: -- provided. What aboutthat?MR. COLEMAN: That's a condition -- that's just a prison condition. The Court has always said that those types of things can be brought in 1983.But -- but what we are talking about here really is ultimately if you are convicted in one county but you're serving time in a different part of the State, you bring your habeas claim and then at the same time you bring a 1983 suit, you ask for discovery and say I don't want -- and this could be DNA; it could be some other Brady materials; it could be an attack -- you say I want to litigate the first half of my claim out here without any of the protections of habeas, and then if it turns out, well, I'm going to just move them over and use them in my habeas, that -- without any of the protections -- that is what Preiser and Heck ultimately47Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 were trying 23 allow these4 Heck cites Rooker for this very proposition.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was going to ask if6 you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument.to stop.Heck said we -- the only time we really types of collateral attacks -- and -- and7 What -- what is your response to the Petitioner's8 counsel's explanation of why there is no Rooker here?9 MR. COLEMAN: There -- there is a way.10 When -- when the court said in Osborne you should use11 these State statutes and you may -- you might have a12 procedural due process, the court was not saying we are13 going to create out of whole cloth an entirely new14 category of procedural due process.15 You do it like you do any other procedural16 due process. If you go into the system and you -- you17 file -- and again litigation is different from an18 administrative procedure, which is what Dotson was19 about. You're in litigation and you're in court. And20 if somebody says, well, there's this prong that you21 can't meet, and you think it violates due process, you22 have an obligation to raise it then, and then you have23 an opportunity, if the court rules against you, to file24 a cert petition.25 And if you don't do that, what we do know48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 is, from this very limited area, is that the one thing2 that you can't do is file a Federal 1983 lawsuit saying3 I think that what the State court did is arbitrary and4 capricious.5 And, so, Skinner is asking you to create a6 1983 lawsuit that is always Rooker-Feldman barred and7 always preclusion barred, because you're asking the8 court to declare that the State courts violated your -­9 the constitutional rights in the way they went about it.10 And -- and so he's asking you to create a category of11 1983 suits that runs exactly contrary to Rooker-Feldman12 and exactly contrary to what Heck said is this13 overriding interest in ensuring that these types of14 collateral attacks are brought, if at all, in habeas and15 not through generalized 1983 lawsuits that don't provide16 any of the protections that Congress has insisted by17 statute be applied in these types of suits.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, then, can you give us19 your best modified statement of Wilkinson against20 Dotson? I think you were telling us that that formula21 fit that type of case, would necessarily demonstrate the22 invalidity of the conviction.￼2324 necessarily25 conviction;It's given here that this evidence would not demonstrate the invalidity of the nonetheless, you say it falls on the habeas49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 side of the line. That does require you to ask for a2 modification of the Wilkinson v. Dotson formula, and I3 ask -- if you could say what that would be, what that4 precise modification would be?5 MR. COLEMAN: Well, first, I don't believe6 the Court has ever acknowledged the existence of a cause7 of action for discovery separate and apart from the8 merits of what you are seeking to do.9 The merits of what he's seeking to do is to10 attack his custody. That is something that can and11 should be brought in habeas. And the Court should not,12 for many reasons, create a cause of action that -- whose13 sole purpose is to run counter to Rooker-Feldman and14 whose sole purpose is to avoid the protections of15 habeas.16 Again, this is not an expansion of habeas.17 It's simply a recognition that he has a claim that he18 can bring in habeas, it -- it probably is a loser and we19 think it certainly would be a loser, but the question20 is, can he bring it, and if he can, it should be subject21 to these types of things. And at the end, when you22 recognize what he is trying to do, this is fundamentally23 a question or a -- he is seeking to invalidate his24 conviction, and that it comfortably fits within the25 policy choices that the Court has made all the way -­50￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the -­ MR. COLEMAN: -- the way.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- JusticeGinsburg's question I think is an important one. Are you going to argue that you fit within -- this case fits within "necessarily implies," or is there another formulation that you think we should have?MR. COLEMAN: We think given the nature of the article 64 proceeding, which is itself an attack on the conviction, it is a request that the Court declare that the conviction is probably invalid, that because that is what he is attacking, he is saying the result that is -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but just -­MR. COLEMAN: -- that -- that we do fit within the "necessarily implies," because any proper attack on an article 64 ruling is an attack, but that within the broader context, if the Court feels a need to rule on these cases in criminal proceedings, then -­ then it should recognize it should be brought in habeas.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- if I can have just 1 minute. Then if you do not file an article -- in a State court at all and you just go to 1983, you're back under Heck, and you haven't given us a qualification that works under Heck.51Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.MR. COLEMAN: Very, very briefly. If the -­ if the only claim you brought -- you say, I'm -- I can never meet article 64 because it says only applies to convictions after January 1st, 2000. I -- I can't meet that. I think it's unconstitutional. You file a 1983 lawsuit. You say I think that provision is unconstitutional. That's really Dotson saying rule that that prong is unconstitutional, but let me go back and have process. That's Dotson -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR.

OWEN: Mr. Chief Justice -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Owen, I know I'mpushing you, but I really would like a clear statement of what the procedural due process violation that you are claiming occurred here is.Official￼MR. OWEN: Your Honor, our -- our claim is construction of the statute, the Texas Court Appeals construed the statute to completelythat in itsof Criminalforeclose any prisoner who could have sought DNA testing52Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prior to trial, but did not, from seeking testing under the postconviction statute, that is -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not -- you -­ MR. OWEN: -- that speaks too broadly.So-­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then let me follow this through. You're not attacking the constitutionality of article 64 on its face, right? Or are you?MR. OWEN: Your Honor, this -- this came up as we were preparing for our presentation, and I think there's -- there's -- here's what I would like to say: We are not suggesting that article 64 -- that there's no way to interpret article 64 that the court could have chosen to -- to construe the statute that would always be unconstitutional in every case. That's what -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It chose to construe it the way it construed it. You -- you can't attack the way -­ the way the State Supreme Court construed its statute.MR. OWEN: That's right, Your Honor. JUSTICE SCALIA: You're attacking thestatute.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you saying -- and that's -- this is where I have difficulty -- that by failing to acknowledge Petitioner's ineffective53Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 assistance of counsel claim, that that was the court's2 error?3 MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. Our claim -­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that was a good5 enough excuse to excuse the fact that he didn't do6 DNA -- DNA testing at the time of trial? Because that's7 what the statute says. You can't get it if it was8 present at the time and -- meaning if that actual test9 that you're seeking was available at the time of trial,10 or you don't prove that you couldn't have done it for a11 good reason. So what is it exactly that the court did12 in applying this that was unconstitutional?13 MR. OWEN: Your Honor, I think it's not the14 specific question to whether in our case they didn't15 consider our ineffective assistance of counsel16 arguments. It's that it made no provision for any17 exception to its rule. In other words, that it￼18 interpreted19 testing for2021 That's what22 conditions under which a petitioner can seek DNA23 evidence, and it said you didn't meet those conditions.24 I'm still trying to figure out what you're arguing -­25 MR. OWEN: I think -­this as a blanket proscription on seeking anybody who didn't seek it prior to trial. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, wait a minute. the statute says. The statute gives the54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- was the procedural2 due process violation in their application of those3 items. So are you challenging it facially, or are you4 challenging it as applied, but as applied how?5 MR. OWEN: Once -- once the Court of6 Criminal Appeals construes the statute, that's what the7 statute means, and we are challenging that. If that's8 what the Court's -­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what do you10 think -­11 MR. OWEN: If that's what Your Honor12 described as facial.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is it about14 they said it means that's unconstitutional?15 MR. OWEN: That it -- that it is not16 it does not admit of any exceptions and that it doesn't17 have any reference to the purposes of the statute, the18 reasoning the testing might not have been sought in a19 particular case, or the fact, particularly that, in our20 case, Mr. Skinner at the time of his trial, this -- the21 postconviction DNA testing statute was still 6 years in22 the future. So that -- so that to the extent the Court23 of Criminal Appeals portrayed Mr. Skinner as making a24 choice, that's -- that's not accurate, because he didn't25 make a choice.55what-- that￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't even -- I'm not2 even sure what that argument ties to, because I thought3 what the court said was: This DNA testing was available4 then. You could have gotten it. Strategically your5 trial attorney chose not to, and so that disqualifies6 you from seeking it now.7 I'm not quite sure what the date of the8 statute's passage, whether it makes any difference,9 because -- because why?10 MR. OWEN: Well, let me then -- I -- I've11 always felt that it was intuitively, especially unfair12 to accuse him of laying behind the log when there was no13 log to lie behind. But that's -- that's not our point14 in responding to your question, Your Honor. Our point15 is simply that we think that the exception that they16 crafted in construing the statute or the statute as17 construed sweeps too broadly. The exception sweeps too18 broadly.19 Now, the Court may not necessarily -- we may20 not prevail on that eventually. We're going to litigate21 that, and I think that we will fight that out in the22 district court. But the question for this Court is23 we-­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Owen, if I25 understand you correctly in how this understanding of56￼Alderson Reporting Company18 challenging 19202122 submitted.2324 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 2557Official1 the claim relates to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, what2 you are saying is that the statute as construed was3 unconstitutional?4 MR. OWEN: Yes.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: And that that falls outside6 the bounds of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine?7 MR. OWEN: Yes, Your Honor.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Whereas, if you were saying9 that the statute -- that the application of the statute10 in this particular case was wrongful, that would not11 fall outside of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine; is that12 right?13 MR. OWEN: That's right, Your Honor, and the14 comment that was made during Respondent's argument15 about -- he said we are challenging, in his words, the16 way the State court went about applying the law to Mr.17 Skinner. That's not what we're challenging. We're￼the statute as construed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR.
