The United States, exrel. Wilson.            Mr. Browning.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.Official - Subject to Final Review  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. BROWNING:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it10111213141516171819202122232425   involves cooperative Federal and State programs.  States3please the Court:            The issue in this case is whether the word"administrative" as used in the public disclosure bar ofthe False Claims Act includes State audits and reportsor is limited to Federal sources.            If this Court were to hold that a relatorcan simply copy a State report or a State criminalindictment and then proceed with a qui tam action, therewill be a proliferation of opportunistic qui tam actionsbrought under this statute.            Such construction of the statute would havea devastating effect upon States, local governments, andthe Federal fisc.Much of the work of State governmentAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   have been an effective partner in fighting against fraud 2   and abuse with respect to those programs.  For example, 3   many States have turned to computerized software to 4   identify irregularities in connection with Medicaid 5   billings.  California has implemented a process of 6   analyzing both its Medicare and its Medicaid databases 7   in order to identify doctors who bill in excess of 8   24 hours in a given day. 9               Under the decision below, that investigatory10   work can simply be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an11   action brought based upon that public report.  The12   result is --13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But under your proposal a14   State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect,15   immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the16   information unusable by conducting a hearing.17               MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, the18   government certainly argues that it would result in19   State and local governments immunizing themselves from20   qui tam liability.21               With respect to States, the Fourth Circuit's22   decision expressly includes reports of the State23   government.  States, of course, are not liable under the24   qui tam provisions, as a result of this Court's decision25   in Vermont Department of Natural Resources v. United4Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   States ex rel. Stevens. 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it's also the 3   original source, if -- if the relator is the original 4   source of the information. 5               MR. BROWNING:  Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg, 6   that -- even if there is a State report that a -- that 7   a -- is in the public domain, a local government could 8   still be sued under that document, if -- in spite of 9   that document, by either the United States or a qui tam10   plaintiff that stands as an original source.  So --11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about the12   argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent13   provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and14   this would -- if you would -- if you include State and15   local reports, that will shrink the availability?16               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, there is no17   question that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public18   disclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 194319   and 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui20   tam action, would be barred if it was based upon21   information that was available to the -- the Federal22   Government.23               Congress decided that that cut off too many24   qui tam actions, and as a result it reached a25   compromise.  Many members of Congress wanted to totally5Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   eliminate the government knowledge bar.  On the other 2   hand, the United States Department of Justice at the 3   time was arguing that the existing bar should remain in 4   effect as a result of abusive and frivolous qui tam 5   actions and their concern with respect to that.  So a 6   compromise was reached in which the bar was completely 7   changed.  It was changed to allow for a -- for an 8   original source to bring the qui tam action, essentially 9   a relief valve that addressed Congress's concerns with10   respect to cases such as United States ex rel.11   Wisconsin v. Dean.12               It also in the 1986 amendments set out13   specific sources of information and directly identified14   the type of public information that a qui tam action can15   be based upon.  That list, of course, includes many16   sources that might or might not be readily available to17   the United States Government.  For example, it includes18   reports by a news media.  A -- an obscure article in a19   weekly publication of limited circulation does not20   realistically put the government on notice of a21   particular fraud.22               The same can be true -- said with regard to23   an action filed in Federal court, a private action24   between civil litigants based upon diversity25   jurisdiction.  If that -- if there is a summary judgment6Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   motion filed in that case and there are a number of 2   depositions, one of which might indicate fraud, that are 3   filed in that summary judgment motion and the case 4   settles, that -- there will never be -- that summary 5   judgment motion wouldn't be reviewed by the Federal 6   district court judge.  But still, there is no question 7   that the filing of that document with the Federal court 8   would constitute a public disclosure under the first 9   clause of the public disclosure bar.10               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would be a -- would it11   be a civil hearing?  A deposition -- you would consider12   a deposition to be a civil hearing?13               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, I am referring to14   a deposition that is actually filed with the court in15   connection with the summary judgment motion and the case16   then settles.  Generally, the -- the courts have --17181920   "criminal, civil, or administrative hearing."  The21   courts have consistently read that word "hearing" as --22   as including all courts' proceedings, not simply the23   hearing itself, documents that are filed with the24   clerk's office --25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Documents are -- documents7            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what provisionwould it come under?MR. BROWNING:  Justice Scalia, the phraseAlderson Reporting Company￼202122232425            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, the -- theproblem is -- is that Congress really did not speak veryclearly at all with respect to the False Claims Act, andso we're -- we're left with this mess of trying tofigure out exactly what Congress intended.The phrase --8Official - Subject to Final Review1   are a hearing?2               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, the -- if3   Congress had meant to limit that word "hearing" to4   literally in-person oral arguments or in-person5   testimony, it -- the result would be that a criminal6   indictment could be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an7   action brought based upon that.8               That, of course, was this Court's decision9   in United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess.  The -- it isclear from the congressional history that Congresswanted to change that result by -- so Congress used theword "hearing" that obviously meant more than -- thansimply --101112131415161718   doesn't go very far with me.  I mean, "hearing" means19   hearing.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Meant more than hearing?            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, and that'sthe part of the problem, is --JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's an argument thatAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE ALITO:  In your view, must an2   administrative report be a report that is generated by3   some government unit?  Could it be a report by the 4 5 6 7   broadly.  When the Congress has used the word 8   "administrative hearing," that would appear to indicate 9   action by the government.10               And, under any of the dictionary definitions11   of "administration," clearly a State administrative12   proceeding, a State administrative report, would fall13   within the scope of the dictionary definition.  We don't14   believe the Court needs to read that language as15   including private hospitals, private universities.16               JUSTICE ALITO:  But I'm not sure why.17   You -- if -- unless "administrative" is informed by the18   other adjectives in that prepositional phrase, "in a19   congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting20   Office," presumably GAO, "report," it -- unless that is21   the -- you know, unless it's informed by those other22   references, and that's why it has to be governmental,23   I'm not sure how you limit "administrative" to24   governmental reports.25               MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, the public9administration of a university, for example?            MR. BROWNING:  Justice Alito, thePetitioners would not read that phrase as -- thatAlderson Reporting Company￼3 4 5 6 7 8 9defines "administrative hearing" as, essentially, ahearing conducted by an administrative agency.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you say "twice," youmean in the first clause that says "in a criminal,civil, or administrative hearing"?            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  And then inthe second clause it proceeds to use the phraseOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   disclosure bar uses the phrase "administrative hearing"2   twice, and it's referring to Black's Law Dictionary.  It101112131415161718   statute.  But Congress was not particularly concerned19   about redundancy in the False Claims Act.  For example,"congressional, administrative, Government AccountingOffice hearing, audit, investigation, or report."            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is a redundancythere if the statute means what you say it does; it says"administrative hearing" in both the first clause andthe second clause.            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, there is aredundancy based upon Petitioner's construction of theagain it uses the phrase "congressional, administrative,or GAO."20212223   Congress.  Its head is appointed by the President.  So24   under any definition GAO would either be congressional25   or administrative, so there is a redundancy there.GAO, of course, is a body that reports to10Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final ReviewThere's also --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think there would1234   includes a GAO report.  I think that's a lawsuit.  I5 6 7 8 9don't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.            MR. BROWNING:  Well, Justice Scalia, let mealso point out that there is a redundancy in connectionbe a good lawsuit as to whether "congressional report"with the use of "audit, report, or investigation."Essentially, Congress is using the same word to meanessentially the same thing in that clause as well.101112   redundancy in the statute.  Of course, the government13   reads this entire clause as being limited to Federal14   proceedings.  They would urge a redundancy in the15   statute as well.  But what's more important is this16   Court has consistently said that it will not read the17   same phrase as having a different meaning in the same18   sentence.192021222324   does not scare the government.  I think the government25   would like to read "administrative hearing" in the11But yes, our reading does result in a            Yes, Congress has created a redundancy, butthat is no more egregious than the fact that it used thephrase "Government Accounting Office" to refer to whatwas clearly the General Accounting Office.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, well, that argumentAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   their argument today.  Of course, just 11 months ago in5   United States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic, thefirst -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federaladministrative hearing as well.MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  That is6   government argued in the Sixth Circuit that a qui tam7   action should be dismissed based upon a State court8   complaint.  They convinced the Sixth Circuit to accept9   that position and dismissed that complaint on January 1410   of this year.11               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that was on -- on the12   basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the13   second?1415161718   was done by an independent accountant?  Is that --19               MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  There are20   two audit reports -- I'm sorry, there are two reports.21   The key one is the report that identifies or asserts22   that this work at issue should have been sent out by23   bid.  That was prepared by an accounting firm for Graham24   County, North Carolina, the same auditor that was25   engaged by the county to comply with the Single Audit12            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, based uponthe first clause of the statute.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is this particular auditreport we are talking about, this is the audit reportAlderson Reporting Company￼1 Act -- 23 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that -- is that auditon file with the Department of Agriculture?            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, I would have togo beyond the record, but yes, we have conducted a --submitted a Public Information Act request, andessentially a week after the document was transmitted toGraham County it was transmitted to the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture.Official - Subject to Final Review            JUSTICE BREYER:  The arguments in this case,my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I101112   can remember, really.  For each one, there is a13   counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air.14               So if -- since we have to decide it, it15   should -- should I take this into account:  That if the16   Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that17   there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards18   at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have19   them.  No question.  They front-run the government.20   They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in21   the newspaper.22               But if you are right, then they are going to23   have to assign people to look at these obscure24   administrative reports that didn't even get in the25   newspaper.  So they want to do that, they don't have13Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   people to do it, and they say these people are 2   performing a service of sorts by reading them, the 3   reports, for them and telling them about it.  And there 4   it is, balanced. 5               But they are the ones who suffer.  You see, 6   they suffer both ways.  They suffer if people don't tell 7   them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting 8   unjustified rewards because the money comes from the 9   Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent.  So if10   they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special11   attention to their views as to how the balance works12   out?13               MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, Justice14   Breyer, first of all, the government hasn't been15   consistent.  As we pointed out in United States ex rel.16   Poteet, they have taken the exact opposite position with17   regard to clause 1 in the first circuit.18               But the real issue here and what should19   concern the Court is the fact that there will be a20   tremendous number of opportunistic qui tam plaintiffs21   that arise.  If someone can simply go to an ongoing22   State or local government investigation, copy it, and23 bring it --24               JUSTICE BREYER:  As you can tell, I have25   taken that point in.14Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. BROWNING:  Yes. 2               JUSTICE BREYER:  So my question wasn't that. 3   My question was, Should I or should I not give them a 4   little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the 5   ones who know it best, that they are the victims? 6               MR. BROWNING:  Well, I would suggest that 7   the weight that should be given is to the partners of 8   the Federal government, States and local governments 9   that are in the trenches administering these programs,10   that will have tremendous difficulty if there is a rash11   of qui tam actions that are brought that disrupt ongoing12   Medicaid and other investigations.13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How will that happen?14   Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation15   is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal16   or State law to require the disclose of ongoing17   investigative materials?18               I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied19   them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never20   permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information21   Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of22   ongoing investigative material.  So I am a little bit23   confused by how that would happen.24               MR. BROWNING:  Justice Sotomayor, there are25   going to be some exceptions to many States' Public15Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   Information Act requests, things such as attorney-client 2   communications, in some cases criminal investigations. 3   But for most States there will not be any sort of 4   prohibition against a plaintiff's attorney filing a 5   Public Information Act request saying, print out -- give 6   us a copy of all printouts that show disparities and 7   irregularities with regard to Medicaid billings. 8               Moreover, most States are -- by law are 9   required to receive complaints concerning the State's10   Medicaid program.  Those are generally processed by the11   State's system integrity program.  And those reports are12   going to be readily available to Public Information Act13   requests.14               Essentially, what this Court should be15   worried about are State employees who know where the16   documents can be located.  You can simply copy the17   document, bring a qui tam action, and produce a windfall18   for yourself, potentially disrupting the State19   investigation.  And if Congress really wanted to do20   that, if they wanted to create this rash of ill-advised21   qui tam actions, this flood that's about to fall upon22   the States, Congress should have written a little bit23   more clearly before doing so.  It isn't consistent with24   the language of the statute or with congressional25   intent.16Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               Throughout the legislative history it is 2   clear that what Congress was intending to do was to have 3   access to true insiders, the whistleblowers, to obtain 4   information that would be confidential, that would not 5   otherwise be available to the Federal Government. 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But Congress obviously 7   wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was 8   the one that you are announcing then it should have just 9   permitted original sources to sue.  But that's not the10   choice it made.  It broadened the scope of qui tam111213141516171819202122232425actions to include more sources or more reward forindividuals who don't have original information.            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, it -- itadded the original source provision, and it identifiedcertainly sources of information and said, you cannotbring an action based upon those specific sources.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I --            MR. BROWNING:  Those include --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question:Is the fact that they've included the news mediaconsistent with your view?            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  That seems to be a muchmore open source of information than you're raising.            MR. BROWNING:  Exactly.  The government17Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   argues that the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal,2   the public disclosure bar should therefore be read as3   exclusively Federal.  But the existence of this category4 5 6 7 8 9of news media indicates that Congress did not intend thepublic disclosure bar to be exclusively Federal sources.            There -- there -- under the government'stheory that all of this fall -- the entire publicdisclosure bar should be read as limited to Federalsources, the only news media that would be able to -- tofall within the scope of the public disclosure bar wouldbe the Voice of America, which is the only Federal newsmedia currently in existence, to my knowledge.1011121314151617   terribly persuasive.  In the statute there are separate18   provisions, they talk about disclosures "in criminal,19   civil or administrative hearings," "in a congressional20   administrative or Government Accounting Office report,21   or from the news media."  Simply because you want to22   limit "administrative" or not limit "administrative"23   does not mean that the other side's view requires news24   media to be modified by "Federal."JUSTICE SCALIA:  Stars and Stripes, maybe.            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  Thank you,Justice Scalia.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that's not25               MR. BROWNING:  Mr. Chief Justice, two points18Alderson Reporting Company￼1011   clauses.  They are really phrases.1213141516171819   phrases.20Official - Subject to Final Review1   I would like to make in response is:  First, these2   clauses -- and there are three clauses, the first one3   beginning with "in" and the third one beginning with4   "from" -- they do not serve different purposes.

It was only on October 3, 1986, that24   the -- when it was -- the provision was finally enacted25   by the Senate, that this second "in" was added before19MR.

HURT               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MR. HURT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            The decision of the Fourth Circuit is16171819202122232425"administrative" which is at issue here is sandwichedbetween the terms "congressional" --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's begin at thebeginning, and that is with the first phrase with the,what is it, "civil, criminal, administrative hearing."Do you as the government -- do you agree with thegovernment that you have to insert "Federal" there, too?Or does that phrase --            MR. HURT:  No.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- include States?22Official - Subject to Final Reviewcorrect because the text of the False Claims Act compelsthe result, and the purpose -- and also the purposes of101112   the 1986 amendments to the Act.  As the Fourth Circuit13   noted, Congress grouped the disclosure sources in14   paragraph (a) of the public disclosure bar into three15   distinct categories.  In CATEGORY 2, the termAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review123456   isn't?  Suppose the general "civil, criminal,7   administrative" is read to mean -- include State.  Why8   shouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin            MR. HURT:  No, the -- the text of category 2compels the result here, although we do believe that thebetter view of category 1 is that it is also Federal aswell, and the context -- the overall context --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose it 9   phrases, be read in pari materia?10               MR. HURT:  Because each of those categories11   is distinct, not only grammatically, but as far as12   function.  The first category is clearly adjudicative in13   nature.  The second is non-adjudicative.  And the third14   category is -- is news media and stands on its own.15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why should we read16   the second category back to alter the meaning of the17   first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to18   alter the meaning of the second?  It -- it is absolutely19   clear when you read this, "in a criminal, civil, or20   administrative hearing"; there is no limitation to21   Federal on that.  And you acknowledge that the criminal22   and civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal23   proceedings, right?  So when you read that phrase,24   "administrative" simply means, obviously means State25   administrative.23Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review123456   less compelling, we agree.  The argument for category 17   is most compelling because these categories are distinct8   and should be looked at as separate units for that            Now, why shouldn't I read that forward andsay, well, since it means State there, it must meanState in the next one, in a congressional,administrative, or GAO report.MR. HURT:  The argument for category 2 is 9   purpose.  You have category 2 as non-adjudicative, and10   category 1 is adjudicative.  And so you have -- you have11   distinction there.12               If you were looking at the three categories13   and, for instance, you don't say category 3 and say14   category 3 is nongovernmental, so therefore we should15   construe category 2 to include private administrative16   reports.17               JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is, what sense18   does that make?  I mean -- and I thought you said that19   the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil20   or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does21   not apply to State proceedings in your view.  You said22232425   on that?  I thought it was virtually -- what is the24that was the better view.            MR. HURT:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the state of the lawAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   state of the law?2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say that just as to3   administrative.  Don't you acknowledge that the criminal4 5 6 7 8 9and civil apply to State criminal and civil?            MR. HURT:  No.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want the whole thing tobe just Federal?            MR. HURT:  No, we think the better view isthat the whole category is --JUSTICE SCALIA:  The whole category?MR. HURT:  -- exclusively Federal.JUSTICE BREYER:  I think you'd have to say10111213   that.  But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?141516171819   I mean, to me it makes no sense.  We are only talking20   about things that don't get into the newspapers.  So --21   and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of22   this would be, look, we don't have people to go send23   around to every -- read every State report.  We just24   don't have that personnel.  So we rely on these            MR. HURT:  The -- the court of appeals havebasically gone the other way, but they have looked at itin a very superficial matter and have not reallydirectly addressed the issue.JUSTICE BREYER:  What are we supposed to do?25   whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified.  I25Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   would think the same thing would be absolutely true of 2   State criminal proceedings that don't get into the 3   newspaper.  There are probably 50 -- several 4   thousands -- thousands and thousands. 5               So how to read these differently is a 6   problem for me.  And I think that's on your side of it. 7   But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to 8   me is the -- is the question here. 9               MR. HURT:  Well, the False Claims Act in10   sections, the pertinent sections 3729 and 3730, refers11   to the Federal Government many times but never with the12   modifier "Federal."  They do it through context.  And infact --131415161718192021222324   hearing.  Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal25   hearing, not State.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any history, whichI pay attention to -- is there any legislative historyor anything else that you can point to, to me that'simportant, showing that that first criminal hearingmeans just Federal?            MR. HURT:  Yes, the -- the legislativehistory shows throughout -- beginning with the House andSenate bills and going forward that these -- the earlierversion shows these were exclusively Federal.JUSTICE BREYER:  And they meant criminal26Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. HURT:  Exactly, and you have references2   --3 4   looking for the backup for that. 5               MR. HURT:  Yes.  The legislative history is 6   clear on that point, and in fact if you look at the 7   Senate bill that was passed August 11, you have the 8   final version of paragraph (A), and then you -- which 9   was enacted in law, and paragraph (B) was somewhat10   different, but it had the phrase "government or news11   media," "disclosures to government or news media."  It's12   clearly referencing back to paragraph (A) and13   categorizing those sources as either sources of capital14   "G" government, the Federal Government, or the news15   media.16               And the changes -- the subsequent changes to17   paragraph (B) give no indication that Congress's18   background understanding of that changed.  There is no19   indication of that.  And of course you have the Senate20   sponsors of the bill making the same statements that21   this was clearly Federal.22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- what was the23   reason for that be, given that there are so many joint24   Federal-State grant programs, like the one that's25   involved here?  Why wouldn't a State report be as much27JUSTICE BREYER:  You say "exactly."  I wasAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   of a public disclosure as a Federal report?  I mean, we 2   are told that this particular report was filed with the 3   U.S. Department of Agriculture. 4               MR. HURT:  Because it gives no -- a report 5   produced by a State or a local government -- and again, 6   their argument is not just State but every little local 7   entity producing these reports fall under the 8   category 2, according to them.  Simply the fact that a 9   local or State official might be producing this report10   gives no indication that the Federal Government is11   focusing on it or looking at it.  And in fact --1213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE ALITO:  You think the FederalGovernment is focusing on everything that is disclosedin every civil proceeding that occurs in Federal court?            MR. HURT:  No, but Congress was selectinggeneral categories and as a general category the Federalproceedings they thought were more likely to put thegovernment on notice --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  News media, they are likelyto be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?            MR. HURT:  Well, I think that as a generalcategory it was reasonable for Congress to assume thatthe news media disclosures would be disseminated ingeneral to the general public and would put pressure onthe government to take action, and the government would28Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   pay attention to that in general.2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, they could have3   said "national news media."  It didn't say "national4   news media."  It said "news media."5               MR. HURT:  It said "news media."6               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It includes a local radio7   station, a local community newspaper, right?  All of89 10 11 12 1315               MR. HURT:  Well, under, under -- this Court16   recognized in Cook County that the 1986 amendments17   abolished the government knowledge rule and allowed the18   qui tam relators to bring cases even where the19   government, Federal Government, had possession of20   information about the fraud.21               What we are doing here is not even -- we are22   not even sure the government has possession of these23   reports.  A lot of these reports are just sitting in24   file cabinets all around the country in these little25   administrative office buildings.29that is included.            MR. HURT:  Congress was drawing the lines --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And yet, State proceedings,which are excluded, right?            MR. HURT:  Yes.                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even state supreme court14   cases and so forth.  It seems strange to me.Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Hurt, let me just give2   you what's really troubling me about this case.  You3   have two citizens of a small town.  One of them goes to4   the hearing and gets all this information, the other one5   doesn't go to the hearing and reads about it in the6   newspaper.  The latter is a permissible plaintiff, the7 8 9former is not; is that correct?            MR. HURT:  Correct.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that make any sense?MR. HURT:  It does, because Congress drew1011   it -- picked it as a general category.  They were121314151617   makes sense.  It just shows that Congress wasn't18   thinking clearly.  There's as difference between the19   two.thinking probably most likely The New York Times ornewspapers that have actual investigative reportingresources, and that was what they had in mind.Here you have a whole --JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't show that it20               MR. HURT:  One of the huge problems with21   Petitioners' position is it's going to sweep into22   category 2 an enormous number of reports and audits that23   the Federal Government is likely to never see, never24   come across, and you need these concerned citizens to25   go -- you want the citizens to go and look at these.30Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, are you2   sure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched3   between two Federal descriptions?  Are you sure4   "congressional" is limited to Federal Congress?  The5   first definition in Black's Dictionary is "a formal6   meeting of delegates."  And I don't know -- maybe I7 8 911   generally conceded that that would be Federal.  Andshould -- I don't know if all 50 States refer to theirlegislature by some term other than "Congress."                 MR. HURT:  The Petitioners have not pointed10   to an example of a State congress.  I think it's12131415   Justice Ginsburg's very first question.  I want you to16   assume that in category 1 it means State or Federal.17   Maybe you disagree, maybe you don't.  I want you to18   assume that.  If we assume that, does it make any sense19202122232425to confine category 2 to Federal only?            MR. HURT:  Yes --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what's thepractical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- Iwant to know the practical rationale for that, thepractical reasons why that should make sense.            MR. HURT:  Because reports and audits are31also, when you look at GAO, that's clearly a Federalentity there as well.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'd like to go back toAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   just a totally -- a category that is much -- many 2   magnitudes greater than the number of criminal, civil, 3   and administrative hearings.  You are going to have 4   millions of documents all over this country in file 5   cabinets that are generated by local and State 6   governments that there is no possibility the vast 7   majority of those would ever come across the attention 8   of the Federal Government.  And so you want concerned 9   citizens to be looking through, monitoring their local10   governments, digging up these reports and bringing11   lawsuits based on those.  The Federal Government's12131415   right?  I mean, do you think that finding the way the16   government wants us to find will produce a revision of17   this really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do18   you think that finding for the other side, giving the19   government some incentive to get this fixed, would20   likely produce a proper amendment?  What do you think?21   I think the latter, to tell you the truth.22               MR. HURT:  Well, unfortunately we have to23   deal with the statute as it is.  And, you know, the --24   our position uses all the clues in the statute to25   construe it.  The other side construes it in a crude32simply not going to do it.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which decision of ours doyou think would prompt Congress to go back and do thisAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   manner and says, let's treat it like a laundry list,2   let's not use any of the grammatical clues in construing3   this language, and also let's construe it in a way that4   ignores what Congress did in 1986, which was to abolish5   the government knowledge part.  This is a reimposition6789   report."  Would you read "news media" to beof that bar.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that the second     phrase said "in a congressional, news media, or GAO10   governmental?1112131415161718   Accounting Office report."  And you say you have to read19202122232425"administrative" in light of "congressional" and "GAO."But what if it said "in a congressional, news media, orGovernment Accounting Office report"?            MR. HURT:  I think that --            JUSTICE ALITO:  Why wouldn't you make thesame argument with relation to "news media"?            MR. HURT:  I think the contextual clues33MR. HURT:  No, I would not.            JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the differencebetween that and the way it's phrased now?            MR. HURT:  Because it is -- Congress did putit in a separate category, so --            JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no.  Right now we have"in a congressional, administrative, or GovernmentAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review123456   nonfederal.  Here you have a category that you can't7   construe consistently as exclusively Federal, given the8   contextual clues in there.  So as it is drafted now, ifwould be less compelling there in that situation, andyou would have --JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that?            MR.

So there was no18   real distinction there.  It was not really a19   governmental report, in the truest sense of the word, as20   it should be construed or regarded for purposes of the21   public disclosure bar.22               And that's -- that shows the real -- one of23   the real problems of going down to the -- to the local24   and State level.  You get all of these problems where25   the recipient is generating the reports rather than the34you look at all the clues you do have distinctcategories that can be construed each on its own merits.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This audit report isrequired by Federal law, isn't it?                 MR. HURT:  Yes, as are many reports,14   Medicaid reports by private recipients, today.

HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:            As I think the discussion this morningillustrates, the Federal nature of the second category,the phrase that is directly at issue in this case, is22232425   other Latin phrase.  If you begin at the beginning andGAO are Federal and under the doctrine or canon ofconstruction noscitur a sociis --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let me go back to the35Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   you begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say 2   is modified by Federal, "civil, criminal or 3   administrative proceeding," why shouldn't that drive the 4   statute, what's in the first phrase? 5               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor, I 6   -- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that 7   that's a better interpretation of the first clause, but 8   I will take it as the premise. 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it's a lot hard to10   say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi --11   means Federal civil, criminal and administrative12 hearings.13               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  It -- it may indeed14   be harder to do that.  We think that it is warranted in15   light of the policy that motivated Congress and in light16   of other references to Federal administrative, civil and17   criminal hearings in the statute.  But even if those18   reasons which we think justify limiting the first19   category to Federal proceedings -- the Court were to20   disagree with that, that would not justify disregarding21   the clear indications of the Federal limitations on the22   second clause.  And there is no policy --23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- I didn't24   mean to interrupt.  Clear limitations, you really have25   only one, right?  I mean you have no argument construing36Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   administrative in a Federal way other than it is 2   sandwiched between two other Federal -- 3               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor, I 4   think that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at 5   the very beginning of the argument illustrated, the 6   literal language of the word administrative would 7   encompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or 8   universities as well.  Now Petitioner es hewed that 9   interpretation --10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we would just11   -- we would just take the sections from your brief today12   and say well no, you have got to read it in the context13   in which it appears and this is all Federal, which means14   it's all governmental.15               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's -- that's16   right, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular17   nature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government.18   As is the Court's decision in Cook County made clear,19   municipal governmental entities are with respect to the20   False Claims Act the same as private corporations.  The21   -- the Court recognized that municipalities are the22   recipients of many Federal dollars.  In that case the23   local governmental entity whose conduct is at issue was24   a county hospital.  And -- and county hospitals receive25   funds under the same programs that private hospitals --37Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE BREYER:  I just want to get your 2   expertise on this, because you have probably read the 3   legislative history of the 1986 amendment.  All right, 4   am I right in thinking this?  If I go back and read 5   it -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this 6   entire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or 7   conference, does the word State appear in any relevant8 context? 9               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No.10               JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not right.  Okay.  So11   when it appears --12               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I guess it13   depends on what you mean by the relevant context.14               JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'm -- the relevant15   context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in16   respect to the first clause, "criminal, civil, or17   administrative proceeding."  Is there any indication18   that those were meant to apply -- any indication that19   those were meant to apply to State as opposed to20   uniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative21   proceedings?22 23 24 25            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor, itis -- it is clear from the legislative --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.

That's right, Your Honor.16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  In both houses or just one17   house?1819   -- the committee report and the bill that was recorded20   by the House which states specifically at that point,21   the public disclosure bar referenced information which22   the Government, capital G, disclosed the basis of23   allegations in a prior administrative civil proceeding.24   That was the House.25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The House.39MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, we have theAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- well, North 2   Carolina has got a government, too. 3               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Excuse me? 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  North Carolina has a 5   government, too. 6               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, as we note, 7   Your Honor, the statute uses the term "Government" with 8   a capital G throughout to refer to the Federal 9   Government.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Same rule for11   Congress?12               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Excuse me?13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Same rule for14   congressional?15161718   referred to as congresses.  And that is one of the19   anomalies that petitioners simply cannot explain:  why20   Congress would have thought that an administrative            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, congressional-- the -- the term congressional is frequently usedwithout a capital, but State legislatures are not21   report issued by a local school board should give rise22   to the bar, but a report or a hearing conducted by a23   State legislature would not.24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was an explanation25   for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what40Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was 2   generating reports, audits, as distinguished from 3   administrative agencies. 4               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well -- well, Your 5   Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that 6   programs are administered by the executive branch more 7   than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to 8   think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if 9   those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with10   respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public11   disclosure.  The reason that Congress didn't include12   State legislative reports is because it didn't include13   State reports at all.  It was --14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well that -- that doesn't15   follow like the night the day.  It could be, as it was16   explained, they didn't include State legislatures17   because they didn't think they would be generating18   relevant material.19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor, I20   -- I think that it is more likely as -- as the21   development and progress of the clause reflects, that22   Congress was focused on what does the government know23   and what does the disclosure show about the whether the24   government is already or is likely to focus on the25 fraud.41Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the Justice Department 2   seeking to get this -- this piece of -- of statutory 3   text clarified?  I mean, you do have some operation over 4   there that proposes to Congress amendments of those 5   provisions that are not working out well.  Is there -- 6   is there any effort to get this clarified? 7               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  There -- I -- there 8   are currently under consideration bills or, and as I 9   understand it, they are not, there are other bills that10   are in contemplation that would revise the language of11   the statute, but -- but would not necessarily focus on12   this.  There are a number of other issues connected --13141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could it make it worse?            (Laughter.)            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I -- I don't know.But of course --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think the question washas the Department of Justice, recognizing that there'sa circuit split this very question recommended thatCongress amend the statute in this particular --            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I -- I don'tbelieve that as of yet the department has taken aspecific position on -- on the legislation that iscontemplated in this particular ambiguity.            JUSTICE BREYER:  There is one ambiguity42Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and2   second refers to State as well as Federal.  If the3   debate took place in a context where everyone's just4   thinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put5   in the word Federal.  They don't think of everything.6   All right.  Now, that's my question.7               You started with the House.  The House to me8   does think just of Federal.  The Senate's ambiguous on9 10 1113   anything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate14   versions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they15   did actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's16   sort of mixed up?  Or am I going to see that that17   context there is Federal?18               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  The context is --19   is Federal.  References to States in connection with the20   act that Congress has thought about it are treating21   States like other private qui tam relators.22               They Petitioner referred to the Dean case,23   and, in fact, that was something that the -- the24   legislative history refers to, but what was offensive25   about the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin43that point --            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  The Senate --                 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and the conference is12   yet more ambiguous on that point.  So is thereAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   had been the original source of the information, but had 2   been barred because it had provided that information to 3   the government. 4               And, under the government knowledge bar, 5   they had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have 6   been taken care of under the original source provision, 7   but it doesn't reflect a view that States have a 8   particular distinctive role. 9               In fact, as this Court's decision in Cook10   County reflects, municipalities are treated just like11   any private corporation for purposes of the act.  They12   can be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam13   relators, but there is no reason to construe the statute14   in a way that would allow a local government,15   technically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by16   disclosing the facts that would be the underlying17   information support of the fraud claim in, perhaps, a18   report that was intended to -- to whitewash the19   situation --20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think that the --21   when a -- when State employees want to immunize22   themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we23   will disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick24   it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.25               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor, I44Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   think it's important to note that, in order to be a 2   public disclosure -- the second category at the very 3   least -- all that needs to have happened is that 4   information be disclosed to -- to one additional person. 5               That -- and that makes a lot of sense when 6   we are talking about disclosures of the government -- 7   Federal government's own reports because, if the Federal 8   government is already investigating and pursuing the 9   fraud, one other person that finds out about it and then10   files a qui tam action on the basis of the government's11   own effort is precisely the situation that Congress12   sought to preclude.13               But it doesn't make any senses when we are14   talking about a disclosure to an individual by a State15 or local --16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's lots of17   disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal18   reports that the government isn't pursuing.19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, we think that20   the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types21   of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced22   in the clause are the type that would evidence that the23   government is pursuing them.24               And -- but where a State -- perhaps a local25   school board discloses facts that might give rise to an45Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   allegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only2   one or two members of the public in attendance, there is3   no reason to think that that information is going to be4   brought to the Federal government's attention.5               The purpose of the bar is to balance --6   Congress was seeking to balance two rules.  One is to7   encourage qui tam relators to bring information and8   bring suit where the information was unlikely to be9   something that the government -- Federal government was10   focusing on.11               Where the Federal government was able to12   protect itself and bring this suit on its own, then13   there's no reason for the Federal government to have to14   share its recovery.15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why can't it -- why16   can't it protect itself if these reports are in its17   possession?  How are they any more in the -- or less in18   the government's possession than articles in the news19   media, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative20   hearings?212223242546            You, yourself, make it very clear that thegovernment -- it isn't keeping track of all of thoseother sources.            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor,Petitioners' reference to this audit being in theAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   possession of the government -- it's happenstance that 2   this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was 3   sent to the Federal government official. 4               But the vast majority of State and local 5   governmental investigations, audits, and reports, are 6   not going to be given to the Federal government, and 7   even though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act, 8   which is only a very narrow subset of audits that States 9   or local governments perform -- do not actually disclose10   the allegations of the fraud.11               In order to get to the actual information of12   the fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be13   brought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency.14   Usually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the15   most money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a16   different Federal program, so it has to be brought to17   the attention of the program whose interests are18   actually at stake.19               They have to go beyond the report that is --20   that is publicly available in the clearinghouse website,21   which tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying22   report which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all23   Petitioners say is that the working papers of the24   auditor are available to the government, not even in the25   government's possession, they are available to the47Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9government if it requests it.            The government has to drill down many levelsbefore it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that argumentsuggesting that the court didn't even need to reach thisissue, even assuming that the State administrativereports are included in the bar?            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No -- no, YourHonor, I don't think so.Official - Subject to Final Review101112   show the fraud?  That's not your argument?            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, aren't you arguingthat what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to13141516171819   was that this person wasn't chosen by bidding.  But20   aren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?21               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  There -- there were22   multiple allegations.  One of the allegations underlying23   the relator's claim is that the government -- the county24   certified that certain procedures were followed that25   would have included a requirement that it be bid out,48            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No -- again, thisreport here did have information that was indicative offraud, and this report --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In which way?MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Excuse me?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which way?  All it saidAlderson Reporting Company￼1819202122232425            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  And what is atissue here is whether the Federal government is evergoing to learn of the fraud.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Browning, you have six minutes.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            MR. BROWNING:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.            Justice Breyer, if I could first turn to49Official - Subject to Final Review1   and that it was not.2               Another was that certain work was paid for3   or billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed4   well, so there were -- there were different allegations,5   and where that would be disclosed to a single person,6   that would constitute a public disclosure, at least with7   respect to Federal --8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the Attorney9   General can always bring suit, right?  I mean, all weare arguing about is whether this information that is inthe in the State and local thing could be the basis of aqui tam suit.            MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  But only if we --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If the government finds outabout it, the Attorney General could always bring suit,10111213141516   right?17Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   your comments or your questions about legislative 2   history; here, I think the legislative history tells us 3   very little because of the many changes in the Senate 4   version and the House version, and unfortunately, there 5   was not a conference committee report, so we won't know 6   the nature of the compromise. 7               At most, the legislative history helps us to 8   show what Congress was generally concerned about, and 9   throughout the original committee, the Senate and House10   report, there is a concern about qui tam actions based11   upon public information.12               JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I agree with you about13   that.  I think it's the silence, though, that might cut141516171819202122232425against you.            MR. BROWNING:  Well --            JUSTICE BREYER:  And the reason that it's --it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking thatcuts against you is because of this sorting of thecontext where they are focusing on Federal.            And, if everybody is working in thatcontext, then nothing said about State means they arejust assuming it's all applying to Federal.            Now, what I'm looking for, you might be ableto put your finger on, is something that shows that mylast statement is not right.50Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Justice Breyer, that thegovernment assumes and repeats throughout its brief thatthe False Claims Act is exclusively Federal in nature;therefore, you read all of its terms as essentiallybeing -- being Federal.            That, of course, does not answer whatCongress intended with the public disclosure bar --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  When we say everybody'sworking in a certain context, how -- how many people isOfficial - Subject to Final Review10   everybody?  What percentage of the House and of the11   Senate were involved in these committees that were12   drafting these bills and that issued the committee13 report?14151617181920212223   Federal.24               It, of course, includes news media, which is25   not Federal.  It also includes criminal, civil, or51            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Justice Scalia, yourpoint is well-taken, that this would only be --            JUSTICE BREYER:  I think in the -- it was --it probably came out in governmental affairs in theSenate, which I think had 17 members at the time.MR. BROWNING:  Yes.            Continuing with your -- your question, if Icould, Justice Breyer, that there is nothing to indicatethat the public disclosure bar should be exclusivelyAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   administrative hearings.  But moreover, there are many2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9aspects of the False Claims Act that are not exclusivelyFederal in nature.            The very change that we are talking about --the -- the change to the public disclosure bar was aresult of a push by the National Association of AttorneyGenerals to actually change the public disclosure bar tomake sure that States could bring qui tam actions.            That is why the public disclosure barincludes an original source provision.10111213   earlier.  Do you have any tie-breaker on your side?14               I mean, if we do decide the arguments are15   pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the16   Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser17   in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a18   percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them19   strike the balance.20               What argument do you have on your side?21               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, again, that our22   concern from the perspective of the States -- and it's a23   concern shared by local governments -- is the reading24   that Respondents advocate will produce a flood of qui25 tam --52            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To -- to follow up,I think it was a question that Justice Breyer askedAlderson Reporting Company￼19202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what your claim is --is that the government -- the Federal government is notthe only person harmed?            MR. BROWNING:  Yes.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, therefore -- you know,we should listen to them, so long as they don't -- theywant to come out this way, you are saying the State and53Official - Subject to Final Review1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's the same --2   that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced3   on the other side.  For example, is -- do -- have we4 5 6 7 8 910ever said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course,with a private Attorney General and all that.            Have we -- does -- is there any authorityfor the idea that we should read it restrictivelybecause of that?                 MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, it does give rise     to a -- a false claim will, of course, give rise to11   criminal liability.  Moreover, it is a case dealingwith --we ever said that that's a basis for reading the act12131415   restrictively?16               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, there is some17   older authority to that affect.  The specific case -- I18   apologize.  The name escapes me.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Have we ever -- haveAlderson Reporting Company￼1234   harmed.56 7 8 9            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- are significantly            MR. BROWNING:  We are -- we are partners --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which the Federalgovernment doesn't care about, right?Official - Subject to Final Reviewlocal governments --            MR. BROWNING:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia.            MR. BROWNING:  The Federal government has, Ithink, taken a very short-sighted view because thesesort of qui tam actions will be very disruptive to whatthe Federal government's partners are actually doing inthe trenches in administering these programs.1011121314   is clear that it is not exclusively Federal.  When it15   was amended in 1986, Congress changed Section 3732(b),16   which allowed pendent State claims to be brought, so a17   State, if there is a Federal false claims action, could18   intervene to protect the State's portions of the -- the19   monies that are at issue.Moreover, the Federal False Claims Act -- it20               Moreover, in Section 3733(l)(7)(A), the21   civil investigative demand provisions, Congress22   expressly viewed the word "administrative" to include,23   not only Federal administrative proceedings, but State24   administrative proceedings as well.25               JUSTICE BREYER:  So your point here is -- I54Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   will put it in cash terms, is the Federal government, 2   who will pay a lot of qui tam lawyers some percent to go 3   and look through all these State criminal hearings and 4   State reports and all these things that didn't get into 5   the newspaper and to bring cases, so it may be cheaper 6   to pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that. 7               Now, your point is that they get a little 8   over-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions 9   that maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the10   Federal government is going to have to hire people to11   sort those out anyway, and so would the States in that12   kind of mess.13               Is that your point?14               MR. BROWNING:  Yes.  They will be very15   enthusiastic if they can simply take a State report16   showing Medicaid fraud and bring a qui tam action.  That17   will be very disruptive to states and to local18   governments.19202122232425            Thank you, Your Honor.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)55Alderson Reporting Company￼Official -
