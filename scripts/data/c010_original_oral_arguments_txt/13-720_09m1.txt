Marvel Enterprises.      Mr. Melnik.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MELNIKON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. MELNIK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      Brulotte's per se ban on patent royalties onpost­expiration use should be discarded because it is arule without a reason.  Brulotte is widely recognized asan outdated and misguided decision that prohibitsroyalty arrangements that are frequently sociallybeneficial.      Brulotte suppresses innovation andinterferes with the goals of the patent system,increasing the likelihood that potentially breakthroughdiscoveries by universities and research hospitals suchas the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center will never reachpatients and consumers.  Discarding ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are now, so what are they doing?MR. MELNIK:I apologize.OfficialAlderson Reporting Company3￼Official1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 like the industry has fallen apart. I don't see any3 examples of ­­ of this.4 MR. MELNIK: Well, the ­­ the examples that5 we have are the amicus briefs. In other words, the6 entities that are ­­ that do this licensing on a7 day­to­day basis are telling the Court in their amicus8 briefs that the ­­ the Brulotte rule is having this9 suppressed effect; in other words, that certain10 licensing arrangements that would otherwise ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why ­­ why should that be12 so, given what you say? In ­­ in your brief you say,13 license ­­ this is at 9 and 10, bottom of 9 ­­ the14 "license payment terms, consequently, reflect the15 anticipated value of the authorization to use the16 patented invention before the patent expires."17 All you have to do is make it clear that,18 although the payments continue after expiration, they19 are for the pre­expiration period.20 So it's ­­ it's ­­ I don't understand why21 this should be so troublesome if the contract says these22 payments will be spread out over whatever period of23 time, but they are for the patent during the period when24 it was valid. If you say the next sentence is “even if25 they're nominally measured by post­expiration use, theyAlderson Reporting CompanyI ­­ I mean, it's not4￼Official51 nonetheless represent an amortization of the predicted2 value of the pre­expiration authorization." If you say3 that in the contract, then I don't see where there's a4 problem.5 MR. MELNIK: The distinction, Justice6 Ginsburg, is between what you're paying for and how7 you're paying for it. The what that you're paying for8 is an estimate of the value of the use of the patent9 during the patent term.10 What Brulotte currently permits is one11 method of how to pay for it, which is to defer payment12 into the post­expiration period. What Brulotte doesn't13 currently permit is to defer ­­ is to stretch the14 royalty base, to defer accrual into the post­expiration15 period. And deferred accrual allows parties to do16 something that deferred payment does not, which is to17 shift the risk of commercialization failure and18 innovation failure from the licensee to the licensor.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Aren't there ways to get20 around that as well? I mean, why don't you just enter21 into a joint venture?22 MR. MELNIK: So, Justice Kagan, I guess my23 first answer to that is that's not the right question.24 The right question is, if you're prohibiting something25 that doesn't make sense, the initial question should be￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial6￼1 why are you prohibiting it? But ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, possibly, except that3 we have statutory stare decisis, and to the extent that4 we think something is not really causing a problem in5 the real world, why overrule something against that6 basic backdrop principle?7 MR. MELNIK: So the ­­ the next answer to8 your question, then, is that the ­­ the alternative9 arrangements are not risk redistributive in the same way10 that royalty ­­ that the deferral of accrual is11 risk­free distributive. What do I mean by that? If you12 stretch the royalty base into the post­expiration period13 in situations where you're ­­ where early stage14 technology is involved where there may not be any sales15 until fairly late and stretching into the16 post­expiration period, you allow the licensee to say,17 I'm going to take on this risk but in exchange,18 licensor, you're going to bear the risk that if the19 product fails, I won't have to pay much because if there20 aren't any sales, I don't have to pay you.21 Payment postponement, for example, doesn't22 allow the parties to do that because even if you23 postpone the payment, you still owe. The obligation to24 pay has accrued during the term, and even if you have to25 pay later, you still have to pay. That's theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial7￼1 fundamental difference between payment postponement,2 which is not risk redistributive and ­­ which is3 permitted by Brulotte. And accrual postponement4 which ­­5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but I was suggesting6 that either could be accomplished, both could be7 accomplished through other means, and particularly8 through just entering into a joint venture rather than9 having a license arrangement.10 MR. MELNIK: So those kinds of arrangements11 may not be realistic for the kinds of entities that are12 most directly impacted by the Brulotte prohibition;13 universities, research hospitals particular ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that what it is? Because15 when I was looking at the amicus briefs here, I was16 struck by the fact that there really are ­­ are not17 companies on the amicus brief. There are not for­profit18 entities. It's all nonprofit entities. And is that19 because nonprofit entities have this particular problem,20 that they can't make the arrangements that would21 otherwise get around the Brulotte rule?22 MR. MELNIK: Well, it's not all nonprofits.23 We had ­­ we had an amicus brief from Biotime which was24 a ­­ a private company's. But one of the ­­ one of the25 groups of entities that are most directly impacted areAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial81 universities, research hospitals, and the like because2 they're the ones where the ­­ the ­­ not all license ­­3 licensing situations are going to be a good fit for ­­4 for accrual deferral. In many situations, this kind of5 arrangement may not make sense for the parties, and they6 wouldn't enter into it.7 One paradigmatic example in the situation8 where the parties may desire to defer accrual but are9 prohibited by Brulotte from doing so are very early10 stage technology. And who generates early stage11 technology? It's frequently universities, research12 hospitals, and the like. So, yes, those are entities ­­13 one of the groups of entities that are most directly14 affected by the ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well ­­ well, you ­­ you16 quoted in ­­ in your brief extensively about quotes from17 the hospital briefs and ­­ and the ­­ and the research18 briefs. But these parties have recently been to19 Congress with reference to the whole drug and20 pharmaceutical industry, and Congress is certainly aware21 of this rule and has left it alone. And you're asking22 us now to add on to the remedies Congress has already23 given.24 MR. MELNIK: Well, Justice Kennedy, I would25 say that not so recently ­­ and I think that we have￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial91 demonstrated special justification within the meaning of2 this Court's case law for overruling this kind of3 precedent, and I would say that we have demonstrated it4 in four ways.5 First, we have shown that since the Court6 considered Brulotte, the patent equals market power7 presumption has fallen, and it ­­ and it has fallen8 actually since the time ­­ last time that Congress9 looked at this in 1988.10 There has been a foundational shift ­­11 second, there has been a foundational shift in12 competition law away from per se rules and toward13 contextualized rules such as the rule of reason.14 Third, economists and other experts in the15 licensing and ­­ and patent field have reached a much16 more nuanced understanding of the economics of17 post­expiration royalties, an understanding that didn't18 exist at the time this Court has found ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that ­­ you ­­ those are20 the three points, and I just wonder, imagine I have a21 piece of intellectual property which I have patented and22 now I have 55 potential licensees. And I say to each of23 them, I will license to you and you will pay me next to24 nothing for any use up to 20 years while you're figuring25 out how to use it. But if it turns out you use it, in￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial101 years 20 to 30, you pay me a lot for each use. Okay?2 That's the problem, isn't it?3 MR. MELNIK: Yes.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Now I've done it for 55,5 and there are a lot of good reasons for getting them to6 do that. I understand the reasons. I just wonder how7 you reconcile that with the Constitution's requirement8 that patents are for limited terms, and statute which9 says the limited term is 20 years. Because if that10 means something, I suppose it means that after that11 statutory period of 20 limited years, people can use12 that intellectual property for free.13 Now ­­ now, if it doesn't mean that, what14 does it mean? And if it does mean that, I mean, how did15 my example allow people to use it for free? Not ­­ I16 mean, they couldn't use it for free. They had to pay.17 MR. MELNIK: The way that I would reconcile18 it, Justice Breyer, is ­­ is to decouple the notion of19 the right to exclude, which is what the statutory term20 is about, the right to prevent the public as a whole21 from using the patented invention from the specific22 royalty arrangement. Once, as ­­ as Chief Justice ­­23 Chief Justice Posner put it in Scheiber, once the patent24 expires expiration is accomplished what it was supposed25 to ­­￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE BREYER:might use this, by the way, any conceivable person,there were only 53 people who might ever use it, and Igot 55 to sign up.  And therefore, nobody's going to useit without paying.  I'm just saying how, in my example,do we reconcile that with the constitutional andstatutory mandate that after 20 years it's free?MR. MELNIK: So, let me make two points.      First is we have to remember that what we'redealing with here is a per se rule.  A per se ruleprohibits all hypotheticals, not just one hypothetical.We're not advocating per se legality.JUSTICE BREYER: In my case, it would be unlawful.MR. MELNIK: I'm ­­ I'm not saying that. I was ­­ I was getting to the second point.JUSTICE BREYER: What's the second point?MR. MELNIK: The second point is that ­­ is that in the ­­ in the post­expiration period, even in your situation, what we're really dealing with are the prices and outputs at which the public is going to access the invention.JUSTICE BREYER: And I'll tell you, in my example, the price and output is a big payment to the owner of the patent in year 29. That's the price andOfficialAlderson Reporting CompanyIt is.  And everybody who11￼Official12 1 output. And the output is restricted because the price2 is up.3 MR. MELNIK: So by ­­ during the term, the4 license ­­ the ­­ the licensees got to use the5 invention.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know there are a7 lot of good reasons for it. My simple question was how8 you reconcile the fact that everybody is paying a lot of9 money to use this intellectual property in year 29 with10 what seems a statute and a Constitution that say it11 should be free at that time. That's what I'm asking. I12 don't want to ask it again because I don't like to ask a13 question more than four times.14 MR. MELNIK: I ­­ I apologize if I have not15 been clear in my answer. Let me take another shot at16 this.17 The ­­ the answer to your question is that18 one needs to ­­ in our view, is that one needs to19 de­couple the right ­­ the right to exclude, which is20 what the term is about, from the royalty arrangement.21 Understand ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If by that ­­ if by23 that you mean that there will be a lot of new people24 coming in who ­­ because they don't have to pay the25 license fee in year 29, and it's very easy for them to￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial131 figure out what to do because they can copy the patent2 and anybody can come and see, I can make one of these.3 All the competition ­­ in fact, everybody who was in the4 business is paying an extra ­­ has to charge an extra $25 because of this license fee, I won't have to charge an6 extra $2. I'll go into that business and make a lot of7 money.8 MR. MELNIK: That's certainly correct, Mr.9 Chief Justice. And that's a point that we made in the10 brief.11 JUSTICE BREYER: It's correct only if,12 unfortunately, to get into this business because the13 patent happens to be ­­ to do with a gizmo, and the14 gizmo is 14 feet deep buried inside a computer and the15 computer is 19,000 meters tall, and so there are only 5516 people, conceivably, who could get into this business,17 and they are all licensed.18 MR. MELNIK: So if the question is can19 one ­­ can one come up with a hypothetical where the20 arrangement would be impermissible because it would21 violate the rule of reason, the answer is yes.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why are we23 importing ­­ it's a fair question by the Respondents and24 others. Why are we importing antitrust principles,25 which already have their own set of problems. We have a￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial141 rule of reason, and we've now done a quick look instead2 of a per se look, and everybody complains about the3 expense related to the rule of reason. Why are we4 importing into patent law the economic principle? You5 fault us for doing that in our original decision, but6 you're asking us to perpetuate that anyway. Antitrust7 law could take care of this by itself. We don't have to8 import this into patent law at all.9 MR. MELNIK: So the ­­ I guess I would10 question the premise that ­­ Justice Sotomayor, that11 we're asking you to import the rule of reason because12 the current standard that the Federal circuit and other13 courts of appeals have applied to ­­ to analyze patent14 misuse and have been doing it for decades is already the15 rule of reason.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they use it for ­­17 for coercion and fraud. So why don't we do what one of18 your amici suggested or one of the amici suggested,19 which is to say reverse Brulotte ­­ Brulotte, and let20 coercion and fraud exist.21 MR. MELNIK: That would be an approach that22 we also would think would make sense. That would be23 drawn on this Court's precedent in Zenith, and we24 would ­­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I bet that in ­­ how￼Alderson Reporting Companythat?OfficialYes.   Because you ­­ you named      JUSTICE KAGAN:three things, and honestly, it all seemed to my earsdifferent variants of Brulotte is wrong.  But, ofcourse, special justifications demand more than thedecision is wrong.  So let's even say the decision iswrong.  Economists think the decision is wrong by ­­everybody thinks the decision is wrong.  That's not aspecial justification.  What's the specialjustification?MR. MELNIK: The distinction that I would draw, Justice Kagan, is ­­ is between the ­­ the ­­ theAlderson Reporting Company15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425long has Brulotte been around?MR. MELNIK: 50 years.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In another 50 years,there'll be an attorney sitting here telling us that wewere wrong in that presumption, too.  Why don't we justlet Congress fix it, because if it's wrong, people cancomplain to it.MR. MELNIK: Well, so the answer to the question is that we ­­ I would submit that we have demonstrated the special ­­ special justification that this Court's precedent requires.JUSTICE KAGAN:MR. MELNIK:Well, could you go back toOfficial1 decision is wrong argument is these arguments were2 presented to the Court at the time the Court made the3 decision, and now you are rearguing those arguments.4 That's the decision is the wrong argument. The points5 that I were making were new things that had emerged6 since the Court decided Brulotte. None of those7 arguments were presented to8 JUSTICE KAGAN:9 more than that. Usually wethe Court.Well, but usually we ask forask for something that says10 this is just unworkable. We thought it was right11 before, but we can't make it work now. That's not this.12 Or we say this is completely anomalous. It just13 can't ­­ it ­­ it's a relic of a past system that is14 utterly out of kilter. I don't think that's this15 either, you know. It may or may not be right, but16 there's nothing incredibly sort of weird and ­­ and17 anomalous about it. I mean, usually we look for things18 like that. And where are those things?19 MR. MELNIK: Well, one thing that we do have20 in this case that's ­­ that's unusual is the complete21 lack of reliance impact that this Court has overruled.22 That make ­­ for example, that makes ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even if I assume that24 that's right, that there's no special reliance push,25 still we have a very strong rule of statutory stareAlderson Reporting Company16￼Official171 decisis. We need some special justification to break2 away from that rule. I guess I'm still waiting to hear3 what it is other than, you know, we now know better than4 we knew before.5 MR. MELNIK: So the ­­ I had 4 points. I6 didn't get to get my fourth point out.7 So the fourth point was that we have a8 better understanding of the real world impact, of the9 innovation suppressing effect of these kinds of royalty10 arrangements that we're hearing from the amicus briefs.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that surely is a12 question for Congress, to go back to what Justice13 Sotomayor was saying, you know, to the extent that14 there's a real world problem, and maybe there is and15 maybe there's not, it's a little bit hard to tell from16 the amicus briefs. I mean, they're surely better17 equipped than we are to deal with that.18 MR. MELNIK: So the same thing could have19 been said, for example, in Illinois Tool Works which20 dealt with the exact same prior congressional enactment,21 with the exact same­­ one of the same bills that was ­­22 that was referred to in the red brief. And this Court,23 nevertheless, overruled that that equals market power24 presumption responding to the overwhelming criticism of25 that presumption in the expert literature.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial18￼1 We have the same here. We have near2 unanimous consensus in the expert literature that all of3 these new understandings have emerged since Brulotte has4 been decided that undermine every single premise on5 which Brulotte was based.6 And the same was true in Blonder­Tongue,7 which was the subject of the discussion in the first8 case this morning where this Court overruled prior9 decisions in ­­ and changed a judge­made rule in the10 patent law context. And the government in that case11 filed an amicus brief that said the fact that Congress12 has failed to act even though it has considered the13 issue is, quote­unquote, "of no significance."14 So if the Court could do it in15 Blonder­Tongue and the Court could do it in Illinois16 Tool Works, the Court could do it here.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a case about18 preclusion. It was ­­ it was really not a patent issue19 like we were discussing.20 MR. MELNIK: Well, you're ­­ you're correct,21 Justice Ginsburg, that it was a case about mutuality of22 estoppel in patent litigation, but it ­­ it implicated23 very important patent policy issues because it asked the24 question of if you invalidate the patent once, is it25 invalid for all time, or can you relitigate the issue?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial191 So yes, you can say that it was a procedural issue, but2 it was an issue that implicated core patent law.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was a ­­ it was a4 decision that applies ­­ generally applies across the5 board, not just in patent litigation .6 MR. MELNIK: My recollection ­­ and I7 apologize because it's been a few weeks since I read8 Blonder­Tongue ­­ my recollection is that the issue was9 specific to mutuality of estoppel in patent litigation.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess what it seems to me11 you are arguing, and maybe we've done this before, and12 maybe we haven't, but what it seems to me you are13 arguing is a sort of new rationale for when to depart14 from statutory stare decisis, and that new rationale is15 when a prior decision is based on what we now view to be16 naive economics. I mean, that's the fundamental￼17 argument here, isn't it?18 MR. MELNIK:19 arguments. I think it's20 new understanding of the21 not ­­ it's not ­­ it's not just the impact that ­­ that22 Chief Judge Posner and the other ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay, so let's say it's24 those two things, because we think a prior decision is25 based on naive economics, and because we think that thatIt's ­­ it's one of the­­ you also have to look at areal­world impact.  And it'sAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial20￼1 decision has some bad real­world consequences. But2 again, both of those things seem to me to be3 congressional choices, much more than judicial choices,4 that it's Congress that's better positioned to assess5 the real­world impact, and it's Congress that's better6 positioned to say whether these economic theories are7 indeed so naive.8 MR. MELNIK: If ­­ I guess I would submit9 that if that were the case, then the results in Illinois10 Tool Works and Blonder­Tongue would be different than11 they were. The principle that you're espousing can't be12 a categorical principle. Stare decisis is after all a13 practical doctrine.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Economics certainly plays15 an important role in antitrust. But what I have learned16 that economists frequently don't take account of is the17 administrative cost of administering by judges a complex18 rule. The point of my questions was to suggest to you19 how complex that would be. I mean, when, under a rule20 of reason, which you advocate, would something like this21 be lawful or unlawful? Does it depend upon how many22 people you license? Does it depend upon the height of23 entry barriers, something that is notoriously difficult24 to estimate? Does ­­ and what is the principle under25 which a rule of reason is violated?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial211 None of those things are decided. The ­­2 you're asking us to decide things under your system that3 I would find very difficult to decide. And the virtues4 of a simple rule are obvious. So it isn't even obvious5 to me that putting stare decisis to the side, it would6 be wise, since none of the economists, even including7 Judge Posner, do, in fact, discuss this problem of8 administering a complex rule of reason rule ­­ rule of9 reason in a complicated area, 50 years after the simple10 rule has been in effect.11 MR. MELNIK: So two responses to your point,12 Justice Breyer. One is I think it's again important to13 remember that the rule ­­ the question is not whether14 the rule of reason should apply to patent misuse. The15 rule of reason already applies to patent misuse under16 decades of Federal Circuit precedent. That's the state17 of the world right now. The question is only whether18 these particular types of royalty arrangements should be19 aligned with the existing rule of reason regime for20 patent misuse that already exists in the world.21 The second point is that I think we need to22 remember that these are negotiated transactions, that23 this kind of royalty arrangement will only exist if the24 licensor and the licensee both agree that it makes sense25 for them. And any answer can be priced into the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial221 license. After all, who is going to bear the risk of2 the rule of reason analysis? It's primarily going to be3 the licensor, because the licensee will at some point,4 presumably after expiration, will say, I don't want to5 pay royalties anymore. And it will ­­ would be the6 licensor who will, at that point, have to initiate the7 lawsuit to collect the royalties.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I ­­ it seems to me9 that the logic of your position is going to govern most10 of what you ­­ you say, oh, you can always look at it11 under rule of reason, but it's hard for me to imagine12 what type of case would fail the rule of reason given13 your logic for overturning Brulotte in the first place.14 MR. MELNIK: Well ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just give me an16 example, that this would be permitted under your17 position but would violate the rule of reason.18 MR. MELNIK: So I suppose the classic19 example would be the one that Professor Hovenkamp and20 his coauthors give at page 3­34 of the IP and Antitrust21 Treatise. This is at the end of Section 3.3c.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe you could23 remind me which one it is.24 MR. MELNIK: I was giving the citation just25 so that you could look it up later, because I’m sure I￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial231 won't be as able to summarize it as ably as they can,2 but they basically set out four conditions: One, the3 patent gives the patent owner market power in the4 relevant market; two, the license requires licensees to5 pay royalties on all products sold in the market6 regardless of whether or not they use the patented7 technology, so there is no ­­ even if you stop paying8 the technology ­­ using the technology, you still have9 to pay. There are substantial entry barriers, and the10 licensees make up most of the market. I ­­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I failed the antitrust12 case. Couldn't the licensee come in and file an13 antitrust case?14 MR. MELNIK: That would ­­ Professor15 Hovenkamp and his coauthors raised that as ­­ as a16 situation where there ­­ where there would be questions17 raised about whether that would violate the rule of18 reason. That was their example. The Chief Justice19 asked me for an example from the literature.

SAUNDERS        ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. SAUNDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      This case should begin and end with staredecisis.  Brulotte remains correctly decided and servesimportant public interest grounded in patent law.But at this point, were any change needed, Congresswould be the appropriate institution to balance thecompeting arguments, and if you consider the public andprivate reliance interests.  Indeed Congressspecifically considered proposals to modify Brulotte,and declined to do so even while making other changes topatent misuse.JUSTICE GINSBURG: After 1988? How recently has Congress taken a look at Brulotte?MR. SAUNDERS: The ­­ the example I'm speaking of is 1988. I ­­ I don't know more recently, but of course, even without that specific compellingAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial251 example of them having taken a look at it, made other2 changes to patent misuse, and not changed it, the point3 remains that Congress could look at it at any time, and4 all of the complicated economic ­­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that really6 proves too much. I mean, we overruled, you know,7 Lowe's, Albrecht, Arnold, Schwinn, those are all cases8 from the mid 1960's, just like this one was. It's a9 problem with the '60s, and we're going ­­ the same10 argument you make now should have prevented us from11 doing that in all those other cases.12 MR. SAUNDERS: I ­­ I think that this Court13 has recognized that in the antitrust context, where you14 have such a barebones statute and a long history of very15 minimal congressional action in that area, this Court16 has had a greater willingness to overturn its precedent.17 In the Patent Act, this is an area where Congress has18 revisited it frequently, 33 times since 1952; important19 to this case, has revisited the patent term, changed the20 patent term, added patent term extensions, patent term21 adjustments, carefully calibrating the incentives to22 strike what it considers to be the correct balance with23 Brulotte as settled law. And so there's a risk in24 overturning Brulotte of upsetting that balance.25 I would also say as the antitrust cases, and￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial261 this point's made very nicely in the Washington Legal2 Foundation amicus brief, that the reliance interests in3 that situation looks different. From the perspective of4 the party that's going to be held liable for paying out,5 there is a big difference in moving from a per se rule6 of liability ­­ no one's out there relying and saying,7 well, I'm certainly going to be liable if I do this ­­8 moving from that to rule of reason analysis. Whereas9 here, for the party that's going to be required to pay10 the perpetual royalties, what you have under existing11 law is the shield of Brulotte in place. And you'd be12 talking about removing that shield after the fact.13 And we have a law here, you know, there's a14 reason that, in addition to the idea of statutory stare15 decisis, we give particular effect to stare decisis when16 we're talking about contracts and property right,17 because for 50 years, parties have entered into18 agreements and made post­expiration business decisions19 with Brulotte as settled law.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But these parties didn't21 even know about Brulotte. I mean ­­22 MR.

You also have had what I would say is the25 legislative reliance in terms of Congress tinkering withAlderson Reporting CompanyThe whole point ofa development in50 years.30￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:2 the other side is that there's been3 economic thought in the intervening4 MR. SAUNDERS: I ­­ there has been ­­ there5 have been developments in economic thought, but thoseOfficial311 the Patent Act and setting very specific balances with2 Brulotte as settled law.3 And in addition to all this, I mean, the ­­4 we've been talking in the ­­ the economic criticism5 coming from the antitrust perspective, but it's6 important to remember here that this is originally7 grounded in patent policy. And what you have is8 Congress has set a limited window of opportunity in9 which you have the opportunity to capture, quite10 frankly, not just the value of your own invention, but a11 certain amount of follow­on invention that may build on12 and incorporate your invention, and that is set within13 that particular window.14 And once you begin going beyond that, by15 contract, there's increased risk that what's going to16 cause sales to spike in the 30th year is not your own17 original innovation, but the follow­on innovation, the18 innovation of your licensee.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But everybody is ­­20 can do ­­ can practice the patent after its expiration.21 And to the extent a licensee has to pay higher ­­ charge22 higher prices because it has to make the license23 payments, that's an open invitation to people to enter.24 MR.

Adkins before Blonder­Tongue,10 which you would say, well, that person is the only11 person who is on the hook and they may continue paying,12 but the rest of the public could practice the expired13 patent in Scott Paper. Or the rest of the public could14 bring their own invalidity challenge ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there16 would be barriers to entry in particular cases and17 perhaps those are situations in which the rule of reason18 could be applied. But otherwise, in a competitive19 economy, the idea that you know exactly what you have to20 do to make a product and this other person is selling21 it, you know, for $2 a widget more than you can, that22 seems to me to be a powerful incentive for ­­ for entry.23 MR. SAUNDERS: It may be an incentive for24 entry, but it still conflicts with the long line of25 cases recognizing the patent policy interest in a￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial33￼1 completely free public domain and the issue that is2 established in Scott Paper. This ­­ Brulotte followed3 very logically from Scott Paper, which is that we are4 not indifferent to the individual licensee. When that5 licensee ties their hands and obligates themselves to6 that ongoing royalty obligation, that in turn is7 affected by the public interest. And so Scott Paper ­­8 it was no accident that the courts of appeals were all9 reaching the same result as Brulotte based on the10 authority of Scott Paper, which Petitioners have not11 asked this Court to overrule.12 So I think that although there ­­ there can13 be nuanced economic arguments when we look at this in14 the antitrust frame, we may be talking about market15 entry in some situations and not in others. That wasn't16 the way that Brulotte was approaching the question. And17 that if you move solely to a rule of reason analysis,18 all you're offering is a remedy that's already19 available. There could already be an antitrust suit in20 this case. So it effectively eliminates any separate21 patent­based doctrine in this area.22 And that is a big step that affects the23 balance ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's an25 interesting issue because I agree with you, that I don'tAlderson Reporting Company12 licensee, like the general13 the patent.

Damages defined in Section 284 asbeing, at a minimum, a reasonable royalty.      So you have a system set up in which one ofthe sticks in that bundle of rights being given to youby Congress for that limited term is your right toengage in royalties.      And so I don't think we can drive thisartificial wedge between ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I know you don't want us to. But let's assume someone wants to, that we think Brulotte was wrong economically. We buy the arguments of the other side, that it hurts the market. How would you substitute?

SAUNDERS: Without ­­ I mean, if we are talking about fallbacks and I assume the question is assuming that we've gotten past stare decisis.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.MR. SAUNDERS: Then I think that, at a ­­ a minimum, you need to have what we have discussed as being a presumption against this practice. And if there are specific instances in which someone can come in andAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial361 show that this comports with patent policy, and this is2 going to be pro­innovative, then they can litigate that.3 But I think to go to Justice Breyer's4 points, you're ­­ you're talking about, on one hand, as5 Justice Kagan's questions are eliciting, very6 speculative and uncertain harm, given the flexibility7 that's already allowed to amortize payments under8 Brulotte; and, on the other hand, the certainty and9 expense of a very difficult to apply legal regime.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you ­­ but11 amortizing the payments under Brulotte is very12 restrictive. What you're saying, those payments have to13 be related in some sense to the patent period, you14 cannot take into account events after that. And yet I15 would think one of the risks are, well, maybe we'll be16 able to turn this invention into something or maybe we17 won't, and so we have to give, you know, license fees18 that take that contingency into account. But you can't19 do that under Brulotte, because that can only refer to20 the period that's left on the patent.21 MR. SAUNDERS: Right. Under Brulotte, you22 have ­­ you have 20 years in which you can do absolutely23 anything, can account for all ­­ all of your risks in24 that period in terms of whether the product is taken25 off. And what you can't do under Brulotte is say, if￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial371 the success, if ­­ if this is accruing on use after that2 20­year period, then we're going to be capturing that.3 But I think that ­­ that crystallizes the problem, the4 conflict between Petitioner's position and the patent5 policy here, because what you're saying really saying6 is, my invention is such that 20 years isn't long enough7 for me, it's not going to realize a success until after8 the 20­year period.9 The fact that you may not be able to capture10 that is a direct consequence of the decision Congress11 made when it set the patent term. And, in fact, for the12 concerns that are raised by particular industries,13 those ­­ those are concerns that Congress has not been14 deaf to it ­­ to them. It passed the Hatch­Waxman Act15 in 1984 specifically targeted to the pharmaceutical16 context. People had concerns about patent life being17 consumed during patent examination. Congress came back18 in 1999, and set up a series of patent term adjustments19 to compensate for that.20 And if there are any industry­specific21 concerns, given the complexity of the economics here,22 given the disputes that we're having about the reliance23 interest, this is quintessentially a task for Congress24 to weigh at this point, particularly since we're talking25 about a rule that has stood for 50 years, and during￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that time, has become part of the fabric of the law.If this Court has other questions?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM STEWART    FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING RESPONDENTMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This Court's decision in Brulotte is not anoutlier, but instead fits comfortably within asubstantial body of decisions that recognize aPatent Act policy favoring unrestricted publicunpatented and previously patented inventions,cases fall into two basic categories.strongaccess toand theseOfficial      The ­­ the first is cases like Bonito Boats,Compco, Sears Roebuck, where the Court held to bepreempted State laws that would provide patent­likeprotection to inventions that either were not patentableunder Federal law or inventions as to which a Federalpatent had expired.  And typically, those State lawsthat were held to be preempted took the form ofprohibitions on the copying of products that werealready in ­­ in the market.  And ­­ and the Court inthose decisions didn't apply anything that looked likeAlderson Reporting Company38￼Official39￼1 rule of reason analysis. It really didn't apply2 economic analysis at all.3 It didn't purport to say that the economy4 would be worse off if these laws were allowed to be5 enforced. It simply said those laws are inconsistent6 with the balance that Congress has struck, both between7 what is patentable and what is unpatentable, and the8 balance that Congress has struck as to what the length9 of patent protection should be.10 And the Court could have drawn a sharp11 distinction between prescriptive State laws and private12 contractual arrangements, but it didn't.13 And I think in addition to Brulotte, the two14 cases that I would point to that fall into the second15 category are the cases that Mr. Saunders has mentioned,16 Scott Paper and Lear. In Scott Paper, the Court said17 that if even a single licensee was allowed to enter into18 a binding restriction on his use of the patented19 invention after the patent expires, the consuming public20 would be deprived of full unrestricted access to the21 patented invention.22 And ­­ and two points there are crucial.23 The first is the Court recognized that even though the24 restriction that was sought to be applied in Sears would25 bind only a single person, would ­­ wouldn't preventAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial40￼1 others from using the patented invention after the2 patent expires. Nevertheless, that was regarded as a3 restriction inconsistent with Federal patent policy.4 And the Court explained that was so in part because when5 a single licensee is restricted in his ability to use6 the formerly patented invention, it's not only he who7 suffers; it's the consuming public who could otherwise8 hope to buy the products that he manufactures.9 And ­­ and the second case is Lear, where10 the Court held after Brulotte that even when the ­­ a11 licensee has entered into a contractual promise not to12 challenge the patent and to continue to pay royalties13 during the pendency of any challenge that may arise, the14 licensee can repudiate the license, can challenge the15 patent itself, can cease paying royalties. Obviously,16 it take ­­ the licensee, in that circumstance, takes the17 chance that it may have to pay damages if the patent is18 held to be valid ­­ if the patent is held to be valid.19 But if a licensee is correct, if the patent is invalid,20 its contractual arrangement will not prevent it ­­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Stewart, do you take22 issue at all with the economic theory of all of the23 amici that have filed in the antitrust area saying this24 makes no sense ­­25 MR. STEWART: I ­­ I ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial41￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ economically?2 MR. STEWART: I'd say three ­­ we ­­ we do3 take issue to some extent, because at least some of the4 criticisms are based on the misconception that Brulotte5 prohibits extending royalty payments out past the date6 of patent expiration, and Brulotte properly understood,7 as the Petitioners recognize, prohibits royalties that8 accrue based on post­expiration use, but it doesn't9 prohibit the post­expiration payments of royalties that10 are calculated based on use during the patent. So to ­­11 to that extent, we do disagree.12 We ­­ I think also, a lot of the antitrust13 criticism has been to the effect that ­­ and ­­ and we14 agree with this as far as it goes ­­ that viewed as a15 matter of modern antitrust law, a ­­ a per se rule of16 illegality would not be warranted because the per se17 rule is reserved for situations in which rule of reason18 analysis would always or almost always condemn the19 practice.20 And so if a particular practice is21 procompetitive and even of significant range of cases,22 it should be analyzed under the rule of reason for23 antitrust purposes, and ­­ and we don't disagree with24 the ­­ the critique that Brulotte ­­ the Brulotte rule25 would not be a sound one of antitrust policy.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial42￼1 But even to say rule of reason should be2 applied because this is not always anticompetitive is3 not going as far as saying that, on balance, the4 Brulotte rule causes more economic harm than benefit.5 I ­­ we don't ­­ I don't know to what extent the6 economists have really made that case. We don't think7 it's been proved one way or the other. It seems to us8 to be a criticism that ­­ that's much more soundly9 directed at ­­ at ­­ to ­­ to Congress.10 That the other thing that I would say11 about ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.

At the very least, it willAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficialMR. STEWART:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. STEWART:But I ­­ I think the other point I wouldThat's correct.   Any other antitrust ­­That's correct.make is, and I ­­ I take your point, Mr. Chief Justice,that the 1960s are often associated with loose economicanalysis, but I think ­­ I think Brulotte not only wasAlderson Reporting Company43￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425presumably bake the royalties into the price it chargesto consumers.      Now, there ­­ there is an argument on theother side, this is more than made up for by the factthat the licensee will presumably be charged less whilethe patent is in force.JUSTICE SCALIA: That ­­ they are the harms. What ­­ what are the benefits?MR. STEWART: The benefits in ­­ in terms of economics are that the licensee or after the ­­ the patent expires can make decisions about whether to exploit the invention, what sort of follow­on products to devise that may incorporate the patented invention without any disincentive created by the obligation to pay royalties.JUSTICE BREYER: In a word, you have a higher price after the 20 years is up, and a higher price means a restricted output.Official44￼1 not an antitrust decision. I think, for better or2 worse, the Court really didn't rely on economic analysis3 of any sort. That is, it said the balance that Congress4 struck was that during the period when the patent is in5 force, you can basically charge whatever royalties the6 market will bear; after the patent expires, the7 invention is supposed to be available for free,8 unrestricted use for the public, and you can't trade one9 for the other.10 It's essentially the same mode of reasoning11 that the Court used in cases like Bonito Boats and Sears12 Roebuck. The ­­ the analysis was not ­­ although it13 might or might have not have been true, this will cause14 economic harm to allow States to restrict copying in15 this manner, the argument was simply this is not the16 balance that Congress has struck.17 And I wanted to return to ­­ to18 Lear for a second because this was a case in which the19 Court applied the same basic mode of reasoning to a20 private contractual arrangement; that is, the Court21 recognized in Lear that the agreement potentially bound22 only the licensee; that is, any other member of the23 public could have challenged the validity of the patent.24 But as Mr. Saunders said, the Court pointed out that the25 licensee may often be in the best position both becauseAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial451 it has knowledge of the patent's workings and because it2 has the economic incentive to try to escape the royalty3 obligation. The licensee may be in the best position to4 challenge the validity of the patent, and therefore, a5 restriction that binds only the licensee is less6 sweeping than one that binds the ­­ the whole State or7 the whole country, but it's still not just like a8 restriction on a randomly selected individual.9 I guess the ­­ the other thing I would say10 about the ­­ the Sloan­Kettering brief and the argument11 that is made there is that undoubtedly, the Brulotte12 rule sometimes prevents contracting parties from13 agreeing to the precise mix of burdens and benefits that14 they would prefer. But there's really been no evidence15 that the effect of the Brulotte rule is to prevent these16 agreements from being formed at all as opposed to their17 being ­­ causing them to be formed on terms that are18 somewhat suboptimal from the ­­ the standpoint of the19 contracting parties. That ­­ the second thing we would20 say is to the extent that there's a ­­ evidence to show21 real substantial harm in terms of impairment of22 licensing agreements, again, that evidence is better23 considered and evaluated by Congress.24 The ­­ the other thing I would say is that25 the situation in which the Sloan­Kettering brief is ­­￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial46￼1 is most clearly directed at is one in which it's2 necessary to do substantial non­remunerative work as a3 preliminary matter during the period while the patent is4 in force in order to be able to monetize the invention5 down the road. And that's why they say, well, use6 during the period while the patent is in force is not a7 real sound estimate of the value of being able to8 exploit the patent. But those are precisely the cases9 in which it's most likely that after patent expiration,10 competitors will face barriers to entry. I mean, to say11 that you need to do a lot of preliminary work before you12 can make money is to say that people who haven't done13 the preliminary work may face difficulties in ­­ in14 becoming competitors. And so on the one hand, that's a15 situation where the licensees might prefer not to have16 the Brulotte rule in place, but it's also a situation in17 which a burden on the licensee is most substantial.18 If there are no further questions.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.20 You have 4 minutes remaining, Mr. Melnik.21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MELNIK22 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS23 MR. MELNIK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.24 I think it bears reemphasis that what we're25 dealing with here is a per se rule. Petitioners are notAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial47￼1 asking this Court to shift to a regime where patent2 royalties are ­­ on post­expiration use are always3 permissible. Petitioners are asking this Court to lift4 a barrier ­­ a per se barrier against these royalty5 arrangements.6 And under this Court's precedent ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that ­­ would that8 rule of reason be a patent rule or a ­­ an antitrust9 rule?10 MR. MELNIK: Well, I think ­­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if a patent rule, where12 does it come from? Where ­­ where is it in the patent13 statutes?14 MR. MELNIK: Well, Justice Scalia, patent15 misuse, when it initially originated, wasn't in the16 patent statutes either. It didn't appear in ­­ in the17 narrow sense until the 1952 act when Congress acted to18 overrule certain decisions of this Court. So the ­­ as19 the law stands today, the rule of reason is the standard20 that the Federal circuit uses to assess patent misuse.21 So where does it exist today? It exists in22 the Federal circuit's case law on patent misuse. So23 the ­­ the question I think that needs to be asked is24 even if you ­­ even if you view it as solely an25 antitrust rule, which it ­­ which it's not on theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial48￼1 current state of the law because of the Federal2 circuit's case law. The question then needs to be asked3 is: What patent policy exists that would justify some4 rule beyond the rule of reason? And I would submit that5 neither the government nor Respondents have demonstrated6 any patent policy that is not at its core an economic7 policy. If you look ­­ take a close look at8 Respondent's patent policy argument, it ultimately9 reduces to a question of prices and outputs in the10 post­expiration period versus pre­expiration period, and11 that is essentially an economic question.12 But to follow up on ­­ on something that13 Justice Sotomayor earlier said, Petitioners would be14 content with an alternative that draws on this Court's15 Zenith decision and a ­­ a test that focused on coercion16 as an alternative to a rule of reason analysis. I think17 either would be appropriate.18 If the Court has no more questions.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.20 The case is submitted.21 (Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the case in the22
