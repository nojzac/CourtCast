RADMORE                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. RADMORE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Federal Tort Claims Act's postal-matterexception bars any claim arising out of the failure of thePostal Service to fulfill its duty to deliver mail to itsintended destination on time and in good condition, butdoes not bar any claim arising out of ordinary negligencethat happens to occur while the tortfeasor is deliveringmail.          The Petitioner's construction shields theGovernment from all claims arising out of loss or damageor delay or destruction of the mail, while allowing claimsthat do not stem from all -- do not stem from theviolation of the unique duty of the Postal Service to makesure that the mail arrives on time and in good condition. It is the construction most faithful with the text andpurpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act.  The exceptionbars any claims, whether for personal injury or property3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 damage, that arise while the mail is -- if the mail is2 lost, misdelivered, damaged, or delayed.3 The Government argues for a much broader4 construction that would bar all claims that arise from the5 handling of mail. The Government's construction depends6 on a definition of transmission of the mail, viewed in7 isolation from the rest --8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Radmore, what was the9 purpose of the enactment of the waiver of Federal10 sovereign immunity here? Was it to allow recovery for11 auto accidents occurring by postal trucks?12 MR. RADMORE: Well, the --13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was that basically the14 purpose?15 MR. RADMORE: Justice O'Connor, this Court's16 decision in Kosak tells us that one of the main purposes17 in enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act was to allow18 private persons to be able to make claims against the19 Postal Service from motor vehicle --20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Arising --21 MR. RADMORE: -- accidents.22 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- out of auto accidents.23 MR. RADMORE: Correct.24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do we normally construe25 waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly?4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. RADMORE: Well, once you --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought we did.3 MR. RADMORE: But once there's a broad waiver --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: For auto accidents.5 MR. RADMORE: Well --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, why should we interpret7 the exception broadly?8 MR. RADMORE: Well, the exception -- this Court9 has told us, in both Smith and Kosak, that it is the --10 the lower courts and this Court, when they're viewing an11 exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act -- that they12 shouldn't extend the waiver, nor should they view it more13 narrowly, that they should look at the waiver -- they14 should look at the exception and make a determination as15 to what the meaning of the words are, and what the reason16 for the exception was, and they should do no more, nor no17 less, than that.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess we've already19 construed it broadly, haven't we, in -- or, excuse me --20 yes, construed the waiver broadly. In Kosak versus United21 States, we allowed a suit against the United States for22 negligence of a mail truck in an automobile accident. I23 suppose the language could have covered that, couldn't it?24 MR. RADMORE: Well, that's exactly what the25 point -- that our point is, is that, because the5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Government, in this case in -- and the Court, in Kosak,2 has told us that automobile accidents are not barred, are3 -- from -- by -- they're not barred --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could --5 MR. RADMORE: -- in the case --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have been within the7 literal. It could have been negligent -- what is it? --8 negligence --9 MR. RADMORE: Negligent --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the delivery of mail?11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Negligent --12 MR. RADMORE: Negligent --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- transmission.14 MR. RADMORE: -- transmission.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But an automobile accident is17 something, as the Government points out, that any agency18 of Government can be involved in, not peculiar to the19 Postal Service. But the transmission of the letter is --20 the words are "negligent transmission." Many people think21 of the Postal Service, the letter carrier, delivering the22 mail to one's home. That act surely fits the word23 "negligent transmission."24 MR. RADMORE: Justice Ginsburg, in isolation, we25 admit that the word "transmission" could have the broad6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 interpretation that the Government as -- is urging this2 Court to follow. But you have to look at the term3 "negligent transmission" in the context of the whole4 exception. And if "negligent transmission" were to be5 given the broad interpretation that the Government urges6 and the Third Circuit found, then the words "loss" and7 "miscarriage" in the exception would be superfluous. And8 we also know that this Court, on prior occasions, has9 indicated that the canon that "words are known by their10 associate" applies in construing exceptions to the Federal11 Tort Claims Act. And in -- that canon tells us that when12 you have words that are in a group, they should be given13 like meaning. And we know that only mail can be lost,14 only mail can be delivered to the wrong location. And, as15 a result, it's pretty clear that the term "negligent16 transmission" deals with the mail, itself. And --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- wait, I -- it's18 not true that only mail can be lost, or only mail can be19 delivered to the wrong location. If you order from a20 private delivery service, they can do all of those things,21 as well.22 MR. RADMORE: Well, they can do all those23 things, but they don't have the benefit of the -- of24 sovereign immunity.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you consider7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 covered by negligent transmission? I take it if the -- if2 the postal worker throws the package to the house and3 there's something in it that gets broken, that's covered4 by the exception?5 MR. RADMORE: Any damage to the mail, itself,6 would be covered to the exception -- by the exception.7 For instance, if a -- if somebody had ordered their8 medication over the -- you know, through the Medicare Act,9 and they had ordered it from a warehouse somewhere in10 Idaho, and the -- during the transmission of the mail, the11 medication had been lost, well, if somebody was injured,12 if they had a stroke or they had a heart attack because13 they didn't get their mail on time --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But if -- now,15 if they throw the package onto the porch, and it lands in16 a place where somebody's going to trip over it, you say17 that's not covered by the exception.18 MR. RADMORE: That's not covered, because that's19 an act of ordinary negligence. Damage to the package20 would always be covered, but the act of creating a21 hazardous condition would not be covered, because that's22 an ordinary tort that would be -- subject private persons23 to a liability between themselves. And that's -- the24 purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act is to allow the25 Government to be held responsible for ordinary torts if8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 there would be a like liability between private persons.2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't the term "negligent3 transmission" probably cover late deliveries?45678 something 9MR. RADMORE:  It would cover late deliveries.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or incorrect deliveries in --MR. RADMORE:  It would -- could.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- to the wrong address,like that.MR. RADMORE:  Delay or damage --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.MR. RADMORE:  -- to the --JUSTICE SCALIA:  It could cover, under your10 11 1213 theory, this very act, just dumping the stuff there on the14 porch, if the consequence of that had not been that the15 homeowner tripped over it, but that rain destroyed the16 contents of the -- of the letters so that they were17 illegible.18 MR. RADMORE: That's correct.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would --20 MR. RADMORE: I --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- say that that would --22 MR. RADMORE: Justice --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- be covered.24 MR. RADMORE: -- Scalia, that's correct, that25 the exception would bar suit against the Government for9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425any damage to the actual contents of the package, itself.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, in -- it seems to me alittle strange that this same act is both within theexception and not within the exception, the same act ofnegligence.          MR. RADMORE:  Well, it's not really the sameact.  It's the same act, in that they used the mail, andthere was a consequence to the mail, but the creation of ahazard or -- through some kind of careless act, whether itbe the postal employee or whether it be a person thatwould raise 2680(c) from the customs exception, whether --or an IRS agent or a private person --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it --          MR. RADMORE:  -- would all be responsible forcreating a hazardous condition on the porch.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But isn't your response toJustice Scalia -- you could make the same argument.  Ifthere's an accident, and the truck caught on fire, and themail was destroyed, you couldn't recover for the lost mailin the truck, but you could -- but you could recover forpersonal injury resulting from the accident.  It would beprecisely the same conduct.          MR. RADMORE:  Precisely the same under ourinterpretation of --JUSTICE SCALIA: That is a good answer. I'm 10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425glad you came up with that.          [Laughter.]          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does "negligenttransmission" add to "loss" or "miscarriage"?          MR. RADMORE:  Well, the -- "loss" doesn't covermail that would be delayed or damaged.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I supposed"miscarriage" does.          MR. RADMORE:  "Miscarriage" would be mail thatwent to the wrong location.  If it was misdelivered,that's what "miscarriage" would mean in this context.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or mis-carried, likehandled in a way that it's damaged, or put in a placewhere it's going to be damaged.  It seems to me that --I'm not sure what additional weight "negligenttransmission" covers if you have a reasonable reading of"miscarriage."          MR. RADMORE:  Well, you could look at every termin the exception, and, if you gave it the broadestdefinition possible, you could say that all of the wordsare superfluous, that "loss" would cover mail that was,you know, lost and not delivered to the postal patronwithin two weeks, and, for that period of time, the mailwas lost.  But if you look at the exception in --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that doesn't work. 11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I mean, if you deliver it to the house next door, youhaven't lost it, you've misdelivered it or miscarried it.I don't -- I don't think "miscarriage" is redundant.  Butyou -- your construction of "negligent transmission" is sonarrow that I'm not sure it adds anything to"miscarriage," which suggests it might --          MR. RADMORE:  Well, "miscarriage" doesn't meanthat the mail was damaged.  "Miscarriage," if I take the-- if the mail is delivered, Mr. Justice Roberts, to yournext-door neighbor, it doesn't mean the mail is -- maybemiscarriaged, but it's not delayed, and it's not damaged.So --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about "delay"?Does "delay" -- your -- isn't that something that'sneither within "loss" or "miscarriage"?          MR. RADMORE:  No, "delayed" wouldn't be withineither term.  "Lost," I think, means exactly what it says,mail that's lost.  "Lost" means lost.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, if, in fact, they -- thePost Office negligently delays the knowledge that wouldcome to me in the letter, that I have 15 days to claim mybillion-dollar inheritance --          [Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I guess I couldn't sue.12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. RADMORE: You couldn't sue.2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, suppose what3 they do is -- this is -- it seems to me this case is like4 a first-year law school hypothetical. But, I mean, the --5 suppose that the -- what they do is, he puts the mail on6 the porch, my package, and he rips it open, negligently;7 and there for everyone to see is the toupee that I8 ordered.9 [Laughter.]10 JUSTICE BREYER: And I sue -- I sue for public11 humiliation. See? I mean, what about that one?12 [Laughter.]13 MR. RADMORE: I have that same problem.14 [Laughter.]15 MR. RADMORE: It --16 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what I -- to sort of my17 cards on the -- I was thinking, "Well, that comes close,"18 but maybe it -- maybe it is within the -- within the --19 within the exception. I'm not sure. And then --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think --21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I think --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I think you're covered.23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- on the other --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's negligence25 transmission.13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  On the other -- no, they --see, it -- he put it on the porch, which is transmittingit, in such a way that it fell open.  But I'm just tryingto think -- and then the -- on the other side of it, youhave the automobile accident.  And I guess he comes alongthe street, the postman, swinging my package around, andbops someone on the head with it.  I guess that's covered. And then, this case is somewhere in the middle.          MR. RADMORE:  Well, obviously, a line has to bedrawn somewhere.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But what's the principleaccording to which we're drawing it?          MR. RADMORE:  Well, I think anything -- anyclaim that would arise from the unique governmental dutyto deliver the mail on time and in good condition would bebarred.  Any --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I don't understand your last-- your last answer.  You think bopping somebody on thehead in the course of delivering a package would --          MR. RADMORE:  Oh, no, it wouldn't be barred,because that's an ordinary tort.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.          MR. RADMORE:  But the mail -- in that14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 hypothetical, the mail still arrived on time and in good2 condition if they bopped somebody on the head. There3 wouldn't be a bar --4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, ordinary tort doesn't5 quite work, because I guess my public humiliation case is6 -- could be an ordinary tort. Somebody could go up to the7 porch and rip it open, nothing to do with the mail. And,8 moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission9 of my inheritance. See? They could. So, all those10 things could be ordinary torts.11 MR. RADMORE: But they don't have a duty. The12 difference is, in that case, if a -- if a private person13 were to go and open up the package, or if a private person14 were to take your letter that showed that you had an15 inheritance, a private person doesn't have the duty. Only16 the Government has a duty to deliver the mail on time and17 in good condition.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it have a -- in good19 condition. Therefore, when they put it -- therefore, I20 guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition,21 so maybe that is immune. And leaving it on the porch in a22 position where somebody would trip over it, you might say23 they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what24 they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you25 don't trip over it. And that's good condition for the15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 delivery.2 MR. RADMORE: Well, it's not good condition for3 purposes of ordinary torts. The exception bars a claim4 against the Government for the contents of the package.5 In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if the toupee were6 damaged as a result of the package being opened, then you7 could not make a claim, because that was the content of8 the mail, but if you fell over the package, that's an9 ordinary tort, that's a common duty between private10 persons. So --11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As is a automobile accident,12 and it -- the Chief suggested to you that there are other13 kinds of people who deliver items. And that kind of14 negligence, you say, is within the exception.15 MR. RADMORE: I'm sorry, I don't --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That --17 MR. RADMORE: -- understand your --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That you say --19 MR. RADMORE: -- question, Justice Ginsburg.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. Outside the21 exception.22 MR. RADMORE: Correct.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there, you're saying that24 the Post Office is just -- it's just like everyone else25 with respect to automobile accidents, right?16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. RADMORE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- and -- you --3 therefore, it should be just like everyone else with4 respect to this negligent delivery in --5 MR. RADMORE: With respect to ordinary torts.6 If they create -- if the Post Office creates a hazardous7 condition, then they should be a -- responsible, just as8 private persons are. We know that that's the purpose of9 the broad waiver of sovereign immunity under the Federal10 Tort Claims Act, is to make the Government -- or to allow11 private persons to make a claim against the Government if12 there is a duty that is common to private persons.13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Radmore, I don't think14 you're quite correct when you say, with regard to an15 automobile accident, it's just like a private entity16 delivering mail -- or delivering packages. If a private17 delivery service had an automobile accident that resulted18 in the destroy -- destruction of a package, a private19 party could sue for the contents of the package. But20 that's not true with regard to the Postal Service.21 MR. RADMORE: That's absolutely correct, Justice22 Stevens. And I believe that that's really the biggest23 problem the Government has with their interpretation of24 negligent transmission, because if there's an exclusion25 for motor-vehicle accidents, then that would mean that17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that exclusion would not only apply to the terms of the2 exception "negligent transmission," but, if it's an3 exclusion, as the Government has argued for, though they4 haven't explained why the exclusion wouldn't apply to loss5 and miscarriage, the logical endpoint of their exclusion6 is that if you have a tractor-trailer that has 10,000 IRS7 refund checks on it, and that tractor-trailer is in a8 accident, and all of the refund checks are destroyed,9 well, any private person who didn't get their refund check10 in time, and couldn't pay their mortgage, or they couldn't11 pay for their credit-card bill or they couldn't do12 something as a result of the loss of those refund checks,13 would be able to make a claim against the Government, as14 long as the loss occurred from a motor-vehicle accident.15 They make no explanation as to why that would not be the16 case.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- the -- you assert18 that would be the case, don't you?19 MR. RADMORE: No, I --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you assert that they21 would be able to sue.22 MR. RADMORE: Oh, not at all.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. All right.24 MR. RADMORE: If the -- any -- anytime that the25 mail is lost, the mail is delivered to the wrong location,18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the mail is damaged or --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MR. RADMORE:  -- delayed --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  I gotcha.          MR. RADMORE:  -- through negligence, regardless          motor-vehicle accident, then the Government isif it's aprotected.  And so, it's --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I guess -- I --following up on Justice Stevens' question, your theorywith respect to negligent transmission is that the PostalService should be liable in the same way that privateparties are.  But that theory doesn't hold up when you'retalk -- that's not your theory.          MR. RADMORE:  That's not --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then, what is your--          MR. RADMORE:  Our theory is, if there's damageto the mail, there's an exception to --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --          MR. RADMORE:  -- some --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thoughtthat was miscarriage.          MR. RADMORE:  Damage?          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or loss.          MR. RADMORE:  Well, if it was -- if it was the19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 same as miscarriage or loss, then that makes the whole2 term "negligent transmission" superfluous. And this Court3 has told us that every term in an -- in the -- any4 exception should be viewed so as --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's only6 superfluous under your reading. If it covers, for7 example, putting the package -- negligently placing the8 package in a location where it's going to cause injury,9 well, then it's not superfluous.10 MR. RADMORE: Well, in a broad -- that's true if11 you're going to read the words so broadly that -- it would12 then make 131415"loss" and "miscarriage" superfluous."JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you're using --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.JUSTICE SOUTER:  You're -- no, please.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was just -- it1617 wouldn't make it superfluous at all. "Loss" would cover18 loss. "Miscarriage" would cover damage. And "negligent19 transmission" would be transmitting it negligently, such20 as leaving it where somebody's going to trip over it.21 MR. RADMORE: But the broad interpretation that22 the Government asks for, and that the Third Circuit23 followed, was that "negligent transmission" covered24 anything that occurred to the mail from the time the mail25 was dropped off at the Post Office until it arrived at a20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425third -- to the third person.  So, with that broaddefinition of "negligent transmission," anything thatoccurred, whether it was a loss of the mail, whether itwas misdelivered to the wrong location, would be covered,and that would make the words "loss" and "miscarriage"superfluous.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you're taking as your prime-- or a prime example of what would be covered by theexception of "negligent transmission" the package that isdelivered to the right place on time and all the chinainside the box is smashed.  I mean, that would be anexample that would fit your theory.          MR. RADMORE:  That's correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. RADMORE:  There would be a bar.  The barwould apply.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And you would -- you would saythat's supported by the -- you know, the noscitur a sociisargument, because it's damage of -- to the mail, or thecondition of the mail, or the manner in which the mailitself is delivered, but it -- that's more or less whereyou -- where you think the exception should stop.          MR. RADMORE:  That's more, rather --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. RADMORE:  -- than less.  That's exactly21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425where we think --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes, your theory is basicallythat the exception just deals with bad things that happento the mail.          MR. RADMORE:  Well, it also would protect theGovernment when there is a -- either a personal injury orsome kind of loss, a personal injury or an economic lossthat arises from the damage or delay to the mail.  Youknow, I think I brought up the example of the medicationor if -- if you had a check or a coupon bond that wasdestroyed.  There would --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that would be, in each case-- in each example you're giving, as I understand it, thatwould be as a consequence to a violation that affected themail, itself, in the first place.          MR. RADMORE:  Yes, Justice Souter.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I lose the -- I lose the money,because the mail is slow, or whatever.          MR.

MILLETT                 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Justice O'Connor, when you mentioned that thisis a waiver of sovereign immunity and we have to construethat with that in mind, it's, sort of, central to ourstarting to our point for understanding this statute.          This claim falls squarely within the text of thestatutory exception, and there doesn't seem to be muchdispute about that.  And the question is whether --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But isn't it true that itfalls squarely within the word "transmission," justexactly as an automobile accident arising out of carrying-- transmitting mail does?          MS. MILLETT:  It falls with --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  They are both equally withinthe plain language.          MS. MILLETT:  It falls within the word"transmission," but the relevant phrase is "negligenttransmission of mail or postal matter."  And --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which is happening in the --in the truck when it has an accident.          MS. MILLETT:  But what you're suing over in thatcase -- and this is exactly the line this Court drew inKosak -- your claim isn't -- it has to arise out of thenegligent transmission of mail.  Your claim, when the --23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 when the delivery truck or the postal truck rear-ends you,2 doesn't arise out of the handling of the mail; it arises3 out of the handling of the vehicle. There's two4 activities going on at the same time, and you're suing5 about the one, and not the other. And I think it's a --6 it's --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have a big8 crate that the postman uses, because you've been away for9 a week and yet the mail -- and he leaves a crate there,10 and you trip on the crate. Under your view, there would11 be liability, because the crate's like the -- the crate12 isn't the 1314 the crate15 left it in a bag or he -- they put a plastic bag around it16 to protect it from the rain, and technically you wouldmail.MS. MILLETT:  I think, at that point, sort of,and the mail have become one thing, as if he17 trip over the plastic bag, but it's the lump of mail that18 you're tripping over. I mean, if the crate had some bar19 sticking out, and all you tripped over was the bar and not20 the mail, then that might be a different case.21 think that we have to look carefully at whether22 out of the handling of the mail. And that is a23 distinction that protects the activity that the24 Service is engaged in that Congress wanted to protect, the25 handling of the mail. It's a -- it's a protection for the24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005But I doit arisesPostal￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425post, but it --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the key word in thestatute is "transmission," not "the transmission ofletters or postal matter."          MS. MILLETT:  The key words, I think, are thewhole exception, which is "arising out of the negligenttransmission of mail."  It's not "negligent activities ofthe Postal Service."  The text focuses -- it's aprotection for the post, not the Postal Service.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But --          MS. MILLETT:  And just as if you're --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if that's true, why do youneed the words "miscarried" -- why do you need the word"miscarriage" in the statute?          MS. MILLETT:  I think "miscarriage" capturesdelivery to the wrong person, which doesn't harm the mail,itself.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you -- but so would theword "transmission" if you -- under your reading, youdon't need the word "miscarriage."          MS. MILLETT:  What -- "transmission" adds a lot-- I think if you look, sort of, sequentially, the wayCongress was thinking -- and it may not have been at, sortof, this level -- but "loss" is mail that doesn't goanywhere, it doesn't get there.  "Miscarriage" gets to the25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 wrong person. "Transmission" gets to the right person,2 but something went wrong in the process. And so, if you3 look at it that way, yes, there's no doubt there's4 overlap, but "transmission" captures a lot more than just5 "miscarriage." It is important to understand that --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: It covers damage, for one7 thing.8 MS. MILLETT: It covers --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You --10 MS. MILLETT: It covers damage. It covers --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which "loss" doesn't, and12 "miscarriage" doesn't.13 MS. MILLETT: Absolutely. And the same delay14 may, or not, be with them. But the other thing that15 Petitioner's theory doesn't capture -- they're two very16 important things. One is the decision to admit things to17 the mail in the first place. If it ends up being a18 letterbomb or, unfortunately, anthrax, or biohazards -- I19 mean, we ship poisons, we ship medical specimens, we ship20 live alligators. I mean, every -- you wouldn't believe21 what goes into the mail.22 [Laughter.]23 MS. MILLETT: And there has to be some24 protection for that decision to admit things into the mail25 in the first place. The other thing it doesn't capture is26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the very important decisions that post -- the Post Office2 has to make about getting the mail to someone on time.3 Part of that is how I get it there. And it's -- it4 includes not just how I get the millions of packages every5 day that don't fit in a mailbox or a mail slot to their6 customers; it includes how, after a hurricane, we decide7 to deliver mail outside the Superdome or to people whose8 mailboxes have been blown off of their houses.9 JUSTICE BREYER: So, how does it hurt you, say,10 in the live alligator, et cetera, case? If the Court says11 -- well, anything that's special in respect to12 transmission of live alligators, because it's the mail, et13 cetera, delayed -- or I -- I don't know how else you'd get14 a tort out of it. But if it's simply the kind of thing15 that anyone could do, like driving a postal truck or16 leaving something on a porch that somebody trips over or17 walking along the street swinging the live alligator over18 your head, or whatever you do –-19202122 [Laughter.] 2324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40027Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that kind of thing that 2345 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40028Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005￼1 doing it -- that kind of thing doesn't mean to fall within2 the "transmission." Now, suppose that that was the3 holding. How would the Government be hurt?4 MS. MILLETT: First of all, that -- if the -- if5 the exception, as I understand it, is that of harms to or6 from the content of the mail, that isn't going to --7 JUSTICE BREYER: What we'd look to is, you'd8 look to the purpose of this. The purpose of it was,9 basically, I gather from the history, as recounted in10 Kosak -- in what the Court said in Kosak -- the purpose of11 this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so12 you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit13 that a person could protect himself for the loss by14 registering the package, by taking out this ordinary15 transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do. So,16 they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery17 claims, all that pack -- family of things, everybody'll18 say, "Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check."19 I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up.20 But the Government's already liable for what I'd21 call the "swinging the package around," leaving it --22 slip-and-fall, trucks. So that falls on the other side.23 Now, how does that hurt you, the Government, if that's how24 we'd come out?25 MS. MILLETT: It hurts us -- I mean, my starting29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 point, first of all, is this text, and not legislative2 history or purpose --3 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you can't get too far --4 MS. MILLETT: -- which is --5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- with the text. I think you6 have a great claim, and so does the other side; but if7 it's just the text, that's not my question.8 MS. MILLETT: Okay. But I --9 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is, If I think the10 text is perfectly ambiguous on this, I look to the11 purpose, suppose I came out the way I just said. How12 would the Government be hurt? is what I want to know.13 MS. MILLETT: What the Government is hurt by is14 the fact that you're -- some -- you're allowing torts for15 the one activity that is distinct to the Postal Service16 amongst governmental agencies, and that is the act of17 delivering. That is what the transmission exception18 protects. When you're -- when you're driving a vehicle,19 the postal employee is making the -- is not making mail-20 specific judgments. The postal employee is making the21 same judgments that I made driving to work today and that22 everyone else on the road makes. But when you are making23 decisions about how to deliver 660 million pieces of mail24 a day to 142 million different locations -- the bottom of25 the Grand Canyon, remote Alaska, and urban cities -- that30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- to getjudgmentsthat job done, you have to be able to makeabout the actual act of delivery.  And  --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, how is mail- --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And what if it's for --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- mail-specific any differentthan the grocery boy -- I mean, than the grocery-specific,under your view?          MS. MILLETT:  No, but it's clear that Congresswanted to capture negligence.  I mean, it's the -- it --the fact that -- there has to be an analog to privatepeople, or we're not in the Federal-Tort-Claims-Act landanyhow.  The question is, Which of those activities?  Andthe text focuses on --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you're --          MS. MILLETT:  -- the actual --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you're saying -- you're --you want us to say that mail is somehow unique.  But itisn't.  There's all kinds of delivery.          MS. MILLETT:  It -- whether or not it's unique,Congress focused on the presence of mail in a mail-specific judgment.  That's how we read --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm saying --          MS. MILLETT:  -- the text --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- it's not mail-specific,31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because all delivery people have the same          MS. MILLETT:  The mail --problem.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, why is it          MS. MILLETT:  First of all, the          mailbox is a uniquely postal --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, and letters are carried          truck, but we allow a cause of action for              the driver of the mail truck.  That's unique              MILLETT:  Drive the -- driving is not unique              It's not, even amongst agencies, let aloneamongst private parties.  The -- what --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're leaving something --          MS. MILLETT:  And it --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That was the very point,leaving something on the porch where somebody can trip onit isn't unique to mail --          MS. MILLETT:  It doesn't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- just as driving a truckisn't.          MS. MILLETT:  It doesn't have to be unique tomail.  If it is unique to mail, if there's no private-party analog, the Federal Tort Claims Act doesn't apply,by its own terms.  But what -- I mean, there is a distinctand unique postal act of putting things into the mailbox.32it into ain a mailnegligence ofto mail, too.          MS.to the mail.Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005mail-specific?decision to put￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, if --          MS. MILLETT:  And if it --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in fact, you have a driverof the truck, the postal truck, and what he does is, heputs the mail in the truck, so my skis, which I haveshipped by mail, happen to stick out the side, and, as hewalk -- drives along, he just mows down the pedestrians.[Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  I take it, on your theory, thatthat -- there is no lawsuit.          MS. MILLETT:  The -- if your damage -- harms toand from the mail, yes.  Yes, that is our position.  If hemows 'em down with his arm or with his rearview mirror onhis truck, your -- the liability attaches.          But you asked why it is important, JusticeBreyer.  And one of the reasons it's very important is tolook at these types of claims.  The Postal Service isdefenseless.  We are essentially defenseless when we getone of these claims.  Unlike a vehicle accident, where weare a party to it and know what happens when it happens,this type of injury, we may not know about for up to twoyears after --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let --          MS. MILLETT:  -- it happens.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- let me ask you about33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 defenses. And it goes a little bit beyond the suit, but,2 as I -- I read through the regulations, and it's the duty3 of the occupant, or the recipient, of the mail to provide4 a box or a letter slot or something. Would the failure to5 do that, so that they just have to put it on the porch --6 is that a defense?7 MS. MILLETT: I'd --8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume there's9 liability.10 MS. MILLETT: Uh-huh.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that your12 interpretation of the statute does not prevail here. Does13 the Post Office have a defense if the person doesn't14 provide a mailbox, as the regulations require?15 MS. MILLETT: I'm not going to say here that we16 wouldn't have some defenses that me may want to invoke at17 a future time, but I'm not very optimistic, because I18 think the fact that you -- they may not have a box doesn't19 mean that we could put it -- assuming your theory that20 we're liable -- put it somewhere negligently --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is --22 MS. MILLETT: -- as opposed --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there --24 MS. MILLETT: -- nonnegligently.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there regulations34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425requiring that the mail be put in a reasonably safe place? And by that, I mean reasonably safe for the occupant, notreasonably safe for the mail.          MS. MILLETT:  It --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- because you quote --you quote, on page 2, the footnote -- you quote theregulation.  But I read that, that it has to be reasonablysafe for the mail, because it says, "Oh, you can leave iton a stairway or under a porch, just so long as it's safefor the mail."  That's the way I read that one.          MS. MILLETT:  I mean, I think they make the --as a practical -- is there text in the Domestic MailManual that specifically says, "Put it where somebodywon't slip"?  No.  I think it's the same judgment that'sbeing made.  They're making the best judgments that theycan, but there is -- you know, they're, sort of, caughtbetween them.  So, they need to put it somewhere whereit's sheltered, and that tends to be close up tobuildings.  And the problem is, it's not --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I guess my point --          MS. MILLETT:  -- once it's on the --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- my point is, if there's aduty, then it seems to me the Post Office is used tomaking these judgments.

If you're-- you know, you go to put it into the mailbox, and apiece slips out of the mailman's hand and lands on theporch, and it's one of those cellophane envelopes, andit's slippery.  I mean, that's --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we have any sense --          MS. MILLETT:  -- maybe all that it takes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- of how many claims of thisnature there are?  I know we do have the Second Circuitcase, on one side.

MILLETT:  I know it was in our brief inopposition, but I don't recall if I did in this.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the brief here -- well,it's -- it surprised me that there were those two cases.But, do you have any notion of how many slip-and-fall,trip-over-mail cases -- claims are filed?          MS. MILLETT:  I can give you a rough estimate.There are -- there are 700 -- about 700 slip-and-fallcases a year, but the vast, vast majority of those areslipping in a building on, you know, a slippery floor,which we concede liability for.  Probably, you know --less than a dozen, around ten or so a year, thus far.  But--          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You concede --          MS. MILLETT:  -- we've been able to --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- liability for a slipperyfall in the Post Office.          MS. MILLETT:  Yes.  We --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.          MS. MILLETT:  -- concede liability for that,39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 because that -- just like -- that's not handling of the2 mail, that's handling of a building or handling of a3 vehicle, which we see different from handling of --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there was --5 MS. MILLETT: -- the mail.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there was, in one of the7 briefs, an example where there's a puddle created by the8 janitor. The Post Office is liable. It's -- relates to9 taking care of the building. There's a parcel of mail10 that has a liquid in it, and it's dropped, and the puddle11 is created by the that. No liability. And you agree that12 that would be the result?13 MS. MILLETT: If we break -- if we break --14 whatever damage is done to the mail, and the package in15 the mail, the liquid in the mail cannot be sued over.16 That is -- and I think Petitioners agree -- damage to and17 from the mail --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you agree --19 MS. MILLETT: -- is our conception.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that that hypothetical --21 MS. MILLETT: Yes.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is correct? And there's23 another one that they gave. The letter carrier comes.24 He's got a mailbag filled with mail, dumps it on the25 street while he takes a rest, somebody trips over it.40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 That's case one. Case two is, he's finished making his2 rounds, and he dumps the sack on the street, it has no3 mail in it, and somebody trips over it. On your theory of4 the case, would there be liability in both situations or5 only in the one where the mailbag was stuffed full of6 mail?7 MS. MILLETT: If you're tripping over mail, and8 the mail bag has mail in it, there's no liability. You're9 harmed from the mail. If it's from mail apparatus or, you10 know, a postal employee's leg sticking out while they're11 sleeping, then we will admit liability for that. The12 focus -- our view of the focus of this exception, I think,13 by its text -- and this is exactly what the Court said in14 Kosak -- is on the handling of the mail, and that is a15 very important line for the Postal Service. They have to16 make hard 1718 hangup --19 of it again -- is the -- is the Kosak case. Carrying the20 mail in a mail truck is the handling of the mail. There21 is no doubt that it's the handling of the mail. And it22 seems to me it doesn't -- it isn't enough to say, "Well,23 other people drive trucks, too." Well, that's true. But24 other people deliver packages, too, and leave 'em on the25 doorstep. How do you distinguish Kosak?41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005judgments --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that you -- my biggestand I wish you'd go through your distinguishing￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. MILLETT:  I think -- in -- first of all,it's just dicta in Kosak, which, in fact, construed thecustoms exception to include both -- you know, not to turnupon the type of damage that ensued, so we actually areasking for the sort of same analysis of the holding inKosak -- the dicta in Kosak about motor vehicles isdifferent -- I think if I could just -- for the logicalreason, if someone rear-ends you, you don't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.          MS. MILLETT:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're -- I assume theGovernment has conceded Kosak, the dictum in Kosak.          MS. MILLETT:  Yes.or not?doesn'tholdingJUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, do you concede that point,MS. MILLETT:  We --  JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you concede the point, itmatter whether it's dictum.  MS. MILLETT:  I agree, but --  JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, you --  MS. MILLETT:  -- I wanted to point out that the--  JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you are trying to draw adistinction between driving the mail in the truck andleaving the mail on the doorstep.  What's the basis for42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that distinction?          MS. MILLETT:  And that language has to be readagainst the backdrop of the holding of Kosak, whichrecognized that when you have exceptions that are writtenin these broad terms, the form of the injury, theparticular type of personal injury -- there, it wasproperty injury -- that ensues doesn't change whether theexception applies.          Motor vehicles are different.  If you're rear-ended by a truck, you don't jump out and say, "Hey, younegligently transmitted the mail."  You say -- you jumpout and you say, "You didn't -- your brake lights weren'tworking," "You didn't signal."  Those are -- there are notjudgments about the handling of the mail being made thatthe claim arises out of.  You're not suing about how wehandled the mail; you're suing about how we handled motorvehicles.  Yes, at --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if the --          MS. MILLETT:  -- 30,000 feet, it's all --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if the postmanthrows the box onto the porch and hits somebody there, yousay that's within the exception?          MS. MILLETT:  Yes, that's -- if we --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't say, "Hey,you hit me with the mail," right?  You say, "You hit me43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with a box."          MS. MILLETT:  Your claim arises out of how wehandled the mail, not how handled a vehicle, not how wehandled a building, not how we handled --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your claim --          MS. MILLETT:  -- mail apparatus.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- arises out of how hehandled the box, just like --          MS. MILLETT:  Yes.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in the other case itarises out of how he handled the vehicle.  You don't carewhether it's the mail or not.  By the same token, when youtrip over something -- a box -- you don't care whetherit's a mail box or if it's the box from UPS.  And yet, inyour case, it makes all the difference in the world.          MS. MILLETT:  Perhaps I misunderstood.  If -- Ithought the box was the mail, itself, that you're throwing--          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.          MS. MILLETT:  -- out of -- and if the box -- butyour injury arises -- if it's to or from the mail --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.          MS. MILLETT:  -- it's within the exception.And, yes, there are fine lines, as with any of thesedistinctions.  In practice -- in practice -- for the44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 practical reason that you don't have the sheer volume of2 claims, against which the Postal Service is largely3 defenseless, that you have when you start talking --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose your --5 MS. MILLETT: -- about delivering --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- defense affects the7 process. In other words, you would, more and more, be8 leaving those -- the little slips of paper saying, "Go9 down to the Post Office and pick up your package," rather10 than leaving the package on the porch.1112 it's hard13 here when14 carrier?15 the mail by taking it back to the Postal Service,16 inconveniencing you, making you come downtown. That act17 is within the exception. I can try a person-to-person18 delivery. But the Postal Service went away from that, for19 logical reasons, because that will delay everybody else's20 mail, and there's no liability for all of those delays.21 If you set this same package down, and it has22 medicine or food in it -- it says -- marked "perishable"23 on the outside -- it's in the sun, it goes rotten, the24 person gets sick, there's no liability. But the -- this25 is a protection for an activity of the Government, like45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MS. MILLETT:  I think that's exactly right.  Andto -- I mean, that is -- you know, what happensI show up with oversized mail, as a mailI've got the choice of delaying your receipt of￼1 the -- many of the other Federal Tort Claim Act2 exceptions. And the protection for that activity is an3 upfront protection that doesn't turn on the happenstance4 of which particular form of injury is manifested at --5 hours later. And it's an important reason, as I said, not6 only for the sheer volume of claims that we could face if7 this is opened up on how we deliver, but all -- our8 inability to defend, when, two years later, we simply do9 not -- unlike FedEx or UPS, or probably the pizza10 delivery,11 delivered12 13we can't recreate, months later, how wethe mail --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, but you're --MS. MILLETT:  -- unless it's registered.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- you're using the word1415 "deliver," but the statutory word is "transmit." And --16 are there other statutes or regulations in respect to the17 Post Office that talk about "delivery"?18 MS. MILLETT: There --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the word -- because it20 seems to me -- the omission of "delivery," it seems to me,21 is a real 2223 chronicle24 contemporaneously, the use of the word "transmit" and25 "transmission" in postal services is commonplace, and itproblem for you, in your theory of the case.MS. MILLETT:  No, I don't think so.  And, as weat length in our brief, both through history and46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 means delivery to -- it means getting something to the2 person. Congress has consistently used "transmission"3 that way.4 And the other thing I would like to bring you5 back to is, understand that the reason the vehicle6 distinction worked -- one of the reasons Congress would7 have expected that is, that had happened before in8 history. We show, again in our brief, a number of cases.9 For a long time, there have been distinctions between10 allowing liability for -- and back then, it was stagecoach11 drivers that drove too fast through town. And those cases12 were held -- you know, when you -- when you held someone13 liable for driving too fast through town, that was held14 not to be a stoppage of the mail, stoppage of the15 transmission of the mail. But when you tried to regulate,16 more fundamentally, how the Postal Service decided to do17 its deliveries, and whom it would authorize to undertake18 the delivery, that was held to interfere with the mails.19 And I think --20 JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- but I'm surprised21 that there's no empirical examples of what -- well, I22 would think it would have happened, in 50 years and tens23 of millions of packages, that a package falls off a truck.24 You know, the next driver veers somewhere and gets into25 an accident, and they say it was the -- it wasn't packed47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 properly. I think should have happened sometime in the2 Post Service over -- Postal Service over 50 year. My3 guess is, it did happen and you just paid.4 MS. MILLETT: My guess is that we did not pay,5 because that --6 JUSTICE BREYER: Really?7 MS. MILLETT: -- would be an injury rising --8 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any --9 MS. MILLETT: -- to and from the --10 JUSTICE BREYER: Do we actually know, either of11 us? I don't, I confess. Do you -- do you --12 MS. MILLETT: I don't, off the top of my head,13 but I -- you know, the distinctions that -- in talking14 with the Postal Service here, I mean, it may -- it -- one15 would -- think it might have happened, but perhaps it16 hasn't. Hopefully, it hasn't. But, if it has, I mean,17 it's a fine distinction. And any tort -- you know, a18 first-year tort student knows that tort lines can, you19 know, give rise to difficult analysis at times. But if20 you understand that what Congress was trying to protect21 here was the movement of the mail and the handling of the22 mail in a way that the Postal Service does --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I don't --24 MS. MILLETT: -- that really no one else --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I don't understand your last48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425distinction.  You say there is no liability for thepackage that falls off the back of the truck, but there isliability if the truck hits another vehicle.  I reallydon't understand the basis for that distinction.          MS. MILLETT:  The claim for the -- if we'reassuming it's a mispacking of the mail into the truck, isthe --          JUSTICE SCALIA:   Right.          MS.

MILLETT:  -- and the way it was packed --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but the person who tripsdoesn't say, "Oh, this really hurts me because it's mailinstead of a box of oranges," does he?          MS. MILLETT:  "Who put this mail here?  This is-- this is -- mail shouldn't be here."  I mean, you have-- a simple way of looking at it is, you have two thingsgoing on at the same time in the car, in the vehicle.You've got the regular activity of driving, and you've gotthe transmission of mail.  But when you come to the porch,you have one activity, and one activity only.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but --          MS. MILLETT:  And that is transmission --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- your argument, as I50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 understand it, on the -- on the truck accident and on the2 package that falls out of the truck -- is that the fact3 that mail transmission is going on at the same time is4 utterly irrelevant to the cause of the damage. And isn't5 it equally open to the -- isn't your position equally open6 to the argument that, when the person trips over the7 package on the porch, it is utterly irrelevant that that8 package has been placed there by a postal employee and has9 been carried in the mail? It is in the same -- it has the10 same character, vis-a-vis tripping, that a brick or a rock11 or any other package might have.12 So, if you're going to be consistent with13 respect to the passage of the truck, the package that14 drops out of the truck, and the piece -- and the package15 on the porch, don't you have to say it is irrelevant that16 the package in the porch has been carried in the mail and17 put there by a postal employee? It's its character of18 package at that place that matters.19 MS. MILLETT: It's the character as mail that20 matters. Mail that's been in transmission is what21 matters. And this --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you can say -- then you23 can say exactly the same thing about the package that24 falls off the truck. You can characterize that. You can25 say, "Look, it wouldn't have been in the truck if they51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 weren't delivering mail."2 3 45 could say6 the truck7JUSTICE SCALIA:  She says that.MS. MILLETT:  What direct --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Pardon me?  But you -- and youthat there wouldn't have been any accident withif the truck hadn't been delivering mail.MS. MILLETT:  It may not be delivering mail at8 the time it has an accident with you. There's no way the9 delivery of mail occurs without the actual delivery of10 mail. That's the point. But, again, you have a text here11 that does not admit of distinctions based on what kind of12 injury happens two hours later, whether it's spoiled food,13 an exploding package, or a trip. And if it's difficult --14 this is a waiver of sovereign immunity. And the fact that15 this is in the text, this case doesn't involve a vehicle,16 and that this case raises serious concerns for the Postal17 Service about how it's going to handle an enormous --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But can I just --19 MS. MILLETT: -- volume of mail.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? The case is21 a little bit on the border, because it's a slip-and-fall,22 and it does -- there may not have been negligence. We --23 but we're assuming, via the allegations, they're true.24 But your position would apply to an intentional tort, as25 well as a negligent tort, I think, wouldn't it?52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. MILLETT: Not if it's transmission of the2 mail, because the exception only applies to negligent3 transmission of the mail.

MILLETT: No, actually negligent or wrongful20 acts are covered. There's 2680(h), which covers a number21 of intentional torts and -- it's often referred to as the22 intentional-tort exception. But, actually, it wouldn't23 cover -- the -- bopping with a package would probably be24 assault. But if we deliver a package that has anthrax in25 it, I don't know that that would be covered.

I mean, itMS. MILLETT:  Well, then I'll probably --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- do you have anyresponse to that policy concern?[Laughter.]          MS. MILLETT:  Then I'll probably be subject tosome intentional torts, myself.[Laughter.]          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the practicalproblem that was raised that, in the automobile accident,there's witnesses, there's a police report, usually; but aslip-and-fall over mail, nobody's around, these are easilymade up, and the Post Office has no opportunity to check?          MR. RADMORE:  The Post Office has everyopportunity, just as in any ordinary tort.  All thedefenses apply.  In this particular case, the Post Office-- and it's been alluded to by several Justices -- wouldbe that they have the defense of contributory negligence.56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 They would have any defense that would be available --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point that -- I think3 that they were making is that there will be an4 investigation, on the spot, ordinarily, in the case of a5 vehicle collision. Post Office won't even know about the6 slip-and-fall until a claim is filed, which could be weeks7 and weeks later.8 MR. RADMORE: But that's -- that's the situation9 in any tort. There doesn't have to be a police report,10 necessarily, in an automobile accident. And in a -- any11 slip-and-fall or any tort, beyond the motor vehicle12 accident, it's the same situation. It's not unique to the13 Post Office.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the volume is15 unique. In other words, there aren't going to, in a16 typical case, be a lot of witnesses, and the volume is17 unique. And you can't bring the postal carrier in, two18 years after the fact, and say, "Do you remember where you19 placed this parcel on this porch on this day?"20 MR. RADMORE: That's what you'd have to do to a21 UPS or a Federal Express employee. And I believe22 Solicitor General's response to Justice Ginsburg question23 about the number of claims that you have a year -- I24 believe the Solicitor General said situations like this25 arise ten times a year. And the Postal -- the Post57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Office's own handbook dealing with the handling of2 negligence cases sets forth procedures and policies that3 deal exactly with this type of circumstance. If we were4 to look at the handbook -- I think, Justice Kennedy5 referred to the handbook, and that section 141 of the6 Postal Investigation Handbook talks about claims that7 arise for personal injury or property damage during the8 delivery of the mail. So, at least since -- and that's9 been -- that was put in place in 1992, so we at least10 know, for the last 13 years, that they've anticipated11 these type of claims. And, according to the Government,12 there's only been ten a year. So, I don't think that13 there's a real concern by the Post Office that there's14 going to be some -- a floodgate of litigation opened up.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.16 The case is submitted.17 [Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the18 above-entitled matter was submitted.]192021222324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40058Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
