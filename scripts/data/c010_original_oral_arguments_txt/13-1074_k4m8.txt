Wong.      Mr. Martinez.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MARTINEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Three features of the FTCA's text andhistory make clear that Congress did not want to allowequitable tolling of its time bar.  First, Congressdrafted that bar in 1946 usingtransplanted from the parallelSecond ­­jurisdictional languageTucker Act context.OfficialJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the ­­ is the word "jurisdiction" used?MR. MARTINEZ: The word "jurisdiction" was not used in ­­ in that language, Your Honor, butthe Court had interpreted that language in the Tucker Act context in six cases beginning with the ­­the Court's decision in Kendall in 1883. And that decision ­­ those line of cases had made very clear not only that the time bar was jurisdictional, but ­­Alderson Reporting Company3￼Official1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 Congress did not say jurisdiction. And I ­­ I'm sure3 you are well aware that this Court, for some time now,4 has been explaining that "jurisdiction" is a word of5 many meanings, too many meanings, and has tried to6 distinguish jurisdiction, meaning subject matter or7 personal, from the rules, once a case fits jurisdiction,8 how it will be processed in the Court. And it seems to9 me a time limitation, even a very stringent time10 limitation, is not jurisdictional.11 MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, I think two12 points on that. First of all, I think that when13 Congress acted in 1946 and it transplanted the ­­ the14 identical words of the statute that ­­ of the Tucker15 Act ­­ the statute governing Tucker Act claims, Congress16 understood itself to be incorporating the same settled17 meaning, and those words had already been given a18 jurisdictional meaning by this Court.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Jurisdictional in the20 narrow sense.21 MR. MARTINEZ: In ­­ in the sense that ­­22 that ­­ that if ­­ that it went to the Court's ability23 to hear the case ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's what I ­­25 MR. MARTINEZ: ­­ and the jurisdictionalAlderson Reporting CompanyThat's the Court.4￼Official51 consequences were attached to those ­­ to those words.2 In other words, the ­­ the issue had ­­ could not be3 waived by the government, and no equitable tolling was4 available.5 In this Court's more recent cases, I think6 the ones that, Justice Ginsburg, you were referring to,7 in the Henderson case, what this Court said was that ­­8 was that the Court will presume that a provision is9 jurisdictional when a long line of this Court's cases,10 undisturbed by Congress, has treated a similar provision11 as jurisdictional.12 And in this case, we have a statute that had13 been interpreted by a long line of this Court's14 decisions, all in the Tucker Act context, very similar15 or identical ­­16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not the Tort Claims17 Act. The Tucker Act, I think the ­­ the line that18 the Court drew, it said if we characterize these as19 jurisdictional in a prior case, we will stick with that.20 But in the future, we're not doing that anymore.21 MR. MARTINEZ: But I think what the Court22 has said, both in the cases addressing jurisdiction and23 in the cases ­­ in the Irwin line of cases addressing24 the available of ­­ the availability of equitable25 tolling is that the Court is not going to look for magic￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial61 words in the statute. It's going to look to the text,2 the context, and the relevant historical treatment, and3 that the overarching purpose of the inquiry is going to4 be to find out what Congress understood itself to be5 doing at the time that it enacted the statute.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't7 that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as8 to new statutes? As to statutes that were passed after9 Irwin?10 MR. MARTINEZ: I don't think so, Your Honor.11 I think ­­ I think what the Court did in Irwin, it12 didn't conduct a lengthy historical analysis of all13 statutes that had ever been passed. But what it did was14 it ­­ it based its ­­ its conclusion and ­­ and the15 presumption on a kind of logical inference. The Court16 essentially reasoned, as I understood the decision, as17 follows: The Court said that ­­ that when ­­ we think18 in the mine run of cases when Congress wants to take the19 big step of waiving sovereign immunity, it's ­­ it's20 reasonable to think that Congress also likely wanted to21 take the small step of allowing equitable tolling.22 And that ­­ and that may well have been true23 in 1990, when Irwin was announced. It may have even24 been true in 1972, when the statute that was addressed25 in Irwin was announced. But we know for certain, and I￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial71 think the parties agree on this, that the rule in 1946,2 when the FTCA was passed, was something quite different,3 and the Court addressed that in the Soriano case just a4 few years later in 1957.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was different about6 1972? They were pre­Irwin. So why wouldn't 19 ­­ a7 1972 statute, the extension of Title VII to federal8 employees, why wouldn't that fall under the old regime9 instead of the fresh look that Irwin took of it in 199010 as applied to a 1972 statute?11 MR. MARTINEZ: Well, I think the ­­ the key12 thing ­­ the ­­ the issue in this case is, obviously,13 the FT ­­ is, of course, the FTCA. And I think there14 are significant distinctions between the FTCA, which was15 passed in 1946, and the provision that was passed in16 1972 that was addressed in ­­ in Irwin. And we have17 statute­specific evidence, it's very detailed and is18 much ­­ much more extensive than the evidence that was19 before the Court ­­ or that was available in ­­ with20 respect to Title VII.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, you see, I would ­­ I22 guess I would have thought that really anything23 pre­Irwin, the government could stand up and make a24 very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this25 world we actually thought that a statute of limitations￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial8￼1 with respect to a suit against a government was2 jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that3 there were really no decisions the other way, that4 Congress thought of that as the background rule. And so5 what's to prevent this case from essentially becoming6 everything prior to 1990 is presumed to be7 jurisdictional contra Irwin?8 MR. MARTINEZ: Well, we're not asking for9 that presumption, and we don't think that the Court10 needs to apply that presumption.11 I think what the Court needs to do is to12 look at the language of Irwin, which says that there's a13 presumption. It's based on its kind of logical14 inference about the mine run of cases. But it also says15 that the presumption is rebuttable. And it's rebuttable16 based on statute­specific evidence where the government17 can come forward and overcome the presumption by showing18 that, with respect to a particular law, Congress had a19 different intent in mind.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if there's ambiguity,21 what breaks the tie? You've made your argument, but22 there are some counters. The two most important are23 that Congress took this provision out of the24 jurisdictional section, and put it in ­­ in a different25 section, number one; and, number two, it said treat theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial3 MR. MARTINEZ:4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:5 break the tie?6 MR. MARTINEZ:7 in fact a tie, I think the ­­ Irwin does ­­ does put8 essentially the slight thumb on the scale in favor of no9 equitable tolling. But I don't think that there's a tie10 in this case for a number of reasons. Let me just11 address ­­ I think the primary reason is the Tucker Act12 point which I mentioned. But let me address the two13 textual points that you raised, Your Honor.14 The first argument about the placement of15 the provisions, as the Court knows, the provisions were16 separated in 1948 as part of that recodification. And17 in the recodification law itself, in Section 33 of the18 recodification law, Congress expressly forbade any19 inference of legislative construction of what the20 statutes meant based on the chapter of U.S. Code of21 Title 28 in which it was placed. And so the argument22 that my friend makes that the placement of the23 provisions in different chapters, that's ­­ that's an24 argument that ­­ that Congress expressly took off the25 table.Alderson Reporting CompanyWithres ­­What ­­ how ­­ how do weWell, I think if there were9￼1 government like you would treat2 So those two counter.any other party.Official10￼1 With respect to the second textual2 argument ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was in the text of the4 recodification?5 MR. MARTINEZ: Yes. That was in ­­ in6 Section 33 of the 1948 recodification. And not only7 that, Your Honor, but ­­ but I think this Court ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does legislative history9 support that, too?10 MR. MARTINEZ: It does. The legislative11 history supports ­­ supports it. It's not just the12 texture, Justice Scalia.13 The ­­ with respect to the second argument,14 Justice Sotomayor, that you raised, I think it's true15 that there's language in ­­ elsewhere in the FTCA in16 Section 2674 about the idea that ­­ that the FTCA17 intended to create liability where a private person ­­18 in circumstances where a private person would be liable19 under State law. But what this Court recognized in20 Richards and what ­­ what a lot of courts have21 recognized, including Judge Friendly's opinion for the22 Second Circuit in the Kosak case is that the time bar23 provision, 2401, is an exception to that principle and24 is essentially a circumstance in which Congress25 specifically indicated that it didn't want the same ruleAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial11￼1 to apply as would apply between private parties in ­­2 under State law.3 And so we don't think that those textual4 arguments get a lot of traction here and they certainly5 don't overcome the strongest textual argument which is6 on our side, which is, of course, the express and7 deliberate incorporation of the Tucker Act language that8 it applied to Tucker Act suits in the court of claims.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Tucker Act doesn't have10 to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same11 extent as with respect to a private party. That's new12 in the Tort Claims Act.13 MR. MARTINEZ: It ­­ it's true that the14 Tucker Act doesn't have that language. I don't think it15 needed that language because the Tucker Act ­­16 essentially, that language in the Tort Claims Act, I17 think, is intended to point to the substantive ­­ the18 law that's supposed to be applied, as this Court19 recognized in Richards. And so it says, you know, look20 to State law when you're applying the tort law.21 The Tucker Act is a little different because22 there you're applying Federal law. You're applying23 Federal constitutional law, Federal statutory law or the24 Federal common law of contracts in the Tucker Act25 context. So it didn't need that language.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial12￼1 But what the Court has recognized in its2 cases is, again, that that principle of ­­ sort of the3 parity principle, you know, treat the government like a4 private party, that ­­ that 2401(b) is really an5 exception to that principle.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: I take it that your argument7 would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)?8 MR. MARTINEZ: We ­­ the government's9 position is that 2401(a) is ­­ is also jurisdictional,10 not subject to tolling. But our argument is really that11 the Irwin inquiry requires a statute­specific inquiry.12 And so ­­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it's the same language.14 And if I understood the argument you're ­­ you're15 making, it's ­­ your essential argument is this16 incorporated the Tucker language, Congress knew what the17 Tucker language meant, therefore, Congress understood18 these to be jurisdictional as well.19 MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, I don't want to20 resist your ­­ your point too much, but I do want to21 point thought that 2401(a)'s history is slightly22 different. The language in 2401(a) actually originates23 in the Tucker Act itself in 1887. The language from24 2501 actually came from the 1863 statute, and that's the25 language, the actual ­­ you know, the 12­word phraseAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial13￼1 that's repeated in 2401(b) comes from that provision.2 So there's some slight differences, but we're not going3 to fight. We certainly would agree that the ­­ that the4 2401(a) language is ­­ is jurisdictional and that's5 being litigated in the lower courts.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: I meant, I have to think7 that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of8 language. There's nothing unusual about this language9 "shall be barred." This is kind of the classic10 language, right?11 MR. MARTINEZ: I think that the "shall be12 barred" or "forever barred," that language does appear13 in a couple of places. But I think what ­­ what's14 important for purposes of our argument is not just that15 two­word phrase, but the broader phrase, because the16 broader phrase is what shows that when ­­ when the human17 being who sat down on behalf of Congress to actually18 write this statute, it shows, I think, that he was19 basing it ­­ he was essentially cut and pasting from the20 preexisting Tucker Act provision. And so that language21 that's relevant is not just "forever barred," but the22 phrase "every claim against the United States cognizable23 shall be forever barred unless." And I think that it's24 very ­­ it's not just the language itself, although the25 language is identical, but it's clear that Congress,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial14￼1 when it was drafting the FTCA, was ­­ its goal was to2 fill a gap that had been left open in the Tucker Act.3 The Tucker Act itself said that it would apply to4 certain claims, quote, "not sounding in tort," unquote.5 And the legislative history that ­­ that we've cited in6 our briefs discussing the purposes of the FTCA makes7 clear that Congress was looking at the ­­ the Tucker8 Act, they saw that there was this hole for tort claims,9 they wanted to plug that gap, and they wanted to give10 tort claimants, in the language of the ­­ of the11 relevant committee reports, the same right to a day in12 court that claimants had under the Tucker Act.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: It sounds to me like, the14 way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have15 to take a case on every statute of limitations in ­­ in16 the U.S. Code. Because you're saying, well, this is17 similar enough and maybe this would be a little bit18 different, it has a few fewer words, and then we have to19 look at the history, and we have to stare at the20 drafting concerns of Congress. And I thought that Irwin21 was supposed to take us away from all that.22 MR. MARTINEZ: I ­­ I don't think that ­­ I23 don't think it's correct that you would have to take a24 case on every statute of limitations, Your Honor. I25 think that ­­ that in those cases where the governmentAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial15 1 can come forward with strong statute­specific arguments,￼2 that the statute was ­­ was lifted, for example, from3 the Tucker Act or from other similar statutes that had4 been repeatedly interpreted as jurisdictional, I don't5 think there's going to be much question about whether6 tolling is allowed.7 JUSTICE SCALIA:8 presumption, right?9 MR. MARTINEZ:10 JUSTICE SCALIA:11 could be overcome and it made clear that this is a12 question of what was the congressional intent. When you13 put all those three together, of course, you have to14 look at each statute separately, don't you?15 MR. MARTINEZ: We ­­ I couldn't agree more,16 Justice Scalia. And I think that's ­­ that's actually17 consistent with this Court's practice. After Irwin,18 the Court has repeatedly looked at ­­ at different19 Federal statutes and it's conducted exactly the kind of20 statute­specific inquiry into the text, the history, the21 precedent, trying to figure out what Congress was22 thinking.23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you have looked at24 the ­­ the statutes that could be interpreted one way or25 the other, are there any that you have concluded are notAlderson Reporting CompanyIrwin said this was just aAnd that's exact ­­  And it said the presumptionOfficial16￼1 jurisdictional other than those that we have already2 held are not jurisdictional?3 MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, I confess that I4 haven't gone through the ­­ the code with an effort to5 try to figure out where ones that are not6 jurisdictional. I think the ones that I have looked at7 are the ones that the Court has addressed, most8 significantly in the Brokamp case, in Beggerly, in9 Auburn Regional, in John R. Sand & Gravel, and now in ­­10 in this case. And I think what ­­ what those precedents11 show is that what the Court has done with Irwin is not12 to treat it as a conclusive presumption, but, rather, to13 treat it as a rebuttable presumption ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Sure. But there are two15 kinds of ways that you can rebut something. One is by16 saying, here's something very distinctive about this17 statute that shows that Congress meant for it to be18 jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn't mean for19 equitable tolling to apply. But that's not the kind of20 argument you are making here. You're making an argument21 that basically says in this pre­Irwin world, Congress22 understood that when it came to statutes against the23 government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable24 tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act. And that25 could be said, I think, for every statute with respectAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial17￼1 to suits against the government prior to Irwin.2 MR. MARTINEZ: With respect, Justice Kagan,3 that's ­­ that's not our argument. Our argument is4 specific to the FTCA and there I think ­­ I don't want5 to give you more than three, the golden rule of three,6 but there are five distinctions. I can just tick them7 off.8 One is the incorporation of the express9 language of the Tucker Act. Two is the fact that this10 Court addressed this ­­ this particular statute, or at11 least tort claims, in the Soriano decision. It also12 addressed this particular provision 2401(b) in Kontrick.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Soriano was ­­14 was a Tucker Act case.15 MR. MARTINEZ: It did, Your Honor, but ­­16 but the Court expressly addressed ­­ it said that ­­17 essentially, that the same rule that would apply in18 Tucker Act cases would also apply to ­­ to statutes19 waiving sovereign immunity for tort actions. And that20 was a response to the point that we had made in our21 brief ­­22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the sovereign23 immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would24 be overcome in every case against the government because25 government ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial18￼1 MR. MARTINEZ: I think ­­ I think at a2 minimum, it would ­­ I think what we have in this3 statute that was not present in Irwin is the fact that4 this Court had expressly mentioned, you know, tort5 actions; and then not only did the Court mention it, but6 then Congress reenacted the statute in 1966, not just7 against the backdrop of this Court's statement in8 Soriano, but also against the backdrop of the uniform9 view of the lower courts, including a number of courts10 of appeals, that it all said that this statute was11 jurisdictional, not subject to waiver, not subject to12 tolling. And so that's another unique feature of this13 statute, the 1966 reenactment.14 We also have a number of private laws, ten15 real­life statutes that were passed by Congress that16 seem to refer explicitly to 2401(b) as having ­­ as17 being a jurisdictional statute. That's very different18 from Irwin and it's very different from a lot of almost19 ­­ I would imagine almost any other statute of20 limitations in the U.S. Code.21 And then finally, we have the fact that22 Congress for 60 years, from the '20s through the 1980s,23 repeatedly grappled with the very question that's at24 issue in this case, which is whether equitable tolling25 should be permitted under the FTCA. In the ­­ in theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial19￼1 bills that it ­­ that it considered before 1946, a2 number of those bills, 9 of the 31 that had been3 proposed, had various types of tolling provisions.4 Those were left out of the final statute. Since ­­5 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there another ­­ is6 there another reason ­­ I think both briefs are good7 briefs and you each have good arguments. And so if it's8 an open question, why does the government oppose this?9 That is to say, compared to contracts, people who are10 suing on contracts usually have a lawyer and they have11 had lawyers, they're dealing with the government, not12 all. But this is about torts. And people who are hurt13 with torts are frequently badly hurt, they could be14 anyone in the world. The government could have treated15 them very badly. Lots of things can happen.16 Hurricanes. The lawyer gets deathly ill on the way to17 the courthouse. The clerk mixes up the papers.18 Somebody steals the lawyer's briefs and runs off to19 Chicago.20 I mean, all kinds of odd things can happen21 to a victim of a tort caused by the United States. Now,22 if in fact you throw them out on this thing, which I23 would call a technicality, he has to go to the Senate24 and he has to ask them for a private bill, which is a25 drain on their time and somewhat random. So those areAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial(Laughter.)      MR. MARTINEZ:on our side ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. MARTINEZ:little bit of context for why ­­ why Congress and whythe United States Department of Justice and theExecutive Branch has consistently opposed equitabletolling in these circumstances.  And this was heavilydebated before 1946 and it's been heavily debated since.Alderson Reporting CompanyIn addition to the law being  Yes.­­ let me try to give a20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the real choices.      Now, why other than, well, we read it andthat's what the law is ­­ I got that part and that isnot a bad argument on your part.  But is there anythingelse?  Is there any sort of functional reason why thegovernment doesn't just say, look, where this person'sbeen hurt and can win his court, fine, we won't throwhim out on the basis of this.  If the hurricane happens,et cetera, then let's proceed anyway.MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, as ­­ as you suggested, our primary argument here is that ­­ that we should win because the law is on our side.JUSTICE BREYER: That there's nothing else? That's a good reason by the way. That's a good reason, yes.Official21￼1 And at every turn, what ­­ what the position of the2 Executive Branch and of Congress, the conclusion that3 they've come to, is that this is such ­­ this was such a4 revolutionary step for ­­ for Congress to take in 1946,5 to create the tort remedy in the first place. And this6 was the second great waiver of sovereign immunity. It7 in some ways, you know, reconceptualized the ­­ the8 relationship between the government to the people,9 but ­­ and that was a great step. But they were very10 cautious. They were very careful and they ­­ they11 expressly treated the statute of limitations provision12 as a safeguard to protect the government from claims13 that could be brought years afterwards. And so they14 wanted something that was strict and this was going to15 ­­ the purpose of the limitations provision was going to16 be to preserve evidence, and also to ­­ there was17 another consideration, which was the fact that this was18 a very controversial bill. It took 20 years for it to19 get through in the 20th century ­­20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Martinez, what21 you said, it's as though the choice were statute of22 limitations or nothing. To get equitable tolling, it's23 a pretty tough case. In order to get equitable tolling,24 you must have a truly exceptional case, maybe the case25 that we're now ­­ that's now before us is such a case.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial221 But it is not easy to get equitable tolling. You have2 to be especially deserving.3 So isn't that the answer to it? Ordinarily,4 the statute of limitations will govern, but if there are5 equitable reasons, then there can be an exception. But6 those reasons have to be very strong.7 MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, I think that's8 true, that's how the equitable tolling doctrine has been9 conceived and if Congress were rewriting the statute10 today, it may well decide ­­ it could well decide that11 that would be a better approach. But the approach that12 Congress took at the time ­­ and I think this is best13 reflected in the colloquy that's cited in page ­­ on14 page 41 of our brief ­­ Congress considered the question15 of whether in hardship cases it would be appropriate to16 give judges some discretion where there was a good17 reason for a ­­ for a claimant to file late.18 And that suggestion was raised by19 Congressman Gwynn and the Department of Justice ­­ this20 was 2 years after the Act. The Department of Justice21 said look, it would just be impractical and it would22 create too much of a burden on the government and it23 would be impractical to have kind of a rule that was not24 hard and fast.25 And so Congress, in 1948, as that colloquy￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial231 showed, did not think that the FTCA that had been passed2 two years earlier allowed for equitable tolling, and the3 consistent view of Congress when it rejected proposals4 to add tolling nine different times between 1946 and the5 late '80s was that equitable tolling should not be6 allowed.7 And so in light of that statute­specific8 evidence, I think it's ­­ it's eminently reasonable to9 conclude that ­­ that, you know, the law is on our side.10 JUSTICE BREYER: If you want to ­­ I think11 it is quite funny, what I said. I'm sorry. Of course,12 the question is the law, all right. I think what I said13 before is relevant to the law. But the question here is14 a slightly more subtle one in my mind. I agree with15 you, the legislative history, et cetera, does show they16 used "jurisdiction" nonstop. Those are the words. But17 "jurisdiction" at that time did not have the Irwin18 meaning.19 And so later on, there comes a case, which20 case Irwin now treats this quite differently than it did21 before. And isn't the question ­­ or is the question22 from the legislative history point of view a pretty hard23 one to answer: Did Congress or would those who passed24 the bill looking at the reasons wanted this statute to25 pick up the later interpretation of jurisdiction or they￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial24￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425wanted it to have stayed the same in the face of thatlater change in how the courts treat the word.MR. MARTINEZ: I think ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: A living Federal Tort Claims Act is what we're talking about here.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: That's actually right. MR. MARTINEZ: Justice Breyer, I thinkthat ­­ I think that, first of all, what this Court hasalways said, of course, is that ­­ that the goal ofstatutory construction in this context as in any otheris to look at the text in light of its context and itshistorical treatment.  What Irwin says is that the goalis to find what the legislative intent was with respectto this particular statute.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But you see, the question is ­­ I mean, normally, it arises in a much grander context. Normally, it arises in the context of changes of terms of the Constitution and so forth. This is not that grand context. But still, in this minor context, why isn't the question the same? How did Congress ­­ or would because it's hypothetical ­­ they didn't know?MR. MARTINEZ: It's not hypothetical, because I think Congress did actually address this exactAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial25￼1 question. 31 bills were discussed between 1925 and2 1946, were proposed in Congress, involving tort claims,3 proposed tort claims bills. 9 of those bills ­­4 JUSTICE BREYER: They didn't ­­ they had the5 tolling. They didn't pass it and normally what they6 didn't pass isn't something that's really great strong7 evidence in light of the meaning of what they did pass.8 MR. MARTINEZ: That ­­ that's normally true.9 But what this ­­ what this Court said in the Muniz case10 is that in the particular context of the FTCA, because11 there was market reliance by each succeeding Congress12 on ­­ on the bills that had been proposed earlier, that13 the omission of a ­­ of a provision from the final FTCA14 that had been there before, we should treat that as a15 deliberate choice, not an inadvertent omission. So I16 think it was a deliberate choice here.17 And I think, with respect to the evolution18 of the statute since then, as of 1966, we know that19 Congress reexamined the time bar. At that ­­ at that20 point in time, it was legislating against a backdrop21 where this Court had suggested in Soriano that it was22 jurisdictional, the lower courts had uniformly treated23 it as jurisdictional, and not just by putting the label24 on it, but by attaching jurisdictional consequences.25 Congress reenacted the statute without any change inAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425meaning, and then even until the late '80s, itrepeatedly considered proposals to add forms of tollingto the statute.JUSTICE SCALIA: If we were to adopt the position that a statute can change in light of current circumstances, what would that Congress think about it today, would there be any reason to limit that to the Federal Tort Claims Act, that proposition?MR. MARTINEZ: I think it would be hard to do and, Your Honor ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: We're into judge Calebresi's manner of statutory interpretation, right? MR. MARTINEZ: I think it would be hard todo.  But most importantly for this case, I think thatthat approach would put ­­ would essentially be at oddswith Irwin, because Irwin says that what governs here isthe legislative intent and that, obviously, I think, hasto be ascertained at the time the statute was passed.      If I could reserve the balance of my timefor rebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial27￼1 it please the Court:2 I think it would be helpful to start by3 pointing out that there are two different background4 rules at issue here. The first is the rule in Irwin,5 which concerns the availability of equitable estoppel6 and, as my brother has pointed out, it is a presumption7 that statute of limitations are subject to equitable8 estoppel, and I think he aptly characterized its9 significant by saying it's a ­­ it's a thumb on the10 scale.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But ­­ but not with12 respect to governmental statutes. I mean, that was a13 question of first impression in Irwin.14 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, the presumption is ­­15 it's the same presumption. But there's a second16 background rule here which is somewhat different, and17 that's the rule Justice Ginsburg pointed to earlier, and18 that concerns whether a statutory requirement is19 jurisdictional.20 Now, there the line of cases are this21 Court's decisions from Arbaugh to Sebelius, such as last22 year, and the requirement there is a clear statement.23 And that's, a clear statement requirement, is24 considerably more demanding. It's more like a whole25 hand on the scale. It's not a search for intent in theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial28￼1 same way that Irwin suggests.2 This, the statutory requirement in this3 case, truly does not satisfy the clear statement4 requirement. The language of 1346(a) provides that if5 six requirements are met the courts shall have6 jurisdiction. So at this point, the burden is even7 greater. The Federal Tort Claims Act is highly specific8 about things like that. It ­­ it ­­ there is an express9 carve­out for things deemed not jurisdictional for10 pension claims. There is also a provision in Section11 2671 defining some of the terms in 1346. Those would be12 jurisdictional. But there is no connection between the13 statute of limitations and the jurisdictional14 provisions.15 And if I might respectfully disagree with16 the government about one historical matter, the statute17 of limitations and the jurisdictional provision have18 always been separate. The statute of limitations was in19 Section 420 of the original Act, and the jurisdictional20 provision was in Section 410. And they had their own21 headings back in 1946, and the ­­ the term ­­ the22 heading "Jurisdiction" was only for the jurisdictional23 provision, not for Section 2401.24 So the text of the statute simply doesn't25 provide the clear statement that is needed, and ­­Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did the re ­­ what did the recodification do?MR. SCHNAPPER: It moved things to ­­ to different parts of 28 U.S.C., but it ­­ those sections were separate all along.      The ­­ and in this regard we agree with thegovernment, the view advanced by the government in itsbriefs in Zipes and Arbaugh, which is that when a ­­ astatute of limitations and a jurisdictional provisionare in separate provisions of the statute, which theyalways have been, that that gives rise to a strongpresumption that they are not jurisdictional.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. SCHNAPPER:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. SCHNAPPER:    So did we err in McNeil?Sorry?    Did we err in McNeil?You did not but ­­ butOfficialMcNeil does not hold that the exhaustion requirement isjurisdictional.  We disagree with the government aboutthat.  The district court had held the requirement wasjurisdictional.  This Court held only that therequirement hadn't been satisfied.      If the Court had used the word"jurisdiction" it wouldn't have been any consequence; itwould have been, as the Court's phrase goes, a drive­byjurisdictional ruling.  But this is less than that.  TheAlderson Reporting Company29￼Official30￼1 government asked the Court in McNeil to label that2 requirement jurisdictional and it didn't. So McNeil is3 an unsuccessful solicitation of a drive­by4 jurisdictional rule. It simply doesn't provide the5 support that you suggest.6 There would, in any event, have been some7 statutory argument there, because the jurisdictional ­­8 excuse me, the exhaustion requirement in Section 2675 is9 in Chapter 171. And the jurisdictional provision does10 contain the language "subject to Chapter 171." But the11 statute of limitations is in sub ­­ is in Chapter 161.12 There isn't that same cross­reference.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, what do14 you do with what I take to be the government's main15 argument? They said here are these two statutes waiving16 the government's sovereign immunity. The Tucker Act, no17 equitable tolling. Tort Claims Act comes later, it uses18 a lot of the same language, it has the same object, so19 the Tort Claims Act should be interpreted in harmony20 with the Tucker Act.21 MR. SCHNAPPER: We think there are a number22 of problems with that argument. It has various23 iterations and maybe I can separate them out.24 One version of that is that the words "shall25 be forever barred" are inherently jurisdictional. AndAlderson Reporting Company12 the purpose of this statute13 exception in the Tucker Act14 MR. SCHNAPPER:15 JUSTICE SCALIA:was to eliminate thefor torts.  The ­­But ­­That was the obvious16 purpose of it, so they ­­ they repeat the language ofOfficial311 as we note in our brief, that language is in a number of2 other statutes. The particular cadence of it, every act3 shall be forever barred unless, is also in the Clayton4 Act, which in Rotella this Court held was not5 jurisdictional, and it's in the Fair Labor Standards6 Act, which is ­­ where the government repeatedly7 contends that equitable tolling is available.8 So I think the ­­ and indeed ­­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't just that phrase.10 It's other language that is just lifted verbatim from11 the two prior Acts. And you add to that the fact that￼17 the Tucker Act and say it applies to torts.18 One would think that the same limitations19 that applied to the Tucker Act continue to apply.20 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, we ­­ we think not,21 Your Honor. The ­­ again, the ­­ the rest of the22 language of the Tucker Act and the Federal Tort Claims23 Act are very different. There are 24 sections of the24 Federal Tort Claims Act, 35 sections of the Tucker Act.25 The rest of them have almost no overlap. It's just thisAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial32￼1 phrase, which is the same phrase in a number of other2 statutes.3 But to get back to the government's4 historical point about the meaning ­­ about the pre­19465 decisions, as we've suggested in our brief, those6 decisions never turn on the words "shall be forever7 barred." A series of decisions dating from the 18838 decision in Kendall took the position ­­ and that was9 the view in the 19th century ­­ that any requirement10 pertinent to a waiver of sovereign immunity was11 jurisdictional, no matter what it was.12 And if the Court were to look at the13 critical paragraph in the decision in Kendall which the14 government relies on, the first four sentences of that15 paragraph are an exposition of that rule: Any16 requirement, any bar, is jurisdictional.17 Then the fifth sentence says: So what are18 the bars in the Tucker Act, and then it notess that there19 is a statute of limitations which has the language that20 applies here. But if Congress had been familiar with21 those details, and we presume that sort of thing, though22 it's not entirely realistic, they would not have drawn23 from those decisions the view that the language of the24 Tucker Act was of any significance, because it wasn't to Formatted: Font25 that line of cases.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 have both argued so far, that there is nothing direct in3 terms of a report or a hearing or a statement on the4 floor that shows that anyone in Congress, staff or5 member, ever thought about this problem. Is that right?6 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's our ­­ that's our7 argument ­­8 JUSTICE BREYER: So what we're doing then is9 we are, however we do it, creating a number ­­ not10 creating but following a number of legal rules, court11 developed, which seek to determine what the, quote,12 intent of Congress was on the basis of other things, not13 necessarily what they said or what they ­­ that's the14 situation?15 MR. SCHNAPPER: I ­­ I think that's right.16 And we rely on the rules and on Arbaugh in cases about17 jurisdictional requirements, and in Irwin about ­­ about18 equitable tolling.19 If ­­ as I was ­­ just one more point about20 Irwin. As we noted in our brief, at the oral argument21 in Irwin counsel for the United States pointed out that22 that language, "shall be forever barred," was not of any23 distinctive importance and suggested it was probably24 language from the 19th century that was just common.25 And that's true; most States used that very language atAlderson Reporting CompanyI take it from what you33￼Official1213 in ­­ 1415 is incompatible with what I thought your position was,16 that it depends upon congressional intent. So we can17 just ignore everything you've argued up to here. It18 doesn't depend upon congressional intent because we can19 give those words meaning that the Congress did not give20 them at the time. You have to pick one argument or the21 other.22 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, our view ­­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you ­­ are you going to24 be bound by ­­ by what the Congress at the time believed25 it was enacting or not?In Soriano ­­ excuse me, in ­­ excuse me,JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me thatAlderson Reporting Company34￼1 the time. It was just ­­ it wasn't of any particular2 independent significance.3 With regard to the question asked by Justice4 Scalia about the living Federal Tort Claims Act and what5 we're to do about the fact that the principles of6 interpretation in Irwin and the Arbaugh line of cases7 weren't on the table back in 1946: This issue has come8 up in at least four cases and the Court has, although in9 one instance over your dissent, taken the position that10 when those rules are applied they don't have effective11 dates. They apply to all statutes.Official351 MR. SCHNAPPER: We agree with Justice Breyer2 that this ­­ that this ­­ it's not a question of ­­ of3 any indication of actual intent. The Court has taken4 the position that when new rules of this sort are5 adopted, they are applied to laws that didn't exist that6 were adopted before that. In your decision for the7 Court in Young v. United States is a perfect example of8 that. In the ­­ I'm sorry, that's wrong. Your decision9 of the Court in Sandoval is an example of that. In10 Sandoval, the issue was somewhat different. It was11 whether to imply a private cause of action. And since12 the Court's decision in Cort v. Ash, this Court has had13 a somewhat more fairly demanding standard. But counsel14 for the plaintiff in that case, myself, argued that15 since the statute involved had been adopted under the16 Ancien Regime back in the days of J.I. Case v. Borak,17 that rule should apply. And you, the Court, unanimously18 rejected that argument. And it made ­­ it made the19 point, which is completely applicable here, the Cort20 v. ­­ the statute in Cort v. Ash had also been enacted21 under the Ancien Regime back before the days of Cort v.22 Ash, but that was the way the Court was going to apply23 it.24 That's precisely the situation here with25 regard to Irwin. Irwin is a statute adopted under the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial361 Ancien Regime as you said. Arbaugh is a statute adopted2 before Arbaugh. Those rules are applied to all3 statutes. Now, if there's an affirmative demonstration4 of actual intent, if something was discussed as Justice5 Breyer says, that might be a different matter.6 JUSTICE ALITO: This is ­­ this is spinning7 out into degrees of abstraction that I hadn't8 anticipated. But it's hard for me to believe that9 Congress really had any intent whatsoever on ­­ on these10 issues. I don't envision members of Congress sitting11 around thinking about these things. But put that aside.12 Do you ­­ is it your argument that we should follow13 congressional intent or not? Or is it your argument14 that Congress's intent was to adopt ­­ to say this is15 jurisdictional and we delegate, basically, to the courts16 the ­­ the determination of what is jurisdictional? So17 if they change their mind about the difference between18 jurisdiction and non­jurisdiction, then that's what this19 should mean. Which ­­ which is it?20 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think the Court's21 answer ­­ the cases in this Court give a slightly22 different answer to that question. With regard to23 whether something is jurisdictional, the clear statement24 rule is a clear statement rule. It's like any number of25 rules like that from the Court. Something ­­ a￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial371 particularly clear expression of the views of Congress2 would do, but it is not quite the same subjective intent3 for a search for intent that we might otherwise have.4 But certainly, the Court ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO: So it's not what Congress6 intended. You're saying that if they intended to ­­ all7 they thought about was they had one idea about8 jurisdiction, they couldn't conceive of another one,9 they wanted it to be jurisdictional in accordance with10 their idea, but that would change. If ­­ if others ­­11 if courts begin to think of jurisdiction differently.12 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think my answer is13 not limited to this clear statement rule. The Court has14 articulated a number of clear statement rules. I don't15 understand those rules to just drop from the case and16 then lead to the usual wide­ranging search for ­­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, I think18 we're getting off the track that Justice Breyer put us19 on, and I think you agreed with him, that there's no20 evidence that Congress ever thought anything about what21 was going to happen in a case like Ms. Wong. They ­­22 they enacted a statute, and it had a statute of23 limitations, a firm statute of limitations, but there's24 no indication that Congress thought about jurisdiction.25 We all ­­ all that jurisdiction stuff comes from￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial38￼1 decisions of this Court.2 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. And I think in that3 circumstance, the ­­ the Court's choice of controlling4 background presumptions and clear statement of rules are5 controlling.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that7 language ­­ that language comes from decisions of this8 Court, exactly. But interpreting the precise language9 that was put into this act in the same context ais the10 Tucker Act. They were addressing a problem under the11 Tucker Act, they used that language. And whatever12 criticism you want to direct to the prior decisions of13 the Court, they have issued ­­ they had issued rulings14 on those when the Congress was looking at the FTCA.15 MR. SCHNAPPER: But those rulings, we16 contend, had nothing to do with the particular language17 of the Tucker Act.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may well be,19 but ­­20 MR. SCHNAPPER: No matter what ­­ how the21 statute of limitations had been phrased ­­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Look, there are a lot of23 statutes, perhaps most statutes, that are not explicit.24 That do not use the magic language that you insist this25 statute have. And when that happens, we don't just sitAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 back and say, well, in that case, it's up to us. We2 don't say that. We have certain rules that ­­ that3 determine what the presumptive intent of Congress was.4 And I don't care whether each individual member of5 Congress or, indeed, any single one of them had that in6 mind. They ordinarily don't. But we have rules, one of7 which that is very strong, is that when you adopt the8 language from another statute ­­ especially when it is9 in the same area, and this is the same area as the10 Tucker Act, it is eliminating the Tucker Act exemption11 for torts. When you have the same language and it has12 been ­­ that language has been interpreted by the courts13 uniformly over a period of years to mean a certain14 thing, we will presume that that is what Congress had in15 mind when it used the language.16 Now, if you're asking us to abandon that17 rule and just sit back in ­­ in any case when the18 legislative history doesn't say anything and ­­ and make19 up what we think should be the best answer, that simply20 is not the way we've proceeded.21 MR. SCHNAPPER:22 Honor.23 JUSTICE BREYER:24 sorry, but I get ­­ I mean,25 existed saying ­­ inferringNor should it be, Your Didn't ­­ I mean, the ­­what about many statutesa certain use of the wordAlderson Reporting Company39￼Official401 about men sitting on juries. And the statutes that say2 those things were enacted long before anyone thought a3 woman would ever sit on a jury. But when they're4 interpreted by the courts, by and large, they're5 interpreted to include both genders. All right? There6 are many instances. So certainly Justice Scalia is7 right in my opinion that that is a rule that ­­ the one8 he enunciates, but neither an absolutely firm rule nor9 the only rule.10 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I'm happy to agree11 with all that. But ­­ but I think where we ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think man means women,13 right? Never mind.14 MR. SCHNAPPER: I don't think we have to15 address all that here. I'm sure you'll have another16 opportunity ­­17 (Laughter.)18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper ­­ Mr.19 Schnapper, I think that I heard a disagreement between20 you and Justice Scalia on how close the words were, and21 you said, yes, there are some phrases in common, but22 there are big differences, too, in the wording of the23 Tort Claims Act. So you can pick out some words and24 say, yes, Congress adopted that language, but in other25 parts it didn't take the Tucker Act as the model used￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial19 things that don't have a particular20 don't apply ­­21 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, no.22 one of the carveouts, that you have23 It's in the ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:25 MR. SCHNAPPER: ­­ the Federal Torts ClaimsAlderson Reporting Companycarveout that That is ­­ that isto give notice.No, no.in fact,theOne of41￼1 different language.2 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's true. And,3 there are some fundamental differences between4 statutes and we think they're important here.5 them is the point that was raised earlier that6 Section 2674 says that in proceedings under the Federal7 Tort Claims Act, defendant, the United States, would be8 liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a9 private defendant in a private action in State court,10 equitable tolling would be the ­­ the rule. Now, there11 are a number of specific exceptions to the language of12 2674, but none of them apply here. And we think ­­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's14 a ­­ a principle that obviously doesn't cut across the15 board.16 In private actions in State court, for17 example, you do not have to give the administrative18 agency notice within two years, there are all sorts ofOfficial42￼1 Act.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. You're3 misunderstanding my point. In other words, just because4 the law says the United States will be liable to the5 same extent as a private party, it doesn't mean that all6 the rules ­­ I mean in State court ­­ it doesn't mean7 that all the rules that apply in ­­ that you interpret8 them the same way across the board. There is no9 requirement that you give a two­years notice in the10 typical State court action. But under your theory,11 well, there ought to be ­­ do you understand where I'm12 headed?13 MR. SCHNAPPER: I do. But ­­ but our view14 is that having announced that general principle in 2674,15 Congress then went on in the Federal Tort Claims Act and16 spelled out a series of express areas where it17 designated a different Federal answer. And one of them18 is the presentment requirement, that actually went so19 far as to say the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are20 going to apply. There's a whole series, though. There21 are listed in Footnote 28 in United States v. Richards.22 Section 2680 has 17 other exceptions ­­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think in24 every other ­­25 MR. SCHNAPPER: If Congress wanted aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial43￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425different result, they spelled that out.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think inevery other respect, the procedure under the Federalaction is the same as under the State action?MR. SCHNAPPER: Presumptively ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it goes ­­ it goes to liability, right? That's the word that's used? Liability?MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it says in ­­ in like manner. I mean ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not procedures. I mean, the procedures are different, obviously.MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, but a ­­ a statute of limitations is a bar to liability. And it ­­ this isn't just a question of how many depositions you ­­ you would get ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I don't find the ­­ the existence of ­­ of those exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, so persuasive, because unlike the Tucker Act, the Tort Claims Act refers to State law, so you have to make exceptions unless you're going to suck in everything about State law, procedures and everything else.      So, you know, it's sort of apples andAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial441 oranges. The fact that those exceptions are there are2 explicable not because Congress didn't think3 jurisdiction meant jurisdiction in the narrow sense,4 but, rather, because having referred us to State law,5 they had to make some exceptions from State law.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't your point,7 however, that this is a new regime, that it's not the8 Tucker Act, that it's something created ­­ they may have9 borrowed from the Tucker Act some phrases and a couple10 of things, but they created a new statute. So to say11 they were wholesale taking the Tucker Act or even12 considering that they were duplicating the Tucker Act is13 not appropriate.14 MR. SCHNAPPER: I ­­ I think that's right.15 As we said, most of the statutes are entirely different.16 There's also another fundamental difference,17 which is the claims recognized by the Tucker Act were18 sent to the then newly­created Federal court of claims,19 which only had whatever powers Congress was going to20 give it as it created them. But ­­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government answered22 ­­ you're saying the difference is the district court23 has all kinds of equitable authority, claims court24 didn't. But the government answered that argument and25 said there's a difference between equitable doctrines,￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial45￼1 which the claims court followed, it's just that the2 claims court can't give equitable remedies like3 injunction.4 So the government's answer is isn't that5 divide, that equity is part of the jurisprudence of the6 claims court?7 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think that argument8 relates to the argument that's been made by the9 Plaintiffs in June. I'm making a different point, which10 is ­­ the point that would go, for example, to the11 presumption of equitable tolling and the standards of12 that articulated in this Court's decision in Holland v.13 Florida.14 The Federal district courts already existed15 in 1946. They had the inherent power to engage in16 equitable tolling. There were no inherent powers in the17 court of claims in ­­ in 1863. It didn't exist.18 Holland says that if Congress ­­ that the fact that19 those powers were already there matters, and that20 there's going to have to be a strong showing that21 Congress, in adopting a statute, meant to take away the22 powers that normally existed. That problem doesn't23 exist under the Tucker Act because there ­­ there were24 no powers to take away the ­­ the courts were just being25 created at that time.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial46￼1 If I could turn for a second from the issue2 of ­­ of jurisdiction to the issue of equitable tolling,3 because the ­­ the issues there are somewhat different.4 That is, the government suggests even if the statute is5 not jurisdictional, whether there's equitable tolling is6 a separate question.7 The ­­ the government's argument relies8 primarily on the fact that a number of other statutes9 had statutory tolling provisions. They are labeled10 exclusions in the case of Section 2416. And the11 government argues that if there are ­­ there's some sort12 of statutory exclusion, or sometimes it's called tolling13 in this Court's decisions, that would mean Congress14 didn't want equitable tolling.15 Now, that issue has been litigated before16 this Court several times. It was litigated in Young v.17 United States where the taxpayer made the same argument18 that since there was a statutory exclusion or tolling19 provision, there couldn't be equitable tolling. This20 Court rejected it there, and the Court's opinion said21 that the ­­ the statutory provisions and equitable22 tolling supplemented one another. The Court rejected it23 as well in Holland v. Florida.24 Now, there's an historical reason for all25 that. Tolling provisions or exclusions in statutes haveAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial47￼1 always coexisted with equitable tolling, going back2 hundreds of years. The original English Statute of3 Limitations Act of 1623 had five exclusions in it. In fact,4 4 of the 5 exclusions in the Tucker Act came from that.5 And yet despite the fact that English statutes of6 limitations always had exclusions and they're carried7 over in colonial and ­­ and American State legislation,8 there has also been equitable tolling. The two things9 coexist and supplement one another.10 And often, although not inherently, the11 statutory provisions operate differently than equitable12 tolling. Equitable tolling is an individualized, a13 somewhat discretionary choice, and it requires a showing14 of hardship applicable to the individual. The statutory15 exclusions do not. The statutory exclusions are there16 whether the ­­ the plaintiff had a compelling problem or17 not.18 So, for example, in the Tucker Act and19 indeed in the original English statute of limitations,20 there is a carveout for people who are beyond the seas,21 and the statute of limitations doesn't begin to run as22 to them until they come back. That exists even if23 they're just across the channel in Calais and have a24 full­time agent in London to manage their affairs.25 There's not a requirement of ­­ of hardship.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial48￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      So the government's argument, I think,misapprehends the fact ­­ the history of all of this andthe fact that these two provisions have alwayscoexisted.  And the government's legislative historyargument is ­­ largely fails on the same ground.  WhatCongress did not adopt in the years prior to the FederalTorts Claim Act were ­­ were tolling ­­ statutorytollings.  They ­­ and I think you could make a fairlygood argument that Congress decided not to havestatutory tolling rules, but they have always beenseparate from equitable tolling rules.The government, in its argument in Younger, made this point really well. I think it's about ­­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any Federalstatutes that permit equitable tolling ­­MR. SCHNAPPER: Equitable tolling, yes, yes. JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ and how are theyworded?

SCHNAPPER: ­­ that discretion. And the ­­ the legislative proposals that the court ­­ that the government refers to for a carveout may reflect, I think it fairly does reflect a decision by Congress not to have a statutory carveout, that doesn't mean Congress was intending to bar equitable tolling. They're ­­ they've always been different and separate. And asthe Court said in Young, they supplement one another.If the Court has no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez, you have four minutesremaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial50￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Martinez, I hate to cutinto your time, but it's important to me to understandwhy you think that if we rule for you, we will not besaying that every statute which allows suit against theFederal government and which uses the words "shall beforever barred" will not have to come out this way.What distinguishes this case from all those others?MR. MARTINEZ: I think in this case it's not just that phrase, it's the broader phrase that was lifted verbatim from the Tucker Act. And to my knowledge, there's no other statute that's been citedin ­­ in their brief, there's no other statute that I'm aware of that's currently in effect that ­­ that borrows that same language from the Tucker Act.      And I think what's ­­ what this Court couldalso do ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, which language are you talking about?MR. MARTINEZ: I'm talking about the phrase, "Every claim against the United States cognizable shall be forever barred unless." So I think you couldlimit ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, "shall be forever barred" seems, to me, to be the most important part ofAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial51￼1 that language.2 MR. MARTINEZ: I think that is the most3 important part. But I think that it's the incorporation4 of the entire phrase that can give the Court confidence5 that what Congress was doing here was directly lifting6 something from the Tucker Act.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 2401 just says, "A tort8 claim against the United States." I don't know how else9 you would say it, where else you would borrow it from if10 what you're interested in is making sure that the U.S.11 is responsible, that you're effectuating a waiver of12 sovereign immunity.13 MR. MARTINEZ: Justice Sotomayor, I think14 the language that I'm referring to is the one that was15 in the original 1946 FTCA, which tracked verbatim the16 language from the Tucker Act. And so I think ­­ I think17 that this Court can issue a narrow opinion that's18 focused on the FTCA that emphasizes that that was ­­19 that language was ­­ was lifted verbatim, it was20 essentially cut and pasted from the Tucker Act, and it21 was intended to ­­ to bring along with it ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Has the Tucker Act been23 amended? To take that language out?24 MR. MARTINEZ: The Tucker Act provision has25 been amended slightly. It appears in 2501. And whatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial52￼1 this Court said in John R. Sand & Gravel was that the2 minor changes that had been made to ­­ to the Tucker Act3 language were essentially insignificant.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is there anything else you5 would say to Justice Scalia is it's just "shall be6 forever barred" plus a few more words? Anything else?7 MR. MARTINEZ: Justice Kagan, I think it's8 the same points that I made in response to your question9 earlier. I think there are a bunch of other features of10 this particular statute of limitations; the fact that11 the Court had addressed it in Soriano, the fact that12 the Court addressed it, although perhaps in dicta, in13 Kontrick; the private laws that had expressly addressed14 this particular statute; the fact that it was reenacted15 in 1966 against a consistent backdrop of incorporation.16 ­­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as Kontrick is18 concerned, that line of cases I thought came out with19 Bowles, Bowles v. Russell, and John R. Sand that we're20 not going to undeclare something jurisdictional that we,21 the Court, but when it's ­­ we're dealing with a statute22 that this Court has never said that about, then we don't23 carry over that ancient regime.24 MR. MARTINEZ: Justice Ginsburg, I think in25 ­­ in footnote 8 of the Kontrick opinion, this CourtAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial531 referred to 2401(b) and it said that it confined review2 of district courts and was of a similar order to 283 U.S.C. 2107, which was the provision that was later at4 issue in Bowles. And in Bowles this Court referred to5 footnote 8 of Kontrick and used that footnote which6 referred to 2107 and to the time bar of the FTCA and it7 used that footnote as a reason to conclude that 2107 was8 jurisdictional. And we think the same conclusion￼9 follows here. I think the key10 JUSTICE GINSBURG:11 look at Kontrick.12 MR. MARTINEZ:13 Justice Ginsburg.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG:15 dissent.16 MR. MARTINEZ:17 Justice Ginsburg. But I think the Court's opinion in18 Bowles expressly addressed the meaning of that Kontrick19 footnote.20 I, think, stepping back a little bit from21 the weeds here that we've been discussing, my colleague22 and I have been getting into the details of the23 legislative history, I think the big picture here is24 that Congress, from the 1920s through the 1980s,25 repeatedly engaged with the issue of equitable tollingAlderson Reporting CompanyAndpoint about this ­­I better take anotherBowles, with respect,In Bowles I was inI ­­ I seem to remember that,Official54￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and at every turn it signaled its intent not to allowequitable tolling.We ask for reversal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
