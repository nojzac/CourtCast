COLE               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. COLE:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          Prisoners typically want two things:  first, toimprove their conditions while in prison; and second, toget out of prison as quickly as possible.  Respondents'claims here are not conditions claims.  They do not seek alarger cell or better food while in prison.  Rather, theirclaims are about getting out of prison.          Traditional understandings of habeas wouldsuggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not insection 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirmsthat this common sense answer is also the correct answer.In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of whichindependently prevent respondents from using section 1983to pursue their claims here.          First, Heck establishes that civil actions undersection 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack Statecriminal judgments.  Before a prisoner can advance a claim31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the2 invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it3 has been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok4 confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions5 regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal6 judgments for this purpose.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it isn't just duration of8 -- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had9 was a determination that the confinement would be10 definitely less as a result of the -- the good time11 scheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that12 what you were attacking would imply that the sentence13 itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on.14 We don't have that here. What we have here is a15 scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more16 definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going17 to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified,18 it's not simply a Balisok situation.19 MR. COLE: It's arguably different than the20 good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor21 notes. However, I -- I would suggest that even with22 respect to good-time credits, often under many State23 systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving24 up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially --25 and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but that had --3 MR. COLE: -- of the sentence.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that had nothing to do with5 the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that6 correct?7 MR. COLE: Your Honor, the -- the Court --8 that's -- that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd --9 I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court,10 though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence;11 that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim12 threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement,13 then that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be14 brought in 1983.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question. But the16 durational consequence in those cases was a definite17 consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the18 first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in19 the second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear20 consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will21 simply be a period of time before a sentence already22 imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it23 will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's24 different.25 MR. COLE: I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 of them are going to have definite durational consequences2 for confinement.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question about that.4 At -- at the level of whether there is a durational5 consequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you6 that.7 MR. COLE: And, Your Honor, as far back as8 Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration9 go to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The duration of -- of the11 sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that12 this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence13 itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole14 would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't15 -- the determination of parole eligibility or parole16 suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in17 any way, shape, or manner. Does it?18 MR. COLE: Well, a decision from a Federal court19 -- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your20 Honor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say21 that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the22 Federal court decision that would follow from the claims23 that -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the24 prisoners here are advancing.25 The State of Ohio has made individualized61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decisions with respect to each of these respondents thatthey should not again be considered for release fromprison until 2005.  The request -- the relief that they'rerequesting and the claims that they're bringing, ifsuccessful, would result in the Federal court underminingthat State decision with regard to the length that theyshould be incarcerated.  It goes directly to the -- the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't -- it doesn'tshorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated.There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they winthis action, they will be incarcerated for a lesserperiod, is there?          MR. COLE:  Absolutely no certainty of that, YourHonor.  But there is certainty --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and there was in theother cases, wasn't there?  In Balisok.          MR. COLE:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think so.I mean, prisoners could be released in the State ofWashington before the terminus of their sentence.  Theymight not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all theway till the end, less whatever good-time credits theyhad.  They could easily be --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but --          MR. COLE:  -- released prior to that time.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, indeed, but the -- but --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be --be released earlier.  They might have been released evenearlier still, but their entitlement to be releasedearlier was a consequence, wasn't it?          MR. COLE:  It was, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there is no entitlement tobe released earlier as a consequence of this.          MR. COLE:  We --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You just get another hearingand maybe you will, maybe you won't.          MR. COLE:  That's correct.  You'll -- you'lljust get another hearing.  But an important note on that:you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearingsooner than the State has decided that you should get ahearing.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's true.  So it makesit possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- butthere's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucialquestion for me, I think, is whether -- whether this couldhave been brought as a habeas action.  Could this havebeen brought as a habeas action?          MR. COLE:  Yes, Your Honor, it could have beenbrought as a habeas action.  If you look at the nature oftheir complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody.Habeas would require custody and violation of the81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Constitution of the United States.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're just asking for a3 new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release.4 What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas5 action which does not seek an earlier release but just --6 just a hearing?7 MR. COLE: I think probably the Garlotte case,8 Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge9 where the only result was going to be to advance the date10 of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. But it -- No, go on.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it doesn't advance the13 date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the14 parole board will take another look. The only eligibility15 is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and16 not an eligibility for release.17 MR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor, but these --18 under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility19 means the first possible release date. But these20 prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of21 it's not going to happen for them unless and until the22 next release hearing.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they are subject to24 another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for25 release. And I think that's the point that we're getting91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 -- let me2 question.3 4-- let me ask a -- a sort of complementaryIs there any reason that these --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this with an I or an E?MR. COLE:  I was hoping for an I, yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  With an I or an E?JUSTICE SOUTER:  With an E.  With an E.  But iftake my questioning as a compliment with an I,5 6 78 -- if you9 that's perfectly okay too.10 (Laughter.)11 MR. COLE: I'll -- I'll wait and see what the12 question is --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's see what it is.14 The -- the question is, could these claims not15 have been brought in advance of any application to these16 particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were17 -- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then18 they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas19 would -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is20 -- am I correct on those two points?21 MR. COLE: The State concedes that if they had22 brought this case before a parole hearing at which the23 guidelines were applied, that it would be a different24 case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that25 situation.101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Here's -- here's the difficulty2 that I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought,3 well, he must be right because this is really about4 custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out5 eventually.6 But then when I -- I -- when I went back to7 Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem8 is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you9 want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's10 going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas?11 Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's12 clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if13 he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth14 Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't15 got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go16 to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it17 was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's18 why that language is there. Now, I got that far.19 Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should20 have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But21 there's no reason not to have a different rule when you22 have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could23 follow your rule.24 But the next thing I come across is a statement25 that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or2 declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we3 write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this4 trouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want5 to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the6 questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it7 really, et cetera.8 Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well,9 I'm going to have to change something for you to win.10 Either I have to change the thing that says the damages11 should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change12 something else somewhere along the line, the word13 necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary.14 Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really?15 Because all that's important here is people know which way16 they should go.17 Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking18 give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from19 Balisok. Why not?20 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, there would be some21 real consequences that would follow from that.22 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought.23 MR. COLE: The reason that it's important that24 these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of25 the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 with habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are2 often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law3 issues, and the State law is often going to provide much4 more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that5 the prisoners advance.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the Prison Litigation7 Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?8 MR. COLE: Yes, but as Your Honor is aware,9 that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this10 Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially11 lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by12 habeas.13 Moreover, it's telling --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- may -- may I just follow15 up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot16 these State law policies perfectly well be taken into17 consideration? In other words, your argument was these18 things are bound up with State law issues and the best19 place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum.20 They can be resolved in a State administrative forum,21 can't they?22 MR. COLE: They could, Your Honor, but I -- I23 think the types of legal determinations with respect to24 legal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a25 State court would also consider Federal claims that might131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court2 claim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by3 State courts. They have the expertise to make the -- the4 determination. And in fact, in Ohio --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't one say the6 same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a7 1983 action? The States know better about how their8 prisons are operating and what changes would have to be9 made. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that10 the State knows more about how its parole system operates,11 but so does it know more about how its prison system12 operates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines13 whether you have 1983 or habeas.14 MR. COLE: Well, but Congress, with respect to15 conditions claims -- and if you look at the language of16 the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at17 42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought18 with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without19 administrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking20 about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring21 administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really22 about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about -- it23 never has 2425 people --been about -- release.Habeas has traditionally been the relief thator the cause of action that people bring when141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 what they're interested in is relief -- or release from2 prison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are3 release-driven claims. They may not ultimately be4 successful in securing release, but the prisoners here --5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, I've got that part.6 But the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But7 that -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the8 here I think because of the -- what we've written.9 The -- I mean, where I'm coming out now,humpwhat10 you've just said, is well, you know, there's going11 exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we12 say that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think13 probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison14 conditions would then cover it, and then there would be15 exhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make16 difference there.17 And now I'm back to asking the other half of18 this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your19 point, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your20 recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word21 necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do?22 Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the23 injunctive/declaratory relief cases?24 MR. COLE: I don't think you need to do either,25 Your Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto be￼1 language there that talks about necessarily implying the2 invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something --3 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well.4 MR. COLE: -- respondents concede in their5 brief, the only question then is does a parole decision6 count as a, quote, criminal --7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. No, but then what8 you're doing is taking the first half because what you're9 reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever10 those words were in Balisok that we were just talking11 about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if12 your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case13 where a person wants to bring a damage action because of14 illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I15 mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept --16 then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it17 was trying to do.18 MR. COLE: I don't think that's necessarily19 right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence20 at the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily21 imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from22 that trial.23 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is he bringing his damage24 action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did25 at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 me because I went right to prison.2 MR. COLE: Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's3 absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to4 make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that5 would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in6 bringing their claim. It turns on the necessary7 implication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a8 distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in9 Balisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication.10 So we look to the claims here, not why they11 brought them, but what are the claims. And the claims12 here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are13 the ex post facto claims. If the -- if they have success14 on their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe15 their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on16 those claims, there's no way the State's decision can17 stand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they18 would again be considered for parole --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but does that mean the --20 the judgment -- the order denying release on parole is21 invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you --22 we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next23 hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as24 you challenge25 next hearing,1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400the date of the hearing -- the date of thedoes that necessarily imply the invalidity17Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the entire order denying parole?          MR. COLE:  We -- we concede that if there's anex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitledto a new parole hearing.  And I guess the --parole.JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they're not entitled toMR. COLE:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  Absolutely.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that it doesn't totallyinvalidate the order that is at issue.          MR. COLE:  Well, the way that -- that I've beenthinking about it is if you put the State parole decisionup on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on thewall, one of them has to come down.  The Federal decisiontrumps the State decision.  It can --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it doesn't entirely comedown.  It just -- half of it comes down.          MR. COLE:  No.  The whole thing comes down, YourHonor.  They're entitled both to an immediate new releasehearing and --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But not for release.          MR. COLE:  -- if they're successful on theirclaims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearingsin the future.  So the decision, the State's --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But -- but isn't itone aspect of your order that's under attack is18true thatthey hadWashington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 refused to grant them parole?2 MR. COLE: Absolutely.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that remains.4 MR. COLE: It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to5 decide that again. That -- that order is void ab initio.6 It's as though it were never entered. They have to make a7 new decision about whether or not this person should --8 should have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the9 State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached10 on that issue.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought the only relief they12 were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.13 MR. COLE: No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I14 believe at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to,15 quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole16 hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and17 administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed18 his crimes. They want an --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But aren't -- aren't those20 claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it,21 he has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the22 hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So23 he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or --24 or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that25 this case now reduces to a clean question about the191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 retroactive application of the new guidelines.2 MR. COLE: Well, it isn't a clean question, Your3 Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges4 infected his first hearing was present at his second5 hearing. If -- if you look at the materials that they6 added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have7 the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 20028 parole decision was predicated on exactly the same9 guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says10 violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause.11 So, in fact, if anything, it's made his12 situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims13 now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his14 previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 200215 hearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review16 that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release17 hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both18 that he should not get parole then and that he should not19 again be considered for parole until 2005.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- maybe I'm wrong21 about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to22 the 2002 hearing.23 MR. COLE: But what Heck makes clear is it24 doesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we25 need to look to is what's the necessary implication of201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 securing success on your claims in Federal court for a2 State decision. Here, the necessary implication, if3 they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going4 to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 19995 decision --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't it simply be that7 prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old8 guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing9 anything that's happened in the past?10 MR. COLE: I think for the same reason that in11 Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective12 order that said -- said something like the method you have13 for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and14 deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that15 method for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you16 have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean,17 necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and18 deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think twice you started20 something and our questions impeded you. But I think you21 were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal22 sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the23 Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State24 criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board25 determination. And -- and I thought that the comparison211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and2 sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination3 -- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.4 MR. COLE: Not exactly on the same plane, Your5 Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said6 that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the7 duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments8 that are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck9 doctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the -- the11 generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect12 to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of13 generality than anything that Balisok decided. In14 Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke15 an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the16 good time would give, and -- and that is a much more17 specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement18 to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect19 to length of confinement.20 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, if this turns on21 whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you22 that it seems good-time credits might be different from an23 entitlement sense than parole.24 But -- but all the way back, in tracing the25 cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue2 that the decision here is going to have dramatic3 consequences for the duration of these prisoners'4 confinement.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we don't know what6 consequence it will have for the duration of his7 confinement. All we know is that it will have a8 consequence in determining the date at which the9 will be taken by the parole board to see whether10 is in a condition to be released. That's all we11 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor,12 they're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as13 this point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they14 can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency15 of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a16 definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they17 receive as a result of that change. So if they're going18 to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're19 going to have to show an impact on the duration of their20 confinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim21 because there's no durational impact on their --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But you're -- you're23 assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are24 going to be successful on this element, that you say25 they've got to satisfy later.231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOnext lookhe thencan tell.but￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. COLE:  Right, but that's the Heck --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And -- and whether they are ornot has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.          MR. COLE:  I -- I disagree, Your Honor, becausein Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happensif they're successful on their claims.  So I'm -- we're --the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they'regoing to be successful on these claims.  We don't agreeit's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they'regoing to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it meansthey're going to have to show, have to demonstrate adurational impact on their sentence.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sure.  It also -- it also meansthat if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if youlose this case, you win the war.(Laughter.)          MR. COLE:  At -- at some level, I think there'san -- an inherent and fundamental tension in theirposition, and -- and the coin could flipped and converselythere's that same tension in ours.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are -- are you sure that that'swhat they have to prove, that -- a durational impact?Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived ofan opportunity to have the sentence shorter?  Wouldn't --wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that theylost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?          MR. COLE:  But, Your Honor, I believe what makesout the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantumof punishment after they've committed their crimes.  Sothey need to show that as an element.          I -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainderof my time for rebuttal, if I could.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You may do so.          Mr. Lewis.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN Q.

Respondent Johnson's section --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell us why -- why isit still live when they -- when they already received asecond hearing?  Or why is not moot?          MR. LEWIS:  Johnson still has remaining claimsfor prospective injunctive relief in this case and, aswell, declaratory relief.  What may be mooted is his claimfor retroactive injunctive relief, inparole hearing.

I don'tunderstand.          MR. LEWIS:  Well, he -- really three differentthings.  He's requesting prospective injunctive relief,fix the due process violations that are going on in Ohioparole proceedings.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is a new -- a new parolehearing.  Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  How could that be fixed?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  How -- how can it befixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?          MR. LEWIS:  Well, he does have a class action.He filed a class action and he's trying to fix theproceeding prospectively.  It doesn't necessarily requirehim to have a new parole hearing.  He's still inconfinement and will very likely have a new parolehearing, a new parole hearing that he wants theproceedings to be different in.  He's not necessarilyasking for a new parole hearing.  He's saying --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't he?  If -- if -- whathe's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I wantyou to do it right in the future.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. LEWIS: Sure. I think that was part of his claim, which might be mooted, but he's also saying in any future --JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It -- it isn't mooted because he still got it done wrong. The second hearing was still wrong.MR. LEWIS: Well, we don't --JUSTICE SCALIA: His claims here -- if his claims here are correct.MR. LEWIS: We don't know that for sure, but part of his claim as well is to say in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed to -- to come into compliance with due process. And I think that's separate and apart from --JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say we don't know whether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?MR. LEWIS: I don't think there's enough in the record to determine that.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so we can assume that that was valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for purposes of this case?MR. LEWIS: I am not willing to assume that.

LEWIS:  We can't yet.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, fine.          MR. LEWIS:  We may intend to.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Then we take it as valid.  Thenwe take it as valid.  That's not a claim you'rechallenging.          But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 hewill have another hearing.          MR. LEWIS:  Actually 2005.          JUSTICE BREYER:  2005?  Okay, 2005 he'll haveanother hearing.          MR. LEWIS:  Absolutely.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And in the year 2005, I wantnot to have the -- what are they called?  The 1998guidelines.  I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied inthe 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good,maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate theConstitution of the United States.          MR.

Now, thatwas -- part of his due process allegations in this casewere that he -- he wasn't even allowed to meaningfullyparticipate in --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And he's saying it violates theConstitution in two respects:  one, they won't listen tome; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.          MR. LEWIS:  That's essentially it.          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's it.  Okay.

This --  JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And what -- what is your --Johnson's mootness argument?  MR. LEWIS:  Well, to the extent in his complainthe was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of thechallenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mootedbecause he has received this 2001 hearing and we justdon't know enough about it to know whether he's going tochallenge it or not.  He'd have to amend his complaint inthe district court.291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could -- is it possible that both Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by -- filing habeas --MR. LEWIS: I don't think so.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- petition?MR. LEWIS: I don't think so. I don't thinkthat Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because theFederal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality ofcustody, the legality of confinement, and that's notanything that he's challenging in this case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they read the wrong file or something, and it was just a challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would that be 1983 or habeas?MR. LEWIS: I think that's a closer call, but I think it --JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why asked you. Why isn't it --(Laughter.)MR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and I -- I think it is still section 1983 if certain things are present. That is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the duration of his sentence by winning his case? And if301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think2 he can proceed in section 1983.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any case in which4 what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a5 habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but6 the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was7 determined?8 MR. LEWIS: I don't --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any -- why -- why10 shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be11 limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always12 -- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?13 MR. LEWIS: Well, I think in the hypothetical14 that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner15 wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence16 is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical17 factor here.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, not necessarily.19 He -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due20 process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might21 -- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't22 prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence23 really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due24 process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out25 earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LEWIS:  Because it's not a challenge to thelegality of the confinement.          JUSTICE BREYER:  My law clerk found two caseswhich we've just looked at briefly.  One is calledWilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery whereshe says that in those two cases people were using habeasto challenge prison conditions even.  Now, so there are --there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she'susually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used tochallenge prison conditions.  So I've thought, well, ifthey can use it, they certainly could use it here.          MR. LEWIS:  Well, and I -- I think point with --with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did notcome into play because the prisoners must have gonethrough and exhausted their State court remedies, and sothere wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring theirclaim in habeas.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  It was a different issue,but it said habeas could be brought.          MR. LEWIS:  Sure.  I think the Court in -- inthat particular case --here?JUSTICE BREYER:  So habeas could be broughtMR. LEWIS:  I don't think so.JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. LEWIS: I don't think there's a remedy in2 habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the3 first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the4 Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are5 you challenging the legality of your custody?6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and they say sure -- sure7 I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to8 be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my9 opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they10 gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be11 released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll12 say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be13 bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a14 shot.15 MR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and -- but he's not16 necessarily challenging the legality of his custody.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that's part18 of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to --19 to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much20 different than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper21 sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong22 guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or23 10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a24 classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison25 for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 classic habeas case?2 MR. LEWIS: Because I think in -- in the first3 hypothetical, Your Honor, that -- that you gave, the4 challenge, if successful, would -- would completely5 invalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to6 redo the -- the sentence.7 And -- and I think that's the critical8 distinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his9 complaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the -- by10 the State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-11 year sentence.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it wouldn't completely13 invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to14 be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a15 question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.16 MR. LEWIS: But in the hypothetical you propose,17 Justice Kennedy, the -- the prisoner was actually -- would18 be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by19 winning the case, he's going to undo the State court20 sentence.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, those cases happen22 to involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case23 doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to24 have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought25 for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it2 would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have3 shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same4 language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is5 properly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some6 language to make it fit.7 MR. LEWIS: Well, I don't -- I don't think it is8 properly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions9 where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I10 think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner11 is already here. He's already exhausted all of his State12 court remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's13 section 1983 or habeas.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we wrote an opinion15 that said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it16 would be right now -- that said in the future your client17 should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly18 awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to.19 But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought20 in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said.21 We're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would22 there be any harm done?23 MR. LEWIS: I -- I think there would be.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what would that harm be?25 MR. LEWIS: I think that by -- by having a rule351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdictionof habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwisecognizable section 1983 claims.enacted aJUSTICE BREYER:  And why would that be bad?JUSTICE SOUTER:  And why --MR.

But I mean, is -- I'masking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer.Would it be bad?          MR. LEWIS:  Absolutely it would.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?          MR. LEWIS:  Because there's a statute thatallows --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, leaving aside --Congress changed the statute.  It says absolutely it'sgoing to be habeas.  Is there any bad consequence in thelaw?          MR. LEWIS:  It's going to give States a licenseto violate civil rights that will otherwise not beprotected under the statute.          JUSTICE BREYER:  We'll catch them in habeas.          MR. LEWIS:  Yes, but the -- the State exhaustion361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 requirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the2 State wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.3 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it comes down to that.4 MR. LEWIS: That's really the critical --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: You said -- you said a moment6 ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to7 expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am8 assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the9 ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State10 does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the11 prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand12 habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an13 immediate 141516release case no matter what.  Is that correct?MR. LEWIS:  That's correct.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. LEWIS:  You would basically end up going todistrict court seeking habeas relief asking forto be changed prospectively.17 a Federal18 processes1920 bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still21 would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get22 out now or get out now unless the State within 30 daysJUSTICE SOUTER:  And that's why they could not23 does something. Is -- is that the nub of it?24 MR.

It2 depends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge3 says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless,4 within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the5 guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute6 works.7 MR. LEWIS: Well, if that's the relief that the8 -- the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a9 habeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in10 this case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at11 all. He's asking for the processes to be changed12 prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking13 for declaratory relief.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what he's asking15 for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be16 entitled to any immediate release.17 MR. LEWIS: That's absolutely correct.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: He would still have a sentence19 of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to20 look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him21 out. Is that --22 MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's absolutely it. He23 cannot -- by winning his case, he's not going to shorten24 his sentence in any way. And that's -- that's a big25 distinction from the Balisok case where there was an381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 automatic 234entitlement to a shorter sentence --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, he might --MR. LEWIS:  -- for Balisok in that case.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- he might shorten the term5 of his confinement.6 MR. LEWIS: Might but not necessarily. And this7 Court made very clear most recently in the Nelson8 decision --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the same10 thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but11 he might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.12 MR. LEWIS: I think a challenge to the sentence13 necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a14 challenge to parole is much different because you're not15 affecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term16 necessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as17 this Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case18 from last term.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the nub of it I guess.20 The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication21 for the validity of the sentence.22 MR. LEWIS: That's absolutely right.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: In fact, it assumes the24 sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if25 he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. LEWIS: That's really all it means. And2 this Court last term in Muhammad in -- in footnote 1 made3 clear that the incarceration that matters for this4 analysis is the -- in the incarceration of the sentence5 from the State court. And I think that's -- that's what6 the Court7 the State8 necessary9needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect oncourt judgment or sentence.  What's theimplications?  Not in this case at all.And really, this case I think has already been10 decided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners11 sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff,12 the prisoners in -- in that case were trying to get their13 good-time credits back. I think this is an easier case14 than the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse15 out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but16 you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the17 processes that are used in connection with depriving18 prisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what19 Johnson is seeking here.20 Your Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention21 was the notion -- Your Honors, the other thing I want to22 mention was the notion that there's no State review of23 these decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly24 provides for State administrative review of even25 challenges to the process. So the -- the State of Ohio401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 could easily set up an appeal process administratively to2 -- to correct that problem.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lewis.4 MR. LEWIS: Thank you.5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Untereiner, is it?6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN E. UNTEREINER7 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT DOTSON8 MR. UNTEREINER: Yes, Justice Stevens.9 Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:10 I'd like to, first of all, go to the point that11 Justice Ginsburg raised about the allegations in Mr.12 Dotson's complaint. This case has -- has become much13 simpler with respect to Dotson because any claim that he14 might have had about this 2000 scheduling decision has15 been mooted.16 What's really left are claims for future17 injunctive relief, for prospective relief. These are18 classic 1983 type cases. Prisoners have been bringing19 lawsuits since Wolff against McDonnell alleging that20 parole procedures and other kinds of procedures,21 disciplinary procedures ought to be reformed and seeking22 future injunctive relief with respect to those kinds of --23 of procedures.24 In Edwards against Balisok, this Court indicated25 that ordinarily claims for prospective injunctive relief411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 will not be barred by the Heck doctrine because ordinarily2 they will not call into question or necessarily imply the3 invalidity of any previous decision. So to Justice4 Breyer's question, this would require a change in the law,5 and it would, I think, fairly substantially cut back on6 the kinds of suits that have been brought for 30 years7 under Wolff because in all kinds of suits like this, the8 State would argue, as the petitioners are arguing today,9 that there's some prior administrative decision that's10 called into question by a future claim for injunctive11 relief with respect to some aspect of the procedures12 relating to good-time credit revocation or parole or the13 revocation of probation. So I think this would be a14 fairly substantial change in the law. A lot of these15 claims would be barred by Heck.16 The -- Justice Scalia, you asked a question17 about the habeas, the scope of habeas relief. And I think18 it's important to understand that the lower courts have19 generally held that habeas is not available for these20 kinds of claims that are prospective only, seeking changes21 in future procedures. There are some lower court cases22 that say that where a prisoner seeks release on parole and23 demands a right or claims a right to release on parole,24 that might be cognizable in habeas, but the vast weight of25 authority in the lower courts is that claims that only421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 seek an -- the right to a new parole hearing, the outcome2 of which is completely discretionary --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want a 1983 hearing in4 which a United States district judge tells the parole5 commission, now, here are your marching orders for future6 cases. You have to comply with this rule, that rule, this7 rule. What is an analog that you can give us where United8 States courts have done this under 1983? Using an9 administrative case, if the -- if the agency does it the10 wrong way, we reverse that decision. It would be like a11 review of a conviction that's not final. Have we had12 cases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now,13 these agencies are doing it the wrong way? You have to --14 can you give me an analog?15 MR. UNTEREINER: I think there -- there are a16 fair number of cases in the lower court where -- lower17 courts where these types of claims for injunctive relief18 have been brought and the Federal courts have ordered, on19 a prospective basis, that the States conform to all kinds20 of -- I mean, Wolff is a case like that I think where the21 -- the State was required to do certain things in the22 future. So I think these are ordinary 1983 claims for23 injunctive relief.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any significant25 difference between this case and Wolff? I mean, Wolff was431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 a case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults2 were cured, someone would have a better chance at getting3 good-time credit. Wasn't that what --4 MR. UNTEREINER: Yes.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it seems to me it's very6 -- very close to your situation.7 MR. UNTEREINER: It is very close, Justice8 Ginsburg. Dotson is essentially making two claims for9 prospective relief. He is saying that these 1998 parole10 guidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole.11 At the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole12 after serving 15 years. Under these guidelines, he'll13 have to wait till -- until 32 and a half years have passed14 before he's eligible for parole. And he's claiming that15 in -- in his next parole release hearing, which is in June16 2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old17 rules to him so that he'll be eligible. So this is very18 much like what was at issue in Wolff.19 The second claim he has is that he's entitled to20 annual parole release hearings in the future. Again, it's21 a future -- it's a prospective claim only. In the future,22 he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and23 the new rules say that the State can postpone those24 hearings for up until 10 years.25 So on both of those claims, he is seeking441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 changes in the future, and these are classic 1983 type2 cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 303 years in the lower courts.4 Now, the Heck test requires a showing that if he5 prevails on his section 1983 claims, he would -- that6 would necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying7 conviction or sentence. And I think this case is very8 different from the Balisok case. There -- there was a9 colloquy about that earlier. I think that Balisok is10 clearly distinguishable because the administrative11 decision there would have had an immediate and direct12 impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by -- by13 revoking the good-time credits. Whereas, here, the impact14 is very, very speculative.15 Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a16 durational consequence. The durational consequence here17 is really quite hypothetical and remote. If he prevails18 on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future19 hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in20 Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings.21 He'll also be entitled to -- merely to be considered22 eligible for parole in the future. So I think that the --23 the consequences -- any impact on -- on the duration of24 his confinement is -- is really quite25 and it would require an expansion not451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOhypothetical hereonly of the HeckWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this casein the State's favor.          Unless there are any further questions, we wouldask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimousdecision in favor of Dotson.  All 11 members of that courtfound that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, andthis Court should affirm.left.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, counsel.Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. COLE:  Thank you, Your Honor.          A number of points.  I wanted to start byresponding to Justice Souter's question, which was againasking about this need for entitlement to early releaseas part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider theIn re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seekingto challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky.And the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeaswas the fact that it was having implications for hisparole eligibility in Alabama.  So there, there was notgoing to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release,but simply a difference in the parole considerations.Second, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 questions about mootness, the only point that I would add2 is that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the3 Sixth Circuit decided it as well. So if mootness is the4 direction we're going, I think there need to be a decision5 vacating the judgment below --6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's your position as7 to whether or not it's moot?8 MR. COLE: Your Honor, we don't believe it's9 moot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons. First,10 once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing11 decision, albeit it not the one that was originally12 threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but13 there is a new one where that would have that consequence.14 In terms of bad consequences, I think the single15 biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to16 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of17 the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts.18 The Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years19 ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action20 about the21 and their2223 deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio24 courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have25 brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts haveway parole works in Ohio.  They were successfulcase resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but you raise471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh,2 they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling3 you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.4 MR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor. At the same5 time, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in6 Federal court means that they're not going to be able to7 get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst8 doctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to9 get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are10 offering and that courts in other States are offering.11 The other -- the other point I wanted to make is12 that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his13 understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the14 sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole15 revocations can't be in habeas either. A parole -- parole16 -- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of17 your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial18 term that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're19 not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't20 impact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into21 prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than22 having you serve it on the street. So I think that23 understanding of sentence can't make sense for -- for24 habeas purposes.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think sentence means custody.481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Don't you think it means custody?2 MR. COLE: Well, but to the extent we're3 talking --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The custody you've been5 sentenced to?6 MR. COLE: But to the extent we're talking about7 duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the8 claims here do have a -- success on the claims here would9 have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement.10 This Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably11 the -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to12 particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the13 province of habeas corpus.14 This is a challenge to a particular, the parole15 procedures, that's affecting the duration of their16 confinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and17 that's what success on their claims is going to mean. And18 because of those durational consequences, as well as19 because of the consequences of success on the merits for20 previous State parole decisions, we believe that those21 claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983.22 If there are no further questions.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: I had one further question.24 Are you asking us to change anything in Wolff against25 McDonnell, or can we follow that case?491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. COLE: I think we can follow that case as2 it's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that -- well,3 Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not4 -- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate5 the underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff6 was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to7 the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the8 type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision9 that had already been made.10 Here, by contrast, the claims that they're11 bringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful12 on the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions13 that have 141516gone before.Thank you, Your Honors.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Cole.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the1718 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40050Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
