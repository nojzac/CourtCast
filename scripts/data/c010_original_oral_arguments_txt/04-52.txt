Collins.          General Lockyer.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. LOCKYER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This Court has repeatedly communicated anunderstanding of the appropriate deference owed toState court fact finding in habeas review under 28U.S.C., section 2254.  Here, we don’t have a simplecase of the Ninth Circuit applying the proper standardof deference, but getting the wrong result.  Theproblem is the Ninth Circuit doesn’t get the standard.Althoughoutset --this, but--JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just at the -- at theand I’m -- I’m not sure you’re prepared forthe joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal, right?MR. LOCKYER:  Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the course of theI think we’d be very interested in knowingcolloquy that the trial judge had with theargument,about theattorneys, and if it’s under seal, it’s a little bit31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425awkward to do that.  Is there any reason that it has tobe kept under seal?Kennedy.MR. LOCKYER:  None -- none at all, JusticeI believe we provided the --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I take it --MR. LOCKYER:  -- appendix 2 --the namesgiven numbers.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- I take it thatthe --they’reof the jurors we don’t know becauseMR. LOCKYER:  That’s correct.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So far as you know, thecounsel for the respondent would also have noobjection?          MR. LOCKYER:  Neither of us have anyobjection, and it’s been quoted extensively --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, it was then quotedextensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought.          MR. LOCKYER:  In -- in the briefs as well.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you.          MR. LOCKYER:  Thank you, Mr. Kennedy --Justice Kennedy.          In this instance, the Ninth Circuit professesfealty to AEDPA deference, but it seems simply tooeasy, having sensed a constitutional injury, to becomewilling to attribute error to the State court and to41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 substitute its own factual inferences for those of the2 trial judge.3 The way the Court decides this case can4 provide further instruction to habeas courts to help5 them avoid the Ninth Circuit error. I’d suggest at6 least four instructions that might be considered.7 First, confirming that the objective8 reasonableness test, that inquiry under (d)(2), is like9 that currently under (d)(1). That is, the factual10 inquiry, like that under the legal inquiry, more11 deferential than review for clear error.12 Second, since it seems logical that State13 fact finding should be entitled to equal, if not14 greater, respect than that now accorded State court15 resolution of legal issues under (d)(1), we’ve argued16 for adoption of the Jackson v. Virginia kind of17 standard as consistent with the letter and spirit of18 AEDPA, meaning that witness credibility determinations19 rarely may be overturned, and that all of the evidence20 must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the21 factfinder.22 Third, although Miller-El v. Dretke23 represented an extraordinarily egregious and I24 personally think undeniable violation of Batson, some25 might react to a whiff of a little smoke as a Miller-El51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 fire. Proper resolution of this case can make it clear2 that Miller-El v. Dretke dealt with a outlier and that3 the traditional line of this Court’s habeas cases,4 restricting Federal courts from second-guessing a State5 judge’s credibility calls, retain their vitality.6 Finally and specifically responding to Mr.7 Collins’ argument that this case, it seems, is an8 opportunity to confirm the well-established presumption9 of correctness for State court fact finding under10 section 2254(e)(1), that it remains available in all11 habeas cases. Collins’ view that the traditional12 presumption now applies only in the rare case of13 Federal evidentiary hearings would eviscerate the14 traditional presumption. In my office --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it is -- it is16 a little unusual to have under your view two different17 sections, both addressed to the question of the18 appropriate standard of review in a particular type of19 proceeding. They seem either redundant or overlapping.20 The theory on the other side at least distinguishes21 them and argues that they apply in different22 circumstances.23 MR. LOCKYER: That’s true, Mr. Chief Justice.24 Our view is that the (e)(1) test really focuses on25 specific facts that have been found in State court.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 The (d)(2) focus is on the decision, which presumably2 would be a bundle of multiple facts, the decision of3 the court and whether it was objectively unreasonable.4 And to limit the (e)(1) presumption not only,5 I think, being contrary to congressional intention when6 AEDPA reforms were adopted, and your cases that have7 applied both (e)(1) and (d)(2) as separate, independent8 tests -- in my office, there are 320 attorneys that do9 Federal habeas work, 120,000 hours of lawyering. If10 you take out the capital cases, the non-capital Federal11 habeas claims, only 2 or 3 percent ever go to a Federal12 evidentiary hearing. So the result of reading that13 (e)(1) without the presumption in the cold record case14 means basically the State loses the presumption for15 almost every habeas claim that we look at. So it would16 seem to not be also supported by the statute’s clear17 terms. There’s no limitation written into (e)(1) that18 it -- it’s -- doesn’t apply across the board to all19 habeas claims.20 The --21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the22 contention in the particular proceeding that the23 district court -- or the State fact finder did not, in24 fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit25 of the doubt to the prosecutor?71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. LOCKYER: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think2 that reading the transcript will show that the judge,3 hearing the Batson motion, asking counsel to explain4 the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel5 to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the6 judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating7 both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the8 doubt may refer back to the fact that there’s a dispute9 about the challenged juror and whether she turned10 aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and11 disrespectful way. And the judge says, well, I didn’t12 see that behavior, but I’ll give you the benefit of the13 doubt. But I think the ruling is a general one that14 subsumes both claims, youthfulness and demeanor.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought youthfulness16 --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I noticed the18 defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in19 any way on the -- the demeanor of the -- of witness 16,20 which means either the -- he -- he saw it and said21 nothing or he -- he didn’t see it at all. We don’t22 know.23 MR. LOCKYER: Justice Kennedy, that’s24 correct. There was no comment.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this2 case to give a coherent explanation of why there -- the3 juror was excused? That step has proceeded. We’re at4 that step in Batson where an explanation has to be5 given. What -- what have we said about how coherent6 and complete that explanation has to be?7 MR. LOCKYER: Well --8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here, it seems that the9 prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or -- or10 certainly was not extremely clear.11 MR. LOCKYER: Well, we are in the middle of a12 -- a trial, of course, and it happens quickly and, as13 the Court 1415 quickly.16 hearing.17has suggested, often peremptory --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I’m not so sureThey gave notice that there’d be a BatsonShe should have known what’s going on.MR. LOCKYER:  Yes, sir.  However, it was just18 a short time later in the day, Justice Kennedy. There19 was a break to dismiss the jury and then come back to20 the Batson claim.21 But the peremptories, as the Court has22 frequently said, are intuitive, often inarticulable.23 In this case, I think the --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the point is once25 there’s a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. LOCKYER: Well, I think that happens.2 That is, as soon as the prosecutor is asked to defend3 her challenge, she does, and she talks about4 youthfulness. She says the young person doesn’t have5 ties in the community, doesn’t have a stake in the6 community, is unmarried, perhaps has a greater7 tolerance for drug crime with a small amount. This is8 a three-strikes case. It would be a natural worry, I9 think, for a district attorney to think that a third10 strike, even though one and two were armed robbery and11 rape -- that a third strike that’s a possession of a12 small amount of drugs, you might need to worry about a13 juror’s tolerance or worrying about that severity of14 sentence.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but isn’t -- isn’t16 the difficulty with your analysis there, General, that,17 yes, she started out by -- by talking about18 youthfulness. As I understand it, she started out talking19 about youthfulness and the -- and the demeanor, the20 rolling of the eyes.21 MR. LOCKYER: Yes.22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sort of at the second stage,23 again she spoke of youthfulness. Then at a third24 stage, she said, well, it’s a combination of -- of age,25 gender, and inexperience. Then she realized she was in101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 trouble, and she said, well, I really didn’t mean2 gender because I -- I’d be in constitutional hot water3 there. Then she said, well, I really don’t mean age4 because there are other young people on the jury, and5 I’m -- I’m not challenging them. So that the only6 thing that was left was possibly that element of age7 which refers to ties to the community.8 And at the end of this long colloquy, in9 which she has gone back and forth and back and forth10 and -- and jettisoned some of her reasons, the trial11 judge says, well, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, and I12 guess I’ll give the benefit of the doubt to counsel. I13 don’t know whether the judge is talking about the14 benefit of the doubt on eye-rolling or the benefit of15 the doubt on -- on ties to the community.16 Assuming it’s ties to the community, that has17 nothing to do, I suppose, with -- with the -- the fear18 that a young person is going to be too sympathetic to a19 defendant20 amount of2122 have what23 suggested. We simply have an incoherent colloquy and a24 response to the judge which simply does not tell you25 what the judge is ruling on or the basis for thewho’s up for the third time with a smalldrugs.And at the end of the day, it seems to me weJustice Kennedy’s question in the first place111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 ruling. All we know is that ultimately he’s saying I’m2 rejecting the Batson challenge. That’s the problem3 with -- with deference in this case.4 What -- what is your response to that?5 MR. LOCKYER: Well, thank you, Justice6 Souter. First, I’d point to the language that the7 judge provided, which was in regard to juror 16, the8 only one that is at issue, the court did not observe9 the demeanor. However, 16 was a youthful person, as10 was 6, and then prepared to give the district attorney11 the benefit of the doubt.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the district13 attorney has -- I mean, the -- the point here is we’re14 judging the district attorney’s responses, not the15 judge’s responses.16 MR. LOCKYER: Right.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: What we want to know is what18 the judge found and ruled upon. The district attorney,19 as I understand it, has withdrawn the general claim20 that youthfulness is a problem, and the only claim that21 might have been -- might -- probably was comprehended22 under youth that -- that remains is the claim of no23 community ties. And I find it very difficult to tell24 from the judge’s ruling whether the judge is saying,25 yes, I think there’s a fair showing that there are no121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425community ties and that’s certainly a race-neutralreason.  I don’t know what the judge was -- was --          MR. LOCKYER:  If I may, Justice Souter.  TheDA never withdrew the youthful claim.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, didn’t the DA say,look, youth alone doesn’t -- doesn’t explain my reasonsbecause there are other young people on the jury that-- that we’re not challenging, and -- and I don’t wantto suggest that all young people should bedisqualified?          MR. LOCKYER:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  General, does -- does thejudge have to find what the reason for the strike was,or does the judge have to find what the reason for thestrike wasn’t?          MR. LOCKYER:  The judge has to find that itwas not a racially discriminatory strike.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if there are severalallegations and -- and each of them is somewhatdoubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefitof the -- of the doubt to the -- to the districtattorney, it’s his indication that, as a matter offact, he finds that the reason wasn’t race.          MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Scalia, your direct --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question,131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 General?2 MR. LOCKYER: Yes.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: There are really two kinds4 of Batson problems as I see it. There are some cases5 where the prosecutor is -- just is deliberately keeping6 African Americans off the jury, and there -- there’s no7 question there’s a violation there.8 But I’m wondering if there isn’t another9 category where persons are unconscious of their own10 subconscious bias and not realizing that they11 themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an12 African American might not be a sympathetic juror.13 Would that kind of failure to really identify the14 problem within the prosecutor’s own conception of the15 case -- would that be a Batson violation in your view?16 MR. LOCKYER: Well, probably not, because the17 requirement is that the strike be intentionally done.18 That is, there’s an intentionality. If it’s19 unconscious, as you suggest, Justice Stevens, I -- I20 would think that wouldn’t qualify.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: If, for example, the judge22 saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor23 had hunches about jurors over and over again and they24 just happened25 not justify a1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400to be black most of the time.  That would-- a Batson challenge.14Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LOCKYER:  Well, there might be a patternover time.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But -- but she’s totallyconvinced of the good faith of the prosecutor.  And I’mnot suggesting bad faith.          MR. LOCKYER:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But just realizes thisperson has an unconscious bias that shows up in the --in the pattern of challenges.  Would that be ajustified challenge?          MR. LOCKYER:  You might be able to deduceintent from -- infer it from a variety of challenges.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  You have to accept hishypothetical as he gave it.  Assuming that theattorney, the district attorney, was in good faith.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.          MR. LOCKYER:  In good faith?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Assuming that the --the attorney did not think that he or she was strikingthe juror because of the juror’s race.          MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Stevens and Scalia, Iwould rely on the trial judge to make a determinationof the intention of the district attorney --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if the trial judgedetermined --151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the question is wouldhe --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- based -- based on thehistory of several trials and so forth, that thisprosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect toblack jurors but not others, that would be a sufficientbasis for a challenge.          MR. LOCKYER:  I’d be inclined to say yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is no such --that -- that’s very far from this case, GeneralLockyer.          MR. LOCKYER:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I did -- I did have one --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that gives a lot ofpower to district -- to -- to the district judge,doesn’t it?  I mean, you know, this -- he says this --this U.S. attorney really doesn’t honestly believe thathe’s biased, but I think, being the great psychologistthat I am, that this United States attorney, orwhoever, is -- is really biased and -- and he’s -- I --you really --          MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Scalia --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you really want thesystem to run          MR.that way?LOCKYER:  Well, Justice Scalia, I hope to16Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 brief that one some day, but --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we -- can we go back3 --4 MR. LOCKYER: -- but -- but it’s a good --5 it’s a good question even though I -- I don’t think6 it’s what’s happening in this instance. And I mostly7 would say we rely on the trial judge who’s there --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Except in this very case,9 one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty10 confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith.11 MR. LOCKYER: I -- I believe that’s correct12 from the record.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She was certainly -- she14 was certainly wrong on the law. When she -- when the15 gender question came up, she said, well, that's not a16 suspect category, and she seemed to be -- her notion17 was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an18 equal number of men and women. And it was -- she19 seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age20 too. I agree with you she didn’t withdraw it, but was21 -- the reasonable explanation was we don’t want too22 many young people here. So I’m going to allow some,23 but I want older people to dominate. But the gender --24 she had to be25 gender. That1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400told by the judge Batson applies to-- that seemed -- that seemed strange to17Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 me that -- that 2 years after, she would not know.2 MR. LOCKYER: Justice Ginsburg, I think that3 perhaps an explanation -- and, again, if the trial4 judge thought it was reasonable -- is there some5 compelling reason to read it a different way years6 later on appeal after the California Court of Appeal, a7 Federal magistrate, and a Federal district judge have8 agreed with the trial judge’s perspectives.9 But it could be that she is quoting, as10 you’ll see in the transcript, California law that had11 talked about jury balances. It’s good to have young12 and old. It’s good to have different races.13 I agree. You’re absolutely right. J.E.B. v.14 Alabama had occurred a couple of years before, and the15 judge does say, I don’t see, Ms. Satriano, that you are16 seeking to justify excusing people of one ethnicity17 based on gender. So he seemed to at least be saying,18 you started with youth. Everything you said about19 youth, ties in the community, tolerance for drug use,20 unmarried, which might be distinctions with other young21 people -- those -- do you have anything else to say?22 And I -- I suspect she felt like compelled to come up23 with some further explanation.24 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the -- where25 -- where is the place in what the judge -- when did181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this eye-rolling take place?  I can’t figure it out.          MR. LOCKYER:  Okay.  Yes.  During thejudicial voir dire.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I have that in front ofme.          MR. LOCKYER:  And --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What was the statement thatthe judge made in respect to which the juror issupposed to have rolled her eyes?          MR. LOCKYER:  The district attorney simplysays with one of the questions to which you -- theprospective --it out isone whereJUSTICE BREYER:  Which question?MR. LOCKYER:  It’s unclear.JUSTICE BREYER:  So the reason I can’t findnone of us know.MR. LOCKYER:  No, you’re right.  I mean, it’s-- it doesn’t say in the record eye-rolling.JUSTICE BREYER:  And it actually says itwasn’t a question.  It was a statement, and that’s whyI can’t figure it out.          MR. LOCKYER:  It -- it seems to be where thejuror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then--JUSTICE BREYER: Which was a question you 191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 said --2 MR. LOCKYER: -- turned aside. All we know3 is yes was said. We don’t know what the question was.4 JUSTICE BREYER: I see.5 MR. LOCKYER: The -- a point I guess to be6 made about this confusing transcript -- and of course,7 I don’t know what the file looked like with respect to8 Miller-El, but this is it. Obviously, there’s not a9 lot to go on, and I think it suggests how vital it is10 to rely on the trial court judge to make some11 credibility determination. He’s there and sees the12 district attorney and tries to, after making13 appropriate inquiries, say that he accepts her non-14 racial reasons.15 Counsel for respondent does a lot to compare16 to Miller-El and so perhaps it’s worth just17 distinguishing briefly. There we have 10 of 11 African18 American jurors struck. We have the lawyers doing the19 questioning, trick questions, loaded questions,20 complicated questions. We have the external evidence21 of the Dallas manual recommending discriminatory22 strikes. We have the cards with race written on them.2324 Here, we have a very brief, quick proceeding.25 The judge is asking the questions and really resisting201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 lawyers’ attempts to add to that, to get more2 information so you can make a valid assessment of the3 juror that’s before you. And so in this instance,4 obviously, relying on intuition, trial experience, she5 exercises the two peremptory challenges, one of which6 was withdrawn on appeal and not pursued, the other with7 respect to the young person, the demeanor, and8 youthfulness are the grounds given.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just a -- kind of10 a background question? I noticed the judge pointed out11 after ruling that he was under -- he -- I can’t12 remember if it was a he or a she, but was under an13 obligation to report its reasons for granting Wheeler14 motion to the State bar.15 MR. LOCKYER: Yes.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that -- did that17 requirement apply after the Ninth Circuit decision? Is18 there a requirement that the -- the lawyer be19 investigated for possible discipline?20 MR. LOCKYER: We tried to research it,21 Justice Stevens, and we believe that it was a -- a22 State court rule adopted subsequent to Wheeler. And23 that -- of course, unlike the way in which it is24 characterized in respondent’s briefs, it wasn’t a25 warning to her, the district attorney, that is. It was211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 a general2 obligated34 saying, and therefore I’m going to be careful about5 finding that there’s been a Batson violation. And Istatement.  If there’s a Batson claim, I’mto report.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I read it as6 wonder if7 judges to89 frankly didn’t read it that way. It just seemed to bethat’s consistent with what we want trialdo when they’re hearing Batson challenges.MR. LOCKYEAR:  Justice Kennedy, I10 he was stating the fact, that it would be an obligation11 to report. Clearly, it has some impact on how people12 feel about the judicial system and the particular13 lawyer’s reputation if the judge were to affirm the14 motion. But I -- I would expect the judge was doing15 his job and performing his duties correctly.16 JUSTICE BREYER: If you have a minute, you17 might -- I don’t know if you -- if this is very useful.18 But I’ve taken this point of view that -- that there’s19 no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes20 in cases like this, a perfect example. And therefore,21 the only thing to do, consistent with the Constitution,22 is no peremptories.23 MR. LOCKYER: Well, I know that’s your view,24 Justice Breyer.25 JUSTICE BREYER: You have 30 seconds. You221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 want to say how irresponsible that is, right?23 and allow 45678910 it please 1112 State appellate court decision represented an13 unreasonable determination of facts because the14 prosecutor did not give a single persuasive reason for15 striking juror 16.16 The circuit also rightly held that the --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn’t the rolling18 of the eyes a persuasive reason?1920 the eyes,21 He says,22 ruling, he does not credit that rationale.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what should24 happen if the trial judge doesn’t see it and a counsel,25 who’s observant, said, judge, I’ve got a problem with231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. LOCKYER:  I prefer to keep the traditionthe peremptory challenges.Thank you.  I’ll reserve time, if I may.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.Mr. Drozdowski, we’ll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. DROZDOWSKI     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. DROZDOWSKI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and maythe Court:The Ninth Circuit properly held that theMR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, here the rolling offirst, is uncorroborated by the trial judge.quite frankly, I did not see it.  And in his￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this juror?  I don’t know that the trial judge has to-- has to see it, if he believes the counsel.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  That could be, but here thetrial court’s --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We’ve -- we’ve all been --been in court and -- and noticed that sometimeswitnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys willmake faces and so forth that’s not consistent with --with proper demeanor in a courtroom.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  That’s correct.  But what’ssignificant here is that this was a judge-conductedvoir dire where juror 16 would have been facing thejudge when giving her answer.  So the judge would havebeen in the best position to see the --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you’re --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe the judge is reading. A judge doesn’t watch -- watch the witness 100 percentof the time.  That’s not credible.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  As the Court has previouslymentioned, what we also have here is there’s no --there’s no corroboration in the transcript that juror--          JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is the point?  Thejudge says, I’ll give the prosecution the benefit ofthe doubt.  Well, he -- he knows the prosecutor and he241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 believes the prosecutor. I didn’t see it, but I’ll2 give him the benefit of the doubt. He told me that’s3 what she did. What’s -- I mean, I really don’t see why4 that isn’t, given the present law, sufficient.5 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, here, the trial6 court’s ruling -- he says, I did not see the demeanor7 complained of. However, juror 16 is youthful, as are8 other jurors. I’m prepared to give the district9 attorney the benefit of the doubt. So I think the10 ruling here, if there is, indeed, a finding of no11 discrimination, would be limited to the youth rationale12 clearly by --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?14 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean benefit of the15 doubt just refers to youth. I -- I read that as16 referring to the whole story.17 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well --18 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I -- it’s pretty19 hard to read that as saying, I’ll give him the benefit20 of the doubt in respect to the youth. It sounds as if21 I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to22 the reasons he gave for challenging her. There are two23 other African American jurors on the jury. She is24 useful -- youthful. He -- she saw him -- he saw her25 rolling her eyes when -- what do you think about the251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 drugs or some other relevant question. And he says,2 I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. I mean, I3 don’t see how to read that in a way that -- that comes4 out the way you want it to come out.5 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well -- well, even --6 JUSTICE BREYER: So tell me.7 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Okay. Even if the Court8 concludes that the trial judge did credit the demeanor9 rationale, it’s still a wholly unpersuasive reason to10 give in light of everything else the prosecutor did11 here. The demeanor rationale wasn’t the sole reason12 given. It comes as part of a litany of reasons that13 are all either unconstitutional, the gender rationale,14 or contradicted or unsupported by the record.15 And there was some discussion earlier about16 this. Miller-El makes clear that the district attorney17 must give the real reason for the strike, not just any18 rational basis the prosecutor can think up. And when19 we look at the transcript of the Batson hearing here,20 we see a prosecutor scrambling to think of anything she21 --22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn’t this just23 another way of saying you don’t believe the proffered24 justification? In other words, the -- the trial judge25 made a credibility determination that that was the261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reason, the person rolled her eyes, and you’re saying,2 in light of the other explanations, you think the3 prosecutor is just making that up.4 MR. DROZDOWSKI: I -- I think two things. I5 think, one, the reasonable conclusion is the prosecutor6 is making it up, but even if the Court -- the Court7 doesn’t need to accept that to still come to the8 conclusion and say the demeanor rationale is still not9 the reason for the strike. She can’t say the reason10 here. She comes up with six different reasons, but11 they’re all either --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you’re saying you13 don’t believe it. You think there’s a different14 reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real15 reason. And we have a factual determination that the16 judge believes that that’s the reason or a reason. And17 under the -- the statute, at least that -- that’s --18 that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or,19 under the State’s reason, that’s presumed to be20 correct, and you have to show it by clear and21 convincing evidence.22 MR. DROZDOWSKI: And the Ninth Circuit23 properly found that the conclusion was both24 unreasonable and rebutted by clear and convincing25 evidence, and it’s because none of these reasons, when271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 we look at the totality -- what I’m trying to say is --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the3 on the eye-roll, which I thought also the4 prosecutor said that she turned her head.5 be that she was out of the vision of the -- the judge6 even if he had been looking. I don’t see that you have7 any evidence to rebut it. You said, well, it was8 rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. There was9 no evidence. There was no evidentiary hearing.10 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, we cited a case on11 page 24 in our brief, a Third Circuit case, Riley, that12 says a reviewing court’s suspicion may be raised by a13 series of very weak explanations given for the strike.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there’s no doubt15 that the court -- or at least in my mind, that -- that16 the trial court could have come out the other way. I17 -- I -- you know, all of the things you say are quite18 true. The question is whether the trial court had to19 come out the other way, whether it was just utterly20 unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it21 did. And that -- you know, that’s a -- that’s a heavy22 burden. And -- and it is a messy transcript and all of23 that, but I -- I find it difficult to see how -- how24 you can establish that -- not only that -- that the25 trial court could have come out the other way or,281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO-- on the ---- theSo it may￼1 indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment,2 should have come out the other way. But you have to3 establish that it’s unreasonable not to come out the4 other way. And -- and I find it hard to -- to see how5 you can do that when you have a transcript that relies,6 in part, upon the -- you know, the rolling of the eyes7 and the -- and the trial court says, I’m -- I’m willing8 to give her the benefit of the doubt that that’s the9 reason she did it.10 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, Miller-El emphasizes11 that we need to view the prosecutor’s behavior12 cumulatively. And again, when we look at here the --13 the prosecutor coming out with one reason after another14 to try to justify her strikes, consecutive strikes, of15 the only two black women on this jury, there’s just16 simply no17 rationale1819 another -- another. Wasn’t there another minority20 woman on the -- in the jury panel?credibility left to give to the demeanoreven if one views that it’s --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought there was21 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Juror 20 Collins explains --22 Mr. -- trial counsel -- defense counsel, explained at23 the hearing was a person of color but not African24 American. So the record shows, I believe, we have one25 African American on the jury and one other minority.291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now, number 19 was2 excused and was a black person.3 MR. DROZDOWSKI: That’s correct.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and a woman. And if5 that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you6 might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people,7 which could have overcome the demeanor testimony --8 demeanor claim.9 But I -- I think on this record that we have10 to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing11 juror 19 merely because respondent’s counsel here --12 you did not pursue that. I -- I read the record as --13 as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned,14 there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror.15 At least respondent’s counsel -- you have not said that16 there wasn’t.17 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, on the State appeal,18 it’s true that Collins’ attorney dropped the claim19 specifically as to juror 19. But the reason the20 prosecutor’s strike of juror 19 is relevant is at step21 three of Batson, this Court has emphasized that the22 duty of the trial judge to determine purposeful23 discrimination requires an examination of all the24 relevant circumstances.25 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is the remedy -- the301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 remedy if we say and hold with you that prosecutors2 can’t give reasons like they gave here? How is a --3 what’s a prosecutor supposed to do? I mean, the4 prosecutor might be moved by stereotype. Young African5 American women -- of course, she tolerates drugs.6 Well, not quite of course. Well -- well -- well, she7 rolled her eyes. Well, at least she looked in this8 direction. Well, I sort of -- maybe I’m seeing eye-9 rolling here. I mean, we all understand that. But10 that’s why I guess I am where I am. I -- I don’t see11 what the -- I don’t see what we’re telling prosecutors12 if we hold in your favor, and I don’t see how we deal13 with the problem if we hold against you.14 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I -- I think -- I15 think the record here reinforces Your Honor’s view on16 --17 JUSTICE BREYER: But I’m asking for your18 experience. You have a lot of experience as a defense19 lawyer. How is this thing supposed to work?20 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I -- I think if -- if21 the Court allows to happen what -- what happened here,22 then I think the message it could be saying to23 prosecutors, is as long as you can just rifle off a24 series of -- of reasons for your strike and then the25 trial court latches onto one of them, taking it out of311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the context of the plausibility of all the other2 strikes, then we’re going to allow this type of behavior3 to continue.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: This prosecutor presumably5 appears before this judge on other occasions, and --6 and don’t you think we -- we can give some weight to7 the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees8 what she’s saying, and -- and can judge better than we9 can whether she’s making this up or just -- just is --10 is somewhat confused, especially since, as -- as I11 think the General pointed out, we’re dealing with a12 kind of determination that is usually instinctive on13 the part of trial counsel. There’s just something14 about this, you know, and you move to strike. I’m not15 sure it springs into your mind, at the time you -- you16 move to strike, the precise reason. Then somebody asks17 you later, why was it? Why was it? There was just18 something about that person I didn’t like. I know it19 wasn’t the race. That had nothing to do with it. Now,20 what was it? And then -- then you have to recreate a21 -- a rational process that, in fact, never occurred.22 It was an instinctive process more than a rational one.23 So I’m -- I’m not particularly upset by -- by24 seeing counsel flounder about in -- in trying to come25 up with what the right reason was. I think it’s321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425probably pretty hard to figure out.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  First of all, there’snothing in the record to indicate that this prosecutorhad appeared many times before this trial judge.          Another point is --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, she might in thefuture, if she’s got a job as a prosecutor in thiscourt.  So she’s certainly going to be concerned withher reputation, her integrity before the court.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  That’s right, but I guesswhat I’m trying to say is it’s not that the judge said,you know, Ms. Prosecutor, you’ve appeared before memany times and I’m willing to give you the benefit ofthe doubt because I know the way you are.  We havenothing like that here.          Also, as far as it being instinctive, Batsonand Miller-El require the prosecutor to give thereasons and stand and fall on the plausibility of thosereasons.  And -- and here --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I’m saying that it’s hard.That’s all.  And -- and that you can understand whysomebody would flop around because, at the time thestrike is made, I’m -- I’m not sure it’s always anentirely rational rather than instinctive action.MR. DROZDOWSKI: I understand, but what’s 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 significant here is when she is flopping around, the2 reason she comes up with -- she says gender. It’s3 patently unconstitutional and discriminatory. We have4 youth, and then she says, well, it’s not that they’re5 younger. Other young people on the jury. It’s not6 that I don’t want young people. And she doesn’t strike7 juror 15.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me -- let me9 ask you as a -- as a response to -- to the kind of the10 incoherent flopping around argument, let me ask you11 what your12 different1314 until that final paragraph or so in which the judge15 rules. And instead of doing what he did in this case,16 the judge says the following two things. He says,position would be if the record werein the following respect.Let’s assume the record is just what it is up17 number one, I didn’t see the eye-rolling, but I accept18 counsel’s representation of fact that the eye-rolling19 went on and I certainly understand the -- the20 significance of that. So I’m going to take that as a21 fact.22 Number two, even though counsel has withdrawn23 the -- the sort of the general claim of youth and so24 on, I understand counsel still to be saying this is a25 person without any manifest ties to the community and341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- and that suggests a certain looseness ofresponsibility.          And based upon the eye-rolling and based uponthe lack of ties to the community, I think counsel hada race-neutral basis for the -- for the strike that wasmade, and for that reason, I’m going to overrule theBatson challenge with respect to number 16.          What would your position be?          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, that -- that would bea -- a tougher case for us because we would have anexplicit ruling --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  -- of what actuallyhappened.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What would your position be?          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I still think that in thiscase, given the entire context and all the otherreasons given, including the gender reason, that itwould still -- that those demeanor and youth reasonswould still not be persuasive looking at the context --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you would say that thosetwo conclusions on the part of the court wereunreasonable?          MR.given all theDROZDOWSKI:  On -- on this record, yes,other reasons we have given by the35Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 prosecutor.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you would3 you’ve established that by clear and convincing4 evidence?5 MR. DROZDOWSKI: I would because when6 through the comparative juror analysis and look7 record of the whole, we see that the reasons given, for8 example, on youth are not used for similarly situated9 white jurors.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but number 6 was a11 young white -- young white male, I believe, and he was12 excused on the ground of youth. So it’s consistent.13 MR. DROZDOWSKI: 6 was different in that he14 was unemployed, in fact, had never been employed, and15 also he had an uncle who was a recovered alcoholic, and16 that made him quite different from juror 16.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What’s wrong with the18 explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she19 didn’t want to across-the-board strike young people,20 but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had21 dominantly older people. So that wouldn’t mean that22 she’s withdrawing youth. It’s just that she’s saying23 it isn’t an absolute with me.24 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I think she’s also25 admitting that youth wasn’t a reason because she’s361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOsaywe go at the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425saying there are other young people on the jury, andthe significant question here --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what’s -- one -- onepoint could be I don’t want too many young people, soI’m going to exercise some peremptories to make surethat the jury is dominantly older people.  What’s wrongwith that?          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  What’s wrong with that hereis the question is why is she using that rationaleagainst the young black juror and not the -- the youngwhite jurors on the panel?  How come she’s seeking toachieve the balance by striking juror 16?          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, she did.  Number 6was white.  Right?          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And youth was a factorthere.  There may have been other factors, but youthwas certainly a factor in that case.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And this one rolled hereyes.          MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Right, but when we look atthe totality of the reasons, which include looking atthe way she treated juror 19, we have the lack of tiesin the community --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Juror 19 -- you just 371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 said earlier the fact that the one juror’s uncle had an2 alcohol problem was -- was a legitimate factor. Juror3 19’s daughter had a -- a cocaine problem and this was a4 cocaine case. Isn’t that a perfectly legitimate reason5 for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror?6 MR. DROZDOWSKI: The significance of the7 treatment of juror 19 is, right out of the box, the8 prosecutor is coming up with reasons that she says9 apply to both 16 and 19, the only two black women on10 the jury. And these are very disparate women, and11 they’re different in age and occupation status, the12 number of children they have, and people they -- who13 are close to them who have substance abuse problems.14 And right out of the box, the prosecutor is saying that15 both of them are disqualified from jury service because16 they’re both young, when juror 19, in fact, was a17 retired grandmother.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that was so19 obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in20 her dissent. Defense counsel too confused -- was21 confused on the numbers. Obviously, it -- the -- the22 prosecutor wasn’t trying to say a grandmother is going23 to be excused24 young.-- is going to be struck because she’sDROZDOWSKI: I respectfully disagree that 38Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO25MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 it was a mistake. Her answer -- her response that2 juror 16 and 19 are both young came immediately in3 response to the court’s request that the prosecutor4 justify her peremptory strikes of judge 16 -- jurors 165 and 19.6 And then later on, when the judge said that7 gender was not going to cut it, the prosecutor said,8 well, it’s not really gender. She backtracked to9 youth, and she said what is important, their youth is10 important. And she could only have been referring to11 16 and 19 at that point because there was no claim that12 juror 6 was being excluded because of his gender.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say the same14 thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and15 19 on page 9? The bottom of page 9, it seems to me Ms.16 -- Ms. Nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16. They’re17 talking about 16 and 6, and then Ms. Nachman ends by18 talking about juror 19. That seems to me clearly to19 mean number 16.20 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Well, I’m -- I -- I don’t21 think so because on the next page she continues22 discussing juror 19 at the top of page 10.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I don’t think24 it’s a necessary reading.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I’m -- what --391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 what is the inference you try to draw from the2 treatment of juror 19? That the prosecutor wants to --3 was striking people on the basis of their race or that4 she had better reasons for 19 than 16?5 MR. DROZDOWSKI: No, no. The conclusion is6 that she was striking jurors on the basis of the race,7 that she is using --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then what do you9 do with the fact that juror 19’s daughter had a cocaine10 problem and this was a cocaine case? That doesn’t seem11 to be -- that’s not a race-based reason. That’s seems12 to me to be a good reason.13 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Right. We’re not14 challenging the strike of 19 per se. What we’re saying15 is that the prosecutor’s reasons she gave for 19 are16 important in trying to determine whether she is17 intentionally discriminating in striking juror 16. And18 the fact that she is lumping the two jurors together,19 not treating them as individuals, but treating them, in20 fact, stereotypically by saying that all -- that three21 of these reasons apply to both of them, when the record22 clearly shows that they don’t apply to juror 19, it23 shows -- it shows the discriminatory behavior.24 The -- the Attorney General said that this25 case is unlike Miller-El, but I’d just like to401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 emphasize certainly here we have a petitioner who was2 representing himself pro se and he did not present3 extra-record evidence of a -- of a history of4 discrimination.56 Miller-El7 relief in89 given here for the strikes pertain just as well to non-But the case-specific evidence is similar toin important respects, and Miller-El requiresthis case.First -- first of all, three of the reasons10 black jurors as to the black jurors, and that’s youth,11 tolerance, and single.12 Here, as in Miller-El, we have the district13 attorney scrambling from rationale to rationale and,14 when called on, one of the reasons shifting to another.15 And here, the district attorney did not ask16 questions on grounds later used to justify the strike.17 Now, clearly here, it’s a judge-conducted voir dire,18 but the attorneys were allowed to ask the judge to ask19 different questions -- to ask that the judge ask20 additional questions. And here, at the conclusion of21 the voir dire of jurors 1 through 17, the -- the22 prosecutor asked the judge to ask four additional23 questions. Three of them were to the panel generally24 and one specifically about juror 8. But the prosecutor25 never asked that any additional questions be asked of411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 juror 16 before she struck her.2 If I could turn briefly to the State’s3 Jackson v. Virginia argument, unless there’s any4 additional questions on the Batson claim. The State’s5 claim that (d)(2) and (e)(1) incorporate the Jackson6 sufficiency of the evidence test is contrary to the7 plain terms of (d)(2) and (e)(1) and this Court’s cases8 construing those provisions. And the State still9 hasn’t cited a single case prescribing a Jackson type10 of review, and courts have been construing AEDPA for11 over 9 years now. That should be the end of the line12 for the State’s argument.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with14 the argument that your reading of the two sections15 means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small16 number of17 trying to1819 -- the structure and text of the statute and -- and the20 fact that the clear and convincing requirement is tied21 to the presumption of correctness.cases, and it’s obvious that Congress wastighten the habeas review procedures?MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Our argument is based on the22 I’d like to emphasize that the Ninth Circuit23 in this case did apply both (d)(2) and (e)(1), as this24 Court did in Miller-El, and found that Collins has25 satisfied both standards. So I just want to emphasize421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 for the Court, even if it does not agree with us on our2 construction of (e)(1), that relief is still3 appropriate in this case.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in a sense, the5 standards perhaps ought to be reversed. When you hear6 the evidence, which is what you do under (e)(1), that7 is when you’ve determined -- should determine whether8 it’s unreasonable. You should presume that it’s9 correct before you decide whether you’re going to hear.10 So you could argue that they should be --11 MR. DROZDOWSKI: Right. I -- I think our12 argument is based on the fact that we have the13 presumption of correctness as part of (e), which is the14 fact development procedure in Federal court.15 The State’s Jackson argument, I’d just like16 to highlight, is irreconcilable with what this Court17 said in Miller-El I, and what it did in Miller-El II.18 In Miller-El I, this Court stated that Federal courts19 can disagree with State court credibility20 determinations and, when guided by AEDPA, determine21 that the conclusion is unreasonable or its factual22 premise rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.23 In Miller-El II, this Court disagreed with24 the State court credibility determination and granted25 habeas relief even though the significance of some of431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the habeas petitioner’s evidence was open to judgment2 calls.3 By contrast, this Court stated in Schlup v.4 Delo, that the assessment of credibility is generally5 beyond the scope of review in Jackson.67 the Court8 rejecting9 stringent10 testimony11 impossible.12 This Court couldn’t have granted relief in13 Miller-El if it construed (d)(2) or (e)(1) as14 containing the Jackson test, and the State’s approach15 would effectively bar habeas relief whenever a habeas16 petitioner challenged a credibility determination.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that (d)(2) or18 (e)(1) is the -- is the stricter requirement? I’m19 really not sure which of the two. Don’t you think it20 -- it might be possible to show, by clear and21 convincing evidence, that the State court decision was22 -- factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do23 not show that it was unreasonable? In other words, it24 may well be that (d)(2) is -- is the more severe one.25 MR.

Ohio, this Court said that the Fourteenthmandate, that racial discrimination be10 In Powers11 Amendment12 eliminated from all acts and proceedings of the State,13 is most compelling in the judicial system.14 Here, the district attorney struck two of15 three African American jurors, including both black16 women, where a black defendant was facing a sentence of17 25 years to life in a three-strikes case for possessing18 .1 grams of cocaine.19 One of the reasons given by the district20 attorney is patently unconstitutional: gender. And21 all the other reasons are either contradicted or22 unsupported by the record.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you, by any means -- you24 don’t contend, though, the fact that she did rely, in25 part, on an unconstitutional reason is a sufficient451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reason for sustaining a Batson type challenge?2 MR.

Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          General Lockyer, you have 4 minutesremaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. LOCKYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          First, with respect to juror 19, I think it’sthe best clear way to see what the Ninth Circuit didand what Collins continues to do, which is tosubstitute their reading, their inferences, and thenconclude that anyone that disagrees is unreasonable.          Juror 19 -- if you read page 5, it’s clearlya slip of the tongue where she accidentally iscomparing the two young people, 6, and says 19.Immediately afterward, she says 6.  And the defensecounsel says, well, who is 6?  She says, it’s the otheryoung person, the young white person that I struck.          That slip of the tongue is the heart of theNinth Circuit effort and analysis to do, as thedissenters said in the en banc denial, nitpick the471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 record to find some circumstantial evidence to support2 your view of inferences and conclusions about3 reasonableness. I think that partly makes the case and4 especially with a statute where deference is so owed.5 The gender claim is ambiguous, but it was not6 a challenge based solely on race and the circuits are7 split on the mixed motive question, as Justice Stevens8 indicated. Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and9 Eleventh, and in one opinion in the Ninth, they’ve10 addressed mixed motives generally saying your clearly11 established Federal law says that it has to be solely12 based on race. That’s the current test in the13 standard.14 We raised Jackson and -- Jackson v. Virginia15 just because of the Lockyer v. Andrade case in which16 the Court indicates that clear error, when we talk17 about objective reasonableness in understanding (d)(2)18 and (d)(1) in the case of Andrade, that it’s more than19 clear error. So we’re trying to figure out, well,20 what’s more than clear error. We don’t know what it21 might be other than seeing the evidence in the light22 most favorable to the trier of fact.23 And finally, with respect to youth, clearly24 it’s reasonable for a judge to look at the demeanor of25 the DA who’s saying again and again and again it’s a481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 young person, unmarried, no ties in the community. One2 of the things we didn’t talk about is the DA who’s from3 Los Angeles knows that that juror lives in Inglewood.4 Now, there are different kind of neighborhoods in5 Inglewood, but a lot of them are neighborhoods with6 lots of drug dealing, and he might think or she might7 think, in this instance, it shows naivete to answer the8 question that there’s never drug dealing in my9 neighborhood.10 Well, for all those concerns, they’re not11 implausible, they’re not fantastic, as you know from12 the decisions that the reasons can be superstitious.13 They can be silly.14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, you’re coming up15 with still more reasons than the prosecutor came up16 with.17 MR. LOCKYER: Well, they’re just the ones in18 the record, Your Honor. So I wanted to make sure the19 Court was aware of them.20 But that’s basically our contention, that21 deference was owed and the Ninth Circuit didn’t respect22 that deference to trial judge that we rely on for23 credibility determinations.24 If there are no questions, thank you very25 much.491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)50Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
