ORAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF MR. SCHNAPPER:(10:02 a.m.) 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis.OF ERIC SCHNAPPER THE PETITIONERMr. Chief Justice, and mayOfficialit please the Court:The first sentence of Section 7703(b)(2)provides that district courts have jurisdiction over all mixed cases, and that provision is largely dispositive here.The second sentence of 7703(b)(2) on which the Government relies is a statute of limitations, and it doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts.That subsection is set out at pages 16a to 17a of the Government's brief. The first sentence provides that for a described category of cases, they are to be, quote, "filed under one of the listed Federal antidiscrimination statutes."As this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of those are statutes which authorize jurisdictionand claims in district courts. Indeed, in Title VII and the ADEA, that is the only Federal court which is3￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 authorized to hear the cases.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, could you3 clarify what the district court, as you see it, does?4 Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does5 it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling?6 MR. SCHNAPPER: With regard to7 the case gets to district court, there may8 substantive claims, a discrimination claim9 claim. Your question, I take it, is about10 Our view is that the claim is filed and11 pled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a12 discrimination case; in this case, under several13 different statutes. And the complaint here reads very14 much like an ordinary discrimination complaint.15 The Government may raise the -- that sort of16 procedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would17 be free to do so here. And that -- that happens on a18 number of occasions.19 For example, if there were a case in which20 the Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations,21 appealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt22 of the agency decision, the Government could move to23 dismiss that claim on what the lower courts call24 exhaustion grounds. And the lower courts have25 repeatedly sustained those motions -­4the -- when be twoand a CSRA the former.￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schnapper --MR. SCHNAPPER: -- but that's a determinative defense.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the critical point, I gather, is what standard of review the district court will apply to that exhaustion question, or thebar question, right?I assume you think that the standard review in the district court is going to be more favorable to your client than the standard -- the arbitrary and capricious standard that would be applicable in the Federal circuit?I guess --MR. SCHNAPPER: When it's come up,Your Honor, it has generally been a question of law, like whether the 30-day rule had applied. If you had something that was -- if it were a factual issue, our contention is then those Section 7703(c) factual issues have to be decided de novo.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't we take this -- this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it as an affirmative defense.MR. SCHNAPPER: And the first question would be whether it's an affirmative defense at all, and our5Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 position would be that it is not. Not everything that2 could go awry in the internal procedure is an3 affirmative defense.4 One of the central principles of the5 1972 amendments to Title VII was to create an exhaustion6 regime which is precise, simple and short. And if --7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I back8 you up a minute to join the two questions that my9 colleague posed to you?10 Let's assume there's a merits-based decision11 on the CSRA and one on the discrimination. In the12 normal course, assuming you are not barred by being13 untimely, you could go to the district court, and the14 district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if15 one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both16 questions.17 What's the standard of review that a court18 would apply to each of those claims independently or19 together? I mean --20 MR. SCHNAPPER: They're there --21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that that's --22 MR. SCHNAPPER: -- it's -- yeah, I totally23 understand the question.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can then fight about25 whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and6￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425exhaustion should be subject to one or the other standard of review, but what are the standards of review?different.MR. SCHNAPPER: They -- they areJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.OfficialMR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the discrimination claim is dealt with de novo. The intent of Congress was that it would generally be treated like a private discrimination claim.However, the CSRA claim is dealt with under the same standard that would apply in the Federal circuit. And that's --￼what --JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you tell meMR. SCHNAPPER: -- well established.JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.MR. SCHNAPPER: That's what the lower courts have been doing. And we don't -- we think that's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you finish your prior answer? You -- you started to say --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you started to say that the Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 change?2 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. I was3 talking about the amendments to the 19 -- to Title VII4 in 1972.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.6 MR. SCHNAPPER: Prior to that, courts were7 applying the -- judicially fashioned exhaustion8 requirements. And the -- Congress made a decision to9 replace that.10 As this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown11 v. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the12 Court's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary13 to exhaust were not clear.14 So the regime established by Section 717 of15 Title VII, which was adopted in 1972, sets up an16 exhaustion requirement which is clear, simple and17 limited in time. It requires the plaintiff to file a18 complaint, wait at that point 180 days, and at that19 point, the plaintiff was done and could go to district20 court.21 Plaintiff also had the option at that point22 of going to the Civil Service Commission, waiting23 180 days. But as long as a timely complaint was filed,24 that was all that was required of the plaintiff. And25 that was a fundamental change in the way this had been8￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 dealt with.2 The ADEA regime, which was adopted in 1974,3 was actually even simpler, although it's been changed a4 little bit since. The plaintiff to exhaust had to do5 only one of two things, either file a complaint with the6 EEOC, period, or give the EEOC notice that the plaintiff7 was going to sue and wait 30 days.8 As the Government pointed out in its brief9 in Stevens, the exhaustion regime under the ADEA hadn't10 -- didn't in any way address what happened after the11 complaint was filed. It simply said, file the12 complaint.13 That is the fundamental principle that's14 animated the Title VII exhaustion requirement in Title15 VII and the ADEA, and we don't think the CSRA was16 written to change that.17 Indeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it18 doesn't do so expressly -- it incorporates by reference19 those statutes; it expressly reiterates the de novo20 exhaustion requirement. It actually shortened the21 period of time that plaintiff has to wait for these22 cases.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- you're talking24 about the discrimination claim. In your view, could the25 plaintiff now in the district court say, I'll forget9￼Alderson Reporting Company                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And then that would take                 whole thing you discussed before about the                 defense and the Government.  It would be the                 choice, I want my Title VII case and that's10 it. 1112 affirmative13 that the CSRA claim under Section 7703(c) would -- would14 be abandoned. And that's --67 care of the8 affirmative9 plaintiff'sOfficial1 the CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to2 hear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I3 need? And so I'm not -- I'm abandoning my CSRA.4 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor. The Plaintiff5 can do that. The --MR. SCHNAPPER:  No, Your Honor.  Thedefenses could still be raised.  It's just￼JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what provision --MR. SCHNAPPER:  -- that's what happenednot uncommon.The CSRA claim involves a right that is much151617 here. It's 1819 more valuable to the plaintiff in the administrative20 process.21 JUSTICE ALITO: What provision authorizes22 the filing of anything other than a discrimination claim23 in district court? I don't see it.24 MR. SCHNAPPER: The statute says "Cases of25 discrimination subject to" -­10Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: "Cases of discrimination" --MR. SCHNAPPER: "Cases of discrimination subject to 7702." And 7702 --JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. It says, "shall be filed under Title VII."So you are saying that a nondiscrimination claim can be filed under Title VII?MR. SCHNAPPER: No. The way the courts have read this, and I think correctly, is this: If -- so this is just one case. It's a little bit like supplemental jurisdiction. So long as the plaintiff is asserting a discrimination claim, the CSRA claim comes along with it.If the plaintiff were to abandon the discrimination claim, then the case would have to go to the Federal Circuit. That's the way the courts have interpreted that.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that a lot of courts have read it that way. I find itdifficult to see how it fits in the statutory language. And in particular, since the second sentence of subsection (2) there has its own filing deadline, it seems strange to have a district court review the timeliness of the filing before the MSPB.MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the second point you11Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 make is really separate from the first, because even if2 only a discrimination claim is filed, the Government can3 insert an affirmative defense, and one possible4 affirmative defense which the Government has repeatedly5 asserted successfully is that the appeal to the MSPB was6 untimely. So that happens either way.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you give up8 your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense?9 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes. It's because --10 because the discrimination statutes themselves have two11 requirements. You have to have filed the complaint or12 an appeal, depending on where you are in the process.13 You have to wait a certain amount of time if you don't14 have a decision.15 The statutes themselves don't --16 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't understand why17 you're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't18 see any provision that says that -- that specifies what19 the standard of review in the district court is for a20 nondiscrimination claim.21 (C) sets out the standard of review in the22 Federal Circuit for a nondiscrimination claim, but it23 pointedly says nothing about the district court.24 Doesn't that suggest that that claim doesn't go to the25 district court?12￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that question,2 of course, isn't here because we haven't asserted a CSRA3 claim. And if you have doubts about it, I think I would4 reserve that for another case. But, we think the -- the5 courts have treated this as -- the statute doesn't say6 claims of discrimination subject to 7702. It says7 "cases of discrimination."8 And if you look at section 7702, which is9 set out at page 8(a) of the Government's brief, it10 describes the cases involved as cases which contain11 these two elements. They are treated as one case in the12 administrative process. And it would be highly peculiar13 for the Government -- for the statute to take one14 administrative proceeding and then split it in half.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the16 Civil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about17 -- about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age18 Discrimination and Employment Act and so forth. What19 would the situation be? Wouldn't you have a right to go20 to district court?21 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Title VII and all the22 statutes authorize that.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, to prevent you from24 going to district court under those statutes, you have25 to find a repealer contained somewhere -­13￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial123 Reform Act, 45 we think this is a classic example of -- for application6 of the rule that implied repeals are disfavored. This7 -- this statute is quite precise when -- when it's8 changing something, it's very specific. The second9 section, section 7703(b)(2), begins with the wordsMR. SCHNAPPER: In that --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the Civil Service correct?MR. SCHNAPPER: That's exactly right. And10 "notwithstanding," because it is changing the statute of11 limitations that would otherwise apply. It's changing12 it from 90 days in Title VII to 30 days.13 So when Congress wanted to change something,14 it was very specific. But the whole thrust of this15 statute is to leave in place, except where very16 specifically it does otherwise, the regime that existed17 under Title VII in the ADEA.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I19 understand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper. When20 you talk about the affirmative defenses that the21 Government can raise, that is -- those are exhaustion22 defenses under the applicable anti-discrimination23 statute, right? It's whatever exhaustion requirements24 Title VII sets out or whatever exhaustion requirements25 the ADEA sets out; is that correct?14￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. SCHNAPPER: Not -- that's not entirely2 correct, Your Honor. There are -- there are exhaustion3 premises in the statute, but these statutes do not4 contain a time period within which a charge or a5 complaint must be filed with the agency, and they don't6 contain a time period within which an appeal must be7 taken. Those time periods are in the regulations.8 The lower courts have taken the position9 that those time periods also have to be complied with,10 and we think that's correct.11 In the case of --12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Those time periods relevant13 to the MSPB?14 MR. SCHNAPPER: And there are also time15 periods relevant to filing a -- complaint at the agency16 level. It's an -- in the case of a private17 discrimination claim, that time period is specified by18 Title VII.19 But Section 717 about Federal employees is20 simply silent. Congress didn't deal with it. But it21 did authorize the EEOC and the MSPB to write22 regulations. They have both written regulations that --23 with regard to the agency, it is the EEOC regulations24 which set up the time period within which a complaint25 must be filed. With regard to appeals to the MSPB, both15￼Alderson Reporting Company1 the EEOC and the MSPB have regulations which are the2 same.Official34 repealer of5 these civil6 of what would otherwise be their right to go to district7 court?8 You are saying, no, you can't go to district9 court because of these time limits, not even establishedJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that awhat would otherwise be the law under all rights statutes? Why isn't that a repealer10 by statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by11 regulation. You think that that's -- that's an12 effective repealer of the right to go to district court?13 MR. SCHNAPPER: We don't -- we think not,14 Your Honor.15 Again, this doesn't go to subject matter16 jurisdiction, which is specified in the statute. The17 statute creates a regime. It doesn't set up time18 periods.19 We think Congress -- the statute should be20 read to -- to mean that the authority of the Government,21 of the agencies to write regulations, includes￼22 regulations setting up time23 inconceivable that --24 JUSTICE KAGAN:25 MR. SCHNAPPER:16periods. It's justAnd would that ---- Congress contemplated youAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would have forever to do these things.JUSTICE KAGAN: And would that put theemployee who has a mixed case in the same position as an employee who has a straight anti-discrimination case?MR. SCHNAPPER: Non-mixed case. Yes. Yes. There are regulations governing both.The non-mixed case claim would only be governed by the EEOC regulation. The mixed case claim is governed as well by the time limit in the MSPB regulation, but that is the same as the time limit in the EEOC regulation.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I've probably led a charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until this matter came before us. And I was -- I suppose you have to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say "cases," "cases of discrimination," which is what this is.We don't usually think of cases that we call a discrimination case based on whether or not itcontains other issues. It's a case.MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, the -- youhave led a charmed life.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I think that helpsyou.Official￼MR. SCHNAPPER: I'm not sure how that17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 affects it. The phrase mixed case is in the2 regulations, both of the EEOC. It also was in currency3 prior to 1978. When Congress was working on this4 problem, it was already calling these kinds of cases5 mixed cases.6 And, of course, we haven't touched on this.7 A mixed case is a case which involves -- has two8 elements. First, it involves what's called, under the9 Civil Service Reform Act, an appealable issue. That is10 an issue which can be appealed to the MSPB, not --11 JUSTICE ALITO: Can't an employee take a12 mixed case appeal to the Federal circuit?13 MR. SCHNAPPER: You could not take that case14 to the Federal circuit without waiving your15 antidiscrimination claim. That is what the -- that's16 the way we read the law and that is the way the MSPB17 reads the law. The MSPB regulation expressly provides18 that if you want to go to the Federal circuit you must19 waive that right.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, can you21 explain something about the MSPB's role? That is, once22 you have a final decision from the agency, you could go23 right to court. You don't -- on the discrimination24 claim, right? You don't need to go to the MSPB. You25 don't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get18￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 your discrimination claim. So, how does the M -- the2 possibility of going to the MSPB make the discrimination3 claim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be4 if you stopped at the agency level?5 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's our view that6 once you appeal to the MSPB, and putting aside the7 unusual situation of people who withdraw the appeal, you8 then must wait, under the statute, 120 days or until you9 have a decision. So you are ready, all set, and you10 could go to court after the district court decision, but11 if you appeal to the MSPB, you then have to wait until12 120 days have passed or you have a decision.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are -- what are your14 advantages? You are deciding -- you have the final15 agency decision, you could go right to court on the16 discrimination claim. What do you gain by invoking the17 MSPB's authority?18 MR. SCHNAPPER: What you gain are the rights19 in Section 7701(c), which are set out on page 3(a) of20 the Government's brief. In the appeal to the MSPB with21 regard to the Civil -- the CSRA claim, the burden is on22 the Government to establish by a preponderance of the23 evidence that its decision was correct. If you bypass24 the MSPB and go to district court, then your claim is25 only a claim under section 7703(c), which requires the19￼Alderson Reporting Company1 plaintiff to establish that there wasn't evenOfficial2 substantial3 plaintiff --45 sorry. 67 valuable at8 in the real9 the MSPB. The MSPB, according to the only study I've10 been able to find, out of 2,000 mixed cases the MSPB11 actually only found discrimination in four. But a much12 higher percentage of CSRA claims are successful there.13 So that's why people go there.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose if you15 say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency16 says, no, you were fired because you were incompetent,17 you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and18 if you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent,19 they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and20 you don't need to proceed with the discrimination --21 MR. SCHNAPPER: Sure. And that's why people22 go there. That's why people go there.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You argued that you were24 exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction25 should go to the Federal circuit, but that you were only20evidence to support the decision. So, CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose -- I'mMR. SCHNAPPER: The CSRA claim is much more the MSPB.

That was the distinction that I6 the Tenth Circuit in Harms--7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, but when8 it below you argued the exception, you didn't9 jurisdictional rule.

That is the view and of the EEOC and the regulations -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not the view of courts, even the courts --MR. SCHNAPPER: It's not the view of theOfficial1 invoking the exception that procedural dismissals should2 be permitted to go to the district court or authorized3 to go. Are you still standing by that distinction?4 MR.

SCHNAPPER: Right. We think that that's21MR. SCHNAPPER: That is not their view andJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every circuit court holds that jurisdictional dismissalsAlderson Reporting Company1 wrong and -- 234 sorry.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you --JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry -- go ahead. I'm56 this before789 you should abandon here?OfficialJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Should you be arguing us?MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, you don't -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this a distinction10 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or at least ask us not12 to address?13 MR. SCHNAPPER: You don't need to address14 it, but we think those decisions are wrong. The15 statutory arguments that we're making treat -- draw no16 distinction between procedural and jurisdictional --17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually the 751218 argument has more legs, I think. The point is that19 you're only permitted to go to district court on issues20 of discrimination that are within the Board's21 jurisdiction. So if --￼2223 there are a24 distinction25 jurisdictional issues went to the Federal circuit youMR. SCHNAPPER: It's somewhat stronger, but couple of reasons why we think thisdoesn't make sense. The first one is if22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 would have an -- a really bizarre problem of -- of2 splitting the claim, and here's why: If, under the EEOC3 regulations which the Government has referred to, if the4 MSPB holds that it didn't have jurisdiction in a mixed5 case, the discrimination claim doesn't die. Under the6 regulations it goes back to the agency, which then7 processes it as a non-mixed case. But the plaintiff is8 still free to challenge the decision of the MSPB that it9 had no jurisdiction. In the Government's view, that10 would go to the Federal circuit. So the case would then11 be pending in two different places. And if the12 plaintiff came to the end of the line in the -- at the13 agency level and lost, the plaintiff clearly would go to14 district court. So the case would then be pending in15 two different places. On our view, everything goes to16 the district court.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree18 with everything that you just said, I can still rule for19 you in this case, right?20 MR. SCHNAPPER: You can, and you don't need21 to address what I just said.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because there does seem to23 be a good deal of difference between the question, what24 happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and25 alternatively, the question of whether something is a23￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about2 an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB.3 And one could think that questions about what can be4 appealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit5 under this statutory language in a way that questions6 that are involved in this case do not.7 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, you don't need8 to rule for that -- me on that, but if I could identify9 another problem before my time runs out. There is --10 and it comes up in two ways. Sometimes whether a case11 is appealable depends on whether there was12 discrimination. There is a district court decision in13 Barrow v. Louisiana in which that problem arose. I will14 spare you --15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that just makes the16 next case very complicated but it has nothing to do with17 this case; is that correct?18 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. But that's why I19 think if you have doubts about it, you should stay away20 from it because that's very bad. In addition, in a21 constructive discharge case based on sexual harassment,22 whether there's jurisdiction, the MSPB in deciding23 whether there is jurisdiction has to decide whether24 there was sexual harassment. It seems to me you would25 not want that going to the Federal circuit.24￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425time.I would like to reserve the balance of myCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.Ms. Harrington.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E.

Are you telling us to rule either completely for you or against you?MS. HARRINGTON: That's always been our position, Justice Sotomayor. Our position hasconsistently been that the only decisions of the MSPB that can get review in a district court are decisions on the issue of discrimination.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are prepared on behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then you -- then the Government will concede that jurisdictional dismissal should as well?MS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.25￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under 7512.2 MS. HARRINGTON: Again, we don't think any3 of them should and --4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have to reach5 that question in this case, but your brief seemed to6 make the argument that there was no basis for the7 distinction between procedural and jurisdictional.8 MS. HARRINGTON: I agree that there is no9 basis for the distinction and part of that is because,10 as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC11 regulation providing that when the board dismisses a12 case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to13 the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final14 decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district15 court. So if the whole point is to find a way for an16 employee to get into district court on her17 discrimination claim, we've already had that taken care18 of in jurisdictional dismissal cases. So the action19 really here is with procedural dismissals.20 And if -- I would like to start with21 Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there22 has been a repeal of the right to go to district court23 on discrimination claims. And I think our starting24 point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is25 28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit. This2 court is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in3 various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that4 that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of5 jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final6 decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the7 only exception to that is for the subset of final board8 decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2). And if you9 look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board10 decision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's11 brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section12 7702. Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase13 judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that14 is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase15 is only ever used either in or in reference to section16 7702.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, does that mean18 that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is19 thrown out on a procedural ground.20 MS. HARRINGTON: It means that it's not a21 judicially reviewable action under 7702.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I23 mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural24 objections all the time and we think of those as25 judicially reviewable. It's -- it's a real stretch to27￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425say simply because it says "judicially reviewable" it means judicially reviewable on the merits.MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in our view, again, because it uses the phrase "judicially reviewable action" under 7702 and that phrase "judicially reviewable action" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this context.So although dismissal on procedural grounds is a board action subject to judicial review, in our view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702. And so you need to look at 7702 to see how --again?slowly.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you say thatMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little moreOfficial￼MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. A procedural dismissal by the board is a final board action that's subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's subject to judicial review.MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, the next -­28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MS. HARRINGTON: But it does not fall within2 the term of art "judicially reviewable action" under3 7702.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So I thought5 that your argument in the brief reduced to the question6 that an action subject to judicial review in one section7 is not judicially reviewable in another. That's right?8 MS. HARRINGTON: Say it again? I'm sorry?9 (Laughter.)10 MS. HARRINGTON: This is going to happen a11 lot.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More slowly.13 (Laughter.)14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I15 thought I heard you to say, and this is what I16 understood your brief to say, that an action that is17 subject to judicial review is not judicially reviewable18 under 7703(b)(2).￼1920 fall within 212223 exclusive -- 2425 argument.MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. It does not --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.MS. HARRINGTON: -- the exception toCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a tough29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MS. HARRINGTON: -- review.2 It's a tough statute. In our view, our3 argument is the best reading of the overall statute.4 And again, because we think "judicially reviewable5 action" under 7702 is sort of the linchpin phrase in6 7703(b)(2), we want to look to 7702 to how the phrase7 "judicially reviewable action" is used by Congress in8 that statute, and the relevant pages here are page 8a9 and 9a in the statutory appendix to the Government's10 brief.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a couple12 questions?13 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the Federal Circuit15 was created, this language preexisted its creation,16 correct?17 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you tell me how19 when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the20 system that you are advocating when it had no idea that21 it would ever create the Federal Circuit?22 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I have two answers.23 The first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases24 where this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl25 and Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has30￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 interpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it2 exists today directs review of board decisions to the3 Federal Circuit.4 But the second answer is, even for that5 brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the6 Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken7 away jurisdiction from district courts over board8 decisions and had directed them to the courts of9 appeals. And this Court recognized in Fausto that that10 -- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted11 the CSRA. It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction12 in all the district courts throughout the country over13 Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a14 layer of review and direct them to fewer courts. Now --15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That still doesn't16 answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no17 Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists18 in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable19 judicial review, used not in the manner that you're20 describing.21 MS. HARRINGTON: I disagree, Your Honor. I22 mean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would23 indicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB24 final decisions reviewed in district court. And again,25 we don't need to assume that the Federal Circuit doesn't31￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 exist today because it does, and that's how this Court2 has construed the statute for the last 25 years, ever3 since the --4 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Harrington, go back5 to the question that the Chief Justice asked you,6 because the question was: Should we read "judicially7 reviewable action" as something different from action8 subject to judicial review, which is how you would9 normally read that language, as something different from10 just final agency action that you can take to a court.11 Not saying which court, that you can just take to a12 court.13 And you're asking us -- you said it's a term14 of art. So I guess the next question is: How do you15 get the definition of the term of art that you say16 exists in this statute?17 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, you look at 7702, and18 let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's19 a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that20 it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702.21 That's in the text of 7703(b)(2).22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, it has to be an action23 that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a24 certain number of days to take it to a court. So that's25 the normal way you would read that language.32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MS. HARRINGTON: But --2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you say no, it really,3 you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not4 other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that5 it's really a switch as to which court you get to take6 the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to7 read this language.8 So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you9 find the definition of the term of art? And I think10 what your answer is going to be is this notion the board11 shall decide the issue of discrimination and the12 applicable action; is that correct.13 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Can I just take you14 back one sentence to say, the point is not just that15 the board is done, the point is that the board is done16 under 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702,17 and so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that18 provision Congress specifies various points at which a19 final board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially20 reviewable action.21 The one that's relevant in this case is in22 subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of23 the page there. It says: "Any decision of the board24 under paragraph (1)" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- "of this25 subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action,33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 either when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek2 EEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case."3 So in our view there are two indications in4 (a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the5 issue of discrimination in order to be a judicially6 reviewable action -- action under section 7702.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't the language8 that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the9 board within 120 days decide both the issue of10 discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the11 board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination12 and the appealable action, not that it must actually13 adjudicate those two issues?14 What if you have a threshold, you have a15 threshold timeliness issue that is completely16 dispositive? You're saying that this language means the17 board nevertheless has to decide the merits of the18 discrimination issue?19 MS. HARRINGTON: No. I'm glad you asked20 that question. The directive in section -- that you're21 referring to is at the bottom of page 8a. The directive22 is that the board shall decide both the issue of23 discrimination and the appealable action in accordance24 with the board's appellate procedures.25 In this case the board complied with that34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 directive by not deciding the issue of discrimination2 because the appeal was untimely. And I know that sounds3 a little strange when I first say it, so let me give you4 an analogous example. Imagine a State law that directed5 the DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in6 accordance -- in accordance with the procedures7 governing such applications. If the DMV required that8 driver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit9 to an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have10 to issue a license to someone who refused to comply with11 those requirements. In that case the DMV would comply12 with the directive that it issue a license in accordance13 with its procedures by not issuing a license at all.14 And it's the same thing here. Here the15 board complied with the directive that it decide the16 issue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate17 procedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination18 and therefore not issuing a decision under 7703.19 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to read it20 that way, do you? I mean, look, it says in (a), it21 says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely,22 and then it says "alleges that the basis for the action￼23 was discrimination," okay.24 within 120 days decide both25 and the appealable action.35In that case the board shall the issue of discrimination So they decided it. TheyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 decided it was out of time. They decided it was barred.2 They decided da, da, da.3 I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an4 issue that a person raises in court and we don't5 normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court.6 It decided it. It decided it was untimely.7 MS. HARRINGTON: But I think normally when a8 court dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't9 think of it as deciding the issue.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, I see. The11 issue. They shall decide the issue of discrimination.12 I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide13 the merits or you could read it as saying, there could14 be several claims that went on below. Heard them,15 decide the discrimination one. Now, you decide the16 discrimination one. And I agree they used the word17 "issue" instead of saying decide the discrimination18 claim, that it says here, he alleges. They could have19 said, decide the allegation. They could have said,20 decide that part of the case.21 But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 1422 hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word23 issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a24 new jurisprudence arising.25 Is the dismissal on the ground that it was an36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to2 really make out discrimination? It was partial summary3 judgment. It was a dismissal on the basis of the4 statement in the complaint. It was -- I mean, we can5 think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to6 be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural,7 jurisdictional or on the merits.8 And why do we want to get courts into that, when9 the simplest thing is the person says, I allege10 discrimination. There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of11 his paper. The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on12 that particular one, and now we go to the district13 court. That's just so simple.14 MS. HARRINGTON: That would certainly be15 simpler. And if it were up to us to make up the rules,16 maybe that's what we would decide.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. All we're18 doing is interpreting what you've said is the word19 issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on20 the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're21 interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he22 has raised that he was discriminated against.23 MS. HARRINGTON: But what we're trying to do24 is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted25 to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's37￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions.In our view, its choice of the word issue isimportant, because it's not just deciding the case that alleges discrimination. It's the issue of discrimination.JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.MS. HARRINGTON: I'm sorry. Go ahead. There's another hint in paragraph (a)(3),and let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the direction to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3), another hint that Congress was really talking about cases where the board decides the issue of discrimination.In paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a), Congress provides that a judicially reviewable action becomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when the employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or when the EEOC decides not to take the case.Now, the only types of decisions from the board that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach an issue of discrimination. And so it would be strange to be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC could review if you're talking about decisions that don't involve the issue of discrimination.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Harrington, may I38Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB,2 and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit3 agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed,4 that's the end of the case, the discrimination claim5 would never be heard then.6 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, the plaintiffs7 could then file a suit in district court and seek8 equitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file9 from the date of the final agency decision.10 And, in fact, that was one of the11 alternative bases for jurisdiction that was asserted in12 the district court below in this case.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the Plaintiff then14 goes to the district court, then what position does the15 Government take?16 MS. HARRINGTON: It depends on the case. In17 this case, we argued against equitable tolling because,18 in our view, she had missed the deadlines through her19 own fault. But if there was some reason to think that20 it wasn't really her fault for missing the deadlines for21 appealing and -- so that even though her appeal to the22 MSPB was, in fact, untimely, it wasn't really her fault,￼23 then we might not resist equitable24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr.25 his brief, and he repeated it this39tolling.Schnapper told us in morning, that theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the2 statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case3 goes to the district court.4 MS. HARRINGTON: I don't think that's5 correct. I didn't hear him say that; but, if he said6 that, I don't think -- I mean, I know it's not correct7 that the EEOC and MSPB disagree with --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, didn't -- in the9 Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that10 it didn't go to the Federal circuit?11 MS. HARRINGTON: That was our position, you12 know, I think it was 30 years ago now. And since the13 Ballentine decision, the Government has had the other --14 has had the position that we're asserting today, which15 is that the only --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so you -- are you --17 are you telling us that the position you're representing18 on behalf of the Government is the position that the19 MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC20 would take today?21 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Yes. Our brief is22 filed on behalf of all the agencies in the United States23 that are affected by this.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, getting25 back to judicially reviewable -­40￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Excellent.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even if I accept your argument that that's not the same as subject to judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get to your position?This is not something about -- a provision about what's judicially reviewable and what's not. It's a notice provision. It says these actions have to be filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review.MS. HARRINGTON: Well, but some --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then you say that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence about notice.MS. HARRINGTON: But it's in a provision that's describing the exception to the general rule that's set out in 7703.So the general rule in 7703 is that when you're talking about final board decisions, judicial review of those decisions is in the Federal circuit.And this is at 16(a) and 17(a) in the Government's brief. It says, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2).So when you're looking to (b)(2), you're wondering -- you're asking what subset of final board actions -- that's -- final order or decision -- that's41Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 their language used in (a)(1) -- what subset of final2 orders or decisions of the Merit Systems Protection3 Board fall within (b)(2).4 Now, in (b)(2), the only types of final5 orders that are described there is at the end of the6 section, judicially reviewable action under section7 7702.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yes, that's9 where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way10 to establish that that is the critical element that11 tells you which provisions you can take forward when it12 just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of13 judicial review.14 MS. HARRINGTON: Under --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And here the16 Government says, aha, judicial review, we think that17 does not mean subject to judicial review. Judicially18 reviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review.Official￼MS. HARRINGTON:  So even if you throw outart --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.MS. HARRINGTON:  -- part of our argument, and allis the last two words of that sentence,1920 the term of 212223 you look at24 which is Section 7702, you still have to look at 770225 and figure out when Congress told you that a final board42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 decision could be subject to judicial review.2 And the relevant place for this case where3 it did that is in section (a)(3), which is on page 9a.4 And there again, it points at (a)(1), which directs that5 the Board decide the issue of discrimination. So it6 says a decision under (a)(1) is -- is judicially7 reviewable. If a decision does not reach the issue of8 discrimination, it is not --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As of. See, it10 shall be reviewable action as of. Again, it's just11 going to the timeliness.12 MS. HARRINGTON: Right. But again -- but13 the two time triggers would only come into play if a14 decision reached an issue of discrimination, because the15 EEOC can't review issues -- can't review dismissals on16 jurisdictional or procedural grounds. It can only --17 the EEOC's review of the board's -- of a board decision18 is limited to its review of the board's interpretation19 of an anti-discrimination law or its application of20 those laws to a particular case.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, would you22 agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress23 trying to accomplish this objective? I mean, if24 Congress were really saying we don't want procedural25 determinations to go to the district court, that's a43￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 very easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send2 you -- you know, involve six different cross-references3 and unnatural reading of statutory language.4 And, you know, in the end, your argument5 just is based on this notion that Congress used the word6 decide rather than dispose of in this single provision.7 The argument would completely collapse if that were not8 the case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what9 you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in10 this extremely complicated and backhanded way.11 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I'm not going to12 resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated. I13 mean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they14 have remarked about how it is a complex statutory15 scheme.16 But I think Congress did accomplish in a17 pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing18 that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal19 circuit, and it did that by making that the background20 rule.21 In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final22 decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal23 circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2).24 And then the question is, well, which of those decisions25 fall within (b)(2).44￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 In our view, you should not read that2 exception more broadly than necessary to accommodate3 employees' rights to have their discrimination claims4 determined de novo in district court.5 Here, the board decision, it decided two6 things. First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board7 timely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her8 untimeliness. There is no reason to think that Congress9 would have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed10 anywhere other than the Federal circuit. The whole11 point of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified12 body of law governing certain things in the country that13 Congress really thought should be directed to one place,14 and that included board decisions.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not -- the16 Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these17 statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it18 would have been taken to the various courts of appeals,19 and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway.20 MS. HARRINGTON: Right, but you would have21 had more uniformity than you would have had if the cases22 had continued to go to the district court, which is23 what -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and24 Congress specifically wanted to stop that process.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't have a quarrel45￼Alderson Reporting Company1 with your opposing counsel's position that once the2 Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination3 claim, the district court reviews both?Official456 questioning789 uniformity is inherent in this structure. You just wantMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Alito was that, but you don't quarrel with that.MS. HARRINGTON: We don't quarrel with it. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the lack of10 to carve out one piece of it that --11 MS. HARRINGTON: No --12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you say deserves13 more uniformity.14 MS. HARRINGTON: It is -- it is true that a15 small range of procedural issues governing the board's16 procedures might be heard in district court, but it is17 truly a very small universe of issues bordering on18 non-existent, and let me explain why. As suggested19 here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up20 is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a21 defense of exhaustion. But then generally speaking it22 would have to be a procedural issue that the Government,23 that the agency raised before the board and the board24 rejected.2546￼Now, the board's own regulations allow theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory2 requirements, including timeliness, for good cause. And3 so the Government would have to argue in the district4 court that essentially the board abused its discretion5 by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very6 high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very7 many cases in which that's going to come up, where the8 Government's going to make that kind of argument. So9 although there's -- there's potential, there's a10 potential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under11 our view, it is really a small universe of issues that12 could go to district court.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything you want14 to say on the question of which is worse? That is to15 say, I get your point on the word "issue," and I think16 you can read the word "issue" to say there is a￼17 contested point as to whether there was discrimination18 or to say there is a contested point between the parties19 as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a --20 has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower --21 the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination.22 The latter way favors your opponent, the23 former favors you; okay. So we could do either, I24 guess.2547The one way, if you win, there will be aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 body of law about what counts as procedural and what2 doesn't. That sounds confusing to me. If you lose, I3 quite agree with you that there will then be different4 courts deciding different procedural matters, where5 you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit.6 Okay. Do you have anything to say about7 two evils is worse? Is there any reason8 MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Have we anywhich of those --way of knowing? 10 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think Congress11 made the determination.12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- going back to the13 language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think14 the language at best might be read, that word "issue,"15 the way you say, but need not be.16 MS. HARRINGTON: But I think you can resolve17 the ambiguity in the use of the word "issue" by looking18 at the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision19 under (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC. I don't20 think there is any dispute that the EEOC can only review21 board decisions that involve an issue of discrimination,22 either an interpretation of an antidiscrimination law or23 an application of such a law to the facts of the case.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a problem,25 because to accept your reading is to say that judicially48￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reviewable action differs between 7702 and the escape hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the provisions you are relying on do. Under your reading both should be given identical meaning, because they both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, we shouldn't have that absurd result.MS. HARRINGTON: But not because --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that if you concede that there is an absurd result in applying your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase.MS. HARRINGTON: Well, so just to be clear, we think the phrase "judicially reviewable action" should be given the same meaning in section (e) that it is given elsewhere in 7702.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the board -- MS. HARRINGTON: Our view is --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when does the timeframes of the escape hatch commence -- MS. HARRINGTON: So --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if the board hasn't rendered any decision on anything?MS. HARRINGTON: Exactly. If the -- if the appeal is still pending before the board, that's when49Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the escape hatch of (e) comes in, because it's just2 intended to prevent employees from being held hostage by3 board inaction.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right, but Justice Sotomayor5 is right, that when you define "judicially reviewable6 action" in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes7 nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting8 additional language, by saying, you know, "and other" --9 "and other kinds of action."10 MS. HARRINGTON: No, it only becomes11 nonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that12 are no longer pending before the board under section13 7702. In our view, once the board issued a decision --14 the decision in this case, it issued a decision under15 section 7701 which is the general provision governing16 board decisions, and then the case was no longer pending17 under section 7702. And so it wouldn't make sense to18 apply the escape hatch to cases in that situation.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it wouldn't make20 sense, but it's what the language would command if￼21 "judicially22 "judicially2324 commonsense25 text of thereviewable action" means what you say reviewable action" means.MS. HARRINGTON: It is true that ourgloss on the statute is not found in the statute. But I think once the -- once the50Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 case has been decided under section 7701 on procedural2 grounds, it's no longer a 7702 case before the board.3 And so there is just no reason to think that subsection4 (e) would apply in the -- in that situation.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still have an6 exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to7 the district court?8 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we raised that9 exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the10 district court. The district court construed this case11 as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking12 review of the agency's decision. Petitioner did not13 challenge that district court holding before the eighth14 circuit in her opening brief. She didn't flag that as15 issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although16 now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case --17 this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's18 seeking review of the agency decision instead of the19 board decision, in our view that's not really a question20 that is presented in -- in the case any longer. In our21 view she is seeking review over the board decision, the22 board decision decided that her appeal was untimely,23 that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness.24 There is no indication anywhere in the statute that25 Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision51￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to be reviewed anywhere other than the Federal Circuit. And so in our view it does not fall within -- in the exception to exclusive Federal Circuit jurisdiction provided in (b)(2) because it does not decide the issue of discrimination.Harrington.If there are no further questions? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.Mr. Schnapper you have 4 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayOfficialit please the Court:I would like to answer the question that theChief Justice asked yesterday morning in Lozman. You -- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better remindme.(Laughter).MR. SCHNAPPER: I -- I am happy to do so, Your Honor. You pointed out that -- that where subject matter jurisdiction is concerned, is it important that rules be clear? And you asked counsel for Respondent, why was Respondent's rule clearer than the Petitioner's rule?In this case our rule is demonstrably52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 clearer. The question is which mixed-cases go to the2 district court? Our answer is all. The Government's3 answer, the rule that is derived from Ballentine, has4 confounded the lower courts since Ballentine and those5 problems are reflected in the divergent accounts of the6 rule in the Government's brief. There are more than7 half a dozen of these problems.8 First, the courts are divided below, as is9 the Government's brief, about whether the Government's10 rule applies to all procedural issues or only to11 procedural issues that arise before the court reaches12 the merits. For example, in -- in Hopkins v. MSPB,13 after the court had resolved the merits, there was a14 dispute about counsel fees and an argument that the15 counsel fee application was untimely. The Government16 took the position that that timeliness issue belonged in17 the district court.18 Secondly, the lower courts are divided as is19 the Government's brief about whether a procedural issue20 that is related to or intertwined with the merits goes21 to the district court or the court of appeals. There is22 a line of cases holding that a -- a -- when the MSPB23 holds there is no jurisdiction because the24 discrimination claim is frivolous, that's a procedural25 jurisdiction issue, it's not a merits issue. And if you53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 look at the opinion in Hill v. Department of the Air2 Force, you see a lengthy description of Title VII law,3 in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, in the course of a4 decision by the Federal Circuit holding there is no5 jurisdiction.6 Third, it is unclear what constitutes the7 line between a merits decision and a procedural decision8 issue. Some things are really neither. For example,9 there are recurring disputes about whether a settlement10 was voluntary. Well, it's not the merits of the11 discrimination case, but it's not procedural in any12 normal sense of the word.13 Fourth, there are cases which involve14 several claims resolved on several different bases. We15 noted some of them in our reply brief. One -- one claim16 was rejected on jurisdictional grounds; one claim was17 rejected on res judicata and one claim was decided by￼18 the19 go.2021 get22 and23 an MSPB decision on procedural grounds, one on the24 merits. The court in that case just thought it ought to25 just keep them both. It's not clear how that comes out.54board on the merits. It's unclear how that wouldThere are also situations in which two cases filed, one of which -- and they are related cases, they go to the same judge, and one -- one involvedAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Fourth -- some, sorry, fifth.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Fifth.MR.

SCHNAPPER: Oh,that was -- I didn't was just keeping score. okay. I'm sorry. IOfficialCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I -- I justthink -- I think we are at six.JUSTICE SCALIA: Checking them off.MR. SCHNAPPER: The MS -- the --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are on numberfive.MR. SCHNAPPER: Okay. The -- the -- an MSPB, ALJ, or the board itself could resolve a claim on alternative grounds, as judges do all the time, and say, well, we think this is time barred, but we also find that it lacks the merits. I know where that goes.There is also a problem, which the briefs address, about factual disputes that arise with regard to jurisdiction or procedure. The -- 7703(c) says,55￼Alderson Reporting Company1819202122232425Official1 "Questions of fact get decided de novo." What does that2 mean?3 If there -- let's take, for example, a case4 in which the claim is that a charge wasn't filed on time5 with the agency. That's a question of fact. The agency6 might find that it was timely -- there could be a7 dispute of fact about when the violation occurred which8 triggers the limitation period. The agency would make a9 finding of fact. The MSPB might affirm that finding.10 The Government tells us they would affirm whatever the11 agency did. The statute seems to say that's got to be12 decided de novo, the Federal circuit can't do that.13 Thank you.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.15 The case is submitted.16 (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the17 above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼56Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialPage 57￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼A abandon11:14 22:9abandoned 10:14 abandoning 10:321:9 25:11able 20:10
