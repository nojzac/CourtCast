United States.      Mr. Lechner.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. LECHNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      If upheld, the decision below will upset100 years of property law and title to perhaps a millionacres of land, based upon an implied reversionaryinterest that the government recently created.I would like to make three points: First, the decision below violates Leo Sheep, where this Court rejected the government's attempt to create a property interest through implication and reaffirmed that the government does not retain any interest not expressly reserved in the patent or the granting statute.      Two, the decision below is contrary to boththe government's argument and this Court's ruling inGreat Northern that 1875 Act rights­of­way are easementsand are not fees.      And finally, the decision below is3Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425inconsistent with the Department of Interior'slongstanding interpretation that the 1875 Act grantedonly an easement.      It is axiomatic that the highest evidence oftitle in this country is a patent from the government.When the government issues a patent, it divests itselfof title except for those interests expressly reserved.Here, the patent did not reserve any interest in the1875 Act ­­JUSTICE ALITO:No?Official￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:reading this, are you?      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. LECHNER:reserve any interest in 1875 Act right­of­way.  Yet thegovernment knew how to reserve interests at that timebecause it reserved the interest for ditches and canal,and reserved the right to two Forest Service roads whenit issued the patent.      That some interests were reserved by thegovernment in 1976 shows that other interests were not.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under Section 1912, the government could ­­ did reserve an interest for a public highway; is that correct?MR. LECHNER: No.4Alderson Reporting CompanyCounsel, you are not   It's all right.Here the patent did notOfficial￼1 MR. LECHNER: 1912, Section 1912 has to be2 read in conjunction with this Court's decision in3 Northern Pacific v. Townsend, and Stringham. And in4 those decisions, this Court held that railroad5 rights­of­way were limited fees with implied6 reversionary interests.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The patent you talk8 about, I am not recalling it exactly. It had some ­­ it9 mentioned the railroad interest, right?10 MR. LECHNER: Yes, it mentioned it in the11 context of, that Brandt's title is subject to those12 rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the13 railroad under the 1875 Act.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it didn't15 characterize it as either an easement or a fee with an16 implied reverter?17 MR. LECHNER: That it was subject to18 rights for railroad purposes as had been granted19 railroad sounds like it was granted subject to a20 servitude. "Rights for railroad purpose" sounds21 servitude. And of course that's how the Department of22 Interior interpreted it at the time, that these 187523 rights­of­way were easements, following its longstanding24 interpretation plus this Court's ruling in Great25 Northern that these were easements.5Alderson Reporting Companythose to thelike aOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And at the time, that regulation was the lawof the land.  And that's ­­ that controlled the titlethat Brandt got.JUSTICE BREYER: What they are saying, I think the government's point is ­­ the other side is saying, and I don't remember the term of my property law. What's the right term? It's ­­ you grant to A, black acre to A and his heirs; it's a fee simple. But it's subject to a shifting; it's subject to divestiture, subject to a condition subsequent. What's the right term?MR. LECHNER:      JUSTICE BREYER:it back.      MR. LECHNER:conditional ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:technical term they used to have.  But anyway, that'swhat they're saying.MR. LECHNER: That's what they're saying.JUSTICE BREYER: And they are saying that that's, for purposes of who owns the land, the mineral rights, it's treated as an easement. But for purposes of deciding who it reverts to, it's treated as a fee subject to a shifting use or whatever you call it.6Well ­­   It shifts the ­­ it shiftsA defeasible fee?

It's different that there they were talking about who owns the mineral rights. So for those purposes they say it's treated like an easement. But for who gets the reverter, it's treated like a shift of the fee.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, that's nice. Do you know of any other real estate thing which says it's an easement for one purpose and the fee for another? The government absolutely denied in Great Northern, didn't it? It was ­­ that was the government's case; this was not a fee.MR. LECHNER: Exactly.JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't say it's a ­­ you know, for some purposes it is. They said it was not a fee. And that's what the Court held, contrary ­­ in accordance with what the government wanted, right?MR. LECHNER: Correct.7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 around for how long?3 MR. LECHNER:4 JUSTICE SCALIA:5 explicitly says it's an easement. And people have been6 buying and selling real estate I assume in reliance on7 that case for ­­ for that entire period of time. And8 now the government has this new theory that for some9 purposes it's a fee; for some purposes it's an easement.10 That's not what Great Northern said.11 MR. LECHNER: No, but I think it's important12 that ­­ the argument that the government is making today13 is similar to their alternative argument that they made14 there in Great Northern, saying, okay, well, if it's not15 an easement, then it's a limited fee in the surface.16 This Court in Great Northern did not even17 address that alternative argument, which shows how18 strongly this Court in Great Northern believed it was19 just an easement. And this ­­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they are not21 really not alternative ­­ well, maybe it's all right to22 say they are alternative arguments, but they are23 mutually exclusive arguments.

And the caseAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 other argument is this is not A.2 MR. LECHNER: Yes. They’d be mutually3 exclusive.4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. We have a5 brief here from the cities, and they point out that ­­6 that, of course, there is reliance on your side;7 you're ­­ I believe you are absolutely right. But they8 say there is also a lot of reliance on the other side,9 because cities have built highways, and they've ­­ or10 states have, and they've converted it to use under11 patents or under statutes that the United States gave12 them that right. And all those are going to be invalid13 if you win.14 So what's your response to that?15 MR. LECHNER: They would all ­­ I'm not sure16 that they would be invalid, necessarily.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Why ­­ why?18 MR. LECHNER: Well, I'm not ­­ I don't know19 where all the city public highways' interests are,20 vis­à­vis how the land was originally patented. It21 could have been originally patented in a town site plat22 or something like that, that ­­ as opposed to here,23 where it was originally patented to one ­­ under one24 patent, and I'm not sure how all the cities' property25 was acquired.9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 be that if it's a choice between disappointing people3 who properly relied on the law, and disappointing people4 who were ­­ were not following the law, it's clear who5 should ­­ who should take it in the neck. It's the6 latter, isn't it?7 MR. LECHNER: Absolutely, plus the cities8 also have the ­­ the power of the eminent ­­ the power9 of eminent domain. And if they would want a public10 highway, they certainly could condemn one.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought this ­­ the12 cities were relying on Section 912, as applied to the13 1875 Act.14 MR. LECHNER: That's what ­­ that's what15 they ­­ that's what the cities were relying on. But you16 must keep in mind that Section 912 did not alter or17 amend the 1875 Act, so the nature of the grant in the18 1875 Act must be looked through the eyes of Congress in19 1875.20 In 1922, when Congress passed Section 912,21 Congress was grappling with what to do with these22 isolated strips of land that would be administratively23 burdensome to manage. And they said ­­ well,24 originally, they said, well, let's give them to the25 settlers because they are the ones entitled to it in the10Alderson Reporting CompanyI assume your answer wouldOfficial￼1 first place, and then ­­ and then as an afterthought2 said, well, let's put these as a public highway.3 But they did not amend the grant under the4 1875 Act or alter the amended grant.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you explain to6 me something to me about that 1875 Act a little bit? We7 know that until 1871, these railroad rights­of­way were8 considered to leave the government in the position of9 having a reversionary interest.10 MR. LECHNER: Correct.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I don't see anything12 in the 1875 Act statute. There was an end to the giving13 away of large ­­ large quantities of land to the14 railroad, and so that was out. But what is there in15 the 1875 Act that changes the right­of­way from what it16 had been up until 1871?17 MR. LECHNER: As the government argued in18 Great Northern and as this Court adopted that argument,19 the key provision in the 1875 Act is Section 4, which20 reserved the right to Congress to dispose of the lands21 underlying 1875 rights­of­way to settlers.22 And this was a reflection of the change of23 policy in 1871 because that's where the Congress changed24 its policy to ­­ in an effort to secure homesteads to25 actual settlers as opposed to benefiting the railroads.11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 In Section 4, as this Court said in Great2 Northern, after language to demonstrate a conveyance of3 an easement would be hard to find.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the railroad wasn't5 benefited by the end of the 1871 understanding of the6 right­of­way. The one that was benefited was the7 government. The government got ­­ got back the land, so8 it's not ­­ we're not ­­ was going to stop giving land9 to the railroad, yes, but the beneficiary that is losing10 out under your interpretation is the government.11 MR. LECHNER: But it's ­­ it's not only my12 interpretation, it's the interpretation of the Court in13 Great Northern that it was an easement. And this Court14 was not ­­ this Court in Great Northern knew the15 difference of the word "easement" and knew what the16 significance of using that term would mean. So did the17 government at the time.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY:19 points along the right­of­way20 a station or a wider area for21 And it ­­ it usually could receive those by simply22 filing a patent if it was within a permitted zone, if it23 was within ­­ if they were 20 miles equidistant or24 something like that.25 How did they get those additional lands?12Alderson Reporting CompanyThere were ­­ there werewhere the railroad neededwater towers and so forth.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. LECHNER: The station ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: One way they could do them was to condemn them, but absent condemnation, could they just receive them from the government?MR. LECHNER: Well, under ­­ under the 1875 Act, yes, Congress did provide for station grounds. The railroad could secure station grounds by filing a map of the station grounds with the local land office, and once the secretary approved, then they would acquire the station grounds.      But the nature of the grant that theyrequired on the station grounds is the same as for theright­of­way, and that's merely an easement.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh. So it's ­­ so it was clear at the time of the grant that it was on the ­­ that what was granted was co­extensive with what the right­of­way was, with the railroad right­of­way.MR. LECHNER: Yes. And that was how the Department of Interior originally interpreted it in 1888, as the ­­ the railroad didn't get a fee in anything, it got a right­of­way ­­ it got an easement in the railroad ­­ in the right­of­way and in the station grounds.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any instances in which the railroad can keep its station even if it13Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 abandons the right­of­way? Or does the station fall2 with the ­­ when the right­of­way is abandoned?3 MR. LECHNER: I think the right ­­ the4 station grounds are tied to the right­of­way. So if you5 abandon the right­of­way, the station grounds would also6 be extinguished and unburden the underlying fee.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you again about8 Section 912? Your patent says that it is subject to9 those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted10 to the railway company in particular, and its successors11 and assigns.12 Now, that was ­­ that patent came after the13 enactment of 912, and 912 clarifies the rights of ­­ or14 changes the rights of railroad companies and says that15 if they abandon property, within one year after that,16 they ­­ there can be a public highway established on17 that ­­ on that property. So why wasn't your patent18 subject to that?19 MR. LECHNER: Well ­­ well, first, I20 don't ­­ 912 did not change the grant to the railroad.21 912 applies if the government has any remaining interest22 in the right­of­way.23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you didn't get your24 property from the railroad. You got it from the25 government.14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. LECHNER: Correct.2 JUSTICE ALITO: You got a patent from the3 government. So the question is: What were they4 conveying to you? And if you read the patent in5 connection with 912, isn't it clear they're conveying to6 you every ­­ arguably everything other than this right7 to have a public highway established on that land when8 it was abandoned by the railroad?9 MR. LECHNER: They were conveying it subject10 to those rights for railroad purposes is the specific11 language. And but 912 does not create a reservation; it12 doesn't create a right of reverter. It was simply to13 deal with what they were going to do with these strips14 of land upon abandonment.15 Because at the time, that's when abandonment16 of the railroads first began, Congress was worried we17 were going to have these isolated strips. It didn't18 change the 1875 Act, it didn't change the previously19 granted rights­of­way to expand the scope of them.20 But when they were abandoned and they came21 back under the law at the time that the government had22 the implied condition of reverter, they came back. The23 government said, okay, well, if you want to establish a24 public highway, that's fine, otherwise, it's going to25 go ­­ it's going to inure to the benefit of the settler.15Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      But it didn't change the nature of thegrant.  It didn't change the 1875 Act.  It didn't createit.  It did not create an interest that wasn't therebefore.  It was just how to deal with the interest thatthe ­­ that Congress thought it had after this Court'sdecision in Townsend and Stringham.JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand it. You say this was purely an easement. All right. So that means that when there's an abandonment, the government has complete title to the property, right? They convey that property to you, but before they do that, they say that there's this reservation of rights with respect to the establishment of a highway.MR. LECHNER: I'm ­­ I'm ­­ one ­­ well, I'm ­­ I'm troubled. Under ­­ under your hypothetical, the government still owns the underlying land when the railroad's abandoned? So when the railroad is abandoned, the two estates merge. There was one.JUSTICE ALITO: That's your argument, isn't it?MR. LECHNER: Well, I think that's the argument under ­­ under the common law, too, is ­­ is what ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Okay. And may be ­­MR. LECHNER:So they ­­ they merge.16Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO:MR. LECHNER:JUSTICE ALITO:JUSTICE BREYER:  It may be a good argument.They merge.  But that's your argument.   Now, what about when 912says that when the railroad abandons a piece of theright­of­way, okay, it then says that the interest ofthe United States, with all right, title, and interestin the state of the United States shall be vested in thetown that builds the highway.      But your point is, that's true, but wherethey previously ­­ where they have previous ­­ wherethey have given ­­ where they conveyed it to a privateperson, they didn't have any right, title, and interest,because on abandonment it was simply an easement.  Andon abandonment, that goes to the property owner who ownsthe ­­ the land on either side.      Is that ­­ I mean, your point is that theUnited States didn't haveon the abandonment unlessown the property.MR.

Can I assign that easement to another person so that the person who buys my home can now walk through your backyard?MR. LECHNER: In certain circumstances, yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's wrong with the concept that when this land was given to you as a railroad right­of­way, when it's abandoned, that the railroad, in essence, under 1912, and under the 1922 Act, that you are giving that easement to the U.S. to use as a right­of­way?      And so, whether it's a trail or a highway orany of the other items that are specified in the statutethat that easement is continuing to be used by theperson who gave it, which was originally the U.S. Yourpatent was given subject to that easement, to thatright­of­way.MR.

Sorry.78.    And what do you want us to                          Well, there was a questionabout whether that was actually the language, was itsubject to those rights.  The last full paragraph,"subject to those rights for railroad purposes have beengranted to the railroad under the 1875 Act."JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The 1875 Act, what was given to the railroad was a right­of­way.MR. LECHNER: A right to lay their tracks and a right of passage.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just as I'm seeing the 1875 grant, it was the right­of­way through public lands.MR. LECHNER: Well, yes, and as the19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 government argued in Great Northern that that was ­­2 that right in the 1875 Act was a right to lay tracks and3 it was a right of passage, an easement.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Lechner, I know Great Northern said so 5   and that is surely very strong support for your6 view. But why did Great Northern think that there was a7 difference between pre­1871 grants and post?8 MR. LECHNER: First, the shift in Congress's9 policy. And the railroads fell out of disfavor and10 Congress passed resolution saying ­­ you know, we want11 to hold on to these lands to secure homesteads for12 actual settlers.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, I guess I had thought if you14 were just dealing with this as a matter of first15 impression that the shift in Congress's policy was a16 shift about whether to give away ­­ you know, huge17 swaths of land to the railroads, and that Congress18 indeed decided, enough of this, we are not going to give19 these checkerboard grants of land to the railroad,20 because they are making a mint from this, and we would21 rather give it to homesteaders.22 But there was ­­ I don't see any evidence23 that there was any shift in policy or any reason why24 there would be a shift in policy, as to what the rights25 of way were. Whether they were easements or whether20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 they were limited fees.2 MR. LECHNER: Well, Section 4 has a lot to3 do with that, and that is where Congress reserved the4 right to dispose of the underlying lands to the5 settlers. That provision is not found in the pre­18716 railroad grants, and this Court in Great Northern looked7 at that and you say, you got to look at Section 4, that8 provides light on how to interpret the right­of­way9 grant in Section 1.10 And because of Congress's intent and the11 legislative history surrounding similar language when12 Congress passed it in 1872, they called it the13 right­of­way is merely going to be an encumbrance.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess ­­ you know, again,15 if you were just looking at this as a matter of first16 impression, the language of Section 4 does not seem to17 me to be very indicative of anything. You know, it says18 "subject to the right­of­way." Subject to the19 right­of­way. Whatever the right­of­way is. Subject to20 the right­of­way if it's an easement. Subject to the21 right­of­way if it's a limited fee. Doesn't seem to22 pick one or the other.23 MR. LECHNER: But as the government argued24 in Great Northern, it would be silly to patent the25 underlying lands subject to a fee. I mean, there would21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 be no reason for that language at all if the railroad2 got a fee. And then you patented the ­­ in effect it3 would be the adjacent land, not the underlying land.4 There would be no reason to say that the adjacent land5 is subject to a fee because with the limited fees, they6 were envisioning those things going to the center of the7 earth.8 So you would be patenting the adjacent land.9 But under Section 4 and as Great Northern interpreted,10 the patents go to the underlying land and that's what11 happened in this case, because Brandt owns the12 underlying land and minerals.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in your answer it14 seemed to me, and maybe you have to do this to proffer, that you15 confused limited fee with fee simple ,with absolute fee.16 Now, obviously that's true if it's the same owner, they17 merge.18 MR. LECHNER: Well, I was using limited fee19 in the context as this Court used it in Townsend,20 limited fee with the implied condition of reverter. I21 mean, even in Townsend 1903, the railroad got it all,22 but it was subject to implied condition of reverter if23 they stopped using it for railroad purpose. But they24 did give fee simple absolute to the center of the earth25 is how it was construed at that time.22Alderson Reporting Company16 what the government says.17 telling us?18 MR. LECHNER:19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, is that what you areI'm saying ­­   The Interior says one thing20 and the Justice Department here says something else? I21 mean, we have a president who reconciles these two22 things. He must agree with one or the other.23 MR. LECHNER: Well, I think, under this24 Court's precedent, you defer to the agency in charge of25 administering the 1875 Act, and that is the DepartmentOfficial￼1 So that sheds light on the fact that Section2 4 reflects that only an easement was granted because you3 would not need to have Subject 2 language at all if you4 were just patenting the adjacent lands.5 It is also well established that the Department of Interior’s6 interpretation of public land laws such as the 1875 Act is7 entitled to great deference. This is because public8 land laws provide for the acquisition of the title,9 which must be secure. Beginning in 1888 and10 continuing through today, the Department of Interior11 still construes the 1875 Act as easements and they can12 still construe 1875 Act rights of way as different from13 pre­1871.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how that15 can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of Interior.consistentlyas easementssubstantial deference.  And the Department of Interior hasinterpreted these as ­­ these rights of wayand that interpretation is entitled toJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure the government will have an explanation as to why we shouldn't.MR.

YANGON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:     The statute, its legislative history, thesurrounding statutory context which includes Section 912as well as 1906 and 1909 Acts and this Court's decisionsconstruing the 1875 Act including Section 4 whichpredated Great Northern show that the United Statesretains the reversionary interest in the surface of theland of right­of­ways granted to railroads ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Yang, I have to say I think the government gets a prize for understatement with its brief in this case. You have a sentence in24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 your brief that says, "We acknowledge that there is2 language in this Court's opinion in Great Northern and3 in the government's brief in that case that lends some4 support to petitioner's contrary argument."5 Here are the subject headings of the6 government's brief in Great Northern. "The right­of­way7 granted by the Act of March 3, 1875, is in the nature of8 an easement. The language of the 1875 Act shows that9 only an easement was granted. The legislative10 background and history of the 1875 Act show that the11 grant was of an easement rather than a fee.12 Subsequent administrative and congressional13 construction confirm that only an easement was granted."14 And the first sentence of the summary of the15 argument ­­16 MR. YANG: There is also other portions of17 the brief. I would refer the Court, for instance, to18 Footnote 4 where the government said there would be a19 separate question raised about whether a patent holder20 subsequently who obtains the patent after the grant of21 right­of­way would take this government interest. And22 the Court ­­ the government said in fact that would23 raise different questions.24 The Court recognized that on pages ­­ the25 last two pages of its opinion, it specifically limited25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 its judgment to situations where the government retained2 interest in the entire surrounding parcel and, in fact,3 modified the judgment below which enjoined the railroad4 from oil drilling simply to apply to that.5 Not only that, the Court was writing on ­­6 the government didn't cite, for instance ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait. Before you go,8 you really think the Court was saying, It will be an9 easement when that suits the government, but it will be10 something else when that suits the government?11 MR. YANG: No, I think what the Court was ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's either an13 easement or it's not an easement. You really think14 the ­­ the opinion meant to reserve the question whether15 it was an easement.16 MR. YANG: I do with respect to the issue17 that we have here. The question before the Court was18 whether the right­of­way, which is a statutory term,19 Congress could have used "easement"; it could have used20 "fee." It did not. It uses a special statutory term21 which has accumulated meaning over time, particularly,22 in the railroad context.23 And in that context, the Court was deciding24 whether it was in the nature of an easement, which as25 our subject heading said, it's in the nature of an26Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE ALITO:JUSTICE BREYER:JUSTICE ALITO:That may be. All right.Official￼1 easement. But that's vis­à­vis the United States ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER: I got that point.3 MR. YANG: ­­ with respect to the mineral4 lands. And, in fact, the shift that, Justice Kagan, you5 were talking about is a shift about subsidies. It was a6 shift of subsidy away from these lavish land grants.7 And when Congress was stopping that ­­ that lavish grant8 to railroads, it made no sense to construe the act with9 respect to the mineral rights, which the Court said10 were11 when12 13­­ were mineral riches. Why would Congress do that it was cutting back on ­­1415 well­known term with an established meaning. And you're16 saying that ­­ you said it was an easement. The Court17 said it was an easement. You ­­ you persuaded the Court18 to say it was an easement. And now you're saying this19 is some kind of property right that has no name,20 previously unknown to the law.21 MR. YANG: It's a right­of­way. And, in22 fact, the government's brief also said that with23 respect ­­ and I'm quoting from page 9 ­­ with respect24 to the surface ­­ the control ­­ under any of the25 theories, even under the easement theory, which I don't27Alderson Reporting CompanyBut the term "easement" is a5 attributes of a fee,6 perpetual occupation7 JUSTICE BREYER:8 this way.and those included exclusive andand remedies ­­         All right.  Let me put itOfficial￼1 believe is a true common law easement, the railroad's2 control of the surface was complete. And then we went3 on further ­­ and this is on pages 36 to 37 ­­ that said4 it was a fact that the right­of­way has some of the9 MR. YANG:10 rewrite our brief, we would certainly do so much more11 carefully now. But I think that the way that you read12 the brief is the way that you read opinions, which is in13 the context in which it was decided, particularly14 because Footnote 4, and this Court's opinion responding15 to Footnote 4, made clear that they were only addressing16 mineral rights where the United States held the17 surrounding parcel.18 And ­­ and that's particularly true because19 this Court had already construed Section 4 of the 187520 Act before Great Northern in Stalker and in Steinke.21 And in Stalker, the Court held that the subject to ­­22 this is on page 154 ­­ a patent was subject to the23 railroad rights acquired by approval. That's the24 approval in Section 4, in the subject to language in25 Section 4.28And so, again, if we were toAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 "Upon approval, the grounds so selected were2 segregated from the public lands and the required3 material to withdraw the land granted from the market."4 And then the Court goes on, and this is on page 1545 again, "The later patent," the patent issued to a6 settler. Even though the local land office forgot to or7 omitted to mark the right­of­way on the land plats, the8 subsequent patent was inoperative to pass title to those9 later patentholders.10 And then in Steinke ­­ this is 1922 ­­ the11 Court followed Stalker and said, "The approved map under12 Section 4 is the equivalent of a patent." And then they13 go on to say, citing Stalker, that the later patent was14 inoperative to pass title.15 And I think it's important, in both of those16 cases, the Court cited to Interior's regulations. In17 Stalker, the Court quoted at length the regulations from18 1888, which, although the Court suggested that in Great19 Northern those were the first regulations, they actually20 weren't.21 There were prior regulations in 1878 which22 discuss nothing about the nature of the fee. And those,23 unfortunately, are hard to find. They are in Senate24 Executive Document 30, 45th Congress, Third Session,25 1879.29Alderson Reporting Company7 say that there are8 of people in their9 MR. YANG:thousands or even tens of thousands position. Do you dispute that?We don't have good numbers,Official￼1 So ­­ but the regs that the Petitioners now2 rely on were specifically referenced by the Court,3 including the regs that say the disposition of the land4 surrounding the right­of­way is subject to the5 right­of­way.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, the Petitioners10 actually, on that.11 JUSTICE BREYER: But what are the numbers?12 I mean, look, this is what I'm thinking. This is13 property law. It's not just a question of trying to14 work out what the case could or couldn't have stood for.15 If I try to remember my property class, it vaguely16 was ­­ which was a great class, A. James Casner, real17 expert.18 And he ­­ he, I think, said that when you19 convey subject of divestment, the ­­ something called20 season under the common law went to the recipient of the21 conveyance.22 But if you conveyed an easement, season did23 not pass. So in holding that it is an easement, you're24 holding there was no season, and therefore, it couldn't25 be a divestiture.30Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Now, whether that's true or not or I've2 misremembered it, I'd go back to Justice Scalia's3 question. Is there a single example since the Domesday4 Book, since Dadonis, since the Bracton, on little to5 whatever it was, I mean, in the history of the common6 law up to the present, where a court has interpreted an7 ambiguous phrase, which doesn't say to grant an easement8 for one purpose, but not for the other.

Multiple agencies have been consulted and we've39Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 been trying to come to grips with the Court's2 conflicting ­­ you know, language.3 If you take language in the abstract and you4 divorce it from the context of the case, the Court's5 decisions are conflicting, but when you look at the6 context of the case, you look at Great Northern with7 respect to saying that the subsurface interests, the8 mineral interests are like an easement with respect to9 the United States vis­à­vis the railroad, but then you10 have Stalker and Steinke saying that when under Section11 4 of the Act ­­ it's an authoritative construction of12 Section 4 of the Act. When you approve a map of a13 railroad under Section 4, it is tantamount to a patent14 and thereafter a subsequent patent does not confer an15 interest on the patentee.16 Those cases are reconciled, we think, by17 acknowledging that Stalker and Steinke control at least18 with respect to the surface interests, and then with19 respect to the subsurface interests, Great Northern20 clearly says that, at least vis­à­vis the United States21 and the railroad where there is no third­parties22 involved that is deemed to be like an easement that23 would not give a subsurface interest. And there is real24 important reasons to distinguish between the subsurface25 and the surface with respect to rights of way.40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Surface for the right of way is what's2 important. It's critical. You need to have an artery3 that connects various parcels of land. That was true4 back when 1875 was enacted and it's true now with5 respect to highways and other uses that the government6 might put its land to.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: The patent here, Mr. Yang,8 which was, what, in the mid­1970s did not reserve9 anything. The government just made an uncritical grant10 to the grant family?11 MR. YANG: And that was true both in Stalker12 and in Steinke with respect to the subsequent patents.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I'm just suggesting14 that after Great Northern and then you're given this15 patent, which is unequivocal and does not reserve16 anything, why anybody would think that they hadn’t17 gotten the whole ball of wax is a mystery.18 MR. YANG: Well, I think you would have19 to ­­ I think if you had a good lawyer, the good lawyer20 would say, Look, we've got ­­ there is uncertainty here.21 You've got Stalker and Steinke, which says you get no22 interest. You have Great Northern, which doesn't23 address interest that pass to third parties.24 It only addresses the interest that the25 railroad has, and it says there is no mineral rights.41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And then you have Congress in 1906, 1909, 1922, and more2 recently in 1988, doubling down and saying ­­ you know,3 the United States' interest goes to roads first.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: It seems to me a fair5 reading of the history here, Mr. Yang, is that it really6 didn't occur to the government until very recently that7 these rights of way had value as anything other than8 railroad tracks, and indeed that the government was9 anxiously trying to give these things away because it10 thought that these spaghetti strips of land, it's of no11 use to the government, here, take them, get them off our12 hands.13 And having done that for many, many, many14 decades, the government faces a problem when it turns15 around and says, you know what, we forgot, there are16 bike paths.17 MR. YANG: I don't think that's quite18 accurate. At least since 1922, the government has19 disposed of ­­ or Congress, I should say, has directed20 the government to dispose of its reversionary interests21 first to roads, and that remains true today. And then22 also from 1922 until 1988, it was supposed to go to any23 municipality, any land within a municipality goes to the24 municipality; and then third, it would go to any land25 owner of the surrounding parcel that was paying the42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 interest subject to the right of way.2 Now, of course ­­ you know, Congress is free3 to choose to change its decision about how to dispose of4 U.S. Government interests to any government property.5 There is no vested interest in that. And I think what6 we are trying to say in our brief is that petitioner7 asks the Court essentially to nullify a significant ­­8 significant enactments by Congress.

It's23 history. And it's early administrative interpretation.24 We therefore do not regard this earlier case as25 controlling.43Alderson Reporting Company5 JUSTICE BREYER:6 in the Stringer case.7 MR.

We told the Court that Townsend was dictum. In3 Townsend, the dispute was by a railroad who got a decree4 from a State court saying it had the right of way.10 MR. YANG:11 we are relying on Stalker and Steinke, which are 187512 Act holdings. It's this Court construing the very13 statute that we're talking about, Section 4, which is14 the very section that the petitioner ­­ now, it would be15 kind of remarkable to read language in Great Northern16 which addressed a different question in which the17 government specifically reserved the question of what18 interest would transfer to a patentee.19 The Court specifically limited its decision20 so it wouldn't reach that issue. And then it sub21 silentio overruled two decisions by this Court on the22 very statute decided 30 years earlier when the Court was23 closer to the 1875 Act? That would be a pretty24 remarkable thing, I think. And what we're saying is25 that, no, Stalker and Steinke remain good law, even if44No, no, we are not relying on ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 you characterize the right of way as having attributes2 of an easement because it's clear it can't be a common3 law easement.4I don't think that even ­­ petitioner may beto dispute this ­­ but a common law easement, asCourt has explained, would not give as5 able6 this7 traditionally framed exclusive and perpetual occupation8 to the railroad. It would not give the remedy of the9 fee. All those are very practical, real rights that10 would have to be conferred that would be greater than a11 mere common law easement. And that's true back in 1871,12 and it's true in 1875, and we said it was true in our13 brief to this Court.14 We said as an easement ­­ you know, the fact15 that it has some of the attributes of a fee, including16 exclusive or perpetual occupation and the remedies of a17 fee and not an easement, doesn't take it out of the box18 of what we were talking about in that case.19 And so, again, I think you need to read it20 in context. I agree that if you just take Great21 Northern and look at it without peeling back the hood a22 little bit, there's language that ­­ you know, would23 lead ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's ­­ that's basically25 my problem. I guess you just don't have any specific45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 things of what property lawyers were saying. But those2 two cases are from the era of Stringer, and at that3 point, apparently, the Court thought it was a limited4 fee.567 were 8911 MR. YANG: But Justice Breyer, I think it's12 a mistake to rely on these labels of limited fee and13 easement too strongly. That's what this Court's14 basically said in Union Pacific in 1957. In Union15 Pacific, the Court said look, these pre­1871 cases use16 the term "limited fee," but really, we're not going to17 deem that to be controlling with respect to the mineral18 rights.19 And the Court is doing exactly what we're20 saying should be done here, which is you understand the21 right­of­way in the context of the statutory text, in22 the context of the environment, the surrounding23 statutory environment in the context of this Court's24 decisions, and it's not a binary black­or­white choice25 between ­­ you know, common law terms.46MR. YANG: One was before ­­JUSTICE BREYER: And then you get ­­ they all ­­ was any of them after Great Northern?MR. YANG: No, not after Great Northern.                         So ­­ so then in GreatJUSTICE BREYER:10 Northern it comes along?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Congress didn't use those common law terms.2 Congress used the term "right­of­way." It used the same3 text that it did in prior grants of rights­of­way. And4 all we're trying to say is that there are real important5 interests here. It's not practically feasible to ever6 reconstruct these arteries through the lands. And they7 were important when Congress granted them to develop the8 lands in 1875, and they remain important today, as9 Congress has now repeatedly recognized in terms of10 granting public roads. So ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO: Do we know how many miles of12 public roads and how many miles of bike trails have13 been ­­ you don't know that either?14 MR. YANG: On bike trails, this is ­­ this15 is not a Rails­to­Trails Act case. There are different16 issues there.17 know, it's ­­18 trail that in19 interest through the national forests as well as through20 this parcel for like a 22­mile trail.

YANG:question the legality of the land transfers. And I'm sure that could be something that could be litigated. There would be issues ­­ I'm sure defenses raised by the States and municipalities.     But what the Court would be saying is thatfor ­­ since 1922, and this policy continues now, thatthe highways that have been created under 1875 Act wouldbe invalid.JUSTICE BREYER: Can you think of anything I can do about this? It's a case, in my mind at least, where reliance interests on ­­ on a previous case in the property law area are important, and yet none of the briefs here really gives me a ­­ a reasonably concrete idea of how much reliance there has been. And ­­ and ­­  I mean, if we rule for the Brandts,going to be highways that can noanymore?It certainly would call intoAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 because again, these are kind of ad hoc things. When2 there's an abandonment, there might be proceedings, but3 there's been ­­ we've not been able to obtain4 centralized, reliable information on the total number,5 because this goes back a pretty long way. We're talking6 about, again, starting in 1922, you know. This has been7 unchallenged until we got two district court decisions8 in '80 ­­ in the mid '80s with respect to the surface.9 Now, on ­­ on the subsurface, Great Northern10 has ­­ you know, continued to be applied by Interior and11 that's been treated differently. And I think it's12 important also to remember that the regulations, not13 only were they cited by this Court in Stalker and14 Steinke, the Court was clearly aware of the regulations.15 In 1931, the ­­ a case called Otis Birch16 where Interior basically followed Stalker and recognized17 that you could not pass title. Now, that was a Mineral18 Act case, and the Court also ­­ Interior also said that19 because you can't separate the estates, or there's no20 reason to separate the surface from the subsurface, the21 mineral couldn't be transferred, either. That's been22 overtaken by events.23 It's important to recognize in '31, and when24 the regs were codified in the CFR in '38, which are the25 1909 regs, which had never been changed or revisited on49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the nature of the interests, they simply just carried2 forward, even though Interior recognized that the ­­3 there would be no interest given to patentees of the4 land after a right­of­way is granted under Section 4 of5 the Act.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:7 don't have records on this,8 unusual that the government9 is that for decades, you didn't think that you owned a10 reversionary interest.11 MR. YANG: Well, for decades, we thought we12 owned a reversionary interest. It's just that ­­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't have14 any records on where these things are.15 MR. YANG: Well, but Congress told us ­­16 told everyone how to dispose of it. It went to streets,17 roads, highways, then to municipalities, and if then not18 municipalities, it would go to the landowner. So the19 United States ­­ you know, disposed of its reversionary20 interests through statute. It wasn't until 1988 that21 the policy changed to ­­ to prioritize highways and then22 the U.S.'s interests after that.23 So it's understandable why we haven't been24 intimately involved with all these forfeitures that have25 occurred over time. Congress directed how the United50Alderson Reporting Company         Maybe the reason youwhich strikes me as prettydoesn't know what it owns,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425States interests should be disposed of.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would ­­ what wouldbe the exposure of the United States if we ­­ if you lose­­are there takings claims now?MR.

MR. YANG: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Lechner, youhave 4 minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. LECHNER: We do know how many acres areinvolved in this case, and the government is claiming 10of the 83 acres that it patented to Marvin Brandt'sparents.As this Court has noted, stare decisisconcerns are ­­ in many cases involving property rights. With respect to Stalker and Steinke, those were pre­Great Northern; those were limited fee cases. At most, they stand for first in time, first in right.Steinke was written by Justice Van Devanterwho also wrote Stringham, which Great Northern overturned. And that's why Stalker and Steinke fell out of use over the years. And if Stalker and Steinke were so important, the government should have brought those cases to the Court's attention in Great Northern, but it didn't.     With respect to the 1931 land decision the53Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 government just brought up, I ­­ I refer the Court to2 solicitor's opinion ­­3 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess it would be the4 private parties that would have brought it up in Great5 Northern, wouldn't it?6 And do you have any light to shed on the7 comparative amounts? I mean, they're saying ­­ for all8 we know there are billions of dollars worth of takings9 claims that will come out where the highways run, and10 you're arguing, of course, any reasonable property11 lawyer would have relied on Great Northern to think it12 was just conveying an easement.13 But ­­ you know, I'm not a property lawyer,14 and so what actually happened matters. And the amounts15 matter, at least to me. And do you have any light to16 shed?17 MR. LECHNER: I don't have any light to shed18 on the actual mileage. We know it's thousands. We know19 that ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: What about on your side?21 What about the possibility that millions of acres has22 been conveyed and there are tens of thousands or23 hundreds of thousands of abandoned railroads that24 property lawyers thought went to the person who bought25 them, and run through somebody's house? I mean, is that54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 a figment of my imagination?2 MR. LECHNER: No.3 JUSTICE BREYER: And you would say no, it4 isn't, and therefore I'm asking you is there any5 empirical support anywhere for how property lawyers have6 treated Great Northern, how much was conveyed,7 et cetera? Anything you can say on that would be8 helpful.9 MR. LECHNER: I have nothing to say about10 the quantity, but I know that with S.C. ­­ the Seventh11 Circuit ruled in S.C. Johnson that the title insurance12 thought that was a landmark decision because it resolved13 a lot of problems with the title insurance industry.14 Each mile of the right­of­way takes up15 24 acres. At one point there were 270,000, as this16 Court noted in Preseault, there was 270,000 miles of17 roads at the peak in the early 1920s and about 130 of18 those had been abandoned by the time of the Preseault19 decision.20 I want to also address the forfeiture21 provision that they mention and Great Northern relied on22 Section 43, 940, to confirm its conclusion that the S23 and D, these are easements because 43 U.S.C. 940 calls24 them an easement. And with respect to land that the25 government still owned at the time of abandonment, they55Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425said that the government's land would be discharged ofthe easements.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any doctrine in property law that if a right of access is granted and its to the exclusion of all other uses, it's ­­ it looks for all purposes like absolute control, that it ceases to be an easement and becomes a limited fee?     I mean, is there some magic that takes placein property law so that if there's a grant that conveyssuch total control, that it construed not to be aneasement?     MR.
