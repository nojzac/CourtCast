Andre Brigham101112131415161718    statute.19              It also is important because this same threshold20    inquiry applies to many kinds of statutes, not justthe Court:          This case presents a narrow but important issue,and it concerns how this Court determines the thresholdquestion of whether a statute is civil or criminal.  Thisthreshold inquiry is important because it establishes whatconstitutional rules apply to a statute and that thestatute must satisfy, and also what constitutionalprotections are available to people who are subject to the21    statutes such as Washington's, providing for the22    commitment of sexually violent predators.  It applies to23    numerous statutes, including others that deal with24    confinement such as more generalized civil commitment25    laws, commitments for drug or alcohol treatment, statutes3 1    such as quarantine statutes, and statutes relating to 2    pretrial detention. 3              In this case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the 4    principle that whether a law is civil or criminal is a 5    threshold question based on legislative intent and the 6    face of the statute.  Instead, the Ninth Circuit held that 7    Washington's admittedly civil law may be divested of its 8    civil nature and converted into a criminal law if 9    conditions of confinement at Washington's Special10    Commitment Center are punitive.11              In other words, the Ninth Circuit held that the12    fundamental nature of a law as either civil or criminal13    may vary and that the same statute may be both civil and14    criminal at different times and in different places.15              The Ninth Circuit's decision is fundamentally16    wrong.  It conflicts with the holding of this Court in17    Hudson v. United States.  It doesn't serve --18              QUESTION:  Ms. Hart, I suppose you could have a19    situation where on habeas some prisoner, some person being20    held under a statutory scheme of this type could come in21    and say, on Federal habeas, I'm being held under22    circumstances that violate the Constitution, and make an23    individual challenge, isn't that so?24              MS. HART:  I think that in habeas an individual25    who's subject to confinement could come in and the purpose41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9of habeas would be for that person to indicate that forsome constitutional reason the very fact or duration ofhis or her confinement violates the Constitution.          QUESTION:  Right.  Is that what this person isdoing, or is there something different?          MS. HART:  No, Your Honor.  In fact, I thinkthat what Mr. Young has here essentially is a civil rightsclaim that the conditions of confinement at the SpecialCommitment Center are not what they ought to be.          QUESTION:  Now, there is an ongoing 1983 classaction, is there, covering this very facility?          MS. HART:  Yes, there is, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And under that action, presumablythis respondent would be affected by the outcome of that?          MS. HART:  I believe that's correct.  TheSpecial Commitment Center is under the supervision of theFederal District Court in Washington at the moment.  Thatparticular case basically deals with issues of whetherthere's adequate treatment at the Special Commitment1011121314151617181920    Center.2122 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Why is that a constitutional claim?I mean, what constitutional claim does he have other thanthe double jeopardy claim?          MS. HART:  In this case, Your Honor?          QUESTION:  Ex post facto.51 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Or ex post facto.          QUESTION:  Both.  Both.          MS. HART:  He would have each of those claims,and in this case, provided he -- that our statute ispunitive --          QUESTION:  No, no, but I mean, assuming thestatute is not punitive, does he have any otherconstitutional relief for the fact that he is not gettingthe treatment which the statute provides he's supposed tobe given?  Is that a constitutional claim, or just a Statelaw claim?          MS. HART:  He would have, certainly underWashington statute, a State law claim in the sense --          QUESTION:  Correct.          MS. HART:  -- that the statute requires adequatetreatment and --          QUESTION:  Right, but what other Federalconstitutional claim would he have?          MS. HART:  The only Federal constitutional claimthat I believe might otherwise be involved here would be aclaim that goes to conditions of confinement on some sortof --not --QUESTION:  Cruel and unusual punishment?  He'sMS. HART:  No, not with respect to any issues                   61 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that would flow from the criminal law, Your Honor.  Thereare -- certain decisions of this Court will not preciselyreach an issue that I read to suggest that individuals whoare deprived of their liberty are entitled to certainminimal adequate conditions of confinement as perhaps amatter of substantive due process.          QUESTION:  And is that the basis for the -- isit the Turay suit?  There is a pending 1983 case, so wedon't have to speculate, at least, about the basis of thatlawsuit.  What is the constitutional right that's invokedin that litigation?          MS. HART:  In the litigation that's ongoingcurrently --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MS. HART:  -- Justice Ginsburg, the right thatis being invoked is essentially a right that one mightfind derivative from your decision in Youngberg, and thatis a right to a certain level of mental health treatment.          QUESTION:  Well, in effect the claim is that ifyou commit me for treatment, you've got to treat me.  I'vegot a substantive due process right to that effect --          MS. HART:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- if I am treatable.  But that's thekernel of it, isn't it?          MS. HART:  That's the essence of the claim, Your                             71 Honor. 2              QUESTION:  Well, Youngberg certainly didn't go3 that far. 4              MS. HART:  It didn't, Your Honor, but I believe 5    that that's where the genesis of the claim in this case, 6    and as I say, there's certain language in Youngberg that 7    would perhaps lead one in that particular direction. 8              QUESTION:  But turning to this case, when at the 9    outset a determination is made for an order for a civil10    commitment, is there no basis for the court to determine11    and to look at how the disease is defined, how the12    treatment is defined, what treatment facilities are13    available in order to determine whether or not it's14 punitive?15              MS. HART:  Your Honor --16              QUESTION:  Isn't there some initial assessment17    that must be made?18              MS. HART:  No, Your Honor.  This Court has, for19    purposes of civil commitment has required two predicates.20    One is a mental condition, and the other is an existing21    dangerousness.22              Once that civil commitment is affected, however,23    Your Honor, there are certain claims that can be made and24    are being made in the State of Washington that the25    individual subject to that commitment is entitled to8 1    adequate care and an adequate level of treatment, but that 2    doesn't go to -- the conditions of confinement, Your 3    Honor, wouldn't go to the face of the statute, or whether 4    the statute itself is punitive.  This Court -- 5              QUESTION:  Why is that?  I mean, suppose you 6    have a compulsive ax murderer, and you know, he's served 7    his time, but he's still a compulsive ax murderer.  You 8    could not commit him simply because he's dangerous and 9    then not provide treatment?10              Or what about quarantine of someone who has a11    communicable disease?  In order to quarantine, do you have12    to provide treatment?13              MS. HART:  Your Honor, I don't find an answer to14    those questions precisely in this Court's jurisprudence.15    It does seem to me that one of the things this Court has16    said, however, on a due process level, is that a17    statute -- if the State is going to claim that it's18    committing an individual for treatment, that's what its19    statutory purpose is, then the statute ought to relate to20    that in terms of the nature of the confinement and the21    duration of the confinement.22              QUESTION:  Does this statute make that23    representation, that it's confining him for treatment, or24    does it simply talk about the abnormality, mental25    abnormality?91234    purposes.5              QUESTION:  Suppose that he makes out his claim.6    Suppose he proves what he's trying to prove.  Suppose he7    proves that there's virtually no treatment for people who8    could benefit by it, that it's virtually impossible to be9    released to half-way houses even though certain medical          MS. HART:  Your Honor, this statute confines fortreatment and in order to protect the community from theseindividuals, so it's -- statutorily it serves both10    people would say he was safe enough for that.11              He proves that it's being run by prison12    officials for the most part, and not by mental health13    officials, and that really there isn't much segregation14    from the general prison population, and they don't seem to15    have the status of ordinary mentally ill people confined16    for civil purposes.  Assume he proves that, would that17    then violate the statute?18              MS. HART:  That would be inconsistent with19    Washington's statute.20              QUESTION:  So it would violate the statute.  So21    you've read his claims, and you're saying that if he22    proves what he says he's going to prove, then the23    conditions violate Washington's statute.24              MS. HART:  Washington's statute specifically25    requires that individuals --101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yes,  but I'd like a yes or no answerto my question.          MS. HART:  I believe my answer to the question,as I understand it, Justice Breyer, is yes.          QUESTION:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  That wouldn't afford a basis for anyFederal relief, I take it, if it's simply a claim that theconfinement violates the Washington statute.          MS. HART:  No, Your Honor, that would not.  Oneof the things about this statute is that Mr. Young andothers like him have a remedy under State law, and thatremedy, because of the way our statute is read, is toensure and press litigation, as is being done inWashington, that the appropriate level of care andtreatment is being provided, but he -- but it --          QUESTION:  Well, if you can find for us a civilpurpose that clearly cannot be fulfilled, is that oneindex at least, or one indicator of an intent to punish?          MS. HART:  Well, Your Honor, this Court haspointed to a number of indicators, all of them determinedfacially under the Court's jurisprudence in Hudson, suchas whether there is a confinement in the first place, whatis the purpose, and whether the statute is rationallyrelated and fulfills that --          QUESTION:  So you read our precedents as saying                            11 1    our inquiry must be simply confined to a facial inquiry, 2    and not to the reality of what the treatment is or is3 going to be? 4              MS. HART:  Whether a statute is criminal or 5    civil -- civil, excuse me -- this Court has held is a 6    facial matter.  That's precisely what the Court held in 7    Hudson, and in doing so disavowed an approach that it had 8    taken in Helper that looked at the actual effects, but 9    -- or conditions of confinement would be the equivalent10 here.11              But Your Honor, that doesn't mean that people12    like Mr. Young are without a remedy, or that they are left13    unable to secure the --14              QUESTION:  May I put the question just a little15    differently?  Assume our first case holds that a statute16    is civil, a facial attack on the statute as being criminal17    authorization for double jeopardy and ex post facto18    violation, and we reject that by saying the statute on its19    face is a civil statute.20              Does that mean that every application of that21    statute that might subsequently be challenged would have22    to come up with the same answer?  In other words, is it23    conceivable that a statute which is valid in response to a24    facial attack could nevertheless be invalid as applied in25    particular cases?12 1              MS. HART:  I don't believe so, Your Honor, and I 2    believe that's essentially what this Court held in Hudson 3    when it overruled Helper. 4              QUESTION:  Wasn't there language -- perhaps it 5    was in Hendrix -- that the first question is, does the 6    legislature mean to enact a civil or criminal provision, 7    and then the second question is, is the scheme so punitive 8    in purpose or effect, and I emphasize or effect, as to 9    transform the civil remedy into criminal penalty?  What10    does that mean, yes, the legislature wants a civil11    statute, not a criminal statute, but it is so punitive in12    effect as to be transformed from civil to criminal?13              MS. HART:  Well, Your Honor, I believe two14    things about that.  First, that Hudson stands for the15    proposition and reaffirms the notion that the effects test16    for whether a statute is civil or criminal is a facial17    test, and having given you that answer, I believe that18    what the effects test, or what that language means, is19    what are the necessary consequences of the very statutory20    provisions that whether it's Congress or State legislature21    has provided.  That would be the effects.22              QUESTION:  Yes, but if the statute has been23    administered for some period of time before the24    adjudication, I take it that the experience under that25    administration may be considered in what we are calling a131    facial inquiry.23 Honor. 45    entirely?  I suppose you could take into account the6    administration in determining what the meaning of7    ambiguous provisions of the statute are.  That wouldn't be8    harmful, I suppose.  But you wouldn't say you could take9    into account the implementation to such a degree that youMS. HART:  I'm afraid I disagree with that, YourQUESTION:  Well, do you have to disagree10    would allow the implementation to contradict the very11    terms of the statute, which is what you're talking about12    here.13              MS. HART:  That's correct, Your Honor, and14    that's essentially the essence of the claim before the15    Court.1617181920212223242514QUESTION:  If that's --QUESTION:  You win if -- no, please.QUESTION:  Well, all right.  If that's so, Itake it -- and this is just an elaboration of what I askedyou before.          I don't know if you're familiar enough withHendrix to refer to it by page number, but at the end, onpage 368, the Court sums up the factors in the statutethat make it civil, and they include things, to bring itto your mind, the State's disavowed any punitive intent,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it's limited its confinement to a small segment, andparticularly -- there are procedural safeguards, they'resegregated, they have the same status as the other civillycommitted, recommended treatment is possible, et cetera.          Does that call to mind the paragraph that you'reprobably familiar with?          MS. HART:  Yes, it does.          QUESTION:  Okay.  Am I right in saying from yourprior answer that you think your statute meets all those?          MS. HART:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And that insofar as the facts in aparticular case don't meet them, they violate the statute.          MS. HART:  That's -- that would be true, YourHonor, and I would point out that the language that you'redealing, or you're quoting from, from Hendrix, is languagethat for each of those propositions one can go back to theHendrix opinion and find that the source of those things,such as the procedural protections, the segregation fromthe prison population, within the statute, just as one canin the State of Washington.          And as you noted in writing the dissent inHendrix --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MS. HART:  -- the Kansas law, our State law,Washington State law was a model for the Kansas law.15 1    They're essentially identical, except for some places 2    where Washington's -- 3              QUESTION:  Yes, but it's important they be 4    interpreted the same way.  They -- the majority 5    interpreted that statute in Kansas to require certain 6    things, like adequate treatment, and I take it -- at least 7    that's how I read it.  That's -- the words are there, and 8    the -- so -- it's important to me that you're saying that 9    if those are not being given in fact, then the remedy for10    the prisoner is to sue under the State law and say, this11    is what the State law means, and I'm not getting it.12              MS. HART:  I believe that a resident at the13    center would have that opportunity under State law to --14              QUESTION:  Insofar as this case is concerned, I15    take it, you leave open the possibility -- you certainly16    don't concede it, but you leave open the possibility that17    there could be a Federal substantive due process claim on18    the theory that we threw out a moment ago, you and I were19    talking about a moment ago, which I guess has been20    asserted, and that is, if the State's purpose in21    commitment is treatment, and I have a treatable condition22    and they don't treat me, that is a violation of due23    process.  I'm not asking you to concede that that theory24    should prevail, but that is at least a possible assertion25    that could be made in a Federal court.16 1              MS. HART:  I believe that's true, Your Honor, 2    and I would like to note that since the question really 3    before this Court is that narrow question of how the Court 4    determines whether a statute is civil or criminal, that 5    that kind of issue and concern is one that really is 6    reflected in, I think in part, or you can find in part in 7    the factors that this Court looks at facially. 8              QUESTION:  Right, and I take it that the -- that 9    for you to win this case the proposition that your case10    really turns on is not even a broad proposition, or a11    broad set of rules about how we determine whether it's12    criminal or civil, but rather, your case depends on the13    proposition that it doesn't vary from individual to14    individual.  It is either civil, or it is criminal, and15    that the details of individual treatment do not affect16    that determination.17              MS. HART:  That's correct, Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  And perhaps it's even narrower than19    has been suggested judging from your question presented.20    What we're actually talking about is, does the -- was the21    Ninth Circuit wrong in saying that this statute as22    presented to it could violate either the Ex Post Facto23    Clause or the Double Jeopardy Clause?24              MS. HART:  That's correct.  Those are the only25    two claims involved in this case and before this Court.17 1              QUESTION:  How does one respond to the, what I 2    understood to be the complaint in this case, which is, I 3    am civilly committed, and yet I'm housed in a prison and 4    I'm treated worse than I was treated when I was serving a 5    sentence of conviction? 6              That's essentially, as I take it, his complaint. 7    There's no change in my circumstances from the time I was 8    incarcerated as punishment.  If anything, I'm being 9    treated worse now than I was.  How does one answer that10 claim?11              MS. HART:  I think the way one answers it in the12    State of Washington first of all has been referenced by13    other members of the Court, is that Washington's law14    requires the provision of adequate care and individualized15    treatment to these individuals.16              The other thing that I think answers, or helps17    answer that, Your Honor, is that Washington's law, just18    like Kansas' law, is a civil commitment statute, and once19    having enacted a civil commitment statute, there are20    certain consequences that fall from that for a State, and21    among them is to provide care more considerate than one22    would receive or is constitutionally entitled to receive23    in a penal institution.24              QUESTION:  My understanding is that he did have25    a proceeding in the State court before he came to Federal18 1    court, is that correct? 2              MS. HART:  Yes.  There is a direct appeal by 3    Mr. Young from his commitment. 4              QUESTION:  It was only that, so at that stage he 5    wasn't complaining about the treatment he was in fact 6    getting.  He was complaining about the right to continue 7    confinement, is that so? 8              MS. HART:  I'm sorry, I missed the last part of9 your --10              QUESTION:  I asked if in his States court11    litigation he was challenging, as he is now, that he is12    being kept in confinement, that he's being treated no13    better and, in fact, worse than he was treated when he was14 in prison.15              MS. HART:  Your Honor, that really wasn't an16    issue on the direct appeal.  When the Washington supreme17    court affirmed Mr. Young's commitment it remanded the case18    to the court of appeals for two purposes, to determine19    whether a less restrictive alternative -- or actually for20    one purpose, to determine whether a less restrictive21    alternative to total confinement would be appropriate to22    Mr. Young, and in the context of that proceeding, at the23    outset of that proceeding, Mr. Young challenged the24    conditions of confinement at the Special Commitment25 Center.19 1              There was a hearing of some week's duration on 2    that issue, and the court declined to conclude that the 3    conditions of confinement were punitive. 4              QUESTION:  So there is a final adjudication 5    after the remand from the Washington supreme court. 6              MS. HART:  Your Honor, my understanding, and it 7    is correct, it's not simply my understanding, is that 8    there has been an appeal from that, and that appeal is -- 9    that appeal to the court of appeals is pending now.10              In other words, the supreme court of Washington11    sent this back to the trial court on a less restrictive12    issue, less restrictive alternative.  In the context of13    that proceeding, Mr. Young raised the issue of conditions14    of confinement, was not successful there, and is now15    appealing that to the Court of Appeals of the State of16    Washington, and that matter is pending.17              QUESTION:  You described the first instance18    decision in rather careful words.  You say that they19    declined to find that.  Did they reject such a claim?  Did20    they say, even if he would establish that he's being21    treated no better and perhaps worse, he still has no22    claim.  What was the reason he was --23              MS. HART:  The court -- this -- the order from24    this proceeding the Court will find at page JA 49, the25    joint appendix at 49, and the court after trial simply201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9concluded -- let me see -- simply concluded that he hadnot demonstrated that the conditions were punitive.          QUESTION:  And the point was that if they werepunitive they would have violated the Washington statute.Was that the point of the proceeding?          MS. HART:  I believe the proceeding itself was ageneralized challenge to conditions of confinement at theSpecial Commitment Center.          QUESTION:  As violating what?101112    Scalia.1314151617181920    word?2122    that is characterized by recurrent and intense urges and23    fantasies, sexual fantasies with respect to things that24    are either nonhuman objects, nonconsenting adults,25    children -- it's a pathological, pathologically driven21          MS. HART:  I believe that the focus there was aconstitutional type substantive due process claim, Justice          QUESTION:  What was the mental disorder, or thepersonality disorder, or the mental abnormality that wasestablished here?          MS. HART:  Mr. Young was found to suffer from asevere paraphilia characterized either by sexual sadism orrape, as well as a severe antisocial personality disorder.QUESTION:  What is paraphilia, if that's theMS. HART:  It's essentially a mental condition1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9mental condition.          QUESTION:  Does a person have that disorder ifhe has or she has volitional control?          MS. HART:  I think that --          QUESTION:  They've talked about this in thebrief, and I'm never quite sure of the full significanceof this part of the inquiry.          My understanding, Your Honor, of this sort ofmental disorder, this sort of paraphilia, is that it is adifficulty with volitional control, that you'll havesituations where individuals will have these repeatedurges and fantasies and then act on them, perhaps beremorseful, but they will repeat, and the ability tocontrol them is something that the individual cannot do          MS. HART:  In Washington's statute, mental -- amental abnormality, which is a predicate to commitmentunder Washington law, requires a condition that doesaffect volitional control.10111213141516171819    consistently.20              QUESTION:  We talk about this.  Do the21    psychiatrists talk about this in a way that has meaning to22    them?  Do they say, this person has or has not volitional23    control?  Is that a standard psychiatric frame of24    evaluation?25              MS. HART:  Not that I'm specifically aware of,221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Your Honor, but I believe it's somewhat inherent in thenature of this particular mental condition.          QUESTION:  Do you interpret the findings herethat he lacked volitional control?          MS. HART:  Under Washington statute, he wouldhave to have -- suffer from a mental abnormality, or wasbound to suffer from a mental abnormality, Your Honor,that entails a lack of volitional control, or at least animpairment of his ability to control what he does.          QUESTION:  I take it what -- he was originallyconvicted of rape?          MS. HART:  He was -- he has a lengthy criminalhistory, Your Honor, of six violent rapes.          QUESTION:  And I presume under Washington lawsome sort of mens rea is required for the offense of rape.          MS. HART:  I believe -- I believe that's -- I'mnot sure, Your Honor.  I don't believe there's necessarilya mental element.  There may be a mental element.          QUESTION:  Well I mean, would Washington law atleast recognize a defense that he was unable to controlhis actions?  Or would it be the McNaughton test?          MS. HART:  I think in Washington it would be theability to discern right from wrong.          Just before -- I'd like to save a couple ofminutes for rebuttal, but the other thing I would like to23 1    do before I do this is essentially to sort of bring this 2    case back to the question before the Court and to make the 3    Court understand that a number -- and I'm sure you do 4    appreciate that, that a number of the questions that 5    you're posing here are ones that have already been 6    resolved against Mr. Young both in the Washington supreme 7    court and in the Ninth Circuit and that the very narrow 8    and limited issue, but important one, before this Court is 9    rather, how the Court determines whether a statute is10    civil or criminal.11              If I could, I'd like to reserve --12              QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Hart.13              Mr. Boruchowitz.  Am I pronouncing your name14    correctly?1516171819202122232425          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes, sir.          ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. BORUCHOWITZ                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I'd like to begin by answering quickly some ofthe questions that the Court just asked.  JusticeKennedy's question with regard to the evidence aboutMr. Young's mental abnormality, the testimony was thatfrom the single State psychologist was that he has aparaphilia not otherwise specified.  He also has a24 1    personality disorder not otherwise specified, neither of 2    which, standing alone, would support the prediction that 3    the psychologist was required to make, but by combining 4    the two, by 51 percent he would say that Mr. Young would 5    be dangerous. 6              There's no evidence of volitional control or the 7    lack of volitional control.  There's no jury instruction. 8    There's no requirement about that whatsoever and, as the 9    DSM makes clear, simply having a disorder in the DSM does10    not make any indication about lack of volitional control.11              With regard to the question about the evidence12 below --13              QUESTION:  And is it conceded by all sides that14    that showing is, under Washington law, sufficient to15    commit him civilly?16              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Under the Washington statute,17    yes.  The test -- well, yes.  We have argued that in the18    State court and lost, that that volitional control element19    is required, and as the amicus brief suggests, that20    remains potentially unclarified by the Hendrix opinion,21    but in Washington that testimony was sufficient.22              I think it's important to point out with regard23    to the testimony, to the decision in the superior court24    below in Mr. Young's case at the joint appendix, page 61,25    the trial court applied to Mr. Young a burden of proof251    beyond a reasonable doubt in order to show that the effect2    of the statute was unconstitutional.3              The judge did find that we proved by a4    preponderance of the evidence that certain conditions were5    less than treatment and greater than prison and so forth6    but, since she applied to us beyond reasonable doubt, we7 lost.89 10          In the Campbell case, which is pending cert inthis Court, a judge found that in fact the conditions wereunconstitutional, so that needs to be clarified, I11    suggest.121314QUESTION:  And then what happened --QUESTION:  The Campbell case was in State court?MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.1516    here.171819202122232425Campbell lost in the supreme court and is now pending cert          QUESTION:  And what was the reason foroverturning the trial judge's disposition in Campbell?          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Basically the State supremecourt took the position that the Attorney General is here,that a statute should be looked at only on its face, andthat the effect of the statute, the conditions of thestatute, the punitive conditions of the statute asimplemented didn't make any difference.QUESTION:  Obviously, the word isn't applied.                  2612345678    unconstitutional.9              But the difficulty here right now, I think, isThat's the wrong concept, I would have thought, that theconditions in an individual case show what the statute mayor may not permit.MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And if they permit no treatment,then, of course, everybody I think concedes -- I don'tknow if everybody does, but I'd say then it's10    the majority's opinion in Hendrix is the law.  The11    majority listed certain features of this case --12    Hendrix -- which made it civil and not criminal.13              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.14              QUESTION:  Now, you've heard the Attorney15    General say, and I guess what's important is that your16    client have some remedy, that he does have a remedy.17    That's what's important, and the remedy is that those18    conditions that made the Hendrix statute civil do not19    pertain to your client, then the law of Washington is20    violated, and therefore your client has an excellent21    remedy.22232425          Either the Hendrix majority conditions apply, orthey do not.  If they do apply, you can't complain -- onmy -- I was in dissent.But if they don't apply -- if they don't apply,                  27 1    well then, you have a perfect remedy, so what's the 2    problem with that, from the point of view of the law? 3              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, I think 4    there are many problems with it.  This Court, of course, 5    has not interpreted the Washington statute.  You only 6    interpreted the Kansas statute, and all three opinions in 7    Hendrix focused on the conditions of confinement.  The 8    majority said, no one here is claiming that there's 9    punitive conditions.  No one here is claiming that Mr.10    Hendrix is not treated as a civilly committed person, and11    so we look at that and we decide it's not punitive.12              Justice Kennedy suggested that if, in fact, it13    turns out that treatment is a sham, then the decision14    would go the other way, and the dissent focused heavily on15    conditions and showed that treatment was not, in fact,16    there, so my suggestion is that this Court over and over17    and over again in a series of cases has looked at how a18    statute is implemented.  In the Allen v. Illinois case19    this Court said this would be a different case if somebody20    had claimed that there was punitive conditions.21              Most recently in Gardner v. Jones this Court, in22    evaluating an ex post facto claim, said, we're going to23    remand this case because there wasn't enough discovery24    done below about what's actually going on, and what the25    Court said is that the respondent must show that, as28 1    applied to his own case, his own sentence, the law created 2    a risk of ex post facto, and also said in Gardner, when 3    the rule does not by its own terms show a significant 4    risk, the respondent must demonstrate by evidence drawn 5    from the rules practical implementation in his case. 6              As long ago as Yerkwo v. Hopkins, that's the 7    position that the Court took, that a statute that was on 8    its face neutral, but that was as-applied with, as the 9    Court put it, an unequal eye, or an evil eye, an unequal10    hand, that --11              QUESTION:  Was Yerkwo either an ex post facto or12    a double jeopardy case?13              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  No, it was not, Your Honor,14    but what I'm suggesting is that the reasoning that the15    Court has applied in many different areas of the law is to16    look at the implementation of the statute and that the17    actions of an administrative agency, whether it's the18    parole board in Gardner, or the city laundry regulators in19    Yerkwo, represent the State itself, and that the State --20              QUESTION:  I may in substance agree with you,21    but is that why we have this case?  I mean, I don't -- I22    didn't think we had this case to determine whether the23    statute was criminal or civil.  I thought we had this case24    to determine whether, given a classification as civil, it25    may then later be treated as having a criminal character291    with respect to its application to particular individuals,2    and isn't that latter issue the one that's before us?3              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I think precisely, Your Honor,4    the issue before you is whether the Ninth Circuit was5    correct in ordering an evidentiary hearing on the question6    of whether the initial confinement render the statute7    unconstitutional.8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But the assumption, as I understandit, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought theassumption of the Ninth Circuit's position was that westart with the proposition that it is a civil statute.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  But that it's application may berendered criminal in particular cases.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right.  And so the issue beforeus is whether the Ninth Circuit, whether that option is,in fact, available, and one of the things that we want toknow, and this goes back to Justice Breyer's question is,let's assume it's not available.          Let's assume that criminality of the statute'scharacter is not a shifting and springing quality.Does -- on the assumption that it's a civil statute, doesyour client have a remedy under State law, and I would addto it, does he have a remedy, even on the assumption of301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425civil character, under Federal law?          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  He would have a remedy, YourHonor, to sue under 1983 in State or Federal court.          QUESTION:  And his claim would be --          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  His claim would be a dueprocess claim that he --          QUESTION:  Substantive due process?          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Okay.  The claim that I was talkingabout with counsel for the State.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  Okay.  So he's got that, and he has aState law claim that he's entitled to treatment which he'snot getting.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I think it's important to lookat the reality, both of the effect of the statute and ofthe litigation that's been going on.  It's been 6 yearssince a Federal court has enjoined the State in thismatter.  The Federal court held the State in contempt,noting its foot-dragging and deliberate avoidance of hisinjunction on the treatment need at the facility.  Theformer Director called the facility dysfunctional, so --          QUESTION:  Well, it may be all of those things,but wasn't the -- I'm not sure they're before us.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, the reason I mention it,                            31 1    Your Honor, is you ask, does he have a viable alternative, 2    and I think there may be a civil remedy, but the civil 3    remedy does not get at the fundamental question in this 4    case, which is that my client has been punished for 10 5    years under a so-called civil commitment statute. 6              QUESTION:  But if you're right, then I take it 7    every member of that class that's now involved in a 1983 8    case would have an equally valid habeas claim. 9              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, some of them10    certainly would, depending on what the district court11    eventually finds at the hearing.  I would point out, by12    the way, that I don't believe it's an actual certified13    class, but there are multiple named plaintiffs, but --14              QUESTION:  Well, all of the named plaintiffs.15              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  But certainly everyone would16    be able to bring their own challenge as applied to them,17    in fact, the statue was unconstitutional.18              Mr. Young should be able to have his day in the19    trial court, in the Federal district court, as the Ninth20    Circuit has ordered, to be able to show that the purpose21    and effect of this statute are, in fact, unconstitutional.22              QUESTION:  That's why I'm confused on the23    procedure.  I would think the answer to Justice Souter's24    question, I mean, at least as I would see it, would be you25    have a civil statute, but this person is suffering32 1    criminal treatment. 2              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct. 3              QUESTION:  All right.  I'd say if that's so, of 4    course he must have a remedy. 5              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Right. 6              QUESTION:  They're saying he does have.  He has 7    two remedies.  You don't need to create a new category. 8              The first remedy would be, under State law -- it 9    violates the statute, and then if you lose on that one,10    there would be another, which would say that the Federal11    Constitution doesn't permit a person who is civilly12    committed to be there without any treatment, where he can13    sustain the treatment, et cetera, et cetera, and that14    would be the Federal constitutional claim.15              You might win, you might lose, but it seems to16    me you have those already in the lower courts, and we17    don't need a remand on this case to give you those.18    That's where I'm confused.  I mean, they're already19    pending, those two claims.  One's in the Washington20    system, the other's in the Federal system, and so what's21    this thing now going to help on?22              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, the posture23    of this case is somewhat unusual in that the Court has24    taken cert of this case before the evidentiary hearing in25    district court, and the Ninth Circuit said, send this back33 1    because Mr. Young didn't have his evidentiary hearing 2    which he should have had. 3              I think it's important to point out, in response 4    to what Justice Ginsburg asked earlier, Mr. Young has 5    claimed that this statute was being punitively applied, 6    and that in fact it was punitive in purpose from the very 7    beginning.  He brought a personal restraint petition 8    before he even has his trial in State court, so he has 9    made this claim from the very beginning, both that the10    effect of this statute illuminates the punitive purpose,11    and that the effect itself is punitive.12              After Hendrix, and after the Ninth Circuit13    remanded the case the first time, then the focus of the14    court was on the punitive effect.15              QUESTION:  But may I just ask this question.  If16    he's correct that as applied to him it's punitive, then17    does that not mean that he's been subjected to double18    jeopardy and is entitled to his release?19              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Absolutely.20              QUESTION:  That's your position?21              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes, Justice Stevens, because22    in fact the whole purpose of a writ of habeas corpus is to23    challenge unconstitutional incarceration, and the relief24    is release, and that's what Mr. Young has been asking for25    from the day he filed his habeas --34 1              QUESTION:  And you add that you can make this 2    showing at the very outset of the order committing him to 3    the civil treatment? 4              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think it's 5    even more the case now, after 10 years, but yes, at the 6    very outset this was a facility that was set up with not 7    even a licensed psychologist on staff.  This was not what 8    the Court described in Hendrix, of a psychiatric facility 9    with 31 hours a week of treatment.  This was a facility10    that did not even have a licensed psychologist, that had11    no certified sex offender treatment providers until long,12    long, long after the injunction was in place.13              QUESTION:  But Mr. Boruchowitz, doesn't --14    again, doesn't your argument go to a different issue from15    the one that's before us?  You're arguing, I think, that16    your client should have, or should have had an opportunity17    to show that this is not like the Hendrix statute, and18    that this one is, in fact, a punitive statute, and19    therefore all the punitive protections apply?  But that's20    not the issue that we've got before us, is it?21              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, I think it22    is the issue.23              QUESTION:  I thought the issue -- and we can24    make it either-or.  I thought the issue we had before us25    was a determination by the State court that the statute35 1    here was like the Hendrix statute and therefore we had a 2    civil statute, and the question was, may the application 3    of that statute nonetheless be treated as criminal in 4    particular cases, even though the statute is classified as 5    a general matter as civil?  I thought we had the latter 6    issue, not the issue whether he should be able to prove, 7    or could prove that it was in constitutional terms unlike 8    Hendrix in a criminal statute. 9              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure10    I understand the question, but let me try this --11              QUESTION:  The question -- let me do it again.12    The question is, is the issue before us whether this is a13    criminal statute, or is the issue before us whether a14    civil statute may nonetheless give rise to claims of15    violating criminal constitutional protections if the civil16    statute is not followed by its own terms?  Which question?17              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I think  between the two I18    think it's the second question.19              QUESTION:  Okay.  That's what I thought.20              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes, but I believe that on21    remand the court of appeals opinion suggests that the22    district court should examine the effect of the statute23    and along the way mentions some evidentiary aspects that24    to the Ninth Circuit looked as if the statute, in fact,25    were -- had a punitive purpose, a deterrent purpose.361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  How would that evidentiary hearingdiffer from the one that's already been had in the Federalcourt in the Turay case?          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, I think oneof the first questions for the district judge to decidewould be what nature proceeding he would undertake, andwhether he would simply use a record that had beenestablished in the other proceeding, whether collateralestoppel would apply on certain issues and, if not,whether he would take evidence on recent developments.          That's something we haven't reached yet, but Iwould think that would be the first question for the judgeto decide.  What nature of evidence do I take?  Do Isimply look at the record Judge Dwyer has prepared over 10years, or do I look at some additional evidence?          QUESTION:  I thought your position was that youcan challenge this statute at the very outset of the ordercommitting him based on the fact that, as demonstrated bythe way in which the treatment facility is operated, itis -- it is not for a civil purpose, and that theclassification of the disease is too imprecise --          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  -- to admit of psychiatric treatment.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes.  It --          QUESTION:  And you simply want to use evidence371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of existing conditions to challenge the operation of thestatute at the time that he's subjected to it.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's right, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And that seems somewhat differentthan the answer you gave to Justice Souter.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, both -- I have to answeryes to both questions, because that's been our positionfrom the very beginning, that the statute in its purposewas punitive, as evidenced by not only the legislativehistory, which this Court in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinezdescribed as the objective manifestation of the law, thelegislative history, and also by the purpose and effect.By the effect, the implementation, which this Court alsolooks at over and over again.          QUESTION:  But that sounds a lot like mydissent, which the lower courts, as much as I'd like themto follow my dissents rather than the majority, I'mafraid, quite correctly, they follow the majorityopinions, not the dissents and that's correct.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Justice Breyer --          QUESTION:  So how do we reconcile that with -- Imean, it's the majority --          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, there are several waysto do that, Your Honor.  First of all, as Justice Kennedypointed out, Hendrix was decided affecting Hendrix alone38 1    and, as you suggested in dissent, if the concern that 2    Justice Kennedy had in his concurrence about the, either 3    potential of the sham treatment or the imprecision of 4    mental abnormality, were to come true, that in fact due 5    process implications would be raised as well, as you put 6    it in your dissent. 7              So I think all three opinions in Hendrix looked 8    at the condition of confinement and, of course, did not 9    look at the Washington statute.  You have not looked at10    the Washington statute, and that's not your function11    today, because what you're being asked to do is whether12    the court of appeals remand was correct or not.13              Now, along the way, you have to examine the14    question of how do we go about making that decision, and15    initially you look at the face of the statute, but that's16    not enough.  The civil label is not enough, you've said17    over and over again, and what you do then is, you look18    beyond that to the purpose and effect.  Has it been19    implemented in such a way that the effect is punitive?  If20    it's punitive, then double jeopardy and ex post facto --21              QUESTION:  Well, it doesn't necessarily mean22    effect that way.  I mean, that's the crucial language,23    purpose and effect.  Does it mean, the effect as evident24    from the face of the statute, which is what your opponent25    says, or does it mean the effect as it is played out, even39 1    if that contradicts the face of the statute?  That's the 2    crucial issue. 3              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I agree. 4              QUESTION:  What that language, effect, means. 5              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Yes, Justice Scalia, I think 6    that's right, and my suggestion is that Hudson doesn't 7    even mention Hendrix.  Hendrix talks in all three opinions 8    about the condition of confinement, and cites other cases 9    that talk about implementation.  Hudson was a question10    involving fines and debarment imposed by the Controller of11    the Currency.  Hudson was decided 6 months after Hendrix,12    doesn't even mention it, let alone purport to overrule it.13              This Court has over 100 years of history, in14    many, many different areas of the law, of looking at how a15    statute is implemented to determine its constitutionality.16              QUESTION:  But Hudson was an opinion dealing17    precisely with the constitutional claim that you're18 raising.19              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.20              QUESTION:  With the Double Jeopardy Clause.21              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct, Your Honor.  I22    think there are key differences from Hudson, and they boil23    down to liberty versus money, because in Hudson you're24    talking about fines and debarment, and --25              QUESTION:  Well, does the Double Jeopardy Clause40 1    make any such distinction? 2              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I don't think it does, no, 3    Your Honor, but I think the Court's opinions have 4    indicated a greater concern about implementation of the 5    law and the facts as applied when liberty is involved, and6 I think -- 7              QUESTION:  Sorry.  Go ahead. 8              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I was just going to say that 9    in the Ex Post Facto context, certainly that's what the10    Gardner decision did, because the Court said the facts are11    not before us as to how this statute is implemented, and12    the policies and practices of the parole board certainly13    should be considered, and so we're going to remand for14 that.15              QUESTION:  In Gardner the claim was made that16    the rule in general had an ex post facto effect on gain17    time, and I think our Court said you -- it's not enough to18    show it might have affected some people.  You've got to19    show it affected you.20              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.21              QUESTION:  Which is quite different, I think,22    from what you're saying.23              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I understand the Court's24    point, but I -- my suggestion is this, that just as it was25    important -- I mean, the ultimate question in Gardner v.411    Jones is, is there an ex post facto violation for2    Mr. Jones, and the question here, ultimately, not3    necessarily at this moment in this Court, but ultimately,4    is there a double jeopardy and ex post facto violation in5    Mr. Young's case, and so how do we do that?  In Gardner,6    we look at the implementation as applied to him.  He has7    to put on evidence of as-applied to him.8              And in Young, all we're asking for is what the9    Ninth Circuit ordered, which is our opportunity to do10 that. 111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Is it going to the same judge who'shandling the other Federal case?          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  No, Your Honor.  I supposethey could merge it.          QUESTION:  It just seems to me this is going tobe exactly the same issue.  If we just let it alone, itwould have gone back to the judge.          The judge would have either said, you're right,the conditions are terrible, you're not getting anytreatment, in which case you would have had three separategrounds for getting the relief, but you would have gottenit, or you're wrong, in which case you'd be out, and Idon't really -- now, see, what we're deciding, we'redeciding whether this judge should do it or that judgeshould do it, and the standards seem to me to be roughly42 1    the same.  I just don't -- and then the consequence is the 2    same. 3              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, it seems to me, Your 4    Honor, the Court could -- 5              QUESTION:  It's not your fault -- 6              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  No. 7              QUESTION:  -- that you're before this Court. 8              (Laughter.) 9              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.10              QUESTION:  Quite right.11              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  It seems to me that now that12    we're here the Court could do many different things.  The13    Court could simply say, we meant in Hendrix that the14    conditions were important.  We were all concerned about15    that, and the Ninth Circuit is right to consider the16    purpose and effect as shown by the conditions.  You could17    just do that.18              You could also say, by the way, mental19    abnormality, we really did mean what we said about lack of20    control, and that there should be some showing about, the21    person has no volitional control, and that would clear up22    a lot of things in the lower courts.  As we pointed out in23    our supplemental two-page brief, the State of Kansas just24    decided that yes, in fact, Hendrix just require the lack25    of volitional control.43 1              The Court could also, I suppose, go beyond the 2    question presented, which it has the authority to do, and 3    say, this statute certainly looks like it's very different 4    than what we though Hendrix was, and at least in 5    Washington as it's being applied there's a problem, but I 6    don't think the Court needs to do that. 7              The Court simply can say, we're going to remand 8    this case and let the court of appeals order stand, 9    because what the court of appeals has simply done is to10    apply Hendrix.  There's nothing different from Hendrix in11    what the Ninth Circuit did.  We're simply going to send it12    down for the district court to evaluate it, and if the13    district court, Judge Cunero decided that let Judge Dwyer14    handle it because he's done the 1983 litigation, that15    could easily -- that's something the district court could16    do if it decided to do that.17              But obviously the 1983 litigation has not been a18    habeas situation involving the question of release because19    of unconstitutional punishment, and what this case is20    ultimately about is that a man has been punished for 1021    years in a prison, longer than he served under his22    criminal sentence, without having committed another crime23    and without having a traditional mental disorder.24              And so there are many issues presented, and I25    think one of the things that's difficult about examining44 1    this case is that it's something fundamentally radically 2    different from a true civil commitment.  There's nothing 3    wrong with a true civil commitment, but this is not civil 4    commitment.  This is punishment. 5              And I think that if you look at the various 6    cases that we've cited here, one other thing about Hudson 7    that I think is important is that the Court said that the 8    penalties in Hudson did not approach the infamous 9    punishment of imprisonment.  They involved administrative10    disability, and they were imposed in administrative11    proceedings.1213141516171819202122232425          In Ward, the Court found that the penalty foroil discharge and water pollution was more analogous totraditional civil damages.          In Shaw v. Martin, before the Court found thatpretrial detention did not violate due process, the Courtexamined the actual conditions of confinement and citedtestimony in the opinion about actual practices.          QUESTION:  Of course, if the -- whatconstitutional question was involved in Shaw?          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Due process, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Yes, and I think that doesn't helpyou very much when you're trying to transpose that holdingover into double jeopardy or ex post facto, which are muchmore precise.45 1              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I appreciate that, Your Honor. 2    The Court has often considered punishment in a parallel 3    way, whether it's due process, double jeopardy, or ex post 4    facto, but I certainly acknowledge that Shaw was a due 5    process case. 6              This is a situation where, as Judge Dwyer 7    indicated in the Turay 1983 litigation, for all intents 8    and purposes this is a prison.  It looks like, feels like, 9    and is a prison run by the Department -- or the external10    facility run by the Department of Corrections, which is at11    page 6 of our brief, joint appendix 147.12              This is a situation where the State of13    Washington, over the time that the injunction has been in14    place, has made it harder to get less restrictive15    alternatives.  One of the things that this Court was16    concerned about in Hendrix, and specifically mentioned,17    was the less restrictive alternative idea, and what18    Washington has done in the last 5 years is to eliminate19    less restrictive alternative from the initial court20    determination and to make it harder for someone to get it.21              I would suggest that this Court over and over,22    in a number of cases involving both double jeopardy and23    due process and ex post facto has been to look at the24    statute as applied.25              In Foosha, Justice Thomas dissented saying that46 1    this would be a different case if the procedures as 2    applied would show, as he put it, window dressing in that 3    case.  In fact, what we have here is the actual 4    implementation of the treatment has turned out to be a5 sham. 6              The Court has said over and over that if you can 7    show by the clearest proof that a statute is punitive in 8    effect, then you can win.  The clearest proof by its terms 9    suggests that evidence will be taken, because otherwise10    where is the proof?  In answer to Justice Scalia's11    question, does it just mean what naturally flows from the12    language, or does it mean the actual implementation?  I13    would suggest that clearest proof means proof of evidence,14    not simply proof of --15              QUESTION:  May I ask on that point, are you16    contending -- is it your view that you have to prove that17    everyone subject to this statute is being punished, or18    just that your client is being punished?19              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Just that my client is being20    punished, Justice Stevens.21              QUESTION:  Well, what if there are 100 people in22    prison, 99 of them are civil, and your client is punished?23    That would -- he would get relief, then?24              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  I think so, Your Honor,25    because ultimately the logical extension of the State's471    position is that you could torture someone and beat them2    and deprive them of food, and as long as the State calls3 it civil --4              QUESTION:  Yes, but there are remedies for those5    things.  I mean, those are independent constitutional6    violations.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  But ultimately, if the way thestatute is being applied to an individual is punitive --          QUESTION:  Yes, but it would seem to me yourcase would be very strong if you could say everybody who'ssubject to this statute is being punished, but you don'tgo that far.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, we don'thave a record that would allow me to say thatcategorically, that everyone -- I think certainly inresponse to Justice, I believe --          QUESTION:  Part of your allegation could seem toestablish that, if this particular facility is -- has nopsychiatrist and is in a correction facility, everybodyincarcerated there must be punished, I would think.          MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Our answer is yes to that,Your Honor, but I don't think the Court has to answer thatquestion to rule in Mr. Young's behalf, but I think you're48 1    right that, as we've been arguing from the very beginning, 2    the statute had a punitive purpose, it was designed to 3    close the gaps, we couldn't accept the double jeopardy and 4    ex post facto -- 5              QUESTION:  Would it be open on remand, under 6    your understanding of the mandate, for you to try to prove 7    what I've just suggested? 8              MR. BORUCHOWITZ:  Well, Your Honor, I think the 9    Court could say that the application to all other10    prisoners would certainly enlighten the question of what's11    applying to Mr. Young, but the Court doesn't need to reach12    that question.13              But I think the answer to the question would be14    yes, because it has had a punitive purpose and effect from15    the beginning, but I don't think there's anything that's16    in conflict with Hendrix for us to go forward.  What17    Hendrix said was, nobody here's saying it's punitive,  it18    applies to Hendrix alone, it would be different if, and19    that's what the Court has said in many different20    circumstances, including Allen v. Illinois.  The case21    would be a different case if someone had shown that there22    was a punitive effect.23              So over and over again I think the Court has24    looked at the actual implementation of the statute, but25    you're right, I think from the very beginning he's been49 1    committed without authority of law. 2              Let me just take a minute to mention Ex Parte 3    Virginia, because I think it's important when the State 4    argues that an administrative agency does not bind the 5    State in some way.  This Court said that whoever by virtue 6    of a public position under State government deprives 7    another of constitutional rights violates the 8    Constitution, and he acts in the name and for the State 9    and his act is that of the State.  There can be no defense10    here that it's simply the administrative agency running11    amok.  This is certainly an act of the State that binds12 the State.13              The State -- thank you, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Boruchowitz.15              Ms. Hart, you have 3 minutes remaining.16               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN A. HART17                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER18              MS. HART:  Thank you.19              I would like to point out to the Court again20    that this case is before the Court on a very narrow issue,21    and it is a threshold issue, and that is, how the Court22    determines whether a statute is civil or criminal.  Hudson23    establishes that that is done facially.24              Washington -- the issue about whether25    Washington's statute is civil or criminal is not before50 1    this Court.  Both the Washington supreme court and the 2    Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have held that Washington 3    statute is civil on its face, meaning the legislature's 4    intent was to have a civil statute and that in purpose and 5    in effect the Washington statute is civil. 6              The predicates for commitment are not at issue 7    before this Court.  There is no question that Mr. Young 8    suffers from a mental abnormality and a personality 9    disorder that makes him likely to engage in sexually10    violent acts if he is not detained.  That is not before11    this Court.  The Washington supreme court and the Ninth12    Circuit have both ruled against Mr. Young on those issues,13    and there was no cross-petition here.14              The only issue before this Court, and what15    Mr. Young is contending, is that because he alleges that16    he is not receiving treatment consistent with a civil17    statute, that he ought to be released, and the only way18    Mr. Young can contend that is by saying, if I do not19    receive the treatment that I'm entitled to under a civil20    statute, somehow that converts this statute to a criminal21    statute, that one day your statute can be civil, the next22    day it can be criminal.23              In Mr. Young's view, if Washington had two24    commitment centers instead of one, the law would be civil25    at the center where the commitment -- where the treatment51 1    was adequate and -- 2              QUESTION:  Could you answer the question I -- 3    supposing he proves that everybody who's been committed 4    pursuant to this statute has been punished? 5              MS. HART:  Then everyone committed pursuant to 6    the statute would be entitled to go into either State 7    court or Federal court and get those remedies, get those 8    conditions remedied, but they do not go to the validity of 9    whether -- they do not go back to the character of10    Washington's statute.11              Washington's statute is a civil law, and that is12    meaningful.  It means that people confined pursuant to13    that law are entitled to the treatment that civil14    committees are given under the statute and under the15    Constitution, and the proportionate, measured, wholly16    adequate remedy is to go to court and require the State of17    Washington to provide the treatment and the care that it18    has promised.19              QUESTION:  But on your view the reason he could20    not, on Justice Stevens' hypothetical, argue that the21    court had made a mistake in finding the statute across the22    board to be a civil statute is that the character of the23    statute on your view must be determined on the text of the24    statute, on the basis of the statutory text alone, is that25    it?  You could find that the text --521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. HART:  Under the Hudson test.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. Hart.the case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)53
