Summum.            Mr. Sekulow.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            MR. SEKULOW:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewplease the Court:            The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that10111213141516   defects:  First, the court's conclusion that a donated17   Ten Commandments monument constitutes private speech18   rather than Government speech is wrong.  Here each of19   the monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been20   selected by the Government, are owned by the Government,21   controlled by the Government, and are displayed on22   Government property.  When the Government is speaking,23 24 25it is free from the traditional free speech constraintsof the First Amendment.            Second, the court compounded its error by3the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces PleasantGrove City to accept and erect on its property a privateparty's donated, unattended, permanent monument.The decision suffers from two constitutionalAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   further concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional 2   public forum for the erection of permanent, unattended 3   monuments by private parties. 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Sekulow, you're 5   really just picking your poison, aren't you?  I mean, 6   the more you say that the monument is Government speech 7   to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech 8   Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a 9   trap under the Establishment Clause.  If it's Government10   speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but11   what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the12   Ten Commandments?13               MR. SEKULOW:  Well, the Ten Commandments14   here was displayed in Pioneer Park, as the mayor said,15   Mayor Cook, in 1971, to show the pioneer heritage of the16   community.  This was a community of pioneers on a quest17   for religious liberty.  That's why this town was18   established.  There is no Establishment Clause claim,19   Mr. Chief Justice, here.  It would be inconsistent with202122232425the relief that the Respondents are really seeking.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well --            MR. SEKULOW:  And I think that -- yes,Justice Kennedy.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I don't want tointerrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I4Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   think it's critical, critical to your argument.  As a2   procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment3   Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint.  Are4   you taking the position it's now waived or something?5               MR. SEKULOW:  Well, there was no Federal6   Establishment Clause complaint at all.  There was a7 8 911   complaint.  It was not the basis upon which theState --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was under the State?                 MR. SEKULOW:  It was under the State of10   Utah's Establishment Clause.  It was raised in theinjunction was sought, and the Tenth Circuit noted thatit was waived.12131415161718192021222324   Establishment Clause problem.  I don't know if -- I'm25   not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or5            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you prevail, the actionshould be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?MR. SEKULOW:  Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.MR. SEKULOW:  Just let me --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then getting back to theChief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if yousay it's Government speech that in later cases,including the case of the existing monument, you'regoing to say it's Government speech and you have anAlderson Reporting Company￼1234   problem.5Official - Subject to Final Reviewthe other, but it certainly raises --            MR. SEKULOW:  Well, I think from an --                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- an Establishment Clause 7   Orden forecloses it.  This monument is very similar to 8   what was at play in Van Orden.  And here the city stated 9   the reason that they accepted and erected this monument,10   accepted the donation from the Fraternal Order of11   Eagles, was to show something and to represent their12   pioneer heritage, but --13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose it depends on14   what the Government speech consists of, what it is the15   Government is saying about the Ten Commandments.  If the16   Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word17   of God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying18   the Ten Commandments are an important part of our19   national heritage, that's something else.20               MR. SEKULOW:  That's -- and precisely,21   Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Mayor Cook in fact,22   at the unveiling ceremony, stated that this will serve23   to remind citizens of their pioneer heritage and the24   founding of --25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you have to --6                MR. SEKULOW:  If there was an Establishment6   Clause claim, Justice Kennedy, which is not here, VanAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   were speech selection cases.  It think it clearly -- 8   that the actions here of the Government, of the City 9   Council, falls neatly within Forbes, Finley, and the10   plurality in American Library Association.  The11   Government --12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before we get -- before13   we get away from the Government, the Establishment14   Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did15   it?  Because you don't have here a 40-year history of16   this monument being there, and nobody seems to be17   troubled by it.18               MR. SEKULOW:  There is a 36-year history19   here.  This monument has been on display since 1971.  So20   this monument has been there a long time, and --MR. SEKULOW:  -- their community --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the NEA -- Finley v.NEA, the Court didn't treat that as Government speech.MR. SEKULOW:  Right.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or am I -- is that the --MR. SEKULOW:  No.  You're correct.  Those2122 point.23               MR. SEKULOW:  Is that the cut-off?24               (Laughter.)25               MR. SEKULOW:  Perhaps I miscounted.  It may7JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think 38 is the cut-offAlderson Reporting Company￼1 be 38. 2345 6 7 8 9CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Sekulow --MR. SEKULOW:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- when you comeOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewupon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in thepark, how are they supposed to tell whether it'sGovernment speech or private speech?            MR. SEKULOW:  Well, of course the face ofit, Mr. Chief Justice, states on the face of themonument that it's presented to Pleasant Grove City in1011   Utah County by the Fraternal Order of Eagles.  As far as12   a Government speech as far as ownership and control goes13   under a Johanns analysis, different from Finley and14   Forbes and that context, here the Government exercised15   control.  After all, they allowed it, accepted it, and16   allowed it to be erected on their property.  Under Utah17   law, all right, title, and interest to that property18   transferred.19               But I would say with regard to the20   endorsement, if you will, or the Establishment Clause21   issue, really the context here, as this Court has22   consistently stated within the Establishment Clause23   cases matter -- this Court has a depiction of Moses24   holding the Ten Commandment in the frieze of the25   courtroom with the words written in Hebrew.  That's not8Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   other lawgivers.  This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments5   and you don't see, I don't think, anywhere "I am thean endorsement of the religion or of the commandments.It's representative of the history.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the context of all6   Lord thy God."  That's not shown.7 8 91011   context.  But as far as the actual language of what's12   going on within the park itself, Justice Ginsburg, this13   is not a monument standing alone.  There are 15 other14   displays in this Pioneer Park.  It's called --            MR. SEKULOW:  No, the words on the Court'sfrieze are "steal," "murder," "adultery" in Hebrew.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.MR. SEKULOW:  Very different in that151617181920   involve an Establishment Clause challenge.  Why are we21   --22               MR. SEKULOW:  There is no Establishment23   Clause.  It's not a basis upon which the injunction was24   sought, and the Tenth Circuit specifically held it was25   waived.9            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this a challenge to theTen Commandments monument?            MR. SEKULOW:  It's not.  This is not anEstablishment Clause case.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought this case did notAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Sekulow, can I just 2   ask:  At what point in the litigation did you first 3   raise the Government speech argument? 4               MR. SEKULOW:  At the Tenth Circuit.  The 5   Tenth Circuit, the existing law in the Tenth Circuit in 6   the Summum line of cases mandated a private speech 7   determination, even if the speech was controlled or 8   known by the Government, if it originated with a third 9   party.  As soon as we were before -- and under Tenth10   Circuit rules that's binding, of course, on the district11   court and on the panel.12               But even in the panel brief, we raise the13   issue of Government speech and the Court addressed it14   both as to -- and, Justice Kennedy, going back to your15   point -- both as to Government speech and to the speech16   selection cases of Forbes, Finley, and American Library17   Association.  And I think that those cases as well point18   to what's at issue here.  Governments in the business of19   governing and determining the parks and the landscape of20   the parks make these kind of decisions.21               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't the tough -- isn't22   the tough issue here not so much whether there is23   Government speech.  I will assume and I do indeed assume24   that there is.  Isn't the tough issue here the claim25   that there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both10Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   Government and private.  And the argument for its 2   continuing to be private speech I take it is simply the 3   Eagles identification with the presentation and their 4   espousal of what the monument says.  How -- how do you 5   think we ought to deal with the mixture issue. 6               MR. SEKULOW:  Well, I think the fact that it 7   originated, that the monument originated by the Eagles 8   as a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the 9   fact that in this particular case, and in most cases10   involving donated monuments, which, as the United States11   would point to, most of the monuments in parks are12   donated by or originated with third parties --13               JUSTICE SOUTER:  They probably are, but most14   of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here.  But I15   don't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain16   as part of -- in a prominent place in the monument17   itself contain the statement that, you know, this is the18   gift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z,19   whereas this monument does.20               MR. SEKULOW:  Most of them, Justice Souter,21   do actually have statements.  In fact, a perfect example22   would be at Gettysburg National Military Park a number23   of those monuments, most of them, are donated by or24   originated by third parties.  They'll often say "Donated25   by," for instance, "the Father Corby --11Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SOUTER:  We may have more cases2   coming. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   who controls the message ultimately here.  And the fact10   is the Statue of Liberty originated by the11   Franco-American Union -- was originated by a third12   party.  The United States by resolution accepted it.  At13   that point title transfer.14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If that -- if we accept15   that there is Government speech, I think Justice16   Souter's question is isn't this really the Government17   endorsement of the Eagles' message?  I mean, the Eagles18   are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle,19   and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their20   monument.  Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in21   the district court there, wasn't the statement, well,22   this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work23   that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to24   prevent juvenile delinquency.25               MR. SEKULOW:  Right.  And I think that12MR. SEKULOW:  I hope not.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But tell me, what is thecriterion that we should use to decide what thesignificance of the private identification is?            MR. SEKULOW:  I think the key should be, asthis Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control,Alderson Reporting Company￼89 10 11 12 13 14answer to me is it's not a mixture.            MR. SEKULOW:  It's not.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  And there ceases to be amixture the moment the Government accepts it.            MR. SEKULOW:  Once -- right, title, andinterest vest under Utah law in the Pleasant Grove Cityupon acceptance and at that point it is owned andOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   actually points to why that once it's controlled and2   owned by the Government the fact that it originated in3   the third party, Justice Ginsburg, changes the equation4   for ownership and control to the Government.5               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if it does, it6   changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating7   the private aspect of the speech.  So that your real15   controlled by the city.  And the fact that it was16   originally created -- and Justice Ginsburg, you're17   correct, the district court and also the court of18   appeals in Van Orden stated that it was originated as a19   moral guidance for youth.  That was the reason that the20   Fraternal Order of Eagles developed.  The State of Texas21   said:  We're going to honor the Eagles.  That was their22   reason, as well as showing the role of the Ten23   Commandments and the rule of law.  And then the Third --24   excuse me, Justice Stevens.25               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I ask you question13Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   that's kind of in the background of the case?2               MR. SEKULOW:  Sure.3               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Assume you didn't have the4   policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that5   the city decided not to put up this monument because it6   disagreed with the message of the monument.  Whether you7 8 911   establishment clause, an equal protection kind of clause12   analysis case, but not under the basis upon which13   Respondents have sought here.  I think that's important14   to point out.  The basis upon which they sought access,15   in you will, is a species of an equal access claim.  But16   of course our position is the Government hasn't17   established anything by accepting the monument.18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, Justice Stevens's19   question is important, maybe not for your case but for20   other cases.  We are deciding this for other cases to21   arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like22   the message then that raises a content-based claim?23               MR. SEKULOW:  Because if the Government is24   speaking, if it's the Government's message, they're of25   course allowed to engage in content-based statements.14call it Government speech or private speech, would thatbe permissible?                 MR. SEKULOW:  It wouldn't be a First10   Amendment free speech claim.  It might raise anAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   The Statute of Liberty was a statement of liberty2   enlightening the world.  I could give a list of3 4 5 6 7 8 9monuments that do that.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand that.            MR. SEKULOW:  That's what they did.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it doesn't seem to methat you have to make the Government speech argument foryou to make the argument that you just made.            MR. SEKULOW:  No, not necessarily, becauseeven under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that'scorrect -- Governments make determinations of what theyare going to put in their parks to communicate a10111213   message.  That's very different from a situation I think14   where the Tenth Circuit panel was incorrect and15   Respondents are incorrect:  They confuse the issue of16   the Government actually creating a forum or a venue for17   speech -- and a perfect example of that would be here,18   with ownership and control vesting in the city.  Very19   different in that situation than the typical equal20   access case, where the Government merely opens up its21   facilities for a variety of viewpoints, Justice Stevens,22   and then cannot engage in content-based or23   viewpoint-based --24               JUSTICE SOUTER:  So the city, in effect, if25   the city says, we are going to have a designated15Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   ten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument, 2   but you can't because we don't like your message, 3   there's a First Amendment problem.  But if the city 4   hides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll -- 5   we'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept 6   monuments from people who want to place them on our 7   property if the monuments have some kind of an arguable 8   historical connection or a connection with people with 9   long association with the community, as long as they10   have that sort of criterion in mind then they can select11   any way they want to?12               MR. SEKULOW:  Justice Souter, there is a13   fundamental difference between opening up a forum,14   taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go15   in, and another situation where the Government is16   clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason.  And17   I think the evidence in these cases, in these series of18   cases, pointing to Justice Kennedy's concern about what19   does it mean for future cases, here it is20   uncontroverted:  The basis upon which the preliminary21   injunction ultimately was issued by the Tenth Circuit22   disregarded or at least cast doubt on the declaration of23   the park administrator, who had been involved in city24   government since 1972, who stated -- and it can be found25   on pages 102 through 104 of the joint appendix -- that16Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   it's been the practice of Pleasant Grove City for three2   decades to accept displays only in their particular case3   related to the history of the community, its pioneer4 history. - 5 6   doesn't it?  I mean, whether it's the Government stating 7   the message or whether it's the Government creating a 8   limited public forum for the presentation of only those 9   messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the10   same thing, doesn't it?11               MR. SEKULOW:  Well, it depends on -- if it's12   a limited public forum, certainly limited public forums13   can be based on subject matter and speaker identity.14   This Court said that, said that consistently, Cornelius15   and Perry.  So in that context, and now that limited16   public forum appears to be more of a non-public forum17   type of analysis, certainly.  Even in the designated18   public forum, it could be limited in that regard.19               I think that points to the confusion of what20   took place here.  The Court in our view conflated those21   two issues, the issue of forum and Government speech.22   And while they're both separate basis upon which we23   believe the Tenth Circuit opinion could be reversed and24   vacate the issuance of the injunction, the reality is25   that in this particular case once title passed and17JUSTICE SCALIA:  It goes to the same thing,Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   control vested in Pleasant Grove City they were the2   owner and effectively controlled.  And, Mr. Chief3   Justice, that does not mean that they violate the4   Establishment Clause simply because they own and control5 a monument.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you a question67   to make sure I understand your position.  It would have8 9101112131415been permissible for the city to say, our park it filledwith monuments and we are only going to let those in whoconvey messages that we agree with?            MR. SEKULOW:  If the policy is --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  If that's a policy.            MR. SEKULOW:  If the policy is that we'reonly going -- that the Government's controlling those     messages, it's not individual private expression, of16   course.  If it's individual private -- if the17181920212223   Government speech, it's irrelevant.  On the factual --24               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Even if it's a Government25   forum for private speech, I think it's the same thing.18Government, on the other hand, were to say --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But really, in this casesort of the debate as to whether the policyjustifications for the monument are a sham are not arereally irrelevant?MR. SEKULOW:  From a legal standpoint onAlderson Reporting Company￼23 24 25            MR. SEKULOW:  The difference is -- thedifference between each of those cases and the case hereis the Fraternal Order of Eagles surrendered control of19Official - Subject to Final Review1   You're defining -- you define the forum to include only2   those -- the forum is putting up monuments.  You just3456   here, your answer was:  Oh, well, the Government owns7   it.  Suppose the Government says:  We will acceptput up those monuments that agree with the message.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the same questionJustice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question 8   ownership only if we agree with the message.  That just 9   puts his question.  I think the ownership argument is --10   is not an answer to the Justice's question.11               MR. SEKULOW:  It's not ownership, Justice12   Kennedy, in and of itself.  Ownership is an indicator, a13   factor for control, but it is control of the message.14   When the Government implanted that monument donated by15   the Fraternal Order of Eagles, they were sending a16   message.  It was not a message of "I am the lord thy17 God" --18               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Nothing could be a more19   obvious control of the message than the criterion that20   says we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or21   not, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree22   with the message.  That is control with a vengeance.Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   their message and their speech.  In the typical equal2   access case, Justice Stevens, they do not.3               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, they -- they do in4   the example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example5   that I just raised.  The Eagles come along say:  Here's6789   says:  Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument.  We willthe monument; take it; it's all yours.            MR. SEKULOW:  Which happened here.JUSTICE SOUTER:  And the -- the Government10   not on identical terms take the Summum monument because11   we disagree with the message.  At the point they make12   the decision they don't own anything.  What they are13   doing is controlling, in your words, and they are14   controlling on the basis of agreement with the message.15   Why isn't that a First Amendment violation?16               MR. SEKULOW:  It's not a First Amendment17   violation because the Government takes ownership and18   control at the time it's displayed, and there is no19   dispute at the time it's displayed that the Government20   is conveying a message.21               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But we've got -- we've got22   to shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title23 passes.24               MR. SEKULOW:  Absolutely not, because25   discovery in this case proves the fact that this has20Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   been a policy in existence for three decades.  And thefact of the matter is under that analysis --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does that mean if we engagein viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we arehome free?234567   speaker, they are certainly entitled to do that.  If8 910111213141516they are not, that would be a very different scenario.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  It wouldn't be a speaker onyour view until it takes control of the monument.            MR. SEKULOW:  But the Government -- thespeech selection itself is an independent basis underForbes, Finley, and American Library Association tobring these kind of --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But those are cases inwhich, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- aMR. SEKULOW:  If the Government is the17   process of, in effect, sponsoring speech.  And here we18   -- we have not, I think, reached the point in which the19   public park is to be analogized either with a20   publication or a magazine or -- or grants to -- to the21 arts.22               MR. SEKULOW:  I think, when it comes to the23   issue of selecting monuments for its park, it's very24   similar to a museum curator or the arts.25               Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the21Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9remainder of my time.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Sekulow.            Mr. Joseffer.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,                    AS AMICUS CURIAE,                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSOfficial - Subject to Final Review            MR. JOSEFFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:10111213   and in other public parks across the country.  The14   Vietnam Veterans Memorial did not open us up to a Viet15   Cong memorial.  When the Martin Luther King Memorial is16   completed on the mall, it will not have to be offset by17   a monument to the man who shot Dr. King.18               JUSTICE ALITO:  Can't there be a situation19   where the Government does create a monument that is a --20   a limited public forum?  Let's take the example that you21   just gave, the Vietnam War Memorial.  I presume the22   Government could not refuse to have the names of certain23   deceased soldiers on that monument because it disagreed24   with certain ideas that they had espoused at one point25   or another.22            Of course the Government can select thecontent and viewpoint of monuments on the National MallAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   Adams one.  I mean, we do get to decide who we want to5   memorialize on the mall because it's Government speech.6               But there are also -- there are two legal            MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, if -- when it isGovernment speech -- for example, we can have a -- aWashington Monument and a Jefferson Memorial without an7   theories here.  The first is that this is Government8   speech.  The second is that this -- even if it was 9101112131415161718private speech, this would be one of those unusualcontexts like public broadcasting, museums, libraries,where normal forum principles do not apply because theGovernment is acting as a curator and value judgmentsare, therefore, both inevitable and appropriate.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's the answer toJustice Alito's question?            MR. JOSEFFER:  I mean, if we wanted --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, supposing theGovernment in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up19   the names of any homosexual soldiers.  Would that be20   permissible?2122232425   problem here.  And what I have in this is the -- the            MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  When the -- when theGovernment is speaking, it can choose who to memorializeand who not --JUSTICE BREYER:  That seems to be the23Alderson Reporting Company￼Did you --Official - Subject to Final Review1   problem I have is that we seem to be applying these2   subcategories in a very absolute way.  Why can't we call3   this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with4   Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we5   do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate6   to a legitimate objective?  I know how you're going to7   answer that question.  You're going to say:  Of course,8   it is.9            But what's interesting me is, are we boundin these cases to apply what I think of as an artificialkind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what101112   seems to me to be at the heart of the matter?  The13   answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is:  Of14   course the Government can't do that because it's15   disproportionate.JUSTICE STEVENS:  I didn't get the answer.MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes, the Government can16171819   choose to memorialize who it wants on the mall.  When20   the Government is -- now, to be clear, that's under the21   Free Speech Clause.22               JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is the answer to23   the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's24   hypothetical?  What is the answer to the homosexual25   hypothetical?  What is the answer?24Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. JOSEFFER:  The only question -- 2               JUSTICE BREYER:  Because that tests the 3   theory. 4               MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, as a matter of the Free 5   Speech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's 6   ability to speak freely.  Under the Equal Protection 7   Clause, the Establishment Clause, perhaps the Due 8   Process Clause, there might be thought to be independent 9   checks on the Government's speech.  But the Free Speech10   Clause, whatever else it does, does not prevent the11   Government from speaking freely.12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me the13   Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could14   disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of15   other things that in -- in many States people are free16   to do.  The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?1718192021   the -- the question?  Why isn't the answer to the22   question that monuments generally are not -- the23   erection of monuments generally are not a forum?  There24   is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner25   in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent            MR. JOSEFFER:  The Government would bepowerless to do anything if it cannot first formulateand then express its own viewpoints.JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that the answer to25Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   monument that takes up space, presumably limited public 2   space. 3               And if you have the unusual situation where 4   you are have a monument that is really analogous to a 5   forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable.  But 6   to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or 7   the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous. 8               MR. JOSEFFER:  When the -- when the 9   Government -- and this is a point I started on earlier.10   When the Government is acting as a curator as in the11   museum context, normal forum principles do not apply.12               In Forbes, for example, this Court held that13   when the Government acts as a public broadcaster it14   normally can engage in viewpoint discrimination outside15   of an exception for candidate debates.  And the -- and16   the same point applies here to monuments, I think, for a17   combination of three reasons.18               First, the Government has an overwhelming19   interest as a property owner in not being saddled with20   structures it does not want; second, the limits on the21   availability of public space you refer to; and, third,22   the Government's sovereign interest in using monuments23   on its own property to tell its own story, as the24   Federal Government has done here on the Mall.25               It's similar to, for example, a sculpture26Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   garden or -- and -- a sculpture garden where the2   Government can choose what sculptures to put in the3   sculpture garden without necessarily having some4   overriding theme or overriding reason.5               If I could give two examples of that, in6   Meridian Hill Park here in Northwest D.C., between 15th7   and 16th streets, the Government chose to accept and8   place a variety of privately donated structures that9   have no evident connection to one another.  They cover101112131415   --16people as diverse as Joan of Arc, President Buchanan --            JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose they onlyaccept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject allthe Republicans?MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  As a matter of policy            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what in the FirstAmendment -- are you saying the First Amendment wouldnot stop that?1718192021   freely.  But as a matter of rational basis review under22   the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see23   how the Government would have a legitimate governmental24   interest in pure partisan activity.25               But the Free Speech Clause, what it does is27            MR. JOSEFFER:  The Free Speech Clause on itsown force does not prevent the Government from speakingAlderson Reporting Company￼though --Official - Subject to Final Review1   that it -- it limits the extent to which the Government2   can regulate other people's speech.3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under the Equal4   Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal5   Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's6   content-based.  That's the First Amendment.7 8 9MR. JOSEFFER:  If it's Government speech,            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I don't think thatcan you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other1011   amendments of the Constitution might apply.  The heart12   of the question is whether the Government may13   discriminate based on content, and that's a First14   Amendment question.15               MR. JOSEFFER:  But when the Government is16   speaking or when the Government is acting as a curator17   as with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or18   here, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both19   content and viewpoint-based distinctions.  Otherwise,20   you get the absurd result --21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not only absolutely22   entitled, it has to do so.  It -- it has no choice, does23   it?24               MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  If we -- if we25   couldn't formulate and express viewpoints, I would be28Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   here today in support of neither party.  And the2   Government, frankly, would be prevented from doing much3   of anything.4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't run a museum if5   you have to accept everything, right?6               MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  Now, yes -- I mean --7   yes, if it's just the simple point that we can do8   content and viewpoint discrimination in this context.9   And Forbes recognized that when the Government -- even10   if it's private speech, Forbes recognizes that as a11   curator we can do this.  An example, though, of the12   question --13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the law always14   require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position?  Aren't15   there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical16   where the First Amendment does enter in?  Do we have to1718192021   hybrid speech which seems to worry some people.  The22   Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a great example.  People23   are permitted there to put private objects next to the24   wall.  That's clearly authorized speech.  It's25   authorized public speech.  But at the end of the day,29decide this case that it's all or nothing?            MR. JOSEFFER:  Of course, the Court couldput limits on its holding if it so desired.            But if I could address the, sort of theAlderson Reporting Company￼89 10 11 12 13 14as the Government putting a painting --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  It would be -- thetrouble --            MR. JOSEFFER:  -- in a Government museum.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  I see your point, but thetrouble with that as an argument here is the privatepart of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone asOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   the Government comes around, takes it away, puts the2   nonperishable objects in a Government warehouse, and3   then decides which of them to display in the4   Smithsonian's American History Museum.5               So what starts off as public speech -- or as6   private speech, clearly becomes Government speech when7   the Government assumes control over it.  It's the same15   the public part.  So it's not going to go away at the16   end of the day, and there isn't any way that the17   Government in effect can engage in the gesture of saying18   all private speech is treated the same way, whatever way19   that might be.  So we've got a -- we've got a -- we've20   got a more difficult problem here.21               MR. JOSEFFER:  But if the Government -- take22   a museum.  The Government could choose or not choose to23   put, say, a Gilbert Stuart painting that has a favorable24   portrayal of a former president on display.  The25   Government didn't paint it.  It has Gilbert Stuart's30Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   name all over it.  But when the Government chooses to 2   put that in a -- in a display, it's the Government that 3   is speaking, and the Government, therefore, has an 4   absolute right to decide its own speech.  That should5 become -- 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:  What you are, in effect, 7   saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this 8   is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in 9   effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of10   Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a11   private identification consistent with it, but the only12   appropriate analysis is the analysis for government13   speech.  You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick14   one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government15   aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes.16   That, I take it, is your answer?17               MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  And when we are talking18   about physical objects that constitute the speech,19   that's oftentimes the case in museums, sculpture20   gardens, parks across the country.  So, frankly, there21   is -- there is nothing even unusual about it.  And the22232425   before.  So, I -- I guess it still rests on you to sayreason is that all the free speech clause does --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  There is nothing unusualabout it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge31Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   why should we submerge the private part to the2   Government part.  There may be a very good reason, but I3456   control, right?  So once the Government takes control of7   something, says this is our speech, then it's thewant to know what your reason is.            MR. JOSEFFER:  It's simply that once theGovernment is speaking, it is the one -- it turns on 8   Government speaking.  And here, I mean, it does -- 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe they can't do10   it in museums, either.  I mean, yes, we've been doing11   this for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been12   wrong all along and maybe the Government can't run13   museums.  It's possible, right?  It's a brave new world.14               MR. JOSEFFER:  And frankly, public parks are15   no less absurd, because we've been doing it in public16   parks for probably at least as long as well.  And in17   fact, there are thousands of privately donated monuments18   and sculptures in public parks across the country, and I19   suspect a great many of them don't have some formal20   disclaimer on them saying "I am the United States and I21   approve this message."  That's not the way that22   Government speech has ever been thought to work.23               The question, though, with Government speech24   turning on control, this is the easy case because we25   have a physical object that Government has both legal32Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   and physical custody over.  It chooses to display it, 2   and then it can do whatever it wants with it.  It can 3   move it, modify it, destroy it, drop it to the bottom of 4   the ocean, sell it on eBay.  So you'll never get a 5   better example of control, which this Court held in 6   Johanns is the touchstone for Government speech that's 7   not subject to the free speech clause.8 Thank you. 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.10               Ms. Harris.11                ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA HARRIS12                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT13               MS. HARRIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it14   please the Court:15               The city here gave the Eagles access to its16   public park for s display about the Ten Commandments and17   it denied Summum access for a display about the tenets18   of its faith.  That's a violation of the core free19   speech principle that the Government may not favor one20   message over another in a public forum.  The Eagles21   display here is not Government speech.  The city had22   nothing to do with the Ten Commandments Monument.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say in a public forum.24   I mean, that sort of begs the question.  I mean, that --25   that encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your33Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   answer.  Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put 2   up a monument there willy-nilly? 3               I mean, a public forum, as you know, we can 4   have praise in the park, we can have protest.  Anybody 5   can do it, so long as you get a license and you're not 6   interfering with some other group.  That's a public 7   forum.  Has this city said anybody can put up a monument 8   in this park? 9               MS. HARRIS:  Justice Scalia, there is a very10   serious factual question in this case about whether the11   city ever had a bona fide selection policy for this12   park.  But putting that to one side for a moment, a13   public park is a public forum.  A monument in a park may14   be a mode of communication for that forum --15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a public forum for16   some things.  Is it a public forum for everything?  It17   may be a public forum for processions, for parades.  But18   it is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody19   constructing a monument?20               MS. HARRIS:  If you look at the question21   that way, Justice Scalia, it might be said that a public22   park is not a forum for sound trucks, it's not a forum23   for sleep-ins, it's not a forum for news racks.24               What that means is that there is no25   unfettered right to engage in those forms of34Alderson Reporting Company￼23 24 25answer those?            MS. HARRIS:  Of course not, is how I answerthat, Mr. Chief Justice.35Official - Subject to Final Review 1   communication.  But if the Government allows it all -- 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Those are time, place, and 3   manner regulations, with which we are all familiar.  But 4   my concern is that this -- this case is an example of 5   the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels.  Because it's 6   a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for 7   parades, for protests, which are limited temporally, 8   it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all 9   of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something10   that will last 30 years for which there is only limited11   space.  It just doesn't make common sense.12131415   all unattended displays.  The Court said that in16   Pinette.  It said that earlier in Vincent.  But Because17   there --            MS. HARRIS:  And that is exactly why,Justice Kennedy, the city, any city, is permitted tomake a decision that it will close its public parks to1819   that?  I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other20   side?  I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have21   to have a statue of despotism?  Or do we have to put any22   president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore?  How do youCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How far do you pushAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review            Any city has available to it two verystraightforward options for dealing with this questionif by some happenstance they do have a monument on1234   public land that is not now a Government monument.  The5 6 7 8 9first thing they can do is adopt any existing monumentsas Government speech converts them.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  How do they do that?  Whatis the -- you mentioned that frequently in your brief,and I'm not sure what formality you have in mind whenyou say adopt.101112   ways, Justice Souter.  The way the national Government13   does it under the Antiquities Act of 1906 is they14   formally designate pre-existing structures as a monument15   of the United States or a memorial of the United States.16               And that, by the way, Mr. Chief Justice, is17   the response to the Statue of Liberty problem.  In 192418   it was so designated.19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, it's frozen into20   time.  Everything up until now is okay, but anythingMS. HARRIS:  Governments can do it different2122232425   that's our speech.  But you're challenging the abilitygoing forward is not?            MS. HARRIS:  I'm not sure I understand.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought yousaid the Government can accept what's there and say36Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9to do that going forward.            MS. HARRIS:  No.  No, Your Honor.  If theGovernment accepts what's there -- what is there now andsays that's ours, then they can say we are not taking --we have closed this forum to private speech, these parksare available only to Governmental displays.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The other side says thatsome of these monuments, especially in the Civil Warbattlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.            MS. HARRIS:  I'm sorry?            Now is that Government speech or private            MS. HARRIS:  It depends if they wereprivately formulated and handed off to the Government asa completed object, they are only Government speech ifthe Government has since then converted them --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they have to go?            MS. HARRIS:  -- by adopting them.  Theydon't have to go.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now that the Governmentconverted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- weadopt this?37101112131415   speech?16171819202122232425Official - Subject to Final Review            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- Mr. Sekulow saysthat some of these monuments, notably those in the CivilWar battlefields, do show who the donors are.Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   Government's property?  Isn't that a manifestation of 5   the Government's adoption of it? 6               MS. HARRIS:  Let me answer both of your 7   questions, Justice Scalia.  The way it does that even if 8   they -- even if a monument makes clear that it was 9   privately formulated, a Government can still adopt it as10   its own speech.  It can put --MS. HARRIS:  That has happened.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't it enough that theGovernment accepts ownership of it and places it on the111213141516171819202122   the city here refuses to do it.  If it were just a23   formality, they would check the box.  They won't do24   it --25               JUSTICE SOUTER:  If we tell them you have38            JUSTICE SOUTER:  So this case -- your claimwould disappear if this town in Utah had passed anordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?            MS. HARRIS:  It would, Justice Souter.  Wewould no longer have an equal access right goingforward --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that's -- I mean, ifthat's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kindof a -- almost a silly exercise in formality.            MS. HARRIS:  Absolutely not, Justice Souter.And the reason we know it's not a formality is becauseAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   Souter.  And I think it would be partly a concern about5   establishment clause exposure, which we already heard6   about today.got to take the monument down if they don't do it, don'tyou think they are going to pass that pretty quick?MS. HARRIS:  I don't think they are, Justice 7               I think that there are substantive reasons 8   why they might not want to adopt one version of the Ten 9   Commandments as the city's own speech.  As it happens,10   the version of the Ten Commandments on the Eagles11   monument isn't even the Mormon version of the Ten12   Commandments.  That might raise sensitivities in this13   town.  And whenever the Government adopts one version of14151617   by adopting one version.  If it's adopting the version18   by saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God,19   that's one thing.  If it's adopting it by just saying20   this is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a21   very significant place in the history of the American22 people.23 24 25            MS. HARRIS:  I think that those are --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wouldn't care whatversion it was if that's all they're doing.39the exodus account, that is not legally sensitive butpolitically sensitive as well.JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on what you meanAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5   for establishment clause purposes, Justice Scalia.  But 6   the only way the Government can be adopting anything in 7   this context is by saying through the act of selection 8   we have adopted it.  And the problem with that is that 9   the Government is not allowed to select which private10   speech it wishes to present to the public in a public11   park.12               It can do that.  It can do that in museums.13   It can do it in libraries.  It can do it --14               JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you this15   example.  Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk16   in a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was17   a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says18   right on there donated by a private neighborhood19   association to commemorate a number of people who were20   killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon.  And now if I21   searched the town records or the county record and I22   don't find any resolution saying they adopted this23   monument as their monument, does that mean that if I24   would like to put up a monument in the park to25   commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I40MS. HARRIS:  Those are very different --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nor would the Mormons inUtah, I think.MS. HARRIS:  Well, those are very differentAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that? 2               MS. HARRIS:  No, Your Honor, and really for 3   three separate reasons.  First of the all, it may be 4   that the Government -- even privately donated monuments 5   often involve a great deal of Government involvement at 6   the front end, when they are created.  Government often 7   works in partnership with private donors to create the 8   content of that monument. 9               JUSTICE ALITO:  Well what if the situation10   is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said11   we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or12   the town says fine, go ahead and do it?13               MS. HARRIS:  Even under those more usual14   circumstances there would be two things the city could15   do to keep you out of their park.  As I said, they could16   adopt the monument that is there.  The other thing any17   city can do is adopt some kind of a content-neutral ban,18   or a content-neutral limit, on the number of private19   displays it wants to have in its park.20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Harris, we -- we need a21   clear rule here.  We -- we can't expect the courts or22   the cities for that matter to investigate in every case23   what the degree of the Government's involvement in24   the --  and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent,25   36 years?  I mean, we are going to make up a percentage?41Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   That's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional 2   questions ought to be resolved or resolvable.  We need a 3   clear rule that the cities can rely on. 4               MS. HARRIS:  I agree that we need a clear 5   rule, and if clarity is important here the easiest way 6   for the Government to make clear that it has adopted a 7   privately formulated message as its own is to adopt it 8   clearly and publicly.  It can put up a plaque; it can 9   designate it a city monument.10               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there an historical11   basis for that, or you just made it up?  You think it12   would be a good idea?  I mean, if that had been the13   practice over the past 200 years for all of these14   monuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the15   landscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the16   difference is.17               But I'm not aware that there is any such --18   such requirement and any such practice on the part of19   Government.  You're -- you're creating a new world.202122232425            MS. HARRIS:  I --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may be a very nice worldbut it happens not to be the world under which ourConstitution has subjected this country.            MS. HARRIS:  If this is uncommon, that isbecause usually the Government does reserve monuments42Alderson Reporting Company￼21 22 23 24 25MS. HARRIS:  Sure.  A city could say wethink --Official - Subject to Final Review 1   for governmental speech, monuments that it helps to 2   create or monuments that it is happy to endorse after 3   the fact.  If this case is unusual, it's because 4   Pleasant Grove has done an unusual thing here by 5   allowing a private party to erect a permanent monument 6   in its park, even though it is not willing to endorse 7   the content of that monument. 8               And I do want to say that although clear 9   rules are necessary, whatever the particular details of10   how a monument came to be on public land, there are11   these two clear safe harbors for any city facing that12   problem.  Adopt it now or enact a content-neutral limit13   on the number of monuments in the park; and we think the14   city could do that on a going-forward basis.  It could15   say we have room -- for aesthetic reasons, for space16   constraint reasons, We would like --17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's all right, the18   first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up,19   okay?  It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or20   whatever else, is that it?  First 95?            JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a practicalsolution to the problem?            MS. HARRIS:  Absolutely, because any city43Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   confronting this problem now can look at its park and 2   say we have four monuments -- 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're saying the last 4   generation had much more freedom than the present one? 5               MS. HARRIS:  I'm saying that as long as it 6   does it on a content-neutral basis, because it is 7   genuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints, 8   clutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit 9   on the number of displays; and if that has the effect of10   grandfathering in existing displays --11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go back to -- your12   basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all13   instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area,14   demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks15   have been places where people can speak their minds.16   But I don't know of any tradition that says people can17   come to the park with monuments and put them up if they18   will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place19   and manner.20               So you're making an assumption that from21   time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be22   presented by anyone who wants to.23               MS. HARRIS:  No, Justice Ginsburg.24   Monuments are different from speeches and because25   monuments are different, the Court has held that unlike44Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   oratory, a city can decide to close its parks entirely2   to all private unattended displays.  It could not say,3   "We've heard enough speeches; no more speeches."  It can4567   all?8               MS. HARRIS:  Because here the city has not9   done that.  The city has not closed -- it has not madesay no private --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  If that -- it that is so,what is the point of using the public forum analysis at10   the decision that it will bar all private unattended11   displays.1213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SOUTER:  That -- that may mean thatyou have the foundation for a -- a speech discriminationargument --            MS. HARRIS:  That --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- but that would not bethe answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditionalpublic forum in -- in the sense that the Court's caseshave used the term.            MS. HARRIS:  Oh, I think --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  So it seems to me that youruse of public forum is just by kind of remote analogyhere, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you orwould help us if we used it as criterion for decision.            MS. HARRIS:  Oh, I think it may be helpful,45Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   Justice Souter, because once we know that we are talking 2   about a public forum, we know that access cannot be 3   limited on a content basis. 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, your -- you can 5   stick with it as long as you want; that's what the -- 6   the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say 7   that we were unconvinced by the comparison between 8   speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on 9   the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy.10   Would that be the end of your case?11               MS. HARRIS:  Oh, no, Justice Kennedy.  Even12   outside a public forum, in any context -- even in a13   museum or library -- in any context in which the14   Government is regulating private speech, it may not act15   in a way that is designed to suppress one particularly16   disfavored message or view; and we think that's what17   happened here.  As I said earlier --18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it does19   all the time.  The -- you don't get equal time -- the20   cigarette companies don't get equal time because the21   Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is22   bad for your health.  It always suppresses alternative23   viewpoints.24               MS. HARRIS:  When the Government is speaking25   for itself, then the Government does have a right to46Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   prefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city 2   has consistently refused to adopt the content of this 3   monument as its own, and it is still disclaiming 4   endorsement of that monument.  The city here -- the 5   justification for that Government speech exception is 6   that sometimes, as the United States has said, the 7   Government is entitled to speak in its own voice to 8   promote its own messages, its own policies.  But it says 9   it's not doing that here.10               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You will say just the11   opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten12   Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause13   grounds.  You will say something like this:  Anybody who14151617181920   there, but it's not true here?  Would anybody think that21   on public land owned by the Government the Government22   disagrees with this message?comes into this park and seeing this monument owned bythe Government, on Government land, will think that theGovernment is endorsing this message.That's what you will say now.MS. HARRIS:  Um --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now why would it be true23               MS. HARRIS:  Justice Scalia, for one thing,24   if this case were being litigated under the25   Establishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether47Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   the monument were actually Government speech, because 2   the Establishment Clause can be implicated by the 3   Government's interaction with private speech as well. 4   That said, I do not think it's the case that anybody who 5   came across this monument would know that the Government 6   is speaking. 7               The monument says it is presented by the 8   Eagles.  It has the Eagles emblem.  The mayor himself 9   testified in his deposition that he thought the monument10   was owned by the city, because it's the Eagles and not11   the -- I'm sorry; was owned by the Eagles, because it is12   the Eagles and not the city that maintains that13 monument.14               I think there is a very real question about15   what people would think here and if those perceptions16   are important the easy way to clarify it is for the city17   to step up and adopt the monument as Government speech,18   which it won't do here.19               JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't merely allowing the20   monument to be built on public property sufficient21   acceptance?  If somebody came up to you and said I'd22   like to put up a monument in your front yard, and you23   said sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting24   that -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?25               MS. HARRIS:  Your Honor, my front yard is48Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   different from a public park, and that matters because 2   when all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead, 3   put your monument in our park, that's all the Government 4   ever does when it administers access to a public forum. 5   If it's doing it on a content basis, that's a problem. 6   The Government -- 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but it doesn't -- it 8   doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner 9   restrictions for access to a public forum if it really10   is a public forum.  There is something more involved11   here.12               This is closer to the case of the individual13   who says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn.  No14   one is going to doubt that the person whose house is15   there is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me16   we are in the same situation with the monument in the17   city.1819202122232425   clear.49            MS. HARRIS:  Again, I think because it's apublic park and because public forums are always usedfor the expression of -- of ideas that the Governmentdoes not necessarily agree with --monument --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sure, but when you get theMS. HARRIS:  -- the perceptions will not beAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SOUTER:  We do not -- there is no2   pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would3   have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants4   to display a message in granite in a public park can put5   it there.  No one assumes that.  Everyone assumes that,6789   everybody may assume that, and they would be right.  Theif the granite monument is there, the city or whateverhas said, yes, we approve it, put it there.MS. HARRIS:  The city in this case --10   city in this case did say, yes, we approve that monument11   and not that one.  So you can put yours up, and you12   can't.  That doesn't solve the First Amendment problem.13   That is the First Amendment problem that the Government14   --15               JUSTICE SOUTER:  It may create the First16   Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to17   Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a18   clear adoption of the monument.19               MS. HARRIS:  If all we have, I think,20   Justice Souter, is that the city has permitted one21   private speaker to erect a monument, there is no22   constitutional or judicially manageable line between23   that and just the ordinary thing the Government always24   does when it grants preferred access to a public forum,25   which is to say you're in, you're out.  If that's enough50Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   for adoption, then there are no more First Amendment 2   violations through lack of equal access. 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but even on your own 4   criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we 5   adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced 6   with precisely the content discrimination problem that 7   you're arguing about here. 8               MS. HARRIS:  But because it's adopted it as 9   its own message, then we think the Government is10   speaking.  And when the Government is speaking, as the11   United States, said it is entitled to make content and12   viewpoint distinctions, but in order to do that, it has13   to step up and speak itself.  That's the justification14   for the Government speech doctrine.15               JUSTICE SOUTER:  You're basically just16   arguing for a clear statement rule.  I mean, Justice17   Alito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the18   fact that there is an affirmative Government act of some19   indication of approval when it says, yes, you can put20   the monument here.  And what you're arguing for is,21   well, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say,22   yes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart.  And23   that seems to be the difference between your position24   and the -- and the position that acceptance of the25   monument is enough.51Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               MS. HARRIS:  I would formulate it only 2   slightly differently, which is not so much a clear 3   statement but that those are really two different 4   things, approving it for access and adopting the message 5   as the Government's own.  And that the differences -- 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you can -- 7               MS. HARRIS:  --  that would -- 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:  You can make that 9   distinction.  There's no -- I understand the distinction10   you're making, but because I don't see that that's a11   distinction that a reasonable member of the public would12   understand to be implied by the -- or at least to be --13   to be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't14   know why it's a distinction that should be significant15   for First Amendment purposes.16               MS. HARRIS:  If what matters is the public17   perception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an18   unclear situation like this, where have you a monument19   that says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the20   Eagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it21   in the park, and that's a fact we should assume a22   reasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear.23   The Government -- there's one way to clarify that, and24   that's for the Government to adopt it.25               JUSTICE ALITO:  And when Government adopts52Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   it, can it at that time specify what it understands the 2   statement to be? 3               MS. HARRIS:  I think it can, Justice Alito. 4   It can adopt -- now the Government is speaking, now this 5   is the Government's own message, and it can tailor its 6   adoption to make clear what message it's adopting. 7               And in answer to some of Justice Scalia's 8   questions, I think the Government here could put up a 9   plaque in front of the Eagles' monument that says10   "Monument of the City of Pleasant Grove and dedicated to11   the role that the Ten Commandments play in secular law."12   It can do that.13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose the resolution of14   adoption by the City Council just says, "The City15   Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle16   Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's17   attention."18               MS. HARRIS:  I think the --19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that enough?20               MS. HARRIS:  No.  I think that the ordinance21   -- or the ordinance has to do one more thing, which is22   to -- which is to say, "This is a monument of the City23   of Pleasant Grove, we adopt the content of the24   monument," not just "we approve it."  "We are giving it25   preferential access, and here is why."53Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   the content of the speech?  In other words, if you came 8   across a monument and it said, "The Eagles are a lot 9   better than every other organization, you should give10   money to the Eagles," someone is going to walk by that11   and say, "Well, that's probably not the City, that's12   probably the Eagles."  But the Eagles, you know, for all13   the good they do, did not come up with the Ten14   Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and15   say, "That's probably the City."  They are not going to16   look at that and immediately say, "That's what the17   Eagles believe."18               MS. HARRIS:  Well, I think it's actually19   trickier than that, more complicated than that, Your20   Honor.  Again, given this monument, I think there will21   be questions about whether this is the speech of the22   Eagles.  And I actually think that, given all the legal23   sensitivities around a Ten Commandments monument, your24   average citizen, when they see a religious monument in a25   park, may well think that may be private speech because54            JUSTICE SOUTER:  You want a signingstatement as well as a signature?(Laughter.)MS. HARRIS:  Like that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it depend on --given the focus on public perception, does it depend onAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   the Government usually can't endorse or at least2   sometimes can't endorse religious speech.  So I actually3456789   of George Washington?  What kind of a resolution doesthink these questions are very complicated.            And, again, if you want to be clear aboutwho's speaking, there's an easy way to do that, which isfor the Government straightforwardly and clearly toadopt this speech as its own.                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if it's just a statue10   the city council adopt?  "We endorse everything George1112131415161718192021222324   Commandments?  "We think the Ten Commandments are worthy25   of respect and" -- and I wouldn't say "emulation"; I55Washington ever said"?            MS. HARRIS:  No.  No.  Again, and in myanswer to Justice Alito, they can adopt any resolutionthey want so long as they adopt that statue as a --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if --MS. HARRIS: -- city memorial.JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right, and I thinkthey would adopt a resolution that says, "We thinkGeorge Washington is worthy of respect and emulation onthe part of our citizens."MS. HARRIS:  And so long as that is --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it could say that, whycouldn't it say the same thing about the TenAlderson Reporting Company￼12345678   means.9Official - Subject to Final Reviewwould say "respect and reverence by our citizens."            MS. HARRIS:  So long as --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would that be enough?JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what that            MS. HARRIS:  So long as it is preceded by astatement that the city actually adopts the memorial asits own, that this is --            MS. HARRIS:  -- a Pleasant Grove memorial ora Pleasant Grove monument.101112   memorial.  The City has acquired property in this13   memorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed14   in the city park.  Period.  "We believe that the Ten15   Commandments which are embodied in this memorial are16   worthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove" --17   is that enough?18               MS. HARRIS:  It may be that if the19   Government goes on long enough, it will have connoted20   what is very important here, which is that it is21   prepared to adopt the content of that monument as its22   own.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what that24   means.  You keep saying it, and I don't know what it25   means.56JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has acquired theAlderson Reporting Company￼123456   Pleasant Grove.  Is that enough?Official - Subject to Final ReviewMS. HARRIS:  It means --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would have thoughtadopting what I said shows that it is adopting thecontent of the monument insofar as the monument says theTen Commandments should be respected by the citizens of7 8 91011   question, Justice Scalia.  If the City says what you12   just said, "We are adopting this monument insofar" and13   however it wants to finish that sentence, that is fine.14               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that's15   fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in16   Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City17   Council has allowed it to be constructed there?  Don't18   you think that's implicit?19               MS. HARRIS:  No, I don't, Your Honor.  I20   think that all that implies is that Pleasant Grove has21   decided this speech is worthy of display in this public22   park based on its content.  And that is the decision the23   City can't make.  If it were just a formality, if it24   were simple, and it's all the same, who cares?, then I25   think that Pleasant Grove would be here saying something57            MS. HARRIS:  If the City says --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or it has to say, "Webelieve in the Ten Commandments"?MS. HARRIS:  No.  No.  I understand yourAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   different, which is, "We adopt.  We adopt.  We'll check2   that box."  There are substantive reasons why it doesn't3   -- it may be a fine line --45   --67   cross it.89   "We adopt," just as I don't know what you mean by "WeJUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the City doesn't knowMS. HARRIS: -- but the City doesn't want toJUSTICE SCALIA:  -- know what you mean by10 adopt."11               MS. HARRIS:  Well, whether or not the City12   knows what we mean, what we know from the City's brief13   is that what it's saying is -- and this is on page 33 of14   its brief -- the Government speech here is only in the15   act of selection.  Selection.  It's not about the16   content of that monument.  That's not enough to make a17181920   monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas?  And21   so if the history is the same, you would know that there22   was -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille23   trying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments.  So24   he gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten25   Commandments all over because it would be good for the58Government speech, and the City is not permitted tospeak through selection, and --JUSTICE BREYER:  What do we do -- is thisAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   morality of people, and also it would help promote the2   movie.  All right?  Is that true -- is that the actual3   description here? 4 5   project -- 6 7 8 9   history of it, what does that mean?  I mean, where do we10   go with that?  Then this is in fact partly an attempt to11   promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly12   an attempt to promote a movie.  So, what do we do with13   that?MS. HARRIS:  This is part of the same EaglesJUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.MS. HARRIS:  -- that was --JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so if that's the            MS. HARRIS:  It's all a private message, andit may be a private message that has many differentelements, but nothing about that suggests Government14151617   speech.  And even if all the Government is doing in its1819202122232425public part is promoting one version of the CecileDeMille movie, it can't do that on a content basis.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  Why not?  Why --suppose that there -- there are certain messages thatprivate people had like "eat vitamins" --            MS. HARRIS:  Uh-huh.            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and so they say -- youknow, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along59Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   with a totally different content, "ride the roller2   coaster," and they say this part of the park is designed3   to get healthy children, not put children at risk.  So4   therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't5   want messages, "ride the roller coaster."  This is all6   private.  It's the -- you know -- now what?7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MS. HARRIS:  The problem is that it's apublic park, and content --            JUSTICE BREYER:  So in other words, they --the --            MS. HARRIS:  Eating vitamins and rollercoasters are not --            JUSTICE BREYER:  They can't do either.            MS. HARRIS:  No.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any case that says-- can they have playgrounds in the park?            MS. HARRIS:  They can have playgrounds, yes.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so we have right inthe playground, we have "eat vitamins," "eat your --clean up all your -- all the food in your plate," "don'tthrow food at your brother," okay?            So -- I mean --            MS. HARRIS:  Those are private messages.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, all private.            MS. HARRIS:  Uh-huh.  Okay.60Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234 or --5               (Laughter.)6               JUSTICE BREYER:  -- whatever.  So -- so7   what's wrong with that?  Where does the First Amendment8   forbid that?  You promote -- they want in this corner,9   promoting in the playground good things that they like            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because there are variousgroups that feel that's important; the city says yes, itis; and we don't want things like pull the dog's tail,10   and not bad ones.  Where does it permit it?  What's the1112131415161718   public forum.  And there is not a limit --case that says that the Government couldn't do that?            MS. HARRIS:  It's all the cases that say theGovernment can't do it.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Give one and I'll read it.Give me three; I'll read them.            MS. HARRIS:  I'll give you Pinette.  TheGovernment can't make content based decisions in a19202122   public park is a public forum.  If the Government wants23   to set aside part of that park -- change the physical24   characteristics, change the principal use and bear the25   attendant cost, it can definitely do that.  That is in61            JUSTICE BREYER:  But the children'splayground isn't the public forum.MS. HARRIS:  Oh, but the Government -- aAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   fact the answer to the sculpture garden; that's what2   happened there.  The Government waived part of what it3   been a public forum; it put up fences; it changed the4   principal use; it limited the public access.  It is no5   longer a park.  It is now a museum.6               I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  The Government7   can --89   Thank you.JUSTICE BREYER:  I see where you're going.MS. HARRIS:  Okay.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you taking this line10 1112   because you say if the city council votes for it, then13   the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten14   Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to15   vote them out?  Is that -- what underlies this notion16   that it isn't good enough for them to approve the17   placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of18   formal declaration?19               MS. HARRIS:  What underlies it is that the20   Government speech -- the Government speech doctrine is21   an exception to normal First Amendment, and very22   important First Amendment constraints.  And what23   underlies the distinction is that that exception is24   justified only when the Government is speaking for25   itself.  The Government needs to be able to promote its62Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   own messages, its own ideas.  But if it's not doing 2   that, if it's disclaiming the content of the monument, 3   saying those are not our own ideas, those are not our 4   own messages, then there is just no justification for 5   allowing it to prefer one form of private speech over 6   another.  The justification for allowing that exception 7   is missing. 8 9   here.  The Government isn't disclaiming it.  And the10   difference it seems to me between you and your friends11   on the other side is you want this clear statement.  You12   want a statement -- for example if you took Justice13   Scalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would14   also be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause.15   Isn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me.  I16   don't see that as an illegitimate object.  I was a Van17   Orden dissenter -- I mean, but isn't that what is18   driving this?19               MS. HARRIS:  Well, I do think that the --20   the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it21   wants to have it both ways.  It wants to be able to say22   this speech is governmental for purposes of blocking23   equal access rights; but not so governmental at that24   it's a big Establishment Clause problem.  So yes, I25   think there is a dilemma here for the city.63JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it's not disclaiming itAlderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            Thank you, Your Honors.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            MR. SEKULOW:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.Official - Subject to Final Review            With regard to the hypothetical about theSenator McCain or President-elect Obama signs, there isanother factor that's important here; and that is thosesigns are created by those -- usually by the campaigns.So the fact that it's created by a third party doesn'tin any way diminish the speech aspect of an individual10111213   who has put that sign in their home.  Also with regard14   to the adopt the monument, governments don't adopt15   monuments; they adopt resolutions that accept monuments.16   That's the way it worked here; that's the way it works17   in most municipalities.  That's this -- the trigger of18   allowing the monument to be displayed.  Here there are19   two.  The city -- it was approached and made a formal20   acceptance, and it was noted later in their minutes as21   well, so in two different places.22               With regard to the adoption of the speech23   problem, Justice Alito, under the hypothetical or -- not24   hypothetical, the factual situation that you talk about,25   under the Tenth Circuit's theory, the case, in64Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   Respondent's theory of the case, al-Qaeda sympathizers 2   could come in and say we want to erect a monument 3   praising the value of the terrorists, and unless there's 4   a compelling governmental interest, there would be no 5   basis on which to deny it.  That's why the whole public 6   forum analysis on this, in our view is absolutely 7   incorrect. 8               And finally on the adopt a speech, there are 9   monuments and memorials that incorporate a variety of10   message, including Holocaust memorials, and they will11   often have in place Nazi-era propaganda, the signs from12   the Nazis that were designed to draw hatred towards13   Jews; and they will incorporate those into the monuments14   and the displays.  They are not adopting the message of15   the Nazis; they are showing the history of what took16   place during an era.  That's very, very different.17               The Statute of Liberty, which was donated to18   the United States, was from the Franco-American Union, a19   private organization.  The United States -- and it's20   found in the appendix to our reply brief -- specifically21   accepted the monument, authorized the president to22   accept and they erected the pedestal.  All privately23   funded in that regard, and it was originated by a third24   party.
