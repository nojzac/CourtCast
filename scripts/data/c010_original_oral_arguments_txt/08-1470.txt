Thompkins.            Mr. Restuccia.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and mayOfficial￼1011121314   established Supreme Court precedent.  I plan to focus on15   the Miranda claim.16               Now, with respect to the Miranda claim, there17   really are two distinct inquiries at issue.  The first18   is whether Mr. Thompkins impliedly waived his rights19   under the Fifth Amendment and, second, whether he20   invoked his right to remain silent during a police21   interview.22               Regarding the waiver question, this Court23   established in Butler that there may be an implied24   waiver, even where a suspect remains silent after having25   received his Miranda warnings, where that suspect3it please the Court:            In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claimand ineffective assistance of counsel claim, theMichigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearlyAlderson Reporting Company7 8 9from that form, he participated in a limited fashionduring the interview.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he didn't -- he10   didn't waive them.  And quite unlike Butler -- Butler,11   if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you."  So that12131415   the right to remain silent.  He volunteered to talk.16   Here there was no such indication that there was a17   waiver of his right to remain silent.18               MR. RESTUCCIA:  Although in Butler this19   Court noted that -- that Butler himself had remained20   silent and did not answer the -- answer at all, or21   remained silent when asked whether he wished to waive22   his right to counsel.  So the -- the standard that was23   established from which the Michigan courts relied is24   really on this -- this language of the standard25   established from Butler, that you can -- you can imply4was a statement --            MR. RESTUCCIA:  But --Official1   knowingly receives his rights and there is a course of2   conduct that indicates waiver.3               The Michigan courts here did not4   unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly5   waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his6   rights under -- from his form.  After having read out loud￼JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that he was waivingAlderson Reporting Company14151617   carefully delineate between waiver and invocation.  So18   here the waiver occurs at the time that he is asked the19   series of questions:  Do you believe in God?  Do you20   pray to God?  Did you pray for forgiveness --21 22 23 24 25            JUSTICE BREYER:  That happened about 2hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it?that he waived, but the former certainly would beneutral.near the --MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's right.  It happenedJUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So -- so what we5MR. RESTUCCIA:  I have toOfficial1   waiver from the knowing reception, and then a course of2   conduct, because the -- the inference can be drawn from3   the words and actions of the person interrogated.  And4 here --5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me6   without more detail, which is what the circuit court7   said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your8   word -- were.  How do we -- how can we imply waiver?￼9 10 11 12            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Meaning if all he saidwas, yes, I want them in, that's much different thansaying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave,13   and he shakes his head no.  The latter might imply to meAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutesof saying nothing.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, we –           JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you say thatthat’s -- that's gone past the point where --           MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, this -- if you’relooking at what has been clearly established for thisCourt, this Court has never -- I mean, one of thearguments raised against the position I’madvocating is that there is an immediacy requirement.Well, this Court in Butler didn't say that the waiverhad to occur immediately.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's right.  But if youlook at what’s the clearly established law -- this Courtidentified the standard, what can be inferred from the101112131415161718   words and actions of the person interrogated.  And if19202122232425you look at what the two --            JUSTICE BREYER:  What they say is, “a courseof conduct” -- we will not hold -- “This does not mean adefendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and acourse of conduct indicating waiver, may never support aconclusion....”            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.6Official￼            JUSTICE BREYER:  In Butler he said:  I willtalk to you, but I am not signing any forms.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5   it's knowing and intelligent, and voluntary.  At the 6   time that Mr. Thompkins gave his answer to that series 7   of questions, there’s nothing in the course of that 8   interview that suggested that no longer did he know that 9   he didn't have to answer questions.10               JUSTICE BREYER:  But going back to Justice11   Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 212   hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver?13               MR. RESTUCCIA:  The -- the -- the waiver14   occurs at the time that he answered the question.  So the15   answer is that he didn't waiver before then, but that --16   it still is evidence to show that that course -- that17   nothing the police had done -- there were no threats --18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do with19   our case law that says that you can't infer waiver20   simply from the confession?21               MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, the --22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, we have said23   that.  So that’s pretty clearly established statement --24              MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, the --257            JUSTICE BREYER:  But the prosecution'sburden is great.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  And if -- if youlook at the two aspects of what constitutes a waiver,￼Alderson Reporting Company123456   rights.  In fact --7 8 9            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I think certainlyin -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, Iknow I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, thatthat would be using those words.10111213141516171819202122   against there being a valid waiver.  But what23   this Court has determined to be a lengthy interrogation24   were interrogations of much longer duration.  In fact,25   Miranda even talks about --8Official           JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- by the Court.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  The courts on direct reviewhave allowed -- where there’s a knowing reception ofone's rights, have allowed the answers themselves toprovide the evidence that the person did waive his￼ MR. RESTUCCIA:  But that would be --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how can you say --MR. RESTUCCIA:  That would be an expresswaiver, though.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can you say thatan appeal to someone's religious position after 2 anda quarter hours is a voluntary waiver?            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, if you look at whatthis Court has provided in terms of guidance regardingwhat constitutes a lengthy interrogation, Miranda notesthat a lengthy interrogation would be strong evidenceAlderson Reporting Company4 5 6 7 8 9lengthy interrogation.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we -- we have nodecision that says that the police, faced with a silentsuspect, goes after that suspect, questioning himincessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, thatthat is not lengthy.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, I think it's importantto remember that the factual record here was establishedby the State court, and the factual record isn't that heremained absolutely silent, but that he participated --Official1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We didn't say -- we don't2   have any decision that says the police are home free for3   2 and a quarter hours.  You said that that this was not￼101112131415161718   participating.  There’s a fundamental difference between19202122232425remaining absolutely silent and participating --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  Do -- do we have anycase that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long?            MR. RESTUCCIA:  No, and in fact --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that there can't be awaiver after 2 and a quarter hours?            MR. RESTUCCIA:  No, there's no case law to9            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He said "yeah," "no," and"I don't know."MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  But he wasAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   that effect. 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, therefore, there’s no 3   clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a 4   quarter hours is too long. 5               MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's the position that -- 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that the name of the7 game here? 8               MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's the position -- 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there a clearly10   established rule that in all of the circumstances of the11   case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one12   aspect of those circumstances?13               MR. RESTUCCIA:  I think that's right.  And14   what -- one of the --15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so that is a clearly16   established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and17   a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices.  -18               MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  The -- the case that19   I cited was Frazier v. Cupp, in which the interview20   started at 5:00 p.m. and it finished at 6:45 p.m., and21   the Court called that an interrogation of short22   duration.  And it is important to remember that this23   Court has stated expressly in Davis that once you have24   knowingly received your rights, that the knowing25   reception itself dispels the inherently coercive10￼Alderson Reporting Company23 24 25unreasonable for the State court to determine otherwise.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's right.  And, ultimately,the question is what guidance is there to the State of11Official 1 2 3 4 5   2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least?  For -- 6               MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's a very different 7   case, because there is case law -- like I cited Blackburn 8   was an interview that ran 8 or 9 hours, and this Court 9   found that that person was probably incompetent or10   insane.  But that duration is -- there's been guidanceaspect --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The question --           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your -- your positionis that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of￼111213141516171819202122   precedent.  The question is, instead, whether it would beabout that kind of long duration, whereas in our --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And does that show that –that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if therewere a waiver it would be --            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  That's thesuggestion from Miranda, that a lengthy interrogationpreceding the waiver can suggest the waiver was notvalid.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The question, ofcourse, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hoursunder all the circumstances is -- is too long under ourAlderson Reporting Company1   Michigan in applying the implied waiver doctrine to2   indicate that the implied waiver couldn't come after 23   hours and 15 minutes of interaction in which it4   concluded that the -- that the suspect had been a5   willing participant.  The testimony from detective6 7 8 9Helgert, which -- he was the only person to testify atthe evidentiary hearing, is that --            JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought Miranda held thatyou can't question a person unless he waives his right.23 24 25            Now, is it clear law that once he says "I donot waive my right," the police cannot continue toquestion him?12Official￼1011121314   Is that -- that's Miranda?  Or at least that's unclear?15   Is that --MR. RESTUCCIA:  No, Miranda in fact talksabout --after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right.JUSTICE BREYER:  You can question him even1617   prerequisite to questioning, but the waiver is not.  In18   fact --1920   the waiver.  I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a21   person hasn't waived his right.  Now let's suppose he22   says, "I do not waive my right."  Okay?MR. RESTUCCIA:  Warnings -- warnings is aJUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not talking aboutAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112   this.  The question is whether, after 2 hours and13   15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about14   Supreme Court law.  Supreme Court law is clear:  You15   cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't16   waived his right.  So then the question becomes, is it17   reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and18   15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is19   it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that20   he has not waived his rights?  Is that the question?21               MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes.  The question as I see22   it is that -- let me see if I understand.  Let me see if23   I understand your question.  There’s a difference24   between refusing to waive, saying I will not waive my25   rights.  Essentially if you make it an expressed statement13no?MR. RESTUCCIA:  If there is a --JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that clear law, yes orMR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes, that if there is --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, yes.  If that's clearlaw, would you say that at some point before the 2 hoursand 15 minutes expires where they're continuously askinghim questions and he says nothing, that it has becomeclear that he has not waived his right?￼MR. RESTUCCIA:  No.  The factual record --JUSTICE BREYER:  For the question is notAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   that you are unwilling to waive, then essentially it is2   in that case -- I want to keep this separate, but that3   would be an invocation:  I do not wish to answer your4   questions.  If you make a crystal-clear statement like5   that, it's a different question.6               But here Mr. Thompkins didn't say he was7   unwilling to waive.  He’s participating.  Now, you89 10 11 12suggest that there was silence --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You’re saying there’s adifference between a waiver and a failure to assert?            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes, exactly.  Here -- thefact pattern here is he did not say "I am unwilling to￼13   waive, I do not wish this interview to go forward."  He14   doesn't do that.  He just doesn't assert --15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You want to change the16   Miranda rule to say:  Tell someone their rights, and17   unless they explicitly say "I don't want to talk to18   you," then they implicitly under virtually any19   circumstance haven't.  That's what you believe the rule20   in Miranda and Butler and Davis sets forth?21               MR. RESTUCCIA:  Butler states that where22   there was silence after the provision of the Miranda23   warnings, silence, that where the subsequent conduct,24   where knowing reception of rights and the course of25   conduct indicates waiver --14Alderson Reporting Company22 23 24 25few comments, anyway.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's right.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why shouldn't we have arule which simply says if you don't want to be15Official1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There wasn't -- there wasn’t2   silence in Butler.  There was an express "I want to3   talk to you."4               MR. RESTUCCIA:  I understand that's the facts5   of Butler.  But the standards by which all the courts6   are operating, including the Michigan court, are the7   standards articulated by Butler.  Butler says that the89 10waiver can be inferred from the words and actions of theperson interrogated, indicating that the --￼                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My -- but we go back to the11   point you made earlier.  Your position is the moment12131415   this interview.  There were no threats.  There were nothat someone confesses, that's an implicit waiver.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  No, because there could havebeen actions taken by the police during the course of16171819   to be interrogated and doesn't say:  You know, I don't20   want to answer your questions.  He just sits there, and21   some questions he doesn't answer.  And he does make aimproper promises.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand how thisperson could just sit there for 2 hours and didn't wantAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5   wouldn't be any problem at all.  That was never said 6   here.  He, in fact, submitted to having these questions 7   asked of him. 8               MR. RESTUCCIA:  I think that that kind of 9   cuts to the nub of what Miranda says.  Miranda says that10   ultimately the statement has to be the free election of11   the suspect.  And here when Mr. Thompkins answered the12   series of questions, he knew that he didn't have to13   answer those questions, and nothing the police had done14   during the course of the interview had undermined the15   provision of rights, because it's those two aspects16   which are the core, the knowing and intelligent and when17   it's voluntary.  Nothing the police had done had18   undermined --19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why should the police have20   to play this game of, you know, an hour and a half,21   2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 5 hours, 7 hours?22   Why don't we have just a clear rule:  You’re read your23   rights; if you don't want to be questioned all you have24   to say is:  I don't want to be questioned.25               MR. RESTUCCIA:  I think that's right, that here16interrogated, all you have to say is "I don't want toanswer your questions"?MR. RESTUCCIA:  Mr. Thompkins --JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's nice and clear,￼Alderson Reporting Companylaw.MR. RESTUCCIA:  It’s a --Official 1   Mr. Thompkins at any point could have said:  I want2 to stop" -- 3               JUSTICE BREYER:  What would you do with 4   Miranda's statement "But a valid waiver will not be 5   presumed simply from the silence of the accused" -- I 6   grant you, as modified in Butler to say that the State 7   has a heavy burden of showing that the silence followed 8   by a confession -- the State has a heavy burden of 9   showing that that is an affirmative waiver.  Now, those10   I think are the two statements of law, the third being11   that after, if there is no waiver, the police cannot12   continue to question.  Now, I thought that was the clear￼1314151617181920   right, but Butler then fully explained.  And think about21   the State courts are coming in that they then -- this22   Court then made clear that even silence after having23   received Miranda warnings -- that if you knowingly24   receive your rights and there is a course of conduct25   that indicates waiver, that there can be a waiver.17           JUSTICE BREYER:  I grant you, you might arguefor a change in the law.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  But -- but this language fromMiranda that says the silence of the accused afterwarnings are given would not be sufficient, that'sAlderson Reporting Company21 22 23 24 25did not --a waiver?the point at which Mr. Thompkins waived is when he actsOfficial 1   That's exactly what the Federal courts have done on 2   direct review. 3               Now, thinking about the Michigan courts and 4   trying to determine what’s -- how these rules are to be 5   applied, the Federal courts have found, in the absence of a 6   waiver, where a suspect knowingly receives his rights 7   and then answers questions implicating himself, that the 8   answers themselves can serve as the basis for the 9   finding of a waiver.10               That's what the -- the conclusion that Mr.11   Thompkins waived here is a reasonable one.  It’s not12   objectively unreasonable.  And, of course, you have to￼1314151617181920   that here Mr. Thompkins did not assert his right.  Herecall the overarching habeas law that governs this,that not just does a Michigan court decision have tobe incorrect, it has to be objectively unreasonable.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there any differencebetween -- between waiving your right and a failure toassert your right?MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes, there is a difference,JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is every failure to assertMR. RESTUCCIA:  No, because at the point --18Alderson Reporting Company1   inconsistent with the exercise of his rights.  When heOfficialanswers questions knowing that he doesn't have toanswer, that is the waiver.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about before that?What is happening before that?2345678   right.  I mean, he hasn't said I --MR. RESTUCCIA:  Before -- in that --JUSTICE SCALIA:  He hasn't asserted his￼ 91011121314151617            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  So what happens ishe has not waived and he has not invoked.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  He has done neither.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  He has does neither.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  He has neither waived norasserted.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  And there's nothing -- theway the Miranda rule works is that the waiver is a -- isa prerequisite for the -- for admission of the evidence, but18   not for the interrogation itself.  So what happens is the --19202122232425well, if there are no further questions, I’d like toreserve my remaining time for rebuttal.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Ms. Saharsky.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,            AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4   admitted at his trial.  I’d like to go right to some 5   of the questions that this Court had about the language 6   that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler 7   decision.  Both -- all of this language comes up in 8   Butler.  Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of 9   the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to10   counsel.  So the suspect said "I will talk to you," but11   the North Carolina Supreme Court said:  Well, we don't12   know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why13   the court got into a question of implied waiver.14               So the Court in its analysis in Butler first15   reviewed this language that the Court has talked about16   this morning from Miranda that says "A valid waiver will17   not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused18   or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact19   eventually obtained."20              And this is our understanding of that language:21   First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda22   rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver.23              Now, Justice Scalia, I think you24   alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth25   Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or20            MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Respondent's confession was properly￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   they are waived.  But Miranda's an exception to that, 2   that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a 3   waiver.  The government has to do something more. 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So do you read -- yes.  So 5   do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be 6   questioning unless there is a waiver?  Then we'll go 7   on to -- or do you -- 8               MS. SAHARSKY:  No. 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay, you do not.10               MS. SAHARSKY:  No.11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So are you going to go on --12   because this is right where you are.  Are you going to go on13   to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert14   can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed?15               MS. SAHARSKY:  As long as the warnings are16   given, the accused has been told of his rights, and that17   the police will respect his rights, and questioning can18   proceed.  The Court said in Davis and said in other19   cases, Moran versus Burbine, that the primary protection20   afforded by Miranda is to level the playing field by21   letting the accused know of his rights and that the22   police will respect them.  And after the point that he23   gets his rights and understands them, the police can24   question him.  You'd have to overrule Butler to say that25   there has to be a waiver before any questioning.21￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               Just to get back to the second thing that 2   the Court said in Miranda that was picked up in Butler, 3   it said:  We are not going to assume that there is a 4   waiver simply from the fact that a confession was 5   eventually obtained; there is a burden on the 6   government. 7 8   the government can't just go into court and say:  Look, 9   we have a confession; we know he waived his rights.10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why isn't that11   language that you quote a negative inference that there12   must be a waiver?13               MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, if you look back at the14   language -- the other language in Miranda, it says that a15   waiver is a prerequisite to the admission of the16   evidence at trial.  We know that to be able to use that17   evidence we have to know that he made a knowing and18   intelligent and voluntary decision to talk.  But that19   he -- that doesn't mean he has to make the decision to20   talk right away.  He might want to listen to what the21   police have to say about the benefits of cooperation or22   the evidence that they have in his case.  And that --And the way that we understand that is that￼23 24 25those are the kinds of things the police could say thatcould be understood to be custodial interrogation.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So there’s a difference22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   between waiving at the time of the interrogation and 2   then waiving it at the time of trial?  I don't 3   understand that. 4               MS. SAHARSKY:  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to 5   suggest that.  What I'm saying is at the time the 6   Respondent makes his statements, that waiver -- there has 7   to be a waiver and it has to be a knowing, intelligent, 8   and voluntary one.  That at the time he makes his 9   statement -- here when he admitted that he shot the boy10   down, he had to understand what his rights were and11   there had -- those statements had to not be the result12   of police coercion.13               And no court here has found that they were the14   result of police coercion.  There is no question about15   voluntariness here.16               So what we understand this language in17   Butler to mean about an implied waiver is the fact of a18   confession itself is not enough to show the government19   has met its burden.  When the Court talked about a20   course of conduct, it talked about the same standard21   that it's always used in the Miranda context, that came22   up again recently in this Court's decision in Shatzer,23   which is that the ultimate question is a knowing,24   intelligent, and voluntary waiver.25               The course of conduct doesn't mean anything23￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425more than that. It means that at the time the guy spoke --JUSTICE STEVENS: But in this case, it was the fact of the concession -- the confession that constituted the waiver.MS. SAHARSKY: That shows that he decided to talk, but the confession itself isn't enough. We neededto have -- the State needed to have evidence that he understood his rights, which he said he did, and that there was -- that the confession was not the product of police coercion.And I think that that comes through directlyin the language that's at issue in Butler. The Courtsaid “an express written or oral statement of waiver” --to remain silent or the right to counsel -- “is strong proof of the validity of the waiver but not inevitably necessary.... The question is not one of form, but whether thedefendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in Miranda.”JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I just want to make sure where we are.MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: You’re not -- you’re conceding, it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?MS. SAHARSKY: Before the evidence can be24Official￼Alderson Reporting Company202122232425no -- there was no assertion of the right.            But you’re not saying that.  You areadmitting there has to be a waiver.            MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  To admit the evidenceat trial, there has to be a waiver.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why do you say it would25have to seek a waiver before they interrogate.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know why youOfficial 1   admitted at trial. 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just don't understand -- 3   why -- why can't -- 4               MS. SAHARSKY:  Okay.  It's -- 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We have to guide the6 police. 7               MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why don't we tell the 9   police, there must be a waiver before you can continue10   to interrogate?11               MS. SAHARSKY:  That would -- that would12   exact a substantial price on law enforcement, and that's13   the exact argument that Justice Brennan made in the14   Butler case that was rejected.  He was in dissent in15   that case.  He said the police should always have to --￼16171819   Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver.  There wasdidn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   change the police's behavior?  Inbau and Reid and, you2   know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers’ brief here is3   filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and4   they all seem to say things like you have to have at --5   once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with6   interrogation.  That seems to be what police today are7 8 9instructed across the country.            It says you cannot question people until he￼     indicates after the warning is given a willingness to10   answer questions.  That's the police manual.1112131415161718192021222324   police manuals that go your way?  Because I want to look25   at those, too.26            So why do you say this would extract a priceon law enforcement when the typical police manuals seemto say what the Petitioner here is saying?MS. SAHARSKY:  Not every police --JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean the Respondent.MS. SAHARSKY:  -- manual says that.  Thatbrief itself cites many examples going both ways.            It is often the case, and it is often thecase in Federal law enforcement, that the police try toseek a waiver immediately after giving rights because wewant to avoid the problems of proof that come up attrial if we don't have a written waiver.JUSTICE BREYER:  Which -- which are theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't2 have the specific citations from the brief. I -- I know3 from asking the Federal law enforcement agencies -- DHS,4 the FBI, and the DEA -- that the DEA does not invariably5 seek a waiver and that we don't understand that we need6 to get an immediate waiver.7 And, again, that was what Justice Brennan8 said in -- in dissent in Butler, is that the police should have9 to seek an immediate waiver. And the Court said, no,10 the Fifth Amendment right is -- compel -- about compelled11 statements being introduced at trial. We don't need12 this protection, that the police have to seek an immediate13 waiver. In fact, if you adopted a rule like that, it14 would essentially take any burden off the suspect to15 invoke his rights.16 He wouldn't need to invoke his rights,17 because the police would just -- if the police didn't18 seek a waiver.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you’re saying20 there -- there’s a difference, I -- I assume, between21 not waiving and positively asserting your right not to22 be interrogated?￼2324 person -- 25MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right. If theJUSTICE SCALIA: So, if -- if he had -- here27Alderson Reporting Company89 10 11 12sign, he had said, I do not want to be interrogated?            MS. SAHARSKY:  Then the interrogation stops.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.            MS. SAHARSKY:  And that --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so he has the righthe simply refused to sign the -- the Miranda form,right?Official12345   would been the -- the waiver.  And -- and you’re saying6   it's his later behavior that -- that showed that, in7   fact, he waived.  What if instead of just refusing toMS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which would have -- which￼13   to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right.  If14   he neither asserts the right nor grants the waiver, the15   police can continue to try to obtain a statement from16 him?17               MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  A contrary rule would18   have to overrule Butler, because the Court said you can19   clearly infer waiver from the actions and words of the20   person interrogated.  That assumes that the person is21   being interrogated.  Just to talk a minute about the --22 23 24 25            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there also assumesthere has to be a waiver.            MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes, at the time that theperson makes the inculpatory statements that are going28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   at be introduced at trial, it must be the case that he2   decided he was going to talk to the police knowingly,3   intelligently, and voluntarily.4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  As I read5   this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own6   statement, was to approach him and say:  This is our7   evidence.  Explain yourself -- that's the words8   the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative9   explanation.  Tell us.￼10111213141516171819   really not talking?  I've never understood how a yes or20   a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit21   said, to questions that we don't know what they were            What's clear is that at no point did heanswer those questions, because nothing about the nodsof the head or anything else showed a willingness toconfess.            And even in the responses he gave, heanswered a series of questions with a “yes,” but not withan explanation, which was what was being requested.            So my question is, how does one infer avoluntary statement from a situation in which someone's22   about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know23   that -- can reflect voluntariness?24               And I understand that in Butler when someone25   says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill29Alderson Reporting Company6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425said in response to the earlier questions, as long as at thetime that he answered questions about God, his decisionto talk was a knowing and intelligent and voluntary one.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unless, I assume, thatyou -- you -- you acknowledge that if the interrogationhad go on -- had gone on for so long that it had becomecoercive, then that -- that -- that last statement wouldnot -- would not be a voluntary waiver.            MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  But Respondentmade a voluntariness argument throughout all of thecourts in this case, and every court has rejected it.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Ms. Saharsky.            Ms. Jacobs.          ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MS. JACOBS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            When I review Miranda, I find language fromMiranda that says that you have to have a -- an advice30Official1   my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one2   could view as voluntary.3               MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  And we say that the4   waiver occurred at the time he answered the questions5   about his belief in God.  And it doesn't matter what he￼Alderson Reporting Company1819202122232425that presumption remains.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument is that youcan infer waiver of the right to counsel from conduct,but you can't infer waiver of the right to remain silentfrom conduct?            MS. JACOBS:  Essentially, yes.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your best authorityfor that proposition?31Official 1   of rights and a waiver before you question.  And I just 2   want to direct the Court to page 475 of Miranda: 3   Requirement of warnings and waiver is a fundamental 4   aspect of the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a 5   preliminary ritual to existing interrogation methods. 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What happens when 7   you read Butler? 8               MS. JACOBS:  Butler, I think, is an 9   interesting case, because Butler is mostly aimed at the10   right to counsel.  When you talk about the right to11   counsel and the right to remain silent, you have really12   two different kinds of rights.  And there’s an13   assertion requirement in the right to counsel.  You￼14151617   require that it be asserted.  It is a presumption.  Andcan't exercise that right without getting some help fromthe police.But the right to remain silent -- we don'tAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4   waiver of the -- of the right to silence.  I -- I do 5   agree with that.  And I look at the cases that have been 6   cited, and I know that there are three kinds of examples. 7               One is the person walks into the police 8   Station, and he says I want to confess.  That's a 9   voluntary confession.  You don't have to assert10   anything.  He's -- he's going to confess.11               If you have a steady stream of speech in12   which he says, I don't want to talk but I'll tell you13   about this, again, you have somebody acting voluntarily.14               Someone who says I'll only talk about drugs15   but I'm not going to talk about murder -- he’s implied16   he’s waived his right to that.17               But in this case, when you look at this18   case, the key issue really is was it volitional?  What19   fact would lead a court to decide that there -- that my20 client --21               JUSTICE ALITO:  So, basically what you’re22   saying is that if the defendant here had said at the23   beginning, I don't know whether I -- I want to talk24   to you or not, but I'm going to listen to your questions25   and I might answer some and I might answer others -- that32            MS. JACOBS:  Let me make sure that I -- thatI said yes to the right thing.You can -- I do -- you can take an implied￼Alderson Reporting Company123456789   does not apply to the right to remain silent.  So IOfficialwould be a different case?            MS. JACOBS:  Yes, absolutely.  You have animplied waiver.            JUSTICE ALITO:  And where is there -- whatSupreme Court case establishes the distinction betweenthose two situations clearly?            MS. JACOBS:  Well, Davis is a case thattalks about the assertion of the right to counsel, but￼101112131415161718192021   don't agree.

Both of those rights areOfficial 1   establish that you cannot continue the interrogation 2   until there has been a waiver. 3               MS. JACOBS:  Well, Justice Scalia, I just 4   read you page 475 from Miranda that says the requirement 5   is warnings and waiver, and that's not, as they said, a 6   preliminary ritual.  That means more.  Seibert -- and I 7   know it's a preliminary -- a plurality -- 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But does that make it clear 9   that -- that there has to be a waiver before the10   interrogation can continue?  And if it does, how does it￼square with Butler?            MS. JACOBS:  Again, Butler is really a rightto counsel case.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  They’re both under --16171819   really occurred very, very early.  There wasn't any kind20   of a gap.

That is clearly a waiver.  That isn't25   what we’ve got in this case.  You have a young man who isdon't want to -- I don't want to do something inwriting, but I'll talk to you.Now, that is a voluntary act:  I'm going to34Alderson Reporting Company476 --MS. JACOBS:  Okay.Official1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   that.  I mean, I think -- I think that Justice Scalia is12   right on that, that Miranda doesn't say you can't13   question him.  The pages that you read to us say that if14   you have a lengthy questioning, then the fact that he15   then gives a statement cannot be taken as a -- cannot be16   admitted.  That's -- that's what it seems to say on pagesitting in a chair, looking at the ground; he's sullen.The only time he looks at the officer is when theofficer directs him to look.            JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought your answer wasthat there does not have to be a waiver beforequestioning can occur.            MS. JACOBS:  No, there must be a waiver.There's no such thing as --           JUSTICE ALITO:  There must be --￼JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, Miranda does not say171819202122232425   questioning.  Am I right about that?35            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in the absence of somespecial circumstance.            MS. JACOBS:  In this case, because it went --because the interrogation lasted so long --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right?  I mean Mirandadoes not explicitly say that you cannot continueAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               MS.

JACOBS:  And I -- and I want to answer 5   you with what -- what I read.  “The requirement of warnings 6   and waiver is fundamental.”  My argument is that you cannot 7   continue to question someone who has not waived the 8   right, that there’s -- 9               JUSTICE ALITO:  So, what if the person says:10   I'm not waiving, but I'm not saying that I will never11   waive.  I’ll listen to your questions.￼121314151617   police.  In my case, Mr. Thompkins was unwilling.  He18   could -- he would not look at anybody.  He would not19   answer questions.  We don't know what the "I don't know"20   and the "yeah" was to.  So that's a very -- my case is a21   very different case than what you are proposing.  There22   is no willingness to engage with the police; there is, in23   fact, this feeling that there is coercion going on.

But that isn’t what11   happened in this case.  There was no indication by my12131415   anything.

JACOBS:  What is key, I think, in your20   -- in your hypothetical and in Justice Alito's21   hypothetical, is that you have a defendant that feels22   comfortable, that is not being oppressed by this23   coercive atmosphere.  My client did not engage in24   anything, and the longer he sat there, the greater the25   chances that anything he said was the product of37Alderson Reporting Company7 8 9JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because that was presentin Butler.Official1   coercion.23   recollection.  In the record in this case, do we know4   whether he said he understood his rights?5               MS. JACOBS:  Justice Stevens, that's kind of6   iffy.

JACOBS:  You are presuming that a13   defendant thinks that they've got the kind of power to14   look at a police officer and say, "I don't want to talk15   to you.  Remove me."     Justice Scalia, you're correct.                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So I -- boy, I -- what moredo you need?                 MS.

JACOBS:  There is nothing in -- on this13   record that indicates that he wanted to listen to them14   as opposed to what Justice Alito's hypothetical is,15   where the gentleman says:  Well, I'm not going to say16   anything, but I want to hear what you have to say.

JACOBS:  What --Official1   even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still2   want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what3   this person did.  He could have said, I don't want to --4   I don't want talk.5               And it -- and it would have ended.  That6   would have been an assertion of his right.  He didn't￼                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- he -- he sat there and10   listened.  Now, maybe he wanted to find out what the171819202122232425don't have that here.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we have it tothe extent that he was told he had right to remainsilent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you.            MS. JACOBS:  There’s no clearly establishedlaw that says that he has to assert his right to remainsilent.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it there anyclearly established law the other way, which is the40Alderson Reporting Company1234   right, that he does not have to assert it.  This is --5   this is -- the right, or the privilege againstOfficialpertinent question?            MS. JACOBS:  I think that because there isthe presumption of the -- the privilege is a presumptive 6   self-incrimination, the constitutional command, is the 7   one right that really defines our criminal justice 8   system.  It means that you cannot talk to -- the police 9   do not have the right to talk to the defendant.  It10   makes us an accusatorial system --11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’re not talking12   -- we’re not talking about the Fifth Amendment right.13   We’re talking about the Miranda warnings.  There’s no14   issue of voluntariness in this case.  Right?￼15161718   voluntary.  The suggestion is that they may have19   violated Miranda.20               MS. JACOBS:  Right.  That's correct.  But if21   you are going to adopt the suggestion of the government22   that you do pre-interrogation waiver, which I think is23   what we’re talking about -- that is, you don't give him24   his rights and then you can just talk and talk25   until you are blue in the face, that that ends up being41MS.

JACOBS:  He could -- that's fine.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And he doesn'tanswer either one.101112   cooperating.  He’s not waiving his rights.  It's not13   voluntary.  Take him back to the cell, that's it.Officiala more coercive situation than we have now.            This is the kind of situation that could1234   Thompkins, do you want to talk to us?  Instead, oncehave been easily resolved just by the officer asking Mr.￼MS. JACOBS:  Then -- then he’s not14151617   right?  That --18               MS. JACOBS:  The state of the -- the state19   of the law is a defendant does not have to invoke his20   right to remain silent.  Davis is the invocation case;21   it applies to the second stage of -- of the22   interrogation.  And it has to do with --23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was the Miranda warning24   adequate in this case?  He got the four warnings, but25   then, unlike some police forms that then ask the42Because the police --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you’re saying thenthat the defendant has to -- never has to invoke hisAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   defendant, do you waive your rights, this form never 2   asked, did you waive your rights?  It just said:  Do you 3   acknowledge that we have informed you of your rights? 4               MS. JACOBS:  That's correct, Justice 5   Ginsburg.  That's all that form said.  And what the 6   officer said is once Mr. Thompkins would not sign it, he 7   then moved into interview mode.  There was no 8   further -- if this was an ambiguous act to him, then the 9   officer should have asked a clarifying question.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say you don't11   have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that12   you can impliedly waive them.  You don't have to￼1314151617181920   waiver; that's what Butler says, right?  So the question21   under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable22   to determine that there was an implied waiver on these23 facts?24               MS. JACOBS:  The State actually found two --25   I think you’re saying that there was an objectively43expressly waive them.            MS. JACOBS:  I'm saying you don't have toinvoke the right to remain silent, that that’s not thestate of the law, that only the right to remain -- I'msorry -- the right to counsel must be invoked.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  So thequestion under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an impliedAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   unreasonable determination of the facts in this case? 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 3               MS. JACOBS:  And I think that -- 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe. 5               MS. JACOBS:  It's one way or the other. 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 7               MS. JACOBS:  And I think clearly that there 8   -- that there were facts that the Michigan Court of 9   Appeals found that were not supported by the record and10   were objectively unreasonable.11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What are those?12               MS. JACOBS:  The Sixth Circuit found that13   when the Michigan Court of Appeals said the defendant14   continued to talk with officers, the Sixth Circuit said15   that that was an objectively unreasonable finding16   because there was no continuation, there was no talking.17   They also found unreasonable that the defendant talked18   with officers sporadically.  The Sixth Circuit said that￼19202122   eye contact several times or a number of times.  And the23   Sixth Circuit said, quote -- this is what the -- theythat was a misrepresentation of the record.            The last fact that they talked about is theMichigan Court of Appeals said that the defendant made24   said that that was incorrect.  What the officer said at25   the hearing is that eye contact came only at the end,44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   one of the very -- one of the very first times came only2 at the end. 3               So -- but those are important facts.  The 4   fact that he was not continuing to talk -- he wasn't 5   talking at all.  How do you find this -- this 6   voluntariness, that the rights are waived -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, those facts are 8   relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, 9   which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and10   interrogation must cease immediately.  If we agree with11   that, then all of these facts become relevant.  But if￼1213141516171819202122232425we think that, until you invoke the right, the police cancontinue to ask you questions and it's up to you toanswer or not, then those facts are really not relevantat all, are they?            I think that's true.            MS. JACOBS:  I don't want to say it's true--            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It wasn't meant to be atrick question.            MS. JACOBS:  -- just because you are askingit.            If you invoke those -- if you invoke -- ifyou hold that he has to invoke those rights.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  On your theory, those --45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 those factual things are irrelevant, whether --2 MS. JACOBS: Well, my theory is that you3 don't get past the failure to get the waiver.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, exactly.5 MS. JACOBS: Yes.6 Returning now to -- to the idea of the7 pre-interrogation waiver, I would suggest to the Court8 that that would return this -- this Court back to the9 kind of test that Miranda stopped, which was the10 applying the totality of the circumstances test, and11 that you would then, again, revert to pre-Miranda law,12 where -- and this I believe is what the Wayne County13 prosecutor amicus wants to do, is just apply totality of14 the -- the circumstances test to whether in fact someone15 has waived their rights. And I would suggest to you that16 Miranda has not been a failure, that this bright-line rule --17 you give the rights, you get the waiver, then can you talk --18 that that’s --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say I've never20 understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's21 generally understood to be the law, that unless you get22 a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to23 terminate interrogation. I think there are a lot of24 police departments that don't -- I've never understood25 that to be the rule.46￼Alderson Reporting Company6 7 8 9is whether it is so clearly established that it wasunreasonable for the State court to think otherwise.Official            MS. JACOBS:  Justice Scalia, the opposite ofthat then becomes the ability to keep the defendant in aroom, and the longer --12345   good rule.  It may be a good rule.  But the issue hereJUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not saying it isn't a            MS. JACOBS:  And we would just suggest thatthe State court applied Moseley incorrectly and appliedMiranda, that those are the clearly established lawin that case.￼10111213   rule is a clear one.  Another clear one would be just14   the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can15   continue unless he asserts his right.  That's another16   clear rule.  We can go either way, and it will be clear.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I like clear rules.  Your17181920   client's free will.  So the government is going to have21   an even greater burden in trying to prove that this            MS. JACOBS:  But if interrogation continues,the longer it continues the less likely that thestatement that is taken is going to be the product of my22   statement was voluntary or that the waiver of rights is23   voluntary.24              So this Court should not adopt a25   pre-interrogation waiver rule, especially not one47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234   the police have to stop?  They read somebody their5   rights; the person says nothing.  Are you saying at that6   point they have to stop?that -- that ends up being as long as this case is, andjust in case --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me when 7               MS. JACOBS:  I think that they can say to 8   the person:  Do you now want to waive your right and 9   talk to us or do you want to remain silent?  I think10   that that's an easy and expedient answer.  If --11               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he doesn't answer.  He12   just sits there --13               MS. JACOBS:  Then that's it.14               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- impassively.15               MS. JACOBS:  Then that's it.16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then they have to stop?17               MS. JACOBS:  There's no burden -- I mean,18   then the burden isn't met, this heavy burden that he19   has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived20   those rights.21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't see how you22   square that with Moseley.23               MS. JACOBS:  Well, Moseley says that the24   longer that you question someone, that -- Moseley is the25   persistent questioning case, where you keep questioning48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   the guy and questioning the guy.  And this is very 2   clearly a Moseley case.  You’ve got two officers in that 3   room, and they talk about the fact that they are both 4   questioning and they talk about the different themes 5   they used.  And the very fact that they had to change 6   themes showed that the defendant was not being 7   cooperative and not -- and was not engaging in this 8   conversation willingly. 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And all he has to10   do is say:  I don't want to talk to you.  It's over.11               MS. JACOBS:  And all they had to say -- I've12   got to take the flip side -- is -- and because it's their13   house, because if they don't want to create the14   ambiguity, they are the ones that have to say:  Will15   you talk to us now?16               They don't even have to ask him to sign the17   waiver, although I think the waiver is proof positive.18   Once he signs the waiver, you know, I haven't got much19   to argue in terms of the admissibility of the20   confession.  But if they create the ambiguity, then￼21 22 23 24 25according to Miranda, that ambiguity is resolved againstthem.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understandhow they create the ambiguity.            MS. JACOBS:  Because they are leaving --49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 they're not moving off of square one. They're leaving2 this, where they are not looking for an answer to3 whether the rights want to be waived and they are4 immediately, as they did in this case, going into5 interview mode. They are going to start to question6 him.7 And this gets to Moseley, where, in fact, you8 end up where you are badgering somebody, and in this case,9 they used many different tactics: the softening technique --10 - here, have a mint.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess this12 gets back to a question I had earlier. I thought13 there was no dispute on this record that there was no14 involuntariness. We are talking about a violation of15 the technical, important but formal, Miranda16 requirements. This is not a case where the person says:17 My statements were involuntary.18 MS. JACOBS: If you are going to base this19 on an implied waiver, don't you have to look to see what20 the circumstances were that were going on? How can you21 look at the very end of a 2-hour and --22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's correct --23 and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at24 the circumstances. And you’re saying no, you don't look at25 any circumstances; they have got to ask the question and50￼Alderson Reporting Company            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The othercircumstances are irrelevant.Official 1 2 3 4 5 6   about 2 hours 15 minutes, what they are doing?  You say 7   that circumstances don't matter. 8               MS. JACOBS:  If you find that the officer 9   does not have to ask the question, does not have to10   clarify whether in fact the defendant is remaining11   silent, then I do have to talk to the rest to try and12   persuade you that in those 2 hours and 45 minutes he was13   not being cooperative, he was not willingly entering14 into --15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That issue is not in16   this case, though.17               MS. JACOBS:  Well --18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As I understand it,19   you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have20   not renewed that, correct?  This is a Miranda case; it's21   not a Fifth Amendment case.22               MS. JACOBS:  I did -- I did talk about23   voluntariness in my brief to this Court.24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your argument would be the25   same if this was compressed to 45 minutes?51he has to waive.            MS. JACOBS:  Yes.Well then, if yes, why are you talking to me￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               MS. JACOBS:  Yes. 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Same result? 3               MS. JACOBS:  Yes. 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  30 minutes? 5               MS. JACOBS:  Yes. 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  15? 7               MS. JACOBS:  Yes. 8              (Laughter.) 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One?  I mean,10   that's -- I don't want to piggyback off11   Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is12   you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say.13   Before they can say anything more, they have to get a14   waiver.  So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before15   they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how16   long do they have to ask, do you want to waive?17               MS. JACOBS:  If -- if you were going to go18   and use implied waiver, if -- and I think that you can use19   an implied waiver, you -- you are interested in looking at20   what happened in this case to decide whether, in fact,21   the “yes” answers were an implied waiver.  And that's why22   I'm arguing about the circumstances, that there's23   nothing in these circumstances that could lead you to24   believe that after 2 hours and 45 minutes, there was a25   voluntary waiver, the implied waiver.52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial12345   I won't put anything in writing.  I'll willing to listen6   to what you have to say, but I'm not going to answer            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could -- could youdescribe a situation where you think there would be animplied waiver?MS. JACOBS:  I'm willing to talk to you, but7   your questions.  And then your -- then as the89 1012   express to me.13               MS. JACOBS:  Okay.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, is --15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  Excuse me.  A waiver16   of what?  I thought the Chief Justice was talking about17   a waiver of your right to remain silent.18               MS. JACOBS:  Yes.19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That wasn't a waiver --20               MS. JACOBS:  Okay.21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- of his right to remain22 silent.23               MS. JACOBS:  Then let me give another24   example of a waiver of the right to remain silent.25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm willing to talk to you,53conversation -- a conversation ensues, and I think thisis what Justice Alito --￼                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought11   that -- that doesn't sound implied.  That soundsAlderson Reporting Company7 8 9that's the new right that you are asserting.            MS. JACOBS:  Well, it's not a new right.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  A right not to beinterrogated.Official1   I'm willing to listen to you.  It seems to me you’re2   confusing a -- a waiver of -- of the right to remain3   silent with a waiver of the right not to be4   interrogated, which is the right that you are asserting5   here, a right not to be interrogated, unless going6   in you say, I waive my right to remain silent.  That's --￼101112   It's not a new right.  The police cannot interrogate the13   defendant unless they read him his rights and my14   understanding of Miranda is that they obtain a waiver of15   those rights.16               Without obtaining the waiver, questioning17   cannot ensue, because then the rest of the questioning18   becomes trying to talk the defendant into waiving the19   rights, trying to talk the defendant into confessing,20   and you have badgering and you have persistent21   questioning, and you don't end up with a volitional22   waiver or a volitional statement.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So what --24   what is an implied waiver case?25               MS. JACOBS:  Well, it's -- the implied54MS. JACOBS:  It's -- it's not a new right.Alderson Reporting Company1234   prevail, you have to overrule Butler.  And it seems to5678   right to counsel case.  It did talk about the right to 9101112131415161718Officialwaiver case is North Carolina v. Butler.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's right.Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if youme that that's the point we're at.            MS. JACOBS:  But Butler -- I don't think youhave to overrule Butler, because Butler really was a￼     remain silent, but most of language has to do with the     fact that this gentleman did not waive the right to     counsel.                 So, I don't think you have to.  I think you     can still have implied waivers.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, there's --     so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right     to remain silent?                 MS. JACOBS:  That's a hard question, and I     don't have -- I don't have an easy answer or a hard19   answer for you.  I -- I don't think that -- I don't20   think that you want to hog-tie the police.  I agree with21   that.  I think that the police should be able to talk to a22   defendant, but there's got -- but it's got to be23   voluntary, and that in order to do that, you really have24   to get a waiver.25               U.S. v. Cardwell I think is an implied55Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   waiver where the defendant starts to talk to the officer2   there -- they’re in a police car, and the defendant3   starts to talk to the officer after an hour and a half4   of silence, although that, again, isn't a custodial5   situation, but the police found -- but the court found6   that that was, in fact, a waiver.7               So if there are no further questions, I’ll8   cede my time.  Thank you.￼9 10 11 12CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.Mr. Restuccia, you have 4 minutes remaining.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I have to say that --     page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in13   terms of a -- of a waiver.  Did -- are there -- did the141516171819   contemplates pre-waiver interrogation.  If you look at20   page 14 of the -- of the reply brief, the yellow brief,21   and the quote from Miranda talking about the processes is,22   on page 14, "Once warnings have been given, the23   subsequent procedure is clear.  If" -- it’s on page --24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What page is --25               MR. RESTUCCIA:  Page 14 on the left side in56subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that viewthat’s closer to your position?REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, I think Miranda itselfAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   the middle.  It’s a block quote from Miranda.  This is2   Miranda's description of the processes:  "Once warnings3   have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear.  If4   the individual indicates in any manner at any time prior5   to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain6   silent, the interrogation must cease."  The --7              JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, why doesn’t it --8               JUSTICE BREYER:  But I don't think that was the9   question.  The question, at least as I understood it, is￼10111213141516171819202122232425that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession intoevidence unless he has first waived it.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's right.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Then it says, clearly, thateven if the police and the prosecution testify he didwaive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, ifthere's a long questioning, even then, the court shouldbe very careful about admitting it.            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  But then --            JUSTICE BREYER:  And doesn't it flow fromthat a fortiori that if he doesn’t admit it and all thereis, is the long questioning that, there has been nowaiver?            MR. RESTUCCIA:  But here Mr. Thompkinsanswered a series of questions knowing --            JUSTICE BREYER:  He answered three57Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425questions.MR. RESTUCCIA: Right.OfficialJUSTICE BREYER: All right. One, do you believe in God? Yes.Two, do you pray to God? Yes.Three, have you asked God for forgiveness for shooting the boy? Yes.Okay. So, where -- where did he waive it?MR. RESTUCCIA: He -- that's what theFederal courts have done on direct review -- this is what Cardwell did, and there are five or six circuits have found the answers to the questions themselves can be the best --JUSTICE BREYER: So, in this case, after 2 hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just￼said, when questions, Miranda isdid he waive his Miranda rights?MR. RESTUCCIA: When he answered thosebecause the --JUSTICE BREYER: No, I think any then -- then--MR. RESTUCCIA: No, because --JUSTICE BREYER: It says you can't admit the stuffafter a long questioning unless he waives. Obviously, he says something or there would be nothing to admit.MR. RESTUCCIA: The -- that's what the58Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.Official1   Federal courts have done in applying Butler, because the2   words and actions of the person interrogated can give3   rise to the inference that the person has waived.  Where4   the person has taken action that's inconsistent with the5   exercise of his rights, it is proper to find waiver.6   The -- this --7               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask, can you go back8   to page 14 in your reply brief?  "Once warnings have9   been given, the subsequent procedure is clear.  If the￼1011121314151617181920212223   any manner that he wished to remain silent.  And until24   the 2 hours and a half later when he did answer the25   three questions, that's pretty -- it's at least arguable59individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior toor during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent,the interrogation must cease."            JUSTICE STEVENS:  So the question is whetherduring those two hours by not answering a -- a number ofquestions, did he indicate in any way that he wished toremain silent?            MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  That this -- so ifyou look at the implication analysis, did he make it clearthat I don't want to participate in this interrogation?Detective Helgert's testimony --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then it says that any -- inAlderson Reporting Company1516171819202122232425remember that this case being reviewed in habeas thatthose factual determinations are entitled to deferenceunless disproven.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            MR.

RESTUCCIA:  Well, what happens, though, 3   in Davis, this Court made clear for the purpose of 4   invocation, that the invocation has to be unambiguous 5   because the police have to know when they have to cut 6   off their questioning.  The -- so, if it's ambiguous, 7   it's ultimately, for the question of invocation, his 8   burden to assert the right to take an affirmative action 9   to show, I don't want to answer any questions.10               Detective Helgert believed, through his11   limited responses, the give and take of part of this12   interview, that he was a willing participant in the13   interview.
