PINCUSON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justiceand may it please the Court:      Florida punished the candidate seekingelection to judicial office because she signed formletters and a Web posting soliciting contributions toher campaign committee, contributions that werecompletely lawful under Florida law.  The FirstAmendment bars Florida from prohibiting that speech.      The threshold question, of course, is whatstandard of review.  We submit that strict scrutinyapplies, the standard that was applied by the courtbelow, for several reasons.  First of all, this isobviously a content­based restriction.  It turns on thecontent of the speech, does it solicit a campaigncontribution.      My friend relies on this Court's decision inMcConnell to justify applying the closely drawn scrutinystandard that has sometimes been applied to campaign3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 contribution limitations. That standard does not apply2 for several reasons.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, whatever the4 standard, suppose the Florida rule was simply no5 face­to­face solicitations. That's it.6 Would you concede that that would be a valid7 regulation or would that fall under the First Amendment8 as well?9 MR. PINCUS: Well, I certainly would concede10 it in this case, Your Honor, because my client did not11 engage in any face­to­face solicitation. So that would12 eliminate the sanctions against her.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I want to understand your14 view of the scope of the First Amendment in relation to15 the selection of ­­ the election of judges.16 MR. PINCUS: I think a state could adopt a17 prophylactic rule prohibiting face­to­face solicitation,18 certainly one­on­one solicitation and perhaps as some19 states have done solicitations in larger groups.20 There might be some applications of that21 rule that were ­­ that made that rule invalid as22 applied, for example, a face­to­face solicitation of23 one's relatives that have nothing to do with the24 judicial system in the state at issue. But I think the25 First Amendment would certainly allow the adoption of4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that sort of rule.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG:3 would not allow that for the candidate for political4 office.5 MR. PINCUS: Exactly.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are making it ­­7 you are recognizing that there's a difference between8 judicial office ­­ that the First Amendment allows the9 State to do things with respect to the election of10 judges that it wouldn't allow them to do with respect to11 the election of members of the legislature.12 MR. PINCUS: Well, I guess I would amend my13 answer to say that ­­ that the First Amendment might14 allow a ban on some solicitations on a coercion theory.15 Let me step back. There are three government interests16 that have been advanced in this case to justify the17 rule.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yeah, but I just asked19 you ­­ you gave me an answer and now are you telling me20 that that answer was ill considered? That is, a ban on21 face­to­face solicitation by candidates for judicial22 office, good or not? And it ­­ would it be judged by23 the same standard as a ban on face­to­face solicitation24 by political ­­ candidates25 MR. PINCUS: I think it would be judged by5Alderson Reporting CompanyBut the First Amendment25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:It seems to me when youOfficial￼1 the same strict scrutiny standard, but I think the2 interests that the government could advance in support3 of that restriction in the judicial context, one of them4 doesn't exist in the legislative context, the interest5 in preventing bias or in preserving impartiality. And6 one, the interest in preventing coercion of the person7 solicited, I think, applies somewhat differently in the8 legislative context than it does in the judicial9 context. So I don't want to say that there's no ban on10 solicitation that would be permissible in the11 non­judicial context. There is a federal statute that12 bans Congress from soliciting ­­ members of Congress13 from soliciting Federal employees, for example.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you had the statute15 that you say would be valid barring face­to­face16 discrimination, then you have all sorts of gradations.17 What about a personal one­on­one letter? How is that18 different? I can just see the Court having to say,19 well, this is what, I guess, under ­­ under­inclusive.20 And then if we say, well, the one­on­one letter, that's21 almost like a personal solicitation, we can ban that,22 then what about a letter to five people? And then we're23 off to the races.24 MR. PINCUS: I think ­­6Alderson Reporting Company25 coerced.Official￼1 make the initial concession, you have a real problem in2 determining how to make this not over­ or3 under­inclusive.4 MR. PINCUS: I don't think so, Justice5 Kennedy. I think the Court, in other contexts, has6 certainly drawn a line between written communications7 and oral communications. In the lawyer solicitation8 context, for example, the Court has drawn that9 distinction. So I think there is a reasonable10 distinction that it says whatever the rule might be,11 written communications are fundamentally different if12 the interest that the government is asserting is13 coercion. And I ­­14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which is it?15 You know, if we meet somewhere and I take out a tablet16 and write something down and hand it to you. Is that17 written or oral? It's at least not oral.18 MR. PINCUS: I guess I would say "in19 person," Your Honor.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In person.21 MR. PINCUS: I think the question here ­­22 again, just to back up for a minute, is in ­­ I think in23 all of the contexts that we're talking about here, the24 interest is whether the person solicited is being7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. PINCUS:JUSTICE SCALIA:    Back all the way up ­­Sure.                             ­­ and give us the threeinterests that you started off saying were at issuehere.  You never did get to that, did you?MR. PINCUS:JUSTICE SCALIA:(Laughter.)MR. PINCUS:I didn't, sorry, Your Honor.    Oh, it's your fault.                         There are three interests.One, the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.One, the interest in promoting impartiality/preventingbias.  And third, the interest in protecting personssolicited against coercion.      JUSTICE SCALIA:judicial dignity?MR. PINCUS:      JUSTICE SCALIA:don't let judges do that we let other people do.  Suchas, it's at least a tradition ­­ I'm not sure whetherit's in any ethical rules, but let's assume it was inethical rules ­­ that judges do not respond in op edpieces to criticisms of their decisions.

I'm4 not sure ­­ I don't believe that it suffices to support5 the prohibition here for 6 all ­­several reasons.  First of    No, no, but answer myokay?Would it be okay to ­­    An interest in judicial      JUSTICE SCALIA:dignity.  There are certain things that are infradignitatem, as we say.MR. PINCUS: I think there is such an interest, and I think it's executed principally through the acts of judges as judges and maybe is best analyzed under the government employee free speech rubric. So it doesn't necessarily have to reach a compelling interest in order for it to justify some restrictions on the judge's speech.I think, in this context, to the extent thatthat interest doesn't apply for several reasons ­­ first of all, we're talking about the campaign context, which is different. Second of all, to the extent the interest would apply, here a fundamental principle of ­­ of Florida's regulatory scheme is that judges may write9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 thank you notes for contributions. So they can say,2 thank you, but they can't say thank you ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if Florida law didn't4 let them do that ­­ what I'm trying to find out is if5 you think you can have different rules for judicial6 elections than you can have for political elections. I7 mean, we're told by the Florida judges who filed a8 brief, that they had a horrendous problem with9 corruption and they wanted to get a handle on it. So10 they made this small step.11 MR. PINCUS:12 JUSTICE GINSBURG:13 MR. PINCUS:14 Justice Ginsburg, yes, there can be different rules.15 Because two of the interests that I mentioned, the16 interest in preventing impartiality and the interest in17 preventing coercion, apply differently in the judicial18 context. So I do think that in your hypothetical could19 Florida prohibit in­person, one­to­one solicitations or20 in­person solicitations to a group of some size as21 states have done, yes, I think they could do that and I22 don't think that could be done for legislative or23 executive branch candidates.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose a state's view is25 we want the ­­ our judiciary to be above the political10Well ­­      And they ­­To answer your question,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 fray so we have this kind of restriction on putting2 themselves forward as ­­ as the solicitor.3 MR. PINCUS: Well, a couple of answers, Your4 Honor. I think the problem with a state having that5 interest is the state has adopted an election system6 that puts judges in the political fray. So as the Court7 said in its opinion in White, some things necessarily8 come with the fact that a state has made the choice to9 choose judges via election and that includes the fact of10 an election and some First Amendment requirements that11 apply to election­related speech. So I think that's the12 problem with making that decision.13 A second problem is the particular scheme14 that Florida has adopted here, which as I said, does15 allow the judge involvement in the contribution system.16 The judge can know who solicited, can know who gives and17 can write thank you notes. So once Florida makes those18 decisions, the decision to prohibit ­­19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how can the judge20 not know? Especially if some states want disclosure, is21 the judge supposed to not read the disclosure list?22 Everybody else does, he doesn't?23 MR. PINCUS: Well, there are some states24 that prohibit the judge from finding out who ­­ who25 knows; Minnesota, for example, has that prohibition.11Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:that ­­ that's just unworkable.MR. PINCUS: I think there's a question about how effective it is, but I do think thatundermine ­­ underlies what's really going on here.That any incremental benefit that is served by a prohibition on solicitation, given the reality that the judge knows and especially given the fact that the judge can write a thank you note ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're suggesting that there could be a mass mailing, but the judge somehow could be prevented from knowing who responded?MR. PINCUS: Well, that is the rule in some states and I don't ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking you whether or not that is consistent with your theory of where we can draw the constitutional line.MR. PINCUS: Well, I don't ­­ I think the Court could conclude, as ­­ as the Eighth Circuit did, that in Minnesota, a state like that, where the judge doesn't know, there is even less of a ­­ of a reason to prohibit solicitations because the judge isn't going to know who responded.JUSTICE SCALIA: Good, honest, Midwestern state, they're not going to tell it.12Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, that ­­ it seemsOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go back to2 judicial dignity coercion.3 It's very, very, very rare that either by4 letter or by personal call that I ask a lawyer to do5 something, whether it's serve on a committee, help6 organize something, do whatever it is that I'm asking,7 that that lawyer will say no. Isn't it inherent in the8 lawyer­judge context that people are going to say yes.9 MR. PINCUS: Well, two, I don't think so,10 Your Honor. In this ­­ in this solicitation, although11 Petitioner was a candidate, there ­­ there was no12 response.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14 MR. PINCUS:15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:16 MR. PINCUS:17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:18 this ­­ this is ­­ this prohibition is dealing with an19 issue that does happen in the vast majority of cases.20 MR. PINCUS: I guess, here's the contrast,21 Your Honor, if I may. I guess the question is what's22 the difference between that letter and the following23 letter that's signed by the members of the committee,24 which is totally permissible under Florida law: Dear25 Joe, As an attorney frequently appearing before the13       Well, I ­­But I ­­ I think ­­       Because she was unknown.­­ even when she ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyBut I'm talking aboutOfficial￼1 county court, we're sure you're concerned with the2 quality of the judiciary. Judge Jones personally asked3 us to serve on his campaign committee, and we're writing4 to ask you to contribute to his reelection. As you5 know, Florida law permits Judge Jones to thank6 contributors.7 I think once all those things are8 permissible, who makes the solicitation really doesn't9 make that much of an incremental difference ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well ­­11 MR. PINCUS: ­­ in an area where we're12 talking to about compelling interest.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ that's ­­ that's what14 you think, but I can actually see how receiving a signed15 letter from the judge saying, give, and ­­ or a16 telephone call or a personal meeting has an17 incrementally greater impact than a letter. I get ­­18 even today I get a whole lot of campaign committee19 letters, and I just throw them out.20 If ­­ if a candidate calls me or reaches out21 to me, I tell them I can't talk to them and I can't22 give, okay, but I have a23 doesn't have that reason24 MR. PINCUS:25 least one line that ­­ that I think is permissible in myreason and an excuse.  A lawyeror excuse.And I think that's why, at14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 response to Justice Ginsburg is a line between written2 communications and oral communications, either3 one­to­one or in­person communications one­to­one in a4 small group. I think the coercive effect, to the extent5 there is one, is clearly greater there.6 And the question in ­­ in the First7 Amendment context where we're talking about core8 critical speech where the Court recognized, both in the9 charitable contribution cases in Schaumburg and Riley,10 as well as in McConnell, that it ­­ it is the11 intertwining of substantive messages and requests for12 contributions that make both effective. Where you're13 severing that, there has to be a really good reason.14 And in the written communication context at least, we15 submit, as Judge Sutton for the Sixth Circuit, and as16 the Eleventh Circuit and as the Ninth Circuit have17 found, there isn't enough there.18 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything in ­­ in19 the Florida rules ­­ I couldn't find it ­­ that would20 prohibit Judge Jones in your example from giving the21 committee a list of people to contact?22 MR. PINCUS: I ­­ there is a rule that says23 that judges can't ­­ or candidates can't do indirectly24 what they do directly. And I frankly don't know whether25 the Florida bar would interpret the giving of a list15Alderson Reporting Company7 systems, that the8 lawyer to a judge9 something normal,normal response to a lawyer ­­ by ain any minor request or, you know,the answer is yes.  That's until theyOfficial￼1 to ­­ to circumvent that rule.2 JUSTICE BREYER: But your problem ­­3 problem, in a way to decide this, and it's a sort of4 joke but it's so true in the experience of the court of5 appeals that I had, my brother in the district court,6 district court judges I know, in State and Federal10 get out the door.11 get out the door.12 But that is such a common experience, that13 when the judge says, can you please ­­ yes. That's the14 answer. And you have to learn how to interpret when15 they really want to do no. And ­­ and that's ­­ that's16 almost universal. And I thought that's why they're ­­17 they're writing the rule the way they do.

And6 I ­­ and I think that's one of the problems.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't the proof of the8 pudding in what Justice Breyer is saying in the9 statistics? One of the briefs mentioned that those10 candidates who can fund­raise personally do appreciably11 better in collecting money than the candidates who have12 to go through a committee. So what would be the13 difference, other than the fact that there is some form14 of personal coercion in the presence of the judge asking15 for the money?16 MR. PINCUS: I don't think so, Your Honor.17 I think the difference can ­­ can ­­ I mean, obviously I18 don't know about where the statistics come from, but19 even assuming that the statistics are right, it seems to20 me in a system where we vote for a person, a message21 from that person that combines what they stand for with22 the request for a contribution makes that request for a23 contribution more effective, not because it's coercive,24 but because it's tied to what the person stands for, and25 those parts of the message are effective when they come18Alderson Reporting CompanyIt's anybody, which reallyOfficial￼1 from the person themselves.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think ­­ I think you'd3 find the same statistics true with respect to political4 candidates, that they do much better when they ­­ when5 they put the arm on you personally, rather than having6 somebody else contact you. I can't imagine that'd be7 any different.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:9 isn't it?10 MR. PINCUS:11 point to ­­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:13 MR. PINCUS:14 the point if that arises from coercion. And as I just15 said, I'm not sure that that's right. I think we don't16 know.17 We also don't know whether those statistics18 involve States that permit one­to­one, in­person19 solicitation, which obviously is quite different from20 the sending of a letter. And in those States ­­ and21 there are ten of them ­­ obviously those ­­ that is22 fully equivalent to the solicitation process in ­­ in a23 legislative or executive race.24 So I think we don't quite know, but I think25 it would be drawing the wrong conclusion to say the only19Well, that's the point,Well, I think it's only the       When you put the arm ­­I'm sorry.

I think there are a2 number of other more likely explanations.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Pincus, I take it it4 follows a fortiori, from what you're saying, that the5 Federal canon that applies to us is unconstitutional, at6 least as respects to written communications, so we're7 not allowed to put our name on fund­raising materials8 and things like that. I take it you're saying that,9 too, that's got to go as well; is that right?10 MR. PINCUS: No, I don't think so, Your11 Honor. As I ­­ as I said in responding to ­­ to Justice12 Scalia, I think the leeway that the Federal government13 and the States have to regulate the judges and other14 employees because of inconsistency with their duties15 this Court has said is much broader than it is and16 meets ­­ does not have to satisfy the compelling17 interest test as this particular restriction does. So I18 don't think it at all follows.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, I really didn't20 get that. Why does it not ­­ why is ­­ why ­­ why is21 the restriction on us constitutional whereas ­­22 MR. PINCUS: You're Federal employees.23 You're government employees. And so the Court has said24 in Pickering and other cases that the government,25 whoever the responsible rule­making authority is, has20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 much more authority to regulate the speech activities of2 government employees.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG:4 the already elected judge when5 reelection?6 MR. PINCUS: Well,7 JUSTICE GINSBURG:8 a rule: Judges don't solicit,9 for themselves. So we have a judge; he's a State10 employee. I take it from your answer and in applying11 Pickering to a government employee that the sitting judge12 can be restricted.13 MR. PINCUS: No, I don't think so, Your14 Honor, because I think this is speech in a different15 category any ­­ any more than the government can say,16 we're going to use Pickering to respect the solicitation17 speech of a sitting congressman or State legislature.18 I think it is the election context and the19 fact that the State has chosen to choose its judges via20 election that triggers the protections ­­21 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, you know, I would22 think ­­ I would think it's ­­ it's just the opposite,23 right, that in a case for Federal judges ­­ like you24 say, there's not really much of an interest. Who cares25 whether I solicit funds on behalf of my old law school.21Alderson Reporting CompanySo Florida could regulatehe's running forI think ­­And he could say, we haveperiod, for charities,Official￼1 It doesn't have anything to do with what rulings I'm2 going to issue, who I'm going to favor, who I'm not3 going to favor.4 In this case, the State can really come in5 and say, you know, the things that we're objecting to,6 the solicitations that we're preventing are exactly the7 ones that are going to go to whether this judge can be8 an impartial judge rendering fair verdicts.9 MR. PINCUS: I think that's wrong on two10 counts, Your Honor. I think there is ­­ again, where11 the judge can know who contributed and can write a thank12 you note, the idea that prohibiting the judge to asking13 contributes in any way ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you're ­­ I'm sorry.15 Please.16 MR. PINCUS: I'm sorry ­­ contributes in any17 way to the protection of that interest seems18 inconceivable if the question is, is there bias?19 What Florida has basically made ­­ made a20 basic determination that a thousand dollar campaign21 contribution limit is going to protect our interests22 against bias.23 And so the question, then, is: Are any of24 these other activities going to create such an25 appearance?22Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And where the State has said a thank younote, which seems more ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. You keep on going back on that. But, I mean, do you think it would be allowable for the State to say, no, that even the chairman can't ­­ can't make those solicitations? So you keep on falling back, well, they allowed the chairman or they allowed the thank you notes.      So now let's say, you know, the State says,look, we've been trying to do this because we've beentrying to narrow the law in order to accommodate FirstAmendment interests; but if you're going to throw thatback in our face, we'll apply it to the campaign chair,too.  We'll apply it to thank you notes, too.  Thosewill also be impermissible.      Would that be constitutional?MR. PINCUS: I think if the State wanted to adopt a system of public financing for judicial candidates, that it might well then be constitutional for the State to ban solicitations on the McConnell theory.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the answer to Justice Kagan's question?Is it, oh, well ­­MR. PINCUS: I don't think ­­23Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 answer that question because we ­­ we can think about3 something else?4 MR. PINCUS: I think the answer to that5 question is no, because the contributions are still6 permissible. And the line that the Court drew in7 McConnell, in terms of solicitation limitations, was8 it's quite permissible to ban candidates from soliciting9 contributions that cannot lawfully be made to their10 committees when there are other avenues ­­ when they can11 still solicit contributions for their committees.12 I think it would be quite a different13 situation to say, yes, we're going to have an election,14 but no one can solicit any money for the campaign15 committee because, as the Court has said, money is ­­ is16 essential to get the candidate's message out.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The whole ­­ but the18 whole effort on Florida's part is to make the selection19 of judges not like the political context.20 And you ­­ what you're saying is that21 they ­­ if they choose to elect their judges, they can22 do it only one way and the same rules apply to the23 judges that apply to candidates for the State24 legislature.25 MR.

I think there are twodistinctions.  One is, I do think once Florida saysthank you notes are okay, it can't ban solicitations.There might ­­ it might have a better case to justifyits State interest if it didn't do that.      And I do think, as I said, the coercionrationale applies differently with respect to judges andwould ­­ would permit limitations that don't apply.      If I may, Mr. Justice, I'd like to reservethe balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Richard.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY RICHARD       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. RICHARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I'd like to begin by responding to JusticeAlito's question.  The answer is that there's nothing inFlorida law or in the canons that prohibits a candidatefrom giving names to the committee for the purpose ofthe committee soliciting from those individuals.      What the Florida canon is designed to do issomething that this Court has recognized previously inBuckley and McConnell, which is to cut the direct linkthat creates the quid pro quo relationship by keeping25Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE SCALIA:JUSTICE SCALIA:Unless it's a thank youI mean, once you say youMR.

RICHARD: Well, if ­­ if what we focus12 on, which is what my colleague and opposing counsel13 focused on, is the intimidation issue, I agree with you.14 Either the intimidation issue or the effort to curry ­­15 to ­­ to say you've curried favor, I agree with that.16 But there's another factor here that this Court has17 recognized is almost equally, if not equally important,18 which is the appearance of the quid pro quo and the19 appearance of corrupt influence that is inherent in the20 quid pro quo that the ­­ that results in a public loss21 of confidence in the judicial system.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's23 not always such an appearance. What if a judge calls,24 you know, a college classmate, says, you know, believe25 it or not I'm a judge and ­­ and I'm running for26Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 election. Could you give me some money? Direct ­­2 direct in person ­­ or direct solicitation. But nobody3 would say there's any real risk of corruption because4 he's calling up his old friends, let's say, who's not ­­5 they're not lawyers.6 MR. RICHARD: I think, Your Honor, that what7 we deal with here, in response to your question, is8 similar in kind to this issue of how many people are9 being addressed.10 This Court has said that in circumstances11 like this, the Court has no scalpel, to use its words,12 as to where to draw the line. The question is what's13 judicially manageable?14 And so the question then becomes where15 there's going to be a line drawn, is it unreasonable for16 the State to say, we're just going to prohibit it, we're17 not going to try to micromanage who it is ­­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's a19 difference between micromanaging and overinclusiveness20 or under­inclusiveness. I mean, could ­­ this could be21 easily limited to litigants or lawyers appearing before22 the Court.23 MR. RICHARD: It could be, Your Honor. But24 then the question is what the appearance to the public25 is; and the second question is, because it's always a27Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question in First Amendment cases, how does this weighagainst the imposition on the candidate's FirstAmendment rights?      This Court has recognized ­­ it did in ­­ inboth Buckley and McConnell ­­ that one of the reasonsthat it upheld it and one of the reasons that it applieda lesser ­­ a lesser standard of review was because itsaid that the imposition on ­­ on the ­­ on thecommunicative value of the contributions was marginal.      In this case, it's even more marginal.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I ­­ be careful with that line because there's a number of Justices on the Court that dissented from that ­­MR.

RICHARD: I ­­ I ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So assuming that's not the argument, what's the better response?MR. RICHARD: No, I understand. I understand, Your Honor. Perhaps it was ­­ it was not the best way to lead into it. But my point here ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you only need five votes, and there were five votes there.(Laughter.)28Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't be too intimidated.MR. RICHARD: I'm getting to try to get your vote as well, Justice Scalia. I haven't reached that point yet. But ­­ and I understand it's a high mountain to climb, but ­­ but the point here that I'm trying to make is that this is an extremely minimal imposition of the candidate's freedom of expression, if there's any imposition at all.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they ­­ could Florida apply this canon to candidates for political office?MR. RICHARD: You're saying could it?JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. If Florida says, we think it's such a good idea for the judges, we want to make it across the board, no candidate for political office can make a direct appeal for money.MR. RICHARD: I think it would be far more difficult to convince the Court that that would be constitutional, and here's the reason: It's because of what Justice Kennedy has recognized as what he coined the ­­ the good responsiveness and the bad responsiveness.      In a democratic society, in a republicanform of government, candidates in the other two branchesare expected to commit themselves in advance to certain29Official￼Alderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE SCALIA:responsiveness, I thought.Why?

A judge ­­ a judge can't campaign, you know, I'm going to be tough on crime?MR. RICHARD: That's a ­­ that's a different issue, Your Honor.MR. RICHARD: Well, I think that's responsiveness to an issue; and I think the judges do have preconceived positions, but not responsive to an individual.JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, okay.MR. RICHARD: That's the difference, and it's a big difference.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there really a ­­ the prospect of the appearance of partiality if you have a radio ad that ­­ with the judge and says, you know,30Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 these ­­ this is my philosophy, please send me a2 contribution? Is anybody going to think, oh, that judge3 is not ­­ is going to be partial to one side or another?4 MR. RICHARD: Well, I ­­ I think that two5 things are occurring there.6 The answer to your question is, I don't ­­ I7 can't presuppose who's going to think he's partial, who8 isn't. I understand your point, Your Honor. I think9 certainly, you don't think that he's partial to a given10 individual at that stage, but that solicitation is a11 solicitation of a quid.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, go back for a second, to13 me, because I actually think judges should try to keep14 their preconceptions under control and decide the15 individual case. And I think that is a widely shared16 perception and I think that Florida has every right to17 say we want to further that.18 But what is your distinction between what I19 took as an important argument on the other side, and20 maybe you've said it already but I want to hear it21 again. Florida lets judges write thank­you notes for22 contributions so there is direct contact and the person23 who has given the money knows that the judge knows that24 he gave it.25 MR. RICHARD: That's right.31Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. RICHARD:      JUSTICE BREYER:judge."      MR. RICHARD:      JUSTICE BREYER:To say what?

RICHARD: I understand, but I want to useevery weapon I have in my arsenal.      So the first answer is that at the time thatthe money is being solicited the contributor, if it issolicited through a third person, doesn't know whetherthe judge will ever find out.  He can find out, but theperson making the contribution doesn't know whether thejudge will ever find out, whether he's ever going toreceive a thank­you note or not.

So what's the                          My second argument?                                What ­­ my ­­                             I want to know what thedifferences are, which is a main point that was arguedthat once you say they can write a thank­you note, andindeed, as you've added, in the initial letter you canMR.

That's theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 does exactly the same, it adds nothing but you don't3 have to deal with every problem. I've got that answer.4 Do you have any answer that says it does add something?5 If so, what?6 MR. RICHARD: I believe that Florida could7 prohibit the thank you note as well, but it doesn't8 change the fact ­­ by not prohibiting, it does not9 undermine the fact that by telling judges that they10 cannot personally, face­to­face or by buttonhole or by11 telephone call solicit it, that it does reduce12 significantly the public's impression of the fact that13 there is a quid pro quo.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you ­­ if you write a15 thank­ you note, you are not a mendicant. You are not16 going around holding your hat out asking people for17 money. But you're not relying on that, are you? You're18 not relying on the judicial dignity ­­19 MR. RICHARD: I am not.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ the dignity of the21 office that is held or sought? That ­­ that's ­­ that22 has nothing to do with Florida's rule.23 MR. RICHARD: I'm not relying on that, Your24 Honor, I believe that if we're talking about25 expressive conduct, that it's unlikely that this Court34Alderson Reporting CompanyOne answer is to say itOfficial￼1 would uphold it based upon the dignity of a given judge.2 It's possible that if the action rose to the point where3 it undermined the public's confidence in the judiciary4 as a whole, it might be sustained. But I agree with you5 that if all we're talking about is the dignity of a6 judge who is going around with a hat, I think that7 probably would not be sufficient for this Court to8 uphold it. But ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: First of all ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the whole idea11 of the Florida Supreme Court when they adopted this rule12 is just that, that they wanted to put judges above the13 political fray, so they didn't want them to seek14 contributions. Call it dignity, call it the integrity15 of the judiciary, call it the public shouldn't perceive16 of judges as being political officers, so we shouldn't17 say an election for a judge is the same thing as an18 election to the legislature. The whole idea is to put19 the judiciary in a separate category. I thought that20 was Florida's idea.21 MR. RICHARD: Well, I think that's true,22 Your Honor. It's not only Florida's idea. I think it23 clearly reflects the culture of this Nation, because24 virtually every State has adopted significantly higher25 standards of ethics for their judicial branch than for35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the other two branches. And I think that goes to2 Justice Kennedy's distinction between the good and the3 bad responsiveness which is ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I think you5 answered Justice Breyer a little too quickly.6 If the letter ended with, "I'm going to tell7 the judge you gave me money," then there might be a8 violation of that other code that doesn't permit a9 candidate to do ­­ to try to circumvent the personal10 solicitation rule.11 MR. RICHARD: Thank you, Your Honor. I12 agree with you.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, number two: You14 had started, I think, in answering the question of the15 quid pro quo difference between a thank­you and the16 initial ask.17 MR. RICHARD: Yes. And ­­ and of course the18 one area where this Court has consistently recognized19 that the State can validly regulate contributions and20 solicitations is in its effort to break the direct quid21 pro quo, the direct communication between the judge22 requesting the money ­­ in this case a judge as opposed23 to the ­­ even in the other two branches, the Court has24 recognized that, but the judge requesting the money25 directly from the person who would be contributing.36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And when one envisions what does not exist2 in Florida and most States at the current time, which is3 a judge being able to pick up the telephone or visit any4 lawyer who ever appears before him, or for that matter5 any nonlawyer who might end up appearing before him or6 before her, and ask for a contribution, and compare that7 to a third person saying to a voter or a contributor,8 "My friend, Joe Smith, is running for judge and I would9 appreciate it if you would give me money," I think it10 would be difficult for anyone who has lived in our11 society for any significant period of time to say that12 it is not a significant difference, and the public13 recognizes that. And the effect of it ­­14 JUSTICE ALITO: We have before us a case15 involving a particular person. She did something and16 she was disciplined for it. So don't we have to compare17 what she did and some ­­ the thing which is regarded by18 the Florida law as being unethical, and what she could19 have done, and see whether there ­­ the incremental20 difference has any significant relationship to any21 interest that this rule is supposed to serve? Does22 it ­­ was there a greater danger of quid pro quo23 corruption or the appearance of corruption or bias or24 coercion, the difference between what she did and what25 she could have done?37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And what she could have done as I understand2 your answers is the following: She could have ­­ a3 letter could have been sent by a committee and the4 letter could have ­­ could have said that Petitioner5 gave us your name and asked us to solicit a contribution6 from you, and that's what we're doing. And the letter7 could either say, "and we'll let the judge know if you8 gave a contribution" and ­­ or the candidate know, and9 she can write you a thank­you note, she will write you a10 thank­you note if you contributed. Or, you speak for11 the Florida bar, so you said it would be okay to put12 that in the letter, but if that's not, at least you13 could put in the letter and under Florida law the14 candidate can see the list of people who contributed.15 So those are the two situations. Now why16 was there any greater damage done by what she did as17 opposed to what you admit she could have done?18 MR. RICHARD: Well, I would say the greater19 damage again goes to the fact that she is personally and20 publicly requesting a quid from people who can be21 expected to appear before her. And it is Florida's22 concern over the public's reaction to that, which I23 would suggest is a fair concern and24 in the other two branches is a fair25 public's confidence in the judicial38this Court has foundconcern over thesystem.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 the judiciary, is it? I mean, to ask ­­ for a judge to3 ask for a quid puts pressure on people to give it. And4 that is a different evil than their simply knowing what5 happens, and I would say probably worse. To send a6 thank­you note is a form of politeness that creates7 knowledge, but does not to the same degree put pressure8 on the person to contribute.9 Now, is that fair or not fair?10 just say yes because you think it's on your11 because I'll have plenty of people pointing12 that it isn't necessarily a good argument, if it isn't.13 MR. RICHARD: Your Honor, I ­­ I think it is14 clearly a good argument because it's difficult for me to15 give you another reason because you said it so16 eloquently. But I do believe that there is a17 significant difference between a judge requesting18 specifically a contribution or later saying thank you19 for the contribution.20 Now when you add to it what if the letter21 said the judge will know about this later, that murkies22 the water a bit, although there's no evidence that's23 ever ­­ ever been ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richard, there is25 something that the other side has said about your39Alderson Reporting CompanyIt's not just confidence inAnd don'tside,out to me25 the line there.Official￼1 position and I'd like your answer to it, that is that2 what you are advocating will help the people who are3 already in the judiciary, the people who have lots of4 money so they don't need contributions from others, the5 people who will be hurt are like Ms. Yulee, who is6 trying for the first time. In other words, the Florida7 bar has set up a system that works in favor of8 incumbents, yes, current officeholders and the rich.9 MR. RICHARD: I disagree with that, Your10 Honor, and I find it curious that the Petitioner would11 suggest that if we take the restrictions off of12 incumbent judges so that they're now free to call13 lawyers who appear before them or litigants who might be14 appearing before them and ask for money, that that15 wouldn't give the incumbent an enormous advantage over16 non­incumbent judges. It seems to me that it would.17 But we're also dealing here in an area in18 which there is no evidence either in the record or in19 the literature to suggest that it makes any difference20 and also ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry, but22 you ­­ up to this point you've been saying what a23 significant difference it makes whether someone can24 solicit in person or not, and that's why you've drawn40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And now you're telling us, well, it doesn't2 make much of a difference at all.3 MR. RICHARD: No.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that5 it's ­­ it's self­evident, particularly in judicial6 races, where that the ­­ prohibiting a form of raising7 funds is to the great advantage of the incumbent because8 the only way that, in most judicial raises, the judge ­­9 incumbents are going to be challenged if you have10 somebody who can get their own distinct message out.11 MR. RICHARD: Well, I have two responses,12 Your Honor, and excuse me if I didn't clearly express13 myself in my response to Justice Ginsburg's question.14 But what I'm saying is, clearly, when you15 tell an incumbent judge that that judge can personally16 solicit money, that's going to give an incumbent judge,17 who has far more intimidation power, an advantage over a18 non­incumbent. And as to weighing which is going to19 give more or less advantage, it's difficult to answer20 that question, and generally this Court doesn't find21 itself in the business of equalizing the playing field22 in any case. So I don't know that it makes any23 difference.24 But the other fact is that we have no25 evidence in this record or in the literature or in the41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 case law to suggest that this is a factor. It ­­ under2 any circumstances.3 The other thing I'd like to comment, if I4 might go back to the question that Justice Alito asked5 me earlier, is I think that there is another linkage6 here that's important, which is this: If you look at7 the difference in the impact upon this Petitioner's free8 speech between sending a letter to one person or9 personally confronting one person and, on the other10 hand, sending it to 5 or 10 or 50 people, if it would11 even be manageable to make a distinction, it doesn't12 move the free speech needle in this case one iota13 because there's very little impact upon that candidate's14 free speech. No matter how many people the candidate is15 talking to, the candidate can still say anything he or16 she wants to about qualifications, about issues, about17 cases, about anything he or she wants to. This Court18 said so in White, and the Florida canon doesn't attempt19 to put any restriction on it.20 The only thing it says is you can't say to21 me, give me money. And this Court has recognized in22 Buckley and in McConnell that the only communicative23 value of saying, give me money, is that when you get24 money, it enables you to broadcast your message more25 widely. And the Court has said that that only rises to42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425constitutional level when the restriction is go greatthat you can't broadcast your message reasonably.      Here, the committee can raise money, and wehave no evidence, again, in the record, the literature,the case law, that ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: And ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Where did we say that?

And so what you're left12 with is no imposition, appreciably, on a candidate's13 expressive ability.

What you've been saying before is it's just a15 little bit that we prohibit, so don't worry about it.16 And ­­ and I mean the ­­ the prohibition was limited to17 the important area. It's face­to­face that is18 important. And now you're saying it's no big deal19 because they can do all these other things. How do you20 reconcile those two positions?21 MR. RICHARD: Well, I'm not saying that it's22 no big deal. I don't think we can ever say that when23 we're dealing with free speech.24 What I'm saying is that this Court25 historically has weighed the degree of imposition45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 against the substantial interests that the State is2 attempting to serve. In this case the State is serving3 an interest that this Court has recognized, at least in4 the area of the quid pro quo, that the State that has5 not only a substantial ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER:7 justice shall not be sold8 mean, that's at least 8009 defines the role of the judge, which I think it does,10 you're saying that it isn't. It is a ­­ you do look to11 the degree to which you are interfering with the free12 speech, which is some degree, some, and it's not speech,13 it's really how you solicit money; and on the other14 side, how that interferes with that basic role of the15 judge. So then is it not relevant?16 But the interference, even with raising17 money, which is at one degree from speech, is small.18 MR. RICHARD: I believe it is relevant. I19 believe that this Court, in almost all of its major20 First Amendment cases, has asked that question.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, 800 years ago,22 judges were not elected. I mean, I appreciate the23 challenge you're ­­ you're under. You're kind of24 backing and filling.25 The fundamental choice was made by the State46   Where does it come from,nor shall it be denied?  Iyears old.  And if thatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 when they said we're going to have judges elected, and I2 mean, you're kind of, as I say, you're trying to patch3 the problem there.4 But, I mean, you have a situation where the5 people in the State have said we're going to have judges6 elected and we're going to recognize that you can7 contribute to judges because of there are contribution8 limits.9 It seems to me you ­­ you're under a great10 burden in trying to figure out how you're going to fix11 that without contravening the First Amendment.12 MR. RICHARD: It is a great burden, Your13 Honor, and ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it a great burden?15 Does it change because you elect the judge, that you're16 changing the fundamental role of the judge?17 MR. RICHARD: I don't mean that it's a18 great ­­ a great burden to make that point. What I mean19 is that we have election of judges, which many people20 think is a burdensome system for selecting judges for a21 lot of reasons.22 But the fact is we have that, and Florida,23 under the United States Constitution, is entitled to24 have that. And what's more, in order to change the25 Florida Constitution, 60 percent of the voters of47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Florida would have to vote to change it, and a2 substantial number of the voters in Florida have voted3 to change it unsuccessfully, and so what we're faced4 with is we're faced, as we said in the brief, with the5 reality that Florida is trying to weigh two fundamental6 constitutional interests and find a reasonable7 compromise. One is the interest in free speech. The8 other one is the undeniable interest, because it's9 essential to a stable democracy, of having a judiciary10 which avoids both the reality and the appearance of11 corrupt influence.12 JUSTICE ALITO: If we looked at ­­ if13 somebody looked at the contributions to the candidates14 in an election for a county court judge in Florida, what15 percentage of the contributions would be found to have16 come from practicing lawyers within the county who17 appear in ­­ who appear before that court.18 MR. RICHARD: That's not in the record, Your19 Honor. However, studies have shown, I think, not only20 in the county court but in all judicial elections that21 the great ­­ the large percentage of the contributions22 come from practicing lawyers. And I think that that's23 where judges naturally seek the contributions. Thank24 you Your Honor.25 JUSTICE SCALIA:48Alderson Reporting CompanyThat could be eitherOfficial￼1 because lawyers expect judges to respond by favoring2 their cases or it could be that lawyers care more ­­3 MR. RICHARD: I think ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ about who the judges in5 the courts are; isn't that quite natural?6 MR. RICHARD: I think that's true, Your7 Honor.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd be surprised if the9 statistics were any different, but it doesn't show any10 corruption whatever. It just shows that lawyers want11 good judges and care more about it than the average12 citizen does.13 MR. RICHARD: I think that's absolutely14 true, Your Honor. But I think that what we're concerned15 about is the two things that this Court has identified16 in the past, which is avoiding the potential for17 corruption that the Court has found is inherent in the18 quid pro quo relationship; and, as importantly, avoiding19 the appearance of corruption that the public sees.20 And if I can address one more thing, Your21 Honor, because I am responding to your question, I22 understand that Your Honor does not believe that Buckley23 was decided correctly and the day may come when Your24 Honor persuades this Court to recede from the parts that25 are applicable here. But in the meantime, I think that49Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it is reasonable to urge the Court respectfully that thesame rules that apply or at least the minimum degree towhich the Court has applied these rules to the other twobranches, needs to be applied to the judicial branch.But there's certainly no basis ­­ it would be totallyinappropriate to carve out a right that judges have thatthe Court has not accorded to the other two branches, andthat this case is an example of where that consistency isimportant.Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus, you have four minutes left.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.      I want to start out by pointing out, becauseI think it's important, that all of the examples that mycolleague used about buttonholing people in the hall andcalling people one on one are one­to­one, in­person orin­person over the phone solicitations, not the kind ofwritten communications that are at issue in this case.And I think that's because it is very difficult to saythat a written communication fits either of their twointerests, and I think it's important to keep themseparate ­­50Official￼Alderson Reporting Company22 compromise and maybe23 this would be a ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER:25 think until Citizensif rational basis applied here,         A rational basis but IUnited in one opinion, which wasn't51Official￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN:2 Suppose I'm a judge and I say Dear Joe, you've been in3 my courtroom many times and I hope I've always been4 fair and I know you're going to be here some more times5 in the future, and I hope I always will be fair; and6 you know I'm running for judge and I'd really like a7 contribution of a thousand dollars, signed Judge Smith.8 MR. PINCUS: And I think the ­­ the issue,9 Your Honor, is the campaign committee under Florida law10 can write that exact same letter and can start by11 saying: Joe, as you know ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: It can't say "I." It's a13 very different letter.14 MR. PINCUS: It can say, I'm writing on15 behalf ­­ I'm one of the people who Judge Smith16 personally selected to solicit funds for his campaign17 and then say the rest. And I think the ­­ the18 difference in coercion there is really immeasurable and19 doesn't rise to the level of a compelling interest.20 I think it's important to make another21 point, which is my colleague said a reasonableAlderson Reporting CompanyWell is it Mr. Pincus?Official￼1 the majority in the more recent case, the Court had2 never used the words "strict scrutiny" in respect to3 campaign contributions periods. And I don't think it's4 used the words "strict scrutiny" either, ever, in5 respect to First Amendment limitations in respect to6 what judges say. Am I right about that or wrong? I'm7 not positive.8 MR. PINCUS: I think it did use "strict9 scrutiny" in White, Your Honor, and I think that was a10 case about what judges say.11 JUSTICE BREYER: In White.12 MR. PINCUS: But it also has used the strict13 scrutiny standard with respect to charitable14 solicitations, and I think it will be an odd state of15 affairs if charitable solicitations got less protection16 under the First Amendment than election­related17 solicitations, given that election stands at the core.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you say that right?19 MR. PINCUS: Yes, that it should get more20 protection, I'm sorry.21 And just to go back to Justice Breyer, your22 question about coercion, I think it's important to23 separate coercion and quid pro quo because they get24 mixed up. Quid pro quo and preventing the appearance of25 quid pro quo corruption is an interest the Court has52Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425found compelling with respect to all elected officials.     So I think if you expect ­­ accept mycolleague's argument that preventing the appearance ofquid pro quo corruption is sufficient to bansolicitation, then there's no reason why Floridacouldn't say, such a great idea, we're going to apply itwith respect to legislators I think you ­­ the focushere, I think, really ends up being on coercion.MR. PINCUS:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. PINCUS:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Well, I want somewhere ­­       Can you point to ­­I think corruption ­­       I hope you don't wantOfficial￼     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     MR.

PINCUS: That goes to a different question, Your Honor, I think, which is bias. And I53Alderson Reporting CompanyI'm sorry, your ­­ yourOfficial￼1 think there's a difference between quid pro quo2 corruption, which is a quid pro quo deal, a corrupt3 deal, and judges being unbiased. So I think my4 colleague refers to quid pro quo corruption because I5 think he wants to use the Court's analysis in McConnell,6 which I think is inapplicable anyway, but I don't think7 it's possible to say that quid pro quo corruption should8 be the basis here.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,10 counsel.11 The case is submitted.12 (Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in
