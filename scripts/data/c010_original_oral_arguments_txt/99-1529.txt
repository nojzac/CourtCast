KILBERG      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. KILBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it7 8 9next in Number 99-1529, Donna Rae Egelhoff v. Samantha101112131415161718192021    provisions.22              Turning first to section 514, this Court has23    made clear that a State law relates to an employee benefit24    plan if it mandates employee benefit structures or their25    administration or binds plan administrators to particularplease the Court:          Washington State's divorce revocation lawstrikes at the very heart of ERISA's comprehensiveregulatory scheme for employee benefit plans.  It does soby purporting to revoke ERISA plan beneficiarydesignations upon divorce.          We submit that the Washington statute ispreempted by ERISA on two independent grounds.  First,because it relates to an ERISA plan within the meaning ofERISA's express preemption provision, section 514(a) andsecond, because it conflicts with ERISA's other3 1    choices.  Washington's divorce revocation statute has 2    precisely that forbidden effect. 3              As applied by the courts below, the statute 4    invalidates the beneficiary determination and benefit 5    payment scheme provided for by the terms of the ERISA 6    plans here and instead mandates payment according to a 7    different State-imposed scheme.  Moreover, the 8    determination of beneficiary status, and the payment of 9    plan benefits, lie at the very heart of ERISA's concerns.10              Indeed, the determination whether particular11    alleged beneficiaries are entitled to obtain plan benefits12    is so crucial to the entire Federal scheme created by13    ERISA that such benefits claims are deemed to arise under14    Federal law under this Court's decision in Metropolitan15    Life v. Taylor even if they purport to raise only State16    law claims.17              QUESTION:  Of course, what you say applies18    exactly similarly, I take it, to a State statute that19    would say, if A murders B, A shall be treated as having20    predeceased B for purposes of inheriting from B, or in a21    word, A can't inherit from B.  All that you've said would22    apply to that similarly, so what's the difference?23              MR. KILBERG:  If that were a State law, then it24    would be preempted.25              QUESTION:  In other words, you're saying that4 1    basically this ERISA preempts all of what you call the 2    slayer statutes, I guess, that traditionally have said you 3    can't inherit from a person you murder. 4              MR. KILBERG:  It preempts the slayer statutes. 5    However, the slayer rule may very well be incorporated 6    into ERISA, because the slayer rule was extant at the time 7    of ERISA's passage in 1974, was a common law rule, and had 8    been applied in numerous cases, Federal cases with regard 9    to a death benefit statute, so it was a gloss on the law.10              QUESTION:  All right.  So does it also11    incorporate statutes where people die simultaneously?12    There are a complicated set of State rules as to how you13    treat what assets for purposes of inheritance.14              MR. KILBERG:  It may encompass simultaneous15    death, a simultaneous death rule.16              QUESTION:  All right, so if it -- now we have it17    interpreting a considerable area of State probate law.  Is18    there any reason why Congress would have wanted ERISA to19    preempt a traditionally State-regulated subject like20    probate and -- you know, at least where it doesn't21    interfere with some important policy, or -- I don't know.22    I mean, you see the -- that's what I want you to address.23              MR. KILBERG:  I can imagine where you're headed,24    Justice Breyer.  Yes, the answer, of course it preempts25    those laws.  There's no reason to believe that it doesn't.5 1    We're talking about employee benefit plans.  There's 2    nothing more central to an employee benefit plan than 3    benefits, how it pays them, to whom it pays them, and 4    ERISA has specific provisions with regard to the exception 5    for State law with -- in the context of the payment 6    employee benefit plans in a divorce situation. 7              QUESTION:  I'm not sure about you -- how you 8    distinguish the slayer statute.  You say it's been around, 9    it's part of the common law, it's part of the background.10    Why -- suppose the case we have here has been around a11 long time.12              MR. KILBERG:  Well, the difference, Justice13    Kennedy, is that the slayer -- the slayer rule was part of14    the common law, was part of the common law of trust at the15    time that ERISA was enacted, and it may be presumed that16    the Congress, seeing that as a backdrop, incorporated,17    impliedly incorporated the slayer rule into ERISA.18              QUESTION:  But not simultaneous death statutes,19    because they vary from State to State, or --20              MR. KILBERG:  Well, I'm not sure about21    simultaneous death statutes, quite frankly.  They may,22    too, have been incorporated, but with regard to a divorce23    revocation rule, that was not the state of the common law24    in 1974.  Indeed, it's not the state of the law now.  Very25    few States, fewer than a third of the States have any sort6 1    of divorce revocation rule.  Only 10 States have 2    developed -- 3              QUESTION:  May I just -- is your point that it 4    was the law before ERISA was passed, or that it's part of 5    the common law. 6              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct. 7              QUESTION:  I mean, which is true?  In other 8    words, supposing this statute had been passed before 9    ERISA.  Would that make a difference?10              MR. KILBERG:  No, not the statute.  If -- if the11    divorce revocation rule had been commonly accepted in the12    common law at the time ERISA was passed and had been used13    as a gloss --14              QUESTION:  So your point is that --15              MR. KILBERG:  -- on similar Federal statutes --16              QUESTION:  Your point is, the other was a common17    law rule, not the timing.  The timing is --18              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct.  Well, it's really19    both, Justice Stevens.  It is that it is a common law rule20    and it was a common law rule at the time of ERISA's21    passage in 1974.22              QUESTION:  Yes, but you've said that if there23    had been a statute which is in effect that wouldn't have24    done the trick.25              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct.7 1              QUESTION:  Well, when you say a common law rule, 2    we're dealing with a country with 50 different States.  I 3    mean, don't you think the law might have been different in 4    some of those States? 5              MR. KILBERG:  Not with regard to the slayer 6    rule, in fact, and indeed what is important here is that 7    the slayer rule had been applied in Federal cases as a 8    gloss to death benefit statutes, and so one can assume 9    that the Congress, or one can rule that the Congress had10    impliedly incorporated that common law rule into ERISA.11              QUESTION:  Even in the face of a provision in12    ERISA that says benefits have to be paid to the named13    beneficiary?14              MR. KILBERG:  With regard to the slayer rule, if15    it had been incorporated into ERISA, then it would be16    incorporated as an implied exception.17              QUESTION:  What is the mechanics of the working18    of a plan?  Supposing that you have a designated19    beneficiary, and the insurance company or whoever goes and20    pays -- goes on and pays out to the beneficiary.  In fact,21    the beneficiary killed someone and he's disqualified from22    inheriting.  If he's still the named beneficiary, is the23    insurance company responsible for that sort of an error?24              MR. KILBERG:  Yes, they would be responsible25    under those circumstances.  The plan administrator has to                                   8 1    make a decision as to whether a benefit is to be paid out. 2    The plan administrator does so by looking both to ERISA 3    and to the terms of the plan. 4              QUESTION:  Well, does he have to look into a 5    whole bunch of factual matters like, you know, whether 6    this beneficiary might be disqualified by some State, 7    State statute like the slayer's -- 8              MR. KILBERG:  No.  No.  He would not look at 9    State law.  He would not have to look at State rules10    unless, not finding the answer in his plan, and not11    finding the answer in ERISA he may choose to look to State12 law, but --13              QUESTION:  It seems to me that would be a much14    narrower ground for ruling in your favor here, rather than15    these general assertions about the incorporation in the16    common law, that perhaps if a State statute actually17    directly affects the designation of a beneficiary, the way18    the Washington statute does, it may be different than the19    slayer statute.20              MR. KILBERG:  But we believe that State law, Mr.21    Chief Justice, that a State law like this, which is22    essentially a rule of decision for employee benefit plan,23    is preempted both as a matter of express preemption and as24    a matter of conflict preemption under ERISA.25              QUESTION:  But you agree that your argument is91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425stronger -- let's assume that the statute does notincorporate slayer statutes, or simultaneous deathstatutes --          MR. KILBERG:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- or simultaneous death rules.Would you agree that your argument is much stronger thanif you rely on conflict preemption than if you rely onstatutory relating-to preemption?          MR. KILBERG:  I believe it's equally strong.          QUESTION:  Well, if it's a flat conflictpreemption, it seems to me relatively easy for us to say,look, the statute says, beneficiaries or plans designatethe --          MR. KILBERG:  Participants.          QUESTION:  -- participants or plans designatebeneficiaries.  This says they don't.  Clear conflict.          But if you get to relating-to preemption, whichwe do not find it easy to understand, then it seems to methe force of the argument for anomalous results which mycolleagues were making is simply a stronger argument,because the concept of preemption is a comparativelyweaker concept.          MR. KILBERG:  Well, obviously, we believe thatthere is both conflict preemption and express preemptionhere, and the Court can certainly, as it did in Boggs, not10 1    reach the question of express preemption and go off on 2    conflict preemption, but -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, except your -- I think the 4    point being made is that your preemption is stronger if 5    you're willing to swallow the bitter pill of not including 6    the slayer statutes, but once you say the slayer statutes 7    don't pose any conflict, it's hard to see why they pose 8    any more of a conflict than -- or, excuse me, any less of 9    a conflict than the statute here.10              MR. KILBERG:  In Ridgeway v. Ridgeway, which was11    a decision of this Court involving the Servicemen's Group12    Life Insurance Act, the Court noted the slayer rule and13    determined that it did not have to deal with it in the14    context of that case and that it was an extreme example.15    The Court certainly is free to do the same in this context16    and that, I believe, was also an express preemption.17              QUESTION:  Mr. Kilberg --18              QUESTION:  But is -- is the answer that you gave19    in talking about the administrative burden -- my20    understanding, and correct me if I'm not right, that this21    statute says that if a trustee of a plan doesn't know22    about this problem, he doesn't have to pay, and if he does23    know about the problem, he doesn't have to pay until the24    State courts resolve it, and if that isn't good enough, he25    can opt out of the whole thing just by putting a sentence111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the plan that says, I opt out, in effect.          So where is the administrative burden, and is itthe same -- they also say there are 47 other States thathave similar statutes, and so I'm trying to get an ideafor what this administrative burden is.          MR. KILBERG:  Oh, indeed, as we point out in ourbrief, I believe it's at footnote 8 on page 20 ofpetitioner's brief.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. KILBERG:  It's also described in amicusbriefs for the National Coordinating Committee and in theWestern Conference of Teamsters.  In fact, the State rulesvary dramatically.  Most States do not have a divorcerevocation rule at all.          Most States, more than two-thirds of the States,the rule is simply that you go with the main beneficiary.It is in a handful of States that you have divorcerevocation rules, and they vary among themselves, so thereis that burden that plaintiffs would have to deal with.          Moreover, the opt-out provision that you'rereferring to in this State law merely adds another layerof complexity.  Now, in order to opt out you have to meetyet another State standard, so at the end of the day --          QUESTION:  Which is?          MR. KILBERG:  Well, which is that you have to12 1    specifically opt out, and you have to opt out in the 2    manner in which the State tells you you have to opt out. 3              QUESTION:  And you may not know which State is 4    the State that will govern. 5              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 6              QUESTION:  But before we get into that, I'm 7    still a little confused on the nature of the common law 8    that we're talking about.  As I understand you, 9    Mr. Kilberg, you are not talking about the common law of10    California or Massachusetts or anything.11              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct.12              QUESTION:  You're talking -- and you're not13    talking about the pre-Erie general common law, either.14    You're talking about what Judge Friendly called, in praise15    of Erie and the new Federal common law.  That is, Federal16    common law that fills in the interstices of Federal17    statute, so you would not be incorporating any particular18    State's slayer rule.19              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct.20              QUESTION:  But it would be a Federal, a true21    Federal common law rule.22              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct.23              QUESTION:  And that with all Federal statutes,24    or most Federal statutes, there will be a penumbral area,25    and what would fill that in would not be the law of any13 1    particular -- common law of any particular State, but 2    Federal common law. 3              MR. KILBERG:  That's correct.  I'm talking about 4    the common law of trusts, Federal common law, which in 5    prior decisions of this Court has been understood to apply 6    to ERISA but, more importantly, or as importantly -- 7              QUESTION:  I mean, if there is such a Federal 8    common law I suppose we could invent a -- you know, the 9    same spousal substitution rule that the State has done by10    statute here.  I mean, if there is -- if we have that11    common law power to say, fill in the interstices in12    statutes --13              MR. KILBERG:  I'm afraid not, Justice Scalia.14              QUESTION:  No?15              MR. KILBERG:  I was moving on from Justice16    Ginsburg's question to distinguish between Federal common17    law which is incorporated into a statute, because it is18    the common law against which the Congress legislates,19    which is what I would be referring to with regard to the20    slayer rule, and that would be the common law in extant in21    1974 that had been applied in other Federal cases to other22    Federal death benefit statutes.23              There is also a notion that if a statute does24    not answer a question, if there are interstices that the25    Court -- a court may apply a Federal common law rule, but14 1    that's not the case here.  Here, ERISA speaks specifically 2    to the issue at hand, and I believe -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, of course, that's the question 4    in the case, whether it does. 5              But suppose there's an ambiguity in the 6    designation, that there's a State rule of law that would 7    resolve, would the trust look to the State rule of law or 8    would it look to some Federal common law rule about 9    ambiguities.  For example, say the beneficiary named my10    son Joseph, and it turns out that the -- that he has -- he11    gave the middle name Joseph to four different sons, and12    how would you go about resolving that?  Would you look to13    a State rule or a Federal rule?14              MR. KILBERG:  It looked -- it would be the plan15    administrator's choice.  It would not be a decision under16    State law, and the plan administrator would look to see if17    there were any guidance in the plan, in Federal common18    law, and then the plan --19              QUESTION:  He would confine his inquiry entirely20    to the terms of the plan itself?21              MR. KILBERG:  He -- no.  He may -- in making a22    decision he may, of course, look to State law if he23    chooses.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Kilberg, the Washington supreme25    court seems to have analyzed the decedent's life insurance151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425policy separately from the pension plan in doing thepreemption analysis.  Do we have to consider those twoplans separately, or do we apply the same analysis to bothof them?          MR. KILBERG:  I believe we can apply -- theCourt can apply the same analysis for both of them withone exception.  One of our arguments is that there is aconflict with ERISA's antialienation provision.  Thatprovision, which is found in section 206 of the statute,applies only to pension plans, but all of our otherarguments would apply to both welfare and pension plans.          If the Court has no further questions, I wouldlike to reserve the remainder --          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kilberg.          Ms. McDowell, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MS. McDOWELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Washington statute relates to employeebenefit plans within the meaning of ERISA's expresspreemption provision and also conflicts with severalspecific provisions with ERISA.  Accordingly, whetherviewed as a matter of express preemption, conflict16 1    preemption, or appeal preemption, the Washington statute 2    in its application to ERISA plans is preempted. 3              QUESTION:  Suppose, Ms. McDowell, you have a 4    trustee under an ERISA plan who has a designated 5    beneficiary and so forth and perhaps, you know, ambiguity 6    as suggested by Justice -- something else -- and then you 7    have simply a trust company that has exactly the same 8    provisions but it's not an ERISA plan.  Are -- does -- are 9    their duties different?  Say when you come to an10    ambiguity -- you're both sitting in Seattle.11              MS. McDOWELL:  As a practical matter, they may12    do essentially the same thing interpreting the terms of13    the plan, or whatever instrument governs it.  The key14    question is what happens after the plan makes the decision15    in the ERISA context.  That decision is subject to review16    and an action under ERISA section 502(a).  In that sort of17    action the Federal court would apply common law.18              QUESTION:  So -- but would the Federal common19    law likely be different from the State of Washington's20    law, or is it just up for grabs, kind of?21              MS. McDOWELL:  In many instances the appropriate22    rule would presumably be for the plan administrator of the23    ERISA plan to look to State law for guidance, for example,24    in determining who was a spouse, who was a child, et25    cetera.  It would only make sense for the ERISA plan to171    essentially require looking to the relevant State law that2    creates the relationship.  That's not so, however, where3    the State law is one that conflicts with the provisions of4    an ERISA plan such as the one here, which --5              QUESTION:  May I ask two questions?  First, do6    you agree that the State law here is a law of general7    applicability?89 10 11 12 13          MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  It refers toinsurance, but it's more general.          QUESTION:  My second question is, in weighingthe various interests at stake here, should we give anyweight at all to the interests in carrying out the wishesof the former employee who -- whose assets are being14    distributed?1516171819202122232425          MS. McDOWELL:  No, we shouldn't          QUESTION:  We shouldn't.          MS. McDOWELL:  In the first place, we don't knowhis wishes.  In the second place --          QUESTION:  Well, we know he presumably wasadvised by a lawyer, who was a State lawyer who told himwhat the State rule of law was, and presumably he was toldhe could rely on the fact that he didn't have to changehis designation for his sons to get the property.  Isn'tthat the normal thing you would expect a divorce lawyer inthat State to tell him?18 1              MS. McDOWELL:  This individual in fact was not 2    represented.  It was a pro se divorce.  One would assume 3    that a participant in an ERISA plan would look at a 4    variety of sources, most specifically including his 5    summary plan description, which in this case made quite 6    clear that the only way to change a beneficiary is to file 7    the required form, that such documents as divorce decrees8 would not -- 9              QUESTION:  Of course, unless as a matter of law,10    there is a rule of law that automatically changed the --11    such as the slayer rule.  Don't you think there's a12    reasonable probability here that the plan participant13    thought the money would not go to his divorced wife?14              MS. McDOWELL:  I don't think there's any way to15    say what the plan participant intended at this point.16              QUESTION:  Because normally in the divorce17    settlement -- they did have a divorce settlement -- don't18    they provide otherwise?  If there's a specific intent to19    save that particular asset for the divorced wife, isn't20    that normally set forth in the agreement providing for the21    property settlement?22              MS. McDOWELL:  Well, certainly there is the23    possibility under ERISA to obtain a qualified domestic24    relations order.  In this case the children's interests25    could have been protected if such an order had been19 1    obtained at any point in the process since the first 2    wife's divorce.  That wasn't done. 3              QUESTION:  Your basic -- you think he really 4    wanted the money to go to his divorced wife.  That's your 5    suggestion. 6              MS. McDOWELL:  My point is, we don't know, and 7    an ERISA plan -- 8              QUESTION:  What about ordinary common sense, 9    that a person who just divorces his wife, gives her half10    the property, might prefer that the other half of the11    property go to his children, rather than this wife, who's12    now going to get more than her fair share, and whom he's13    just divorced?14              I mean, suppose I thought the common sense of it15    in my knowledge of human nature is that people would16    prefer their half share to go to their children rather17    than the just-divorced wife.18              MS. McDOWELL:  Well, that's a sensible approach,19    and ERISA plans could adopt that approach --20              QUESTION:  And is there some reason -- all21    right, is there any -- so then is there any reason to22    think that Congress wouldn't have wanted State statutes23    that don't interfere that much with anything and in fact24    embody that common sense notion, like you wouldn't like25    your property to go to the guy who kills you.  You know,20 1    that's another common sense notion. 2              QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, that common sense 3    approach is disagreed with by two-thirds of the States, as 4    I understand it, right?  Two-thirds of the States don't 5    think that that's common sense and don't provide for 6    automatic substitution in the event of a divorce. 7              MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, and in many 8    instances -- 9              QUESTION:  So it's not that much common sense,10 and I --11              (Laughter.)12              QUESTION:  And I assume that any -- that once13    you have a statute like ERISA, which avowedly supersedes14    State law, if you're dealing with a lawyer who doesn't15    consult ERISA and knows nothing about ERISA and gives you16    your advice only on the basis of State law, you're going17    to get a lot of bad advice.18              MS. McDOWELL:  And you might in fact have a19    malpractice action.20              QUESTION:  Mine was actually a question.  Mine21    was actually a question.  I wasn't just making a comment.22              (Laughter.)23              QUESTION:  I wanted you to respond to the notion24    that State statutes, probate -- you know, that traditional25    State area that embody that kind of a notion, what I'd21 1    call a notion of trying to carry out the wishes of the 2    testator, or whoever, that those are not preempted unless 3    they impose a real burden upon the ERISA plan. 4              MS. McDOWELL:  Well, you began your question 5    with a reference to what Congress would have intended 6    here, and we do know that Congress intended to permit the 7    nationally uniform administration of ERISA plans.  That's 8    why it included an express preemption provision. 9              QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, I would like to go back10    to your prior concession, or maybe I shouldn't use the11    word concession, but is it not within the realm of the12    possible that a man who has just divorced a woman, he's13    tired of her, he's used her up, he's thrown her over, he's14    off with a young thing but not married, and he's feeling15    tremendous remorse, so he says, I'm going to leave that16    pension plan alone.17              (Laughter.)18              MS. McDOWELL:  Well, that's true, and perhaps19    the more common situation is where the divorced spouse has20    custody of the couple's children.  In that case, it would21    probably be a matter of relative indifference to the plan22    participant whether the money went to the spouse directly23    or the children, or --24              QUESTION:  Isn't it even more likely, instead of25    this tender-hearted --221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  -- divorced husband, isn't it morelikely that the wife, in striking her deal for the divorcesettlement, having an ERISA plan, knowing there's an ERISAplan which names her as the beneficiary, assumes thatthat's her money?          MS. McDOWELL:  She may well do so, although shewould know that at the time of their divorce the -- herspouse would be free to --          QUESTION:  And knowing that ERISA supersedesState law, as well --(Laughter.)          MS. McDOWELL:  With respect to express conflictpreemption there are several provisions of ERISA that wesubmit conflict with the Washington statute.  One is theprovision that requires that plans be administered inaccordance with plan documents.  The plan documents, inthis case, require payment to the beneficiary designatedby the plan participant, rather than by somebodydesignated under State law.          It also conflicts with ERISA's definition ofbeneficiary as the person designated by the participant orunder the terms of the plan.  If one looks to theparticipant's designation and the terms of the plan,petitioner here is the proper beneficiary, not respondent.231 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          With respect to the pension plan, the Washingtonstatute also conflicts with ERISA's antialienationprovision, which prohibits the assignment or alienation ofplan benefits.  This statute affects an assignment oralienation of benefits by transferring a right to benefitsfrom the petitioner's former spouse.          QUESTION:  So your view of the murder situationstatutes are all preempted, too.          MS. McDOWELL:  Well, we would submit that theslayer statutes and the underlying slayer rule and theFederal common law reflect a public policy limitation thatERISA plans would not be free to --          QUESTION:  Despite the express preemptionprovisions on which you rely here.          MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct.          If there are no further --          QUESTION:  What is your position if in a divorcedecree the decree sets forth that the wife agrees torelinquish her interest in the pension plan and that thehusband will name the children as beneficiary, and theyboth agree to that?          MS. McDOWELL:  And the husband doesn't do it?          QUESTION:  Right, and then you have this -- thenyou have this --          MS. McDOWELL:  Our position is that under ERISA                            241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9one would continue to enforce the terms of the plan, justas in this case.          QUESTION:  And the children could not bring asuit, because that would be preempted?  The suit would bepreempted as well, I take it.          MS. McDOWELL:  There may be a separate sort ofaction in that situation under State law.          QUESTION:  Why couldn't that --          QUESTION:  Well, I thought the preemption of theplan --10111213141516171819    matter?2021 22 23 24 25          MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, you're correct.  It might berecognized as a QDRO --          QUESTION:  -- Kennedy gave you, why isn't thatcovered by the QDRO section --          QUESTION:  Can --          QUESTION:  -- if it comes up in a divorce          MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, it couldconstitute a QDRO, depending on whether it meets theprocedural requirements.          QUESTION:  But the QDRO has to be forwarded tothe plan administrator, I take it?          MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, and presumably                            25          QUESTION:  -- be a QDRO, though?  In the exampleJustice --1    the children with an interest in the benefits would do2    that.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Thank you.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. McDowell.          Mr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I will turn quickly to the mistaken notion thatthe Washington statute at issue in this case conflictswith ERISA, but I want to explain from the outset exactlywhat this statute does and why it does it.          Washington, like a number of States, as a numberof the questions have reflected, recognizes theunsurprising proposition and, Justice Scalia, it isrecognized by an increasing number of States very rapidly,that when two people divorce they try to give each otherless money, not more.          Particularly relevant here, the designation ofone spouse as a death beneficiary, whether in a will, andthere are will statutes in 49 out of the 50 States, or insome other asset, is premised on the idea that at the timeof death the couple will still be married.          Applied to this case, and I think it very                            26 1    important that we talk about the facts of this case, the 2    statute rests on the idea that when petitioner sought and 3    received a divorce from David Egelhoff, and after they 4    entered a very detailed divorce decree, to the level of, 5    he got the tan area rug and she got the Exercycle, that he 6    did not walk out of the courthouse thinking, oh, and I 7    want her to get the pension and the life insurance, too. 8              QUESTION:  Maybe she thought she got it. 9              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is --10              QUESTION:  Maybe she had a good lawyer who read11 ERISA --12              (Laughter.)13              QUESTION:  -- and said that, you know, there is14    this statute, but it ain't going to affect whether you get15    your ERISA payment.  You have that one.  Now, maybe he16    doesn't know that, but boy, we're walking away with a good17    settlement here.18              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Fortunately --19              QUESTION:  You really can't predict what the20    expectations were.  It's hard to do.21              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  With respect, we can here for22    two reasons.  First, the divorce decree itself explicitly23    says that he gets the pension.  It says so, and there's no24    doubt that that was the parties' intent.25              And second, there is a declaration27 1    uncontradicted in the record that she basically went 2    around telling people that David would roll over in his 3    grave at the notion that she was going to get this money. 4              QUESTION:  Well, just addressing the first, the 5    fact that the husband has the property interest means that 6    he simply has the power to designate the beneficiary. 7    That's quite consistent with his wanting to let her remain 8    the beneficiary. 9              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  With respect, in terms of just10    what the parties understood would happen to the money, and11    in particular, Justice Scalia, what Donna's expectation12    was, he got the pension benefits.  The death benefit is13    the entirety of the pension benefit, and she could not14    have an expectation that she would ever get the money,15    because she knows that he could change it the next day.16              Moreover, this is a community property State.17    They had to divide up the marital property, which included18    the value of the pension at the time of divorce, and she19    had to get equivalent assets at the time of divorce.  This20    is nothing more than a double recovery in the purest21 sense. 2223 24 25          QUESTION:  Well, maybe it is, but I guess thepoint that I don't seem to grasp is why it makes a dime'sworth of difference.          We've got a statute.  If the statute means what                            28 1    they say it does, you lose.  If it doesn't, maybe you win, 2    but the particular expectations of the parties in a 3    particular divorce, even if there's an evidentiary basis 4    for it, seems to me irrelevant. 5              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is relevant in the sense -- 6    in two senses, Justice Souter.  The first is that I'm 7    trying to explain to you the rationale and why it is so 8    rational that Washington did what it did, and second, it 9    goes to the question now speaking to the statute, what the10    standard is for finding a conflict and finding preemption,11    and that is that in this area, from cases like Hisquidero12    on, there must be a clear and manifest conflict.13              And now let me turn directly to the notion of14    whether or not there is a conflict.15              QUESTION:  Before you do that, can you just16    clarify -- you said that this is a galloping thing in the17    States.  How many States have these statutes now?18              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There are 20 States that have19    the statute now -- the number has been growing rapidly --20    with respect to nonprobate assets.  It was --                QUESTION:  So the majority of States still do                MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They do not.292122    not.232425          QUESTION:  Is this the case:  47 States haddivorce revocation when the instrument is a will --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Exactly.          QUESTION:  -- and about 20 have it when divorcerevocation is a nonprobate asset, and it's notnonuniform -- that is, the States that have it are copyingthe Uniform Probate Code, which has such a provision init?  Is that right?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.          QUESTION:  All right.  If that is right, dothese 20 States all say, or most of them say, likeWashington, that if you expressly deny the applicabilityof a divorce revocation statute, you're home free?  Dothey all say that?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They do not --          QUESTION:  Some of them?  They all say that?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They do not all say that, butalmost all do, because that's in the UPC.          QUESTION:  All right.  Do almost all of themprovide, as Washington does, that if a trustee doesn'tknow about a conflict among beneficiaries, he needn't pay?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The majority do.          QUESTION:  All right.  Do the majority alsoprovide that if the trustee does find out about it he alsoneed not pay until the State courts resolve the matter?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.          QUESTION:  All right.30123456789    plan?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer has helpfullyjust identified three different opt-out provisions that godirectly to the question of whether or not there's anactual burden on the plan.Chief Justice Rehnquist --          QUESTION:  Now, is it the case that -- does thepreemption provision at issue here say that preemptiononly occurs when there's an administrative burden on the101112131415161718    burden?19              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We do not believe so, and Boggs20    is an example, that the Court did not reach the question.21    Four justices of the Court in Justice Breyer's opinion22    explained that there really wasn't a burden and there23    wasn't field preemption.  The majority said there is24    conflict preemption here, but it is worth noting that25    Justice Kennedy's opinion in that case did explain why31MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The courts --QUESTION:  Is that the criterion?  I mean --MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is a principal criterion.Whether or not there's an --          QUESTION:  Oh, I have no doubt that if there isan administrative burden you will be much more likely tofind preemption, but if, on the face of it, there ispreemption, does there need to be an administrative 1    there would be real administrative trouble if you 2    recognized nonparticipant interest. 3              Chief Justice Rehnquist -- so if I could 4    continue for the moment to focus on the practicalities of 5    what happens to an ERISA plan, turn to the specific 6    alleged conflicts with the statute in just a moment. 7              Chief Justice Rehnquist, you asked how this 8    worked in operation, and I'd like to refer to you -- refer 9    you to the respondent's lodging for a moment.10    Respondent's lodging at tab 3 has the designation form for11    the life insurance plan, and it explains that David12    Egelhoff designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife -- I13    apologize.  There may be some confusion.  This is an14    8-1/2 X 11 lodging that may not have come upstairs.151617    Kennedy.18192021    appendix, apparently.QUESTION:  What is the tab that you --MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm starting at tab 3, JusticeQUESTION:  On this so-called lodging --MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.QUESTION:  -- this isn't part of the joint2223    O'Connor.2425    what authority did you file it, if I may ask?32MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is correct, JusticeQUESTION:  And it's not a brief of yours, and by 1              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We conferred with the Clerk's 2    Office and received permission to file a lodging. 3              Let me explain also that these are materials -- 4    it's particularly important, because this is not something 5    that translates at all well into -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, normally things that the 7    parties intend to refer to are incorporated in a joint 8    appendix, and I did not know that we accepted these 9    independently submitted supplemental documents.  I10    couldn't believe it when it came in.11              QUESTION:  The fact that the Clerk's Office12    gives you leave to file it doesn't mean that it's a13    desirable or even a permissible thing to do so far as the14    Court is concerned.15              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That point is well-taken, Mr.16    Chief Justice.  Let me just specify for the benefit of the17    Court that the documents that I am about to refer to are18    part of the record.19              I understand the point is well-taken that20    counsel are much preferred at the beginning of the case21    within the joint appendix to have one consolidated22    document.  It is the case, however, that as the case moves23    along, for example, after we received the petitioner's24    brief, other documents become relevant that we want to25    bring to the Court's attention.33 1              QUESTION:  And these are part of the record? 2              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and so 3    let me just be absolutely clear these are not pedagogical 4    devices, anything outside the record.  The two documents 5    I'm going to take you now are in the record of the case. 6    Tab 3 is the designation form, and it says that David 7    designated Donna R. Egelhoff, wife. 8              The reason I point to it is that when the 9    administrator receives a claim for death benefits it's10    common ground that he or she pulls out the designation11    form.  Before paying the benefits, he or she must get the12    death certificate.  We have to be sure that the person is13    dead.  That's common sense.14              On the death certificate it explains that David15    Egelhoff died, and on line 14 -- or, excuse me, in cell16    14, three lines down, it explains that he was divorced,17    and that is the sum total of the administrative burden18    that is put on ERISA plan administrators.  They look at19    the exact same documents.20              QUESTION:  Death certificates always say whether21    you're divorced or not?22              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So far -- I will not represent23    to the Court that I have been able to identify every24    State, but I have not been able to find one that hasn't.25    There was no easy way of identifying every State's death341    certificate, but yes, because they have to notify2    next-of-kin, and remember as well, Justice Scalia, that3    when you try to pay on death the survivor annuity required4    by ERISA you must make the same inquiry.  You have to know5    if the participant was married at the time of death, and6 so -- 789          QUESTION:  But it's not married.  I mean, dothey put down never married so you know that?  You saidthey must put down divorced.10111213141516171819202122232425    different.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The question for the survivorannuity, Justice Ginsburg, is, at the time of death wasthe person married.  That -- and if so, there must be amandatory --          QUESTION:  So it will say -- it will say eithermarried or divorced.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Exactly.  There are two lines inthe death certificate.  One is married or divorced and thesecond is, there is, in fact, a surviving spouse, so --          Now, a number of the questions have focused onwhether or not there is a conflict with the terms ofERISA.  Justice Scalia, you pointed out that it may wellbe that there would be preemption even if there was noadditional burden.  This is -- Congress said, this is howit's going to work.  Washington can't say anything351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Justice Souter, earlier you inquired similarlywhether or not there might not be conflict preemption,because the statute mandates that you have to pay thebenefits to the named beneficiary.  The difficulty is thatthe statute does not say that.  The only claimed conflicthere is with the term, beneficiary, and with the --          QUESTION:  I think I was referring to thedefinition of beneficiary as being the individualdesignated by the participant or by the plan, and Ithought there was an apparent conflict between that andany statute which in effect superseded that.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That occurs, with all duerespect to my colleagues, because in their briefs there isan ellipsis of an important phrase, and the definition ofa beneficiary is -- and I'm going to now refer to 29U.S.C. 1002 sub (8).          QUESTION:  Where do we find it?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, it is at theappendix to the petitioner's brief at page 2, and I --when I refer to statutory section, from henceforth it willalways be in that brief.          QUESTION:  Page 2a?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  This is1002, sub (8).  The term, beneficiary, means a persondesignated by a participant or by the terms of an employee36 1    benefit plan who is or may become entitled to a benefit 2    thereunder, and let me explain how Washington law operates3 here. 4              Washington law at the time of divorce does not 5    say, if you divorce you are no longer a beneficiary, the 6    money instead goes to the children.  It instead says that 7    the designation is ineffective and it is up to the terms 8    of the plan to determine who gets the money, and that's 9    exactly what the children were here.  They were persons10    who may become entitled to a benefit thereunder.  They11    have always been, because the plan specified.12              QUESTION:  Two things -- excuse me.  Two things13    occur to me.  One is, doesn't -- first I guess is, just as14    a matter of Washington law, the children don't become15    entitled under the plan.  They end up becoming entitled,16    if they are entitled at all, under the Washington -- under17    the State law of Washington.18              And number 2, would you comment on what I19    speculated when I read that last phrase, who are or may20    become entitled.  I assumed that that last phrase was21    referring to, in effect, a contingent designation.  You22    know, to B or a C if B dies first, something like that.  C23    would be, may become entitled. --24              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I --25              QUESTION:  And I thought that was all it was371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425referring to.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I understand.  I have bothpoints firmly in mind.  The first, Washington law does notsay that the children become entitled because of thestatute.  All that Washington law says is that thedesignation -- it reflects, again, the common-senseunderstanding that the meaning of the designation -- Imean, it's fairly obvious here, when it says Donna R.Egelhoff, wife, but --          QUESTION:  Well, the form is, first becomesdisentitled --          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Becomes disentitled, and then --          QUESTION:  We agree with that, and isn't thatenough for the conflict?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice Souter.          QUESTION:  Because the participant, or theplan -- I guess the participant in this case -- isdesignated and the statute says no, that designation isnot operative.  Isn't that a conflict?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  The actual conflict, tomake it even more specific, the conflict would have to go,if petitioner's position were accepted, ERISA says, paythe beneficiary, which is correct, absent this special --          QUESTION:  Well, ERISA says, sure, but ERISAsays, by means of the definition section, pay the381    beneficiary, who is the designee either of the participant2    or of the plan.3              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, then we come to your4    second point, because we have, or may become, because it5    doesn't say the person who is entitled to receive by that6    -- under the designation or under the plan.  It's, who may7 become.8 910111213141516171819202122232425          I agree with you that that is intended totrigger contingent beneficiaries.  Our point is that thechildren are as much contingent beneficiaries in themeaning of that term as is the participant, because --          QUESTION:  They are if you first assume there isno conflict and therefore the statute prevails.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, we are looking --          QUESTION:  That's -- I mean, that seems to me acircularity in your position.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I will give you an interpretiveaid in trying to decide what it means to be, or maybecome, and that is that it can't be the case thatthe children -- let me take you to Boggs.          Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Boggsexplained that there are a class of people that ERISA isintended to protect, participants and beneficiaries.  Ourposition is, is that before the death of David, and beforethe administrator looked at the alternate beneficiary39 1    provisions, the children were protected by ERISA. 2              They were in the class of people who could bring 3    an action and say, look, you're misadministering plan 4    assets, just as much as Donna could.  They are within the 5    class of people that ERISA intended to protect, and so if 6    you are going to call them not beneficiaries, they are 7    excluded from the rest of the statute entirely and they 8    receive none of the protections. 9              Our understanding is that if Congress wanted to10    say -- use more limited language than or may become, it11    could have.  It could have said --12              QUESTION:  Yes, but it's also the case that13    the -- and I will assume the premise of your argument that14    there may be a considerable class of individuals who may15    object to plan administration.  It does not follow from16    that that every one of those individuals in fact gets some17    money in the pocket at the point of distribution.18              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, but the first class, the19    group of people who are protected by the statute, are20    denominated in the statute as beneficiaries.21              QUESTION:  It seems to me what you're arguing is22    that it does not pose a conflict with the plan if you23    require the plan to pay out to a contingent beneficiary24    instead of to the main beneficiary.25              I mean, the mere fact that it's somebody who was40 1    not entitled to it, but would be entitled to it if the 2    person entitled to it weren't around, that's still a 3    conflict, it seems to me.  Just because they both are 4    called beneficiaries of some sort, you're still requiring 5    payment not to the beneficiary named. 6              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Scalia, there are 7    many times when an ERISA plan pays benefits to someone 8    other than a named beneficiary, so we're going to have to 9    find the conflict somewhere else.10              ERISA plans pay benefits out under the spousal11    annuity.  ERISA plans pay ERISA benefits out under the12    QDRO provisions.  It is many times not the case that they13    pay it out directly to the person whose name is on it.  In14    fact, the plan here reserves the right to determine that15    the individual named is incompetent, and not to pay them16    then, either.17              QUESTION:  But the spousal annuity provision, I18    mean, the spouse at the time of death may not be named,19    but it's clear on the face of the plan and the20    accompanying law of ERISA that the spousal annuity goes to21    the spouse at the time of the beneficiary's death, or --22              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Let me deal with what I take to23    be the premise of your point, which is that a conflict24    with the terms of the plan would be sufficient to cause25    preemption, if the plan said, you can't do this, and41 1    second -- so I'll return to that in just a moment, whether 2    or not that would be sufficient to cause ERISA preemption, 3    but let me deal with it on the facts of this case, and it 4    is important to return to the text of the statute again. 5    With the stroke of a pen, you can write into any 6    nonprobate asset, including an ERISA plan, divorce 7    revocation statutes do not apply. 8              Justice Ginsburg, you asked the petitioner's 9    lawyer, wouldn't there also be the problem you wouldn't10    know which State law applies.  The Attorney General of11    Washington in her brief at footnote 6 has explained under12    this statute, you don't have to say, Revised Code 110701013    doesn't apply, Alabama Code, da-da-da.  It is, you just14    say, divorce revocation statutes don't apply.15              An earlier question also said, and --16              QUESTION:  Mr. Goldstein, you said the17    Washington statute, but there are a number of statutes,18    and they are various, so it wouldn't obviate the conflicts19 problem.20              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, it would in21    one sense and potentially not in another.  The Court is22    asked to pass on a particular statute with three safe23    harbors that Justice Breyer has identified.  I'm not24    representing to you that the same rationale would save all25 of them.42 1              I think, though, your point goes more 2    particularly to what does the administrator do in a 3    conflict of laws problem?  There's the hypothetical, for 4    example, that someone's from Oregon, someone from 5    Washington, someone from Texas.  The plan operates in a 6    multi-State arena. 7              There are two important points.  The first is 8    that there is the safe harbor both under the text of ERISA 9    and under this plan -- under this statute, that says, if10    you have any doubt, don't pay.  You don't have to go to11    court.  Just don't do it.  Just send a letter to the12    people who want the money and say to them, come back to us13    when you have figured it out or a court has told you what14 to do.15              And so in terms of getting to the16    practicalities, Justice Ginsburg, of how is this going to17    work for administrators --18              QUESTION:  Doesn't that conflict with ERISA?  I19    mean, isn't he supposed to pay out the money promptly to20    the person entitled to it, and you're saying it doesn't21    conflict with ERISA to tell him to sit on his hands until22    litigation terminates 2 years hence?23              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, it is frequently24    the case, in fact, that ERISA plans have some doubt.  The25    Court discussed probably the most obvious cases, slayer431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9statutes, simultaneous death happens actually notinfrequently, but there are lots of times -- JusticeStevens, the middle name of all the children is Joseph.There are many times when you don't pay immediately.          ERISA provides in its enforcement section, andthe circuits uniformly agree, that what the plan should dothere is simply put the money aside and wait for theclaiming participants to fight it out.          QUESTION:  Would you refresh my recollection?Does the statute take care of the situation when thebeneficiary is incompetent, or a child, or something likethat?  Does it provide paying to a conservator, or is thatdone as a matter of State law?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Does -- ERISA does not.          QUESTION:  It doesn't contemplate that.  So if,in fact, the plan administrator knows that the -- say, thebeneficiary is in prison, or is having a mental problem orsomething, he doesn't have to pay out right away?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There are many times this          QUESTION:  If -- is there -- you're asking us, Itake it, to interpret the statute, ERISA, whicheffectively says pay the money to the primary beneficiary.4410111213141516171819202122    happens.2324 251    You want to say, well, pay the money to the primary2    beneficiary who is a beneficiary and isn't disqualified by3    certain State laws, and now this is one of the State laws4    that might disqualify a person, and another one is a5    slayer statute, and a third one, I take it, is a6    simultaneous death statute, and are there any others --789 of?MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Those --QUESTION:  -- that anybody's been able to think1011    understand in terms of what the court is opening the doors12    to, that the States have been regulating this area for13    centuries, and that is the -- you know, this is in the14    area of divorce.  There are normal probate areas that they15    have limited themselves, and if I could just mention one16 point --17              QUESTION:  Do -- I mean, one of the ways they18    used to regulate it is that, you know, the wife would get19    half the estate automatically upon death.  Suppose the --20    a State enacts a law that says, you know, if this benefit21    is not given to the spouse at the time of death, it must22 be. 23242545MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, and it is important toMR. GOLDSTEIN:  I understand.          QUESTION:  And this is probate, this is ourconcern with the family and with marriage and all of that. 1              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 2              QUESTION:  Surely you wouldn't say that ERISA 3    would be overcome with that. 4              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's exactly right, because 5    that's a prohibited alienation.  That's Boggs, and let me 6    explain why this is not. 7              Congress provided that there are certain people, 8    participants and their beneficiaries, when it's a spousal 9    annuity, who have an expectation that they are going to10    live off pension benefits, and it specified when an11    alienation would occur.12              This is not a situation where the money is taken13    away from the participant or anyone else who has a14    mandated right to it and give -- and let me take you to15    the definition.  The alienation definition is not16    reprinted in the appendix to any brief -- I apologize --17    but I will simply read it to you.  Well, the statute is,18    and that is at the appendix to petitioner's brief at page19    4, and it simply says, not very helpfully, each pension20    plan shall provide the benefits provided under the plan21    may not be assigned or alienated.22              Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boggs looks to the23    IRS's definition and I will read it to you.  This for the24    record is at 26 C.F.R. section 1.401A-(13)(c)(i) -- (ii).25    The terms, assignment and alienation, include any direct46 1    or indirect arrangement, whether revocable or irrevocable 2    whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary 3    a right or interest enforceable against a plan in or to 4    any or all of the plan benefit payment. 5              QUESTION:  That's what I thought alienation 6    means.  It means from a participant.  This alienation is 7    not from the participant.  It's by operation of the State 8    law.  You're not getting it from the participant. 9              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We agree.  It's not an10    alienation.  That's our point, and that's the difference11    from the hypothetical you asked.  If there was a divorce12    decree that said, look -- if the divorce decree here said,13    Donna Egelhoff is going to get 100 percent of David's14    pension, if that is not, Justice O'Connor, registered as a15    QDRO that's an alienation.  You can't do it.16              Now, the petitioner --17              QUESTION:  Excuse me, that is an alienation?18    Why is that an alienation?19              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because it takes it from David20    and gives it to Donna.21              QUESTION:  But David is not alienating himself.22    He's not taking it from himself and giving it to Donna.  I23    thought you agreed with me that that's what alienate24    means.  It means you can't transfer it to someone else,25    not that operation of law can't take it away from you and47 1    give it to somebody else. 2              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize, Justice Scalia.  I 3    was focusing on the take it from the person to another. 4    You were focusing on the operation of law.  I actually 5    agree with your interpretation of operation of law. 6    Unfortunately, I think it's precluded by Boggs.  That was 7    State community property law.  I think Justice Breyer 8    might -- some might think he had the better of that 9    argument.  That is water under the bridge, and that was10    community property law.11              QUESTION:  Yes.  Yes.12              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Remember, the second wife,13    community property law, took it.  She -- the community14    property law is what gave it to her.  So what I'm focusing15    on, though, is that this does not take it from somebody16    and give it to somebody else.17              Now, there was the question put before, well,18    should this have been a QDRO, and there is the negative19    inference suggested by petitioner that Congress occupied20    this field, that really these sorts of things are supposed21    to be done by QDRO's, and I will explain to you why that's22 not so.23              Washington law doesn't intend to say that the24    kids will get the money.  That's the whole point, that the25    plan will decide who gets the money.  Washington law wants48 1    David, after the divorce, to decide who will get it.  Say 2    there's a third wife.  David -- say he's a serial marrier. 3    If there's a third wife, David wants to be able to name 4    her.  If there's a QDRO, he can't.  If the divorce decree 5    said, the money goes to the kids, he's out of luck. 6    That's a registered decree under Washington State law. 7              All Washington is trying to do here is say, 8    look, when you divorce, the intent is that the spouse, 9    your ex-spouse isn't going to get the money.  Go fix the10    problem some other way, and it says to the plans, or any11    other nonprobate asset, you don't want to comply, say12    you're not going to comply.  You have any doubts, don't13    comply.  And it says to the participant himself, if you14    don't want this to be the rule, just say so, either in the15    divorce decree or even in your designation.16              There really is nothing going on here that17    Congress didn't want to happen.  There's nobody -- unlike18    Boggs, where we had the actual spouse who was going to get19    the spousal annuity, or we had the pension benefits after20    death in the hands at least of the estate of the21    pensioner, none of that applies here.22              We're in a situation where Congress left it up23    to anybody to name a designee, and unless there's some24    real practical problem for the ERISA plan, unless25    something's -- it's just not workable, I could understand49 1    a reason to preempt it.  But when you're going to take 2    away simultaneous death, slayer statutes -- in the 3    footnote in which they address the issue in their reply 4    brief, petitioner says, Justice Scalia, that it preempts 5    state law definitions of what it is to die, who's a 6    spouse, what's a child, common law issues frequently 7    regulated by the States. 8              I should make one final point, and that is that 9    there is at the very least one alternative narrow holding10    that I don't understand the answer to for this Court, and11    that is that we sued petitioner under a provision of State12    law that lets us just sue her, and if the problem is the13    practical administration of this rule, that it will cause14    a burden for ERISA plans, the rule at the least ought to15    be that that's not preempted.  It's a State law conversion16    suit.  We can go after her for the money.17              QUESTION:  It seems to me, and maybe you have an18    answer to it, that the manner in which this State law19    differs from laws that say who a wife is, who a child is20    and so forth, is that this is a State law that is directed21    explicitly to the manner in which a contract, an ERISA22    contract in particular, should be interpreted.  It is23    directed precisely to the intent of the parties to an24    agreement, and it says this is what they shall be deemed25    to intend.  It operates directly and explicitly upon the50 1    agreement itself. 2              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Two points.  The first is that, 3    of course, it doesn't operate in such a fashion if there's 4    any contrary expression of intent by any of the parties, 5    be it the plan or the participant. 6              The second is that I do think in these ERISA 7    cases we get the unfortunate sense that this statute is 8    about ERISA plans, and it's not.  There's a separate 9    statute, of course, that deals with every form of will.10    This statute deals with every conceivable form of11    nonprobate asset.  It's really important under State law.12              Most of the money that is held by individuals13    now is either in your home or in a life insurance plan or14    in a pension, whether qualified or not, and you get the15    situation that you have here, and that is that Donna16    Egelhoff already got equivalent assets.  She's going to17    come along and recover again.  The children are going to18    be completely out of luck for no sensible purpose at all.19              If there are no further questions --20              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.21              Mr. Kilberg, you have 3 minutes remaining.22              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KILBERG23                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER24              MR. KILBERG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.25              Just a few points.  The last point that Mr.51 1    Goldstein made, which suggests broader preemption than I 2    think the statute entails, ERISA preempts State law only 3    insofar as it relates to an employee benefit plan.  No one 4    is suggesting that the State statute is preempted with 5    regard to other nonprobate assets. 6              Mr. Goldstein also mentioned that they had sued, 7    the respondents here had sued petitioner, not the plan. 8    Well, that is true.  That, of course, was true in Boggs as 9    well and, as the Court said in the Boggs decision, there,10    as here, the premise of the lawsuit is based on a11    displacement of ERISA provisions and plan provisions.12              A point with regard to the contingent13    beneficiary notion.  If Mr. Goldstein is correct, and14    respondents are beneficiaries under ERISA because they15    have a contingent right, then their only cause of action16    would be under section 502(a) of ERISA.  That would be17    their exclusive right, and they would have had to sue the18    plan under those provisions rather than the petitioner19    under the State statute.20              With regard to the QDRO point, Qualified21    Domestic Relations Order point, the fact is that a QDRO22    could have been fashioned that provided that the spouse23    had given up any interest that she might have as a24    beneficiary.  The fact here is, that wasn't done.  That25    provision is a relatively easy one to effect.  It wasn't521    done, and that's the reason that respondents must lose.2              Unless the Court has any questions for me --3              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.4    Kilberg.
