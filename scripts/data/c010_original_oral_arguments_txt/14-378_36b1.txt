United States.      Mr. Russell.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELLON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The briefing in this Court has narrowedconsiderably the disagreement among the parties.  We nowall agree that the Fourth Circuit misconstrued the mensrea element for a ­­ a criminal offense under theControlled Substance Analogue Act, and we further agreethat the jury instructions actually given in this casewere erroneous.      Instead, we and the government now agreethat to prove an offense, the government must show thatthe defendant knowingly distributed an analogue.  And wefurther agree that the government may do that by showingthat the defendant knew that the substance in questionhad the characteristics that made it an analogue underthe statute.      Where we may disagree is over theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial41 government's alternative theory that it can instead show2 that the defendant knew that the substance was illegal3 or regulated. If all the government means by that is4 illegal or regulated under the statute of conviction,5 the Controlled Substances Act itself, we would agree,6 but the government would simply lose because, as it's7 acknowledged, the evidence in this case tended to show8 that my client did not believe that his conduct violated9 the CSA itself.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: But just to make sure I11 understand all that you're agreeing on, you do agree12 that if the defendant knew that the substance was13 illegal under the Controlled Substances Act or the14 Analogue Act, even though the defendant didn't know the15 chemical structure or the particular effects ­­ say that16 the dealer had handed him a box and said this is our new￼17 analogue which is18 Analogue Act, you19 for a conviction.20 MR. RUSSELL:21 think that that is simply a special application of the22 general rule that the defendant has to know the facts23 that make his conduct unlawful because he knows in that24 circumstance the only fact he needs to know in order to25 know that what he's doing is illegal.illegal under this ­­ under the­­ you agree that that is sufficientWe do agree with that.  And IAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 sensible to me. What about the expert testimony from3 chemists? Is that still put on in the trial? Does the4 government still have to show ­­ put on an expert to5 say, well, this is chemically modified, but it's6 substantially similar and the jury sits there knowing7 that it doesn't have to listen to this? I mean, how8 does that work?9 MR. RUSSELL: No. They do have to show that10 because the government still has to prove that it is, in11 fact, an analogue. So they have to both show that the12 defendant ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but does a jury have14 to understand the chemical testimony?15 MR. RUSSELL: They've ­­ they've got to make16 the determination that it is, in fact, chemically17 substantially similar. I acknowledge that that's a lot18 to ask of a jury. It's a lot to ask of a ­­ of a19 defendant to understand that.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is the21 government's burden to show both the composition in22 relation to the controlled substance, and the ­­ the23 effect of the drug. Those ­­ those the government must24 prove. But what we have out of the way is that the25 defendant now doesn't have to know ­­ you agree theAlderson Reporting CompanyAnd that ­­ that sounds5￼Official6￼1 defendant doesn't have to understand the chemical2 structure?3 MR. RUSSELL: He doesn't have to understand4 the chemical structure if the government can prove that5 the defendant knew that the substance was illegal under6 the Controlled Substances Act itself.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the government8 has given up a lot getting to this point and I think9 you've just given up a lot.10 I would have thought your ­­ your position11 that you have to know that it's regulated under the12 chemical substances or Controlled Substances Act, it13 seems to me is ­­ is contrary to the proposition that14 ignorance of the law is no excuse. If you didn't15 know ­­ I didn't know this was regulated, you would say16 he's ­­ he's innocent because he didn't know the law.17 I thought your position was that you do have18 to know, as in all the other cases in the mens rea area,19 the ­­ the facts that make your conduct illegal. You20 don't have to know that it's illegal.21 MR. RUSSELL: That ­­ that is certainly our22 principal position. We are willing to say, however,23 that either ­­ whether you consider it a special24 exception to that rule or a special application to that25 rule, if the government can show that the defendantAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial71 knows that the substance is illegal under the statute of2 conviction, that serves the basic purpose of the3 knowledge of fact requirement, which is something ­­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he doesn't5 know, he's innocent.6 MR. RUSSELL: If he does not ­­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he's ignorant of8 that law, he's not guilty.9 MR. RUSSELL: Well, he's not guilty unless10 the government can show that he knows that the substance11 has the characteristics of ­­ of an analogue, in which12 case his ignorance of the law is not an excuse.13 So the government has two options: It can14 prove the facts, the factual knowledge in the way that15 this Court described in Staples and has applied in other16 cases involving prohibited items. But we're willing to17 acknowledge that if they can, instead of that, show that18 he knew that this is illegal under the statute, that's19 good enough because ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: And ­­ and I take it that's21 the same as under the Controlled Substances Act itself;22 is that right? That's the analogy, is that you can23 either show the person knew it was heroin or you can24 show, well, the person didn't know it was heroin, but25 the person did know that it was some drug that was on￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial8￼1 Schedule I of the ­­ of ­­ of ­­ and so a controlled2 substance.3 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. And where we4 disagree with the government is that it construes some5 of the lower court cases that say that as saying the6 broader thing, which is ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You keep8 saying "knowing that it's illegal under the Act." He9 doesn't have to know the Act. He just has to know it's10 illegal, that some law regulates it; otherwise, he's not11 going to know what the number of the law is or the12 Controlled Substance Act.13 MR. RUSSELL: Well, let me be clear. When I14 say ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, criminals don't16 care. They just know that this is ­­ they may think17 it's something. They just know it's a controlled18 substance.19 MR. RUSSELL: No. I ­­ I would disagree20 with that. And I think that's the principal21 disagreement we have with the government here, is that22 it's not enough to show that the defendant thinks that23 it's illegal generally or that it's unlawful under an24 import statute or State law.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. The ­­ theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial91 government would say if he's selling it without paying2 the sales tax, he knows that that's illegal, that's3 enough to convict him under the Controlled Substances4 Act.5 MR. RUSSELL: Potentially, I ­­ I think6 that that may be their argument, you know. So we give7 the example in our brief of somebody who knows he's8 selling Cuban cigars in violation of the import ban. He9 knows in that case that it's an illegal or controlled10 substance, but that knowledge doesn't equate ­­ you11 wouldn't say that somebody in that case knows he's12 selling a controlled substance, simply because it turns13 out, unbeknownst to him, that the cigars have marijuana14 in them.15 That's not the way that you use the English16 language. You wouldn't say that he knowingly sold17 marijuana or even that he knowingly controlled a ­­ sold18 a controlled substance.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Let's take the ­­ a20 case involving a drug that isn't an analogue, a drug21 that's actually listed. And let's say that the facts22 are these: The distributor gives it to the person who's23 going to make the distribution and says this is an24 illegal drug, go distribute it. And the person then25 goes and distributes it and tries to evade law￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial10￼1 enforcement and so forth, is caught.2 Now, is it ­­ is that sufficient ­­ is that3 evidence sufficient to take the case to the jury so the4 jury can find ­­ the jury can decide whether there's5 circumstantial evidence that the person who distributed6 the drugs knew that it was a controlled substance under7 Federal law as opposed to one of the few things that is8 illegal under State law, but not under Federal law?9 MR. RUSSELL: Yes, I think that's sufficient10 evidence to go to the jury. The jury then has to decide11 whether to make that inference. And in a case like this12 where the defendant puts on countervailing evidence that13 he, in fact, didn't believe it violated Federal law, or14 when ­­ or if the defendant is able to explain, yeah, I15 thought it was illegal because I thought it was in16 violation of an import statute, then it's up to jury to17 decide whether to believe that. But if it does, then it18 ought to conclude that mens rea wasn't established19 unless the government can show that the defendant knew20 the characteristics of the substance that made it an21 analogue.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the supplier23 tells the dealer this substance produces exactly the24 same effect as cocaine. Would that be enough to satisfy25 the mens rea requirement?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. RUSSELL: It wouldn't be enough to2 satisfy it. It would may be evidence from which the jury3 could draw an inference that the defendant knew that it4 was a controlled substance under Federal law. I don't5 think that they ­­ they should. I think it's ­­ it's6 only partial evidence.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: You ­­ you say he has to8 know the ­­ the chemical makeup that causes it to be an9 analogue. Right?10 MR. RUSSELL: He either has to know that or11 he has to know that it violates the CSA.12 JUSTICE SCALIA:13 that he doesn't know that it14 doesn't know that it ­­ what15 But he knows what it is. It16 knows.17 Now, under the Controlled Substances Act,18 that would be enough. He wouldn't have to know the19 makeup of it. He would just have to know it's one of20 the named controlled substances. If indeed MD­3 is ­­21 is an analogue, why isn't that enough that he just knows22 what it was and what it was is an analogue?23 MR. RUSSELL: Right. I think that's24 parallel to somebody knowing that he has an AR­15 rifle,25 which is, in fact, a machine gun. In Staples, thisAlderson Reporting CompanyI understand.  Let's assumeviolates the law.  He alsothe chemical makeup is.is MVD­3.  That's all he11￼JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this isn't6 This is, in fact, an analogue of a controlled7 I mean, it's ­­ it's not a proper comparison.8 MR. RUSSELL: With respect ­­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: He knows that ita rifle.substance.Officialis ­­ he 10 knows the identity of it. And ­­ and that chemical11 is ­­ has, in fact, the characteristics that make it an12 analogue.13 MR. RUSSELL: He knows ­­ knowing simply the14 name of it doesn't tell you whether it's an analogue or15 not. You don't know that it's an analogue simply16 because you know the name. And the way that you17 would ­­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. And ­­ and19 knowing that it's cocaine doesn't prove that you know20 it's a controlled substance.21 MR. RUSSELL: It ­­ it does though, because22 the only fact that you need to know about cocaine for it23 to be a controlled substance is that it is cocaine.24 Because that's the fact that makes it illegal. It's25 listed on the Controlled Substance Act and theAlderson Reporting Company12￼1 Court2 facts3 isn't4 isn't5said that's not enough.  You need to know theabout the gun that make it an analogue, whichits name ­­ or which make it a machine gun, whichits name.  Here it's not the name ­­22 23 24 25JUSTICE ALITO: It does list the chemical name.MR. RUSSELL: So then I think you do know the fact that that makes the conduct unlawful.Official131 controlled substance schedules. So if it's cocaine, you2 know everything you need to know, based on the3 presumption that you know the law, to know that what4 you're doing is illegal, and that's not true ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose ­­ suppose the6 distributor gives it to the person who's going to7 distribute it and says, here, distribute this and8 there's the actual chemical formula on the container and9 it's the chemical formula, excuse me, for PCP, whatever10 that is, C­something H­something and ­­ so that's all a11 person knows. He knows exactly what it is, the chemical12 formula. Is that ­­ has he not committed a ­­ a crime13 then?￼14 MR. RUSSELL:15 Controlled ­­16 JUSTICE ALITO:17 MR. RUSSELL:18 I don't know.19 on how it's listed in the schedule. I think the20 schedule might, in fact, list the chemical name, but21 if ­­Under the ordinary  Yes.­­ Substances Act?Alderson Reporting CompanyI mean, it depends, I think,Official141 JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't know ­­ the2 person has just arrived, excuse me, from ­­ from Mars3 and has no idea what ­­ you know, whether ­­ whether4 it's legal or not.5 MR. RUSSELL: I think the basic assumption6 is that people know what the law is. They know what's7 in the ­­ the schedules. And if you know what's in the8 schedule and if you know the fact, that's enough, I9 think, to convict.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What ­­ what do you do11 with the actual facts of this case? That is, the12 defendant gave names to what he was peddling. He called13 it speed, Nu­Up, a replacement for the listed ­­ now14 listed MPPD. He ­­ these were supposed to be bath15 salts, but there's no bath salts in the world that cost16 what those packets cost.17 So what ­­ what do we make of what he was18 advertising this to be, Speed­Up, and selling it at a19 price that fits a controlled substance?20 MR. RUSSELL: I think what it reflects ­­21 what a jury certainly could find it to reflect, and I22 think what the truth of the matter is, is that it shows23 that Petitioner thought he'd found a loophole to the24 Federal drug laws; that so long as something was not25 on the schedules, even if it had drug­like￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial5 that his conduct violated6 But here, of course ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN:8 that kind of evidence was9 right?10 MR. RUSSELL:11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 furtively or that he sold13 prices, that all of that,14 itself, but it's evidence15 government is trying to prove.16 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. And I think it17 gets to the jury, but it doesn't prove what the18 government has to prove here, which is harmless error19 beyond a reasonable doubt.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: But then if I can just21 understand. I mean, I think ­­ tell me if I'm wrong ­­22 that the only thing that's possibly separating you and23 the government ­­ we'll see if it is separating you and24 the government ­­ is this question of what happens if25 the defendant knew it was illegal under something otherthe Controlled Substances Act.  I ­­ I thought you said thatenough to get you to a jury,Yes.  That the defendant actedthese for incredibly inflatedit's not ­­ it's not the thingof the thing that theAlderson Reporting Company15￼1 effects, he could sell it and he could sell it at2 whatever price the market would bear.3 You know, certainly, the government can4 point to that kind of evidence to suggest that he knewOfficial161 than the CSA or the Analogue Act, right? And that's the2 only point of potential difference between you and the3 government?4 MR. RUSSELL: I think that's true with5 respect to our legal interpretation. I will say we also6 think that you ought not to reach that because this7 entire regulated status theory was raised for the first8 time in the government's brief on the merits in this9 Court ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait ­­ wait a minute. I11 mean, yes, you do differ with the government on that.12 MR. RUSSELL: Yes.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but assuming that ­­14 that the government cannot prove any belief in15 illegality, the government would not say it therefore16 must prove that you knew the chemical composition of17 what you were selling. And you say, you have to know18 the chemical composition.19 MR. RUSSELL: Right. I ­­ I think we're all20 on the same page. So just to be clear about our21 position, I think that the only disagreement about the22 meaning of the law between the government and us now is23 this question of whether it's sufficient as a matter of24 law for the government to show that the defendant25 believed that the substance was unlawful under some law￼Alderson Reporting Company14 JUSTICE SCALIA:15 composition?16 MR. RUSSELL:17 to be ­­   Which means the chemicalYes.  Yes.  I understand thatOfficial1 other2 think3 45 67 sufficient, what ­­ what else does the government have8 to prove? I think you differ on that.9 MR. RUSSELL: I don't think so. I think the10 government agrees that one way to prove the mens rea in11 this case is to show that the defendant knew the12 characteristics of the substance that made it an13 analogue. They agree that they can do it that way.than the CSA.  They think that's sufficient; weit's not sufficient.                       Okay.  So ­­                    Beyond that though ­­JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. RUSSELL:JUSTICE KAGAN:JUSTICE SCALIA:And this is for ­­ Assuming it's not18 19 2021 other22 would23 person would not.24 MR. RUSSELL: I ­­ I acknowledge that giving25 the statute what I think is a pretty straightforwardJUSTICE SCALIA:MR. RUSSELL:JUSTICE GINSBURG:   Okay.  We'll see.­­ their position.                         And who would that reachthan the ­­ the chemist?  The underground chemistbe in a position to know that, but an ordinaryAlderson Reporting Company17￼Official181 and ­­ and traditional reading does have the effect of2 making it substantially harder for the government to3 prove that mens rea for an ordinary layperson, but ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, my ­­ my under ­­5 well, the government will tell you, but my understanding6 of the government is it would be enough if the defendant7 knew the name ­­ the name of the drug, that it's blue8 fly ­­ 910111213141516171819202122232425￼MR. RUSSELL: Now, if ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ or whatever else. And if, indeed, that drug has the chemical composition.MR. RUSSELL: I won't spend the Court's time looking it up. I'm pretty confident that's not their position.JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. RUSSELL:JUSTICE KENNEDY:   Okay.That they've said the opposite.                              Suppose the courtinstructs the jury that it's ­­ it suffices if thedefendant knows that this is an illegal drug because ofits hallucinogenic effect.MR. RUSSELL: I don't think ­­ it ­­ again, the critical question is illegal drug. If it ­­ by that you mean illegal drug under the CSA.JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It's an illegal drug because of its hallucinogenic effect. Maybe that'sAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial191 incorrect because it has to be chemically the same, so2 that's incomplete. But it seems to me that should3 suffice for mens rea.4 MR. RUSSELL: Just to be clear. I think a5 court ­­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, excuse me, and7 then ­­ and then it's ­­ it's shown that this is8 chemically similar.9 MR. RUSSELL: Right. I think the Court10 would have to tell the jury that you can take into11 account the defendant's knowledge of its hallucinogenic12 effect in deciding whether he knew it was illegal under13 the Controlled Substances Act itself.14 And so what I'm quibbling with is just the15 unadorned word "illegal." I don't think it would be16 sufficient if a jury was convinced that the defendant17 thought it's a hallucinogenic effect and it's illegal18 under State law. That's why I was acting furtively.19 I don't think that a jury could, if it20 believed that, find the mens rea established unless, of21 course, it went under this factual knowledge prong.22 That's ­­ that's the ordinary way in which knowledge of23 unlawful possession of a prohibited item is proven.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The ­­ the instructions at25 page 14 of your brief ­­ the brief in footnote 9 ­­ can￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial3 MR. RUSSELL:4 JUSTICE KENNEDY:5 or what?6 MR. RUSSELL:7 that this is setting forth the elements. And so I think8 the element is that the defendant has to know that he's9 distributing an analogue. And then there's questions10 about ways in which to prove that. And I think the11 jury ­­ the ­­ the court could give an instruction of12 the sort that we proposed, which said that the defendant13 has to know that ­­ that this is an analogue within the14 meaning. It has the characteristics that make it an15 analogue within the meaning of the statute.16 Had the government asked for an instruction,17 it could have also given instructions that ­­ or the18 government can show that the defendant knew the conduct19 was unlawful generally. And you can make that ­­ or20 unlawful under the CSA itself. And you can reach that21 conclusion based on circumstantial evidence, including22 evidence concerning the defendant's knowledge about the23 drug's effect.24 But there's a world of difference between25 saying that this is relevant circumstantial evidenceNo.  Because ­­    Or ­­ or isit beyond hopeNo.  I ­­ I think ­­ recallAlderson Reporting Company20￼1 you say that by adding just a sentence or2 first paragraph?two to theOfficial211 about whether the defendant knew that he was violating2 the statute of conviction and what the government's3 position is, which is once you prove that the defendant4 knows that it's illegal at all, you're done. And the5 jury is compelled to conclude that mens rea is6 established. And I think that that's simply wrong.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to put you8 through this again, but it's important, I think for me9 anyway, to get it right. I understand your ­­ your10 understanding that the SG ­­ it's a big difference. The11 SG says you have to know it's illegal under any law.12 You say, no, under the CSA.13 Now, what was the other way in which you14 disagree with the government?15 MR. RUSSELL: I think that's the only way in16 which we disagree about the meaning of the statute.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But I thought18 that you were disagreeing about names and19 characteristics.20 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I was disagreeing with21 Justice Scalia. I don't think we're actually22 disagreeing with the government about that because I23 think they have said in their brief under the knowledge24 of identity approach, they have to show that the25 defendant knows the chemical structure and effects of￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial221 the analogue because it's not enough to simply know its2 name. And so I don't think that we disagree with each3 other on that.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask, Mr. Russell,5 about your difference as to whether it's under this6 statute or under any statute?7 If you look at some of the instructions that8 are given just under the CSA, not analogues, that some9 of the instructions just say that you need to find that10 the defendant knew that he was distributing some kind of11 prohibited drug. And they don't say a drug prohibited12 under the CSA. So if we use that as the analogy here,13 that would suggest that ­­ that the ­­ the jury wouldn't14 need to find the ­­ the analogue prohibited under the15 CSA and the Analogue Act, but just that they knew it was16 prohibited by something.17 MR. RUSSELL: Right. I think there is an18 ambiguity in those instructions, whether it's referring19 to unlawfulness generally, or unlawfulness under the20 CSA. I think courts ­­ what they really mean is under21 the CSA. And in the cases where the defendant has come22 forward and said, actually, I thought it was illegal23 under some other statute, in Hassan and again in24 Hussein, and ­­ and, I believe, the case of Morales.25 Three of the seven cases the government cites for this￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial23￼1 proposition, the Court has said, no, that's not good2 enough. And those are ­­ and that makes complete sense.3 Now, it ­­ it could be that in a lot of4 cases the government is going to present evidence that5 the defendant just thinks it's ­­ it's a controlled6 substance generally. And we agree that a jury can7 infer, absent other evidence, that he thought it was8 illegal under the CSA itself. But you have to leave9 open the possibility that the jury can, in a case like10 this, say, actually, no, he ­­ the evidence doesn't show11 that he believed it was lawful ­­ unlawful under the CSA12 because he looked at the schedules, and he quite13 reasonably believed that if they weren't on the14 schedules, they weren't illegal.15 I mean, I will acknowledge, the only reason16 that they are illegal if they're not on the schedule is17 the existence of the Analogue Act. And I'll acknowledge18 that prior to this case, I didn't know about the19 Analogue Act, and I think a lot of people didn't.20 And in the community where ­­ where my21 client was selling these things, these things were being22 sold openly in delis and gas stations that were being23 advertised in local newspapers and magazines. And24 that's, I think, consistent with the ­­ the fact that25 lots of people entertain the incorrect notion that ifAlderson Reporting Company17 JUSTICE SCALIA:18 Wait.19 MR. RUSSELL:20 JUSTICE SCALIA:21 mean?22 MR. RUSSELL:23 JUSTICE SCALIA:24 characteristics. Okay?

But if you take that view, we still winthis case because there's no evidence that Petitionerknew anything about the chemical structure of ­­ of whathe was selling here.JUSTICE BREYER: I assume your argument is simply that it's a kind of coincidence. You have to know that this substance is an analogue, and there are two ways you could know that. One way you could know it is you could know what the chemical composition of this is and what the chemical composition of, say, cocaine is. That would be one way. Very few people other than chemists know that.      Then there is a second way you could know.The second way you could know is that you know that itis forbidden by a law which has the title forbiddinganalogues.  And if you happen to know that it fallswithin that, of course you know it's an analogue becauseyou know it falls within it.  And those are the twoways.MR. RUSSELL: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: And no one's been able toOfficialWell.   ­­ they got you.I think ­­ I think we disagreeAlderson Reporting Company26￼Official27￼1 think of a third.2 And ignorance of the law is no excuse has3 nothing to do with this case. This is just a4 coincidence that those are the two ways you could know5 it was an analogue.6 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I certainly agree that7 those are the two ways that you can know that it is an8 analogue. And I don't think that ­­ that the government9 can even argue that it satisfied that burden in this10 case, much less that the jury would have been compelled11 to find that harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but you say that the13 government has to prove knowledge of two chemical14 compositions: The chemical composition of what is being15 sold, but also, the chemical composition of one of the16 items on the ­­ on the list of controlled substances.17 MR. RUSSELL: Yes. Yes. That is ­­ that is18 our position. And that ­­19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But only if that's the20 government's theory. Only if the government goes that21 route rather than the route of just saying you knew it22 was an analogue.23 MR. RUSSELL: That is correct. And, you24 know, I will acknowledge that going the knowledge of25 identity route in an analogue case is going to beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial28￼1 different ­­ difficult for nonchemists.2 But I think it's difficult for reasons that3 should not give the Court pause, which is simply that4 it's difficult for somebody to know, even if they know5 what the law is, whether what they're doing is illegal6 or not. And so, you know, our theory has the benefit of7 avoiding entirely the vagueness problems that we think8 are inherent in this statute.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there enough evidence10 in this case to go to the jury under the instruction11 that you want?12 MR. RUSSELL: Yes. I will agree that there13 was.14 And so the only question here is whether15 there should be a new trial under which we can have16 another discussion with the ­­ with the district court17 about what the proper instructions are ­­ I don't think18 we will have a lot of disagreement about that ­­ or19 whether the court should instead hold that the error is20 harmless.21 And it would be exceedingly unfair to do22 that in this case on the ground that Petitioner didn't23 prevent ­­ present sufficient evidence to rebut a theory24 the government wasn't making at trial. That's why we25 have and why we enforce forfeiture rules.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial29￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And this Court could, I think, quite easilyresolve this case by saying, as Justice Breyer did, hereis the legal rule, here are the two ways in which thiscan be proven, but the government in this case, to theextent it has some special new theory about illegalunder some other law has waived that argument by failingto preserve it.If I could reserve the remainder of my time. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      My friend, Mr. Russell, is almost correctabout the extent of the disagreement that's left in thiscase.  Our position is not that we can prevail if we canprove that the defendant believed that his conduct wasillegal under some law other than the CSA or theAnalogue Act.  Our position is that we can prevail if wecan prove that a defendant knowingly distributed a drugand that he believed that his conduct, that hisdistribution of the drug was illegal, generally.As Justice Sotomayor has ­­JUSTICE BREYER: My question is ­­ that IAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial30￼1 posed to him is really for you.2 MS. HARRINGTON: Would you mind repeating3 it?4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'll try.5 Suppose you have to show, and I think you6 do, that the defendant did know it is an analogue, say7 to cocaine. There are two ways you could do that. The8 first way is you could show that this defendant, being a9 graduate in chemistry, knows what the chemical10 composition of cocaine is, knows what the chemical11 composition of this other substance is, and knows they12 are the same. You're not going to be able to do that13 very often.14 MS. HARRINGTON: Right.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Another possibility is you16 could show that he knows that this particular substance17 is banned by a law that is called the ­­ the Analogue18 Act, because obviously if he knows that it is banned by19 the Act that bans analogues, it must be an analogue.20 Those are two ways you could prove knowledge.21 To prove that it is banned by the22 Anti­Turkey Shoot Act proves nothing about his knowledge23 that this is an analogue. And, therefore, once you say,24 as you are trying to say, I think, that some other25 illegality is enough to convict, I no longer understandAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial20 doesn't tend to show it's an21 MS. HARRINGTON:22 saying is defendants tend to23 doing is illegal, not under any particular provision,24 but just generally they believe it's illegal. And we ­­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what the statuteAlderson Reporting CompanyWell, the argument, asanalogue.Right.  Well, what I'mbelieve that what they're31￼1 the argument.2 MS. HARRINGTON:3 Justice Sotomayor pointed out, in the real world,4 defendants don't tend to know specific provisions of5 Federal law or State law, but they do tend to know6 whether what they're doing is illegal or not. And so7 our view is that the knowing or intentional standard in8 Section 841(a) describes a culpable state of mind. And9 one way to prove that culpable state of mind is to prove10 that the defendant knowingly or intentionally engaged in11 the act ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but then you're not ­­13 then you are saying the defendant does not have to know14 it is an analogue, and that, I think, you don't want to15 say.16 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, what we're saying ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you could think it18 was banned by some other act, and that would make you19 know that it is that thing that the other act bans. ItMS. HARRINGTON: Yes, and itJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what applies to. So you have to know that it law, not just know that you're ­­ you're That doesn't ­­ that's not what it says.­­the knowinglyviolates thata bad guy.OfficialMS. HARRINGTON: Well, in almost every context, the easiest way to prove knowledge of ­­ of this kind of statute is to prove that the defendant knew the facts that made his conduct illegal.JUSTICE SCALIA:MS. HARRINGTON:JUSTICE SCALIA:MS. HARRINGTON:Right.But what the knowing ­­Under the statute.But just to prove thefacts.  He doesn't have to have any awareness of thestatute, but if he knows all the facts, which in thiscase would include knowledge of the chemical structureand pharmacological effects, that's usually, in othercontexts, the easiest way to prove knowledge under thiskind of statute.      In this context, that's not the easiest way,and we think there is another way.  We think the knowingor intentional standard describe the culpable mentalAlderson Reporting Company32￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425says.  The statute doesn't say knowingly be a bad guy.It says knowingly manufacture, distribute, or dispense acontrolled substance.Official331 state, and this Court has said that that's ­­ that to2 prove knowledge, you don't always have to prove that the3 defendant knew all the ­­ the critical facts.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the ­­5 the Cuban cigar that turns out to be filled with6 marijuana?7 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I guess our primary8 submission is that it's sufficient if the government9 proves that a defendant distributed a drug and that he￼10 believed that doing so was illegal under some drug law;11 that he knew it was some kind of illegal drug. We think12 it would be ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 some drug law.15 MS. HARRINGTON:16 JUSTICE SCALIA:17 and I don't think your brief said it. It has to be18 illegal under some other drug law.19 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, just ­­ let me just20 point out the reason there's maybe not as much21 explication in the briefs is because there's a22 fundamental disagreement that became clear in the reply23 brief that ­­ that we disagree with Petitioner about24 what the courts of appeals have done in the CSA context.25 And I can get to that in a second.Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, it has to be underWell, we think ­­You didn't say this before,Official34￼1 But we think certainly it's sufficient if a2 defendant believes that what he's doing is illegal under3 a drug law, that he's distributing an illegal drug. We4 think it would be consistent with sort of broader5 principles if the Court held more broadly than that,6 that he believed that his conduct was illegal generally.7 You don't need to go that far in this case. The breadth8 of that hasn't fully been briefed in this case.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem ­­ I10 mean, that highlights what I think is the practical11 difference here. You've got a defendant who is12 obviously ­­ knows something's out there. He's trying13 not to do something, whether it's not to violate the CSA14 or whether it's not to violate anything. And you just15 want to be able to show to the jury, look, something is16 bothering him. He knows that something's afoot, and ­­17 and that's all you want to be ­­ have to prove, as18 opposed to he knows he's violating either the CSA or a19 drug law.20 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I just don't22 know how that works. I understand how that works in23 this case, because you just say to the jury, look,24 he's ­­ he's checking the schedule every day, he's doing25 this, he's doing that. But I'm a little concerned aboutAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial35￼1 extending that as a general matter, where it doesn't2 have to be the law in ­­ one, because I think usually3 it's not a question whether you know anything about the4 law at all, it's simply whether you know a question5 about the facts, and whether that happens to bring it6 under the law.7 But then I don't know how broad the8 principle is that you just have to know what you're9 doing is ­­ would raise a doubt in the jury's mind about10 whether you knew it was legal or not.11 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, so I ­­ I have two12 types of responses, which I'll just point out so that I13 can come back to them in case I don't get through them14 all. The first is a doctrinal point. And second, I can15 give you sort of a real world example of how this works16 in the CSA context.17 The doctrinal point is that this Court has18 held that there are other ways to prove knowledge other19 than that a defendant actually knew a critical fact.20 For example, the government can prove willful blindness.21 And the Court has explained, as recently as the22 Global­Tech case, that the reason you allow willful23 blindness to substitute for knowledge is not because24 being willfully blind to a fact is the same as knowing25 the fact. It's because a person who is willfully blindAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial      MS. HARRINGTON:that ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA:culpable?     MS. HARRINGTON:needs to hold that in this case.  We think certainlyit's sufficient if the government can prove that adefendant knowingly distributed a drug believing it tobe illegal to do so, whether or not he knew whatprovision of law ­­JUSTICE BREYER: It's illegal because, in fact, it's bad for animals, and the law involved ­­ prevents veterinarians from using this kind of drug for animal treatment. That's all he knows. That's all heAlderson Reporting CompanyWell, again, we believeYou think he's just asWe don't think the Court36￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to a fact has the same culpable state of mind as theperson who knows the fact.      And so we would submit that a person whoengages in an act intentionally and correctly believesthat doing that is illegal is at least as culpable, ifnot more culpable, than the person who knows all thefacts that make his conduct illegal.      And so the real world ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: He thought he was violating a sales tax law, and you're going to send him up the river for 15 years.Official1 thinks.2 Now, he's guilty of this statute? That3 doesn't tend to show at all that knowledge that he knows4 it's an analogue. But in your view, because he feels5 guilty, as perhaps he should, he's guilty of violating6 this law.7 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we do believe that8 that would establish the necessary culpable state of9 mind. But again, the Court doesn't really need ­­10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Can you give me11 any authority for that? I mean, your example of willful12 blindness is an example of where, in fact, in respect to13 this law, he knows there is a risk he is violating doing14 the conduct that it ­­ that it permits, he knows there15 is a serious risk, and he pays no attention to that at16 all.1718 fine ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER:20 analogy, I don't think.21 MS. HARRINGTON:22 shows is that you don't have to prove actual knowledge23 of a fact to satisfy a knowledge standard in a statute.24 And again, we think it would be perfectly sufficient for25 the Court to hold in this case that when the governmentMS. HARRINGTON:Well, we do think it'sThat's not a very strongWell, but I think what itAlderson Reporting Company37￼Official381 proved the defendant is distributing an illicit drug for2 human consumption and he believes that what he's doing3 is illegal, and he is correct about that, then that is4 enough to ­­ to satisfy the CSA or the Analogue Act.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it might be except6 that there is some evidence in this case different than7 what you're saying. He checked, according to his8 brother, the Controlled Substance Act; didn't see this9 listed. And also when he was told something was10 illegal, he flushed it down the toilet.11 So why isn't ­­ why don't we leave this to12 the court below to figure out whether the error was13 harmless or not, given the evidence in the case?14 MS. HARRINGTON: I certainly acknowledge15 that that is the Court's usual practice, to remand for16 application of a harmless error standard, and we17 wouldn't have any problem with the Court doing that18 here.19 We do think the evidence that you point20 tends to show that he may not have believed he was21 violating the CSA specifically, but he ­­ there is22 plenty of evidence to show that he knew and correctly23 believed that what he was doing was illegal. He sold24 his products in little baggies and vials ­­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. He has to￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial39￼1 know that it's a controlled substance?2 MS. HARRINGTON: He has to know that it's a3 controlled substance analogue. Where we differ is how4 you prove that ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not even an analogue,6 because plenty of people sell things thinking it's maybe7 cocaine, but in fact, it's crack, or they sell something8 else thinking that it's a different drug, they just know9 it's a drug.10 MS. HARRINGTON: We totally ­­ we are11 100 percent on the same page as you. I think Petitioner12 believes ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yeah, but you keep14 saying has to know it's an analogue. I think that's15 wrong. He just has to know it's a controlled substance.16 MS. HARRINGTON: Right. But I mean ­­ but17 by controlled substance, what we don't mean ­­ this is18 where we differ with Petitioner ­­ we don't mean that he19 has to know that it's illegal under Control Substances20 Act. That's Petitioner's position. That's not our21 position.22 JUSTICE ALITO: Is this a real world23 problem? This sounds to me like the most artificial24 distinction that I've heard in a long time. Is there ­­25 does Virginia have an Analogue Act? This is fromAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial40￼1 Virginia, right?2 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.3 JUSTICE ALITO: Does have Virginia have an4 Analogue Act that's different from the Federal Analogue5 Act?6 MS. HARRINGTON: I do not know that ­­ the7 answer to that question. Let ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO: Do the States typically have9 Analogue Acts, period, or do they have Analogue Acts10 that are different from the State Analogue Acts? You11 know, all of these cases ­­ unless this case involves a12 chemist, your proof that a person knew the thing was an13 analogue is going to be that this person engaged in all14 kinds of furtive conduct to try to hide it from ­­ from15 law enforcement.16 And so it's going to be for the ­­ for the17 jury to ­­ to determine, based on circumstantial18 evidence, whether the person knew that this thing was19 illegal under some law. And if it's not the Federal20 Controlled Substances Act, I don't know what act it's21 going to be. The defense is going to be, well, you22 know, I knew that it was illegal, but I thought it was23 illegal under the State Analogue Act, it wasn't illegal24 under the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Is that25 what we're worrying about here?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial14 might come into play here?15 MS. HARRINGTON:16 one, but I think our point17 defendants don't ­­ aren't18 right? They just know that what they're doing is19 illegal, and so we shouldn't have to prove that he had a20 specific ­­ a specific statute of conviction in his21 mind ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, I mean, I23 take your points that this is going to have a very small24 practical effect in terms of what either the prosecutor25 or the defense attorney is ­­ is putting on at trial.Alderson Reporting CompanyI think that sort of gets  Well, I'm not sure there isis that the defendant ­­ mostaware of any body of law,41￼1 MS. HARRINGTON:2 to the point, I mean, the way you sort of characterize3 what might be the right instruction, that you have to4 prove that the defendant knew it was ­­ or believed it5 was illegal under some drug law, we're fine with that.6 I think Petitioner would like the instruction to be that7 you have to ­­ the government has to prove that the8 defendant knew it was illegal under the Controlled9 Substances Act or under the Analogue Act.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, and the question I'm11 asking, a practical question is, we've got the Federal12 Controlled Substances Act, the Analogue provision. What13 is this other ­­ what is this other body of law thatOfficial42￼1 But it actually seems to me to be a real theoretical2 difference, which has implications far beyond this case.3 Then what Mr. Russell has suggested is two4 ways of showing that a defendant knew a fact. That the5 fact that he was distributing an analogue, and you might6 know it because you know the chemical structure and all7 its properties, or you might know it because you know ­­8 you know, somebody has given you a box and said, this is9 an analogue prohibited under the Analogue Act, and so10 you know that it's an analogue.11 So those are two ways of knowing a fact.12 But you're saying that in addition to knowing a fact,13 the mens rea is satisfied if you can just show that the14 defendant knew he was acting culpably in violation of15 some law. And that, it seems to me, is a theory that16 could be put on to any law. That in addition to knowing17 all the facts that a statute says you have to know, the18 government has an alternative way of proving its case,19 which is just to say, oh, look at ­­ look, you were20 acting culpably. You knew you were doing something21 wrong.22 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes, and again, you know,23 we would embrace a narrower articulation in this case of24 what your knowledge of illegality has to be. If you25 know you're violating a U.S. drug law or you know youAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are distributing an illegal drug, we think that'ssufficient ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose he thought that there was a labeling law and he was violating the labeling law. He's wrong, there is no labeling law, but it violates the Analogue Act. Guilty?MS. HARRINGTON: Under our view, that would be sufficient. We don't think the Court needs to reach that in this case because there's no suggestion thathe ­­ that his belief in illegality was that he was doing anything other than distributing an illicit drug, that he was violating some U.S. drug law.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you ­­ so you ­­ just to clarify, you ­­ you are saying it's not just any illegality, it has to be an ­­ a drug law that's ­­ that's a qualification.MS. HARRINGTON: We're saying at least for the purposes of this case, that is sufficient.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by "for purposes of this case"? What is the law generally? Must it be a drug law or could it be any law?      MS. HARRINGTON:      JUSTICE SCALIA:Ms. Harrington?  I mean ­­      MS.

HARRINGTON:5 turned out to be a real world problem, and I6 certainly understand the Court's concern, and I'm not7 trying to sort of blow it off or avoid answering it. I8 do think in the willful context, that that has ­­ the9 Court in Bryan said that's sufficient if ­­ if the ­­10 the defendant correctly believes that what he's doing is11 illegal, he doesn't have to have any sense of what law12 he's violating.13 Now, willfulness is generally thought to be14 a much higher mens rea standard than knowing or15 intentional, and although this Court has never addressed16 this precise question, both the model penal code and the17 Brown Commission Report have embraced the idea that when18 you satisfy a higher mens rea standard, you necessarily19 satisfy all the lower ones. Having said that, I20 understand the Court's concern ­­ I don't mean to21 interrupt you, Mr. Chief Justice ­­ but ­­ and so we are22 embracing a narrower articulation for the purposes of23 this case.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you say25 you're embracing the narrower articulation, but it seemsAlderson Reporting CompanyWell, I think ­­We can go on like this, butSo I think that has not45￼Official461 to me that's just a case­specific one, and Justice Alito2 is right, it's hard to see how that would make a3 difference here. But I think it could make a world of4 difference when you expand that to the other cases5 involving mens rea. And when you get to that point, it6 is sort of an ignorance of the law question. I mean, in7 all the cases involving mens rea, we do not ask whether8 you have any idea whether it violates the law or not.9 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in the ­­10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And ­­ and we ­­11 your position makes it much easier to convict people12 because you don't have to show that they even knew the13 facts that made their conduct illegal. All you have to14 do is say that ­­ under ­­ illegal under the law that15 they're being charged. All you have to do is say, they16 did something that makes it look like they knew that ­­17 they did something that makes it look that they were18 suspicious. And if we can find any law in the19 United States Code that makes what they did illegal, we20 can prosecute them for what we want to prosecute them21 for, even though they didn't know that the facts fell22 under that provision.￼2324 them25 tookMS. HARRINGTON: Well, you have to prosecute for the ­­ for the ­­ for the actions they actually that broke the law, I mean ­­Alderson Reporting Company2 that prosecution is you must show that they had the3 requisite mens rea.4 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:Official47 1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and part of￼And what you're6 saying is, we can show that simply by showing the jury7 that they were acting suspiciously.8 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I don't think9 that's quite correct. We have to convince the jury that10 the defendant in any case believed that what he was11 doing ­­ that the relevant conduct, which is in this12 case would be distributing the drug, violated the law,13 was illegal. You have to prove that beyond a reasonable14 doubt. And so just merely suggesting to the jury that a15 defendant was acting suspiciously, I think is not going16 to get the job done in most cases.17 And I do think in most contexts it is easier18 to prove that a defendant knows the facts that make his19 conduct illegal than it is to prove that he knew what he20 was doing was illegal ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the best case you22 can give us to help? In Morissette, the defendant23 didn't know that the surplus shell casings belonged to24 the government. And he was exonerated because he had to25 have an intent. Suppose that he ­­ he didn't know theyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial481 belonged to the government, but he thought that it was2 an illegal casing because it was dangerous. And he was3 wrong about that. But it did wrong ­­ could he be4 prosecuted then?5 MS. HARRINGTON: We think he ­­ we think he6 could be. I mean, I think all of the cases that ­­ in7 that line, the Morissette, Staples, all of those cases8 involved defendants who claimed that they genuinely ­­9 genuinely believed what they were doing was innocent.10 And so the problem for this Court was to try to figure11 out a way to construe the statute so that it didn't12 sweep in people who really were innocent. Now, this is13 a case where ­­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What ­­ what ­­ is there a15 case you have for us?16 MS. HARRINGTON: So ­­ so ­­ the easier17 cases where the defendant really truly believes that18 what he's doing is illegal, and those cases tend not to19 come to this Court. There are some statements in the20 opinion in Bryan. Now, Bryan was principally a case21 about the willful standard, but there was also a22 discussion of a knowledge standard. And in Bryan, the23 Court said the government doesn't necessarily have to24 prove that a defendant knew what he was doing was25 illegal, and I think the use of necessarily there￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial491 suggests ­­ at least leaves open the possibility that if2 the government did prove that, then it would be3 sufficient. The Court also said ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the best you have?5 MS. HARRINGTON: The Court ­­ the Court also6 said in Bryan that the defendant ­­ that the government7 merely needs to prove knowledge of the facts that make8 his conduct illegal, suggesting that that's an easier9 standard for the government to meet.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just ­­11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow12 up ­­ I'm sorry, just to follow up quickly on Justice13 Kennedy's hypothetical, what if he knew he was14 trespassing when he went on to the government property15 and ­­ and took the casings? You have to show he knew16 what he was doing was illegal, he was trespassing. The17 sign said government property. And so we can convict18 him for taking the shell casings.19 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we would we would tie20 it more directly to the conduct that actually violates21 the law. And so if ­­ if he needs to know that the22 taking of the shell casings is illegal, not that some23 ancillary conduct that, you know, brought him to the24 shell casings was illegal. And so here we would say,25 again, he needs ­­ the defendant needs to know that the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialsubstance is irrelevant.     MS.

And we think, you know, if you look at the ­­ I think we're on the same page with Petitioner in suggesting that thesame standard should govern both CSA cases and analogue cases. We just disagree about how the courts of appeals have applied this in the CSA context.JUSTICE ALITO: Let me try this out.Start with a drug that is on the list. All right. The defendant knows the chemical composition of the drug that's on the list. The defendant has no idea that this is on the list, knows nothing about the Federal drug laws. This person distributes it intentionally, knowingly.That person has violated the law. The person's ignorance of the fact that this is a controlledis.JUSTICE ALITO:MS. HARRINGTON:Official         Yes.  So, no, we agree.that if we can prove that a     Our position isdefendant knew what he was doing was illegal, that's away of proving that he knew he was distributing acontrolled substance analogue or a controlled substance.JUSTICE ALITO: But it's not something thatAlderson Reporting Company51￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that the thing is on the list, knows the chemical composition of it, and it turns out that this is an analogue, that is sufficient. That's not going to be the proof in most cases.And I think maybe the confusion is that the defendant ­­ a defendant's knowledge of the illegality of what he or she is doing is not something that has to be proven. It is circumstantial evidence that the person knows that the thing that is being distributed is something that is on the list.MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And, again, there's no list in the analogue context. It's ­­     JUSTICE ALITO:     MS. HARRINGTON:     JUSTICE ALITO:understand ­­     MS. HARRINGTON:I understand that. Okay.But it makes it easier to Yes.­­ if we imagine that thereOfficial521 you have to prove. You don't have to prove that he knew2 that it was illegal under Federal law, or under State3 law, or under any other law.4 You have to prove that he knew that it was a5 substance that constitutes ­­ that, in fact, constitutes6 an analogue.7 But the fact that he knows that it's illegal8 under Federal law is circumstantial evidence that he9 knew that it was something that fell within that10 definition.11 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. And it might help if12 I could give you sort of a real world example of how13 this has worked in the courts of appeals under the CSA.14 There's a number of ­­ of cases in the ­­ in15 the courts of appeals dealing with a substance called16 khat, which is K­H­A­T. Khat is a plant that's grown in17 the Horn of Africa, generally, and if you pick the18 leaves off the plant and chew them, it gives a stimulant19 effect. And the reason it gives a stimulant effect is20 because fresh leaves of khat contain a substance called21 cathinone, which is a Schedule I substance illegal under22 the CSA. It sort of produces amphetamine­like effects.23 So khat is legal in many places in the24 world. It's illegal to distribute it in this country25 because, again, it contains ­­ when freshly picked,￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425contains a Schedule I controlled substance.     So there are a number of cases where thegovernment has prosecuted people under the CSA for distributing cathinone in the form of distributing khat. And defendants in those cases have said, Look, I didn't know it had cathinone, I was distributing khat. It's legal where I come from, I have no what the chemical is in this ­­ in this plant. And the courts of appeals have generally upheld those convictions based onproof ­­ or when there is proof that the defendant knew that distributing the khat was illegal, even if he didn't know why it was illegal. Even if he didn't ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. The light is dawning slightly, maybe. Don't say I'm restating your argument correctly if I'm not.MS. HARRINGTON: Okay.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Please. The ­­ you're ­­ you're saying, first, he doesn't know the chemistry. So he doesn't ­­ he has to know it's an analogue, but he doesn't know the chemistry.     Now, you're saying, of course, if he knowsthat it is illegal under the Analogue Act, that's goodenough because he knows it's an analogue.MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Now you're saying if heAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial541 knows it's illegal generally under the drug laws, that2 should be evidence of the fact that he knows it's an3 analogue because let's ask him why do you think it's4 illegal under the analogue ­­ I mean, why do you think5 it's illegal under the drug laws? I'm going to tell you6 its not a listed substance. Why could it be? And he'd7 sort8 hmm,91011 because it's a lot like cocaine, he knows it's an12 analogue. And if say, using my, you know, far out13 examples, it's not because he thinks it's a veterinarian14 law.15 So what it should be ­­ is this right ­­ if16 I follow your argument, you'd say the fact that he knows17 it's illegal under the drug laws, is, itself, evidence18 that he knows it's an analogue, but he's free to come up19 if he wants with some kind of basis for saying that even20 though he thought it was illegal under the drug laws, he21 thought it was illegal under some other law that had to22 do with postage stamps or something. That ­­ that23 should be, if the jury believes that, get him off.24 Have I got it basically right?25 MS. HARRINGTON: That's a correct￼of be stuck there because he doesn't want to say, because it's a lot like cocaine.MS. HARRINGTON: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: Because once he saysAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficialthat's enough to proveanalogue.     JUSTICE GINSBURG:law" be other than theMS. HARRINGTON:context, there wouldn't be, but, again, our point is really that the defendant, generally, does not have a specific law in mind. He just knows that what he's doing is breaking the law.     And so when Petitioner says we have to provethat he knew he was violating the ­­ the statute ofconviction, we think that's a ­­ much too high a burden.The only time you have to do that is when you have awillful standard in the tax evasion context; right?This is certainly not that context.

Right? That some knowledge that you're violating a drug law is sufficient.     You know, and we think in this case there isactually ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said sufficient. HowOfficialAlderson Reporting CompanyWe think that's ­­ it's56￼Official571 about necessary? Is it necessary? Is the drug ­­ is2 the law that he thinks he's violating, be a drug law, is3 that necessary?4 MS. HARRINGTON: So, again, we think that5 there is ­­ that a broader view would be correct. But6 we are perfectly happy with a ruling in this case that7 it ­­ that it would be sufficient that the government ­­8 we don't think that there is necessarily a basis for9 limiting the knowledge of illegality specifically to10 drug laws. As long as you tie the conducts to the11 belief in illegality, we think that's enough.12 But we think it's definitely sufficient for13 this case to hold that when the government proves a14 belief that ­­ that he is violating a drug law, that15 that's enough.￼16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So ­­ so the conduct is17 related to the genus of illegality.18 MS. HARRINGTON: Right.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:I think ­­ I think 20 there are areas where criminal defendants do try to21 tailor their conduct to fall within, if they're captured22 or caught, particular laws but not others. I recall23 cases where that's true.24 I mean, hypothetically, let's say they know25 that this much marijuana or cocaine is a misdemeanor.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial581 If they got up to this much, you know, it's 15 years2 mandatory minimum, so they structure their activities to3 fall within the lower level.4 You would be able to prosecute them,5 according to your theory, for the big 15­year mandatory6 whatever, if they happen to go beyond the misdemeanor7 amount.8 MS. HARRINGTON: Certainly, yes. You know,9 if a defendant believed that he was distributing 1 pound10 of cocaine and it turned out ­­ and that's probably,11 it's, you know, I don't know what the right numbers are,12 but say he believed he was distributing 1 pound of13 cocaine. Turned out, he was distributing 5 pounds of14 cocaine and there's different sentence that applies for￼15 5 pounds.16 pounds of17 under the18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:19 do to your theory that they have to20 know is that it's illegal under the21 What ­­ what was illegal ­­ what they knew22 was the misdemeanor amount. And you're saying, well,23 that doesn't ­­ it doesn't matter that they ­­ doesn't24 matter that they didn't know they were distributing the25 larger amount.  If we can prove he actually distributed 5cocaine, then I think that would be sufficientControlled Substance Act.Alderson Reporting Company Well, what does that­­ what they have todrug laws.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425                         59So I took your hypotheticalOfficialMS.

He didn't know it was a going to be a felony because he didn't know he had that much of the drug.MS. HARRINGTON: Well, under our view, if he knew what he was doing violated a drug law, which Ithink would be the case in your hypothetical, thenthat's sufficient.     Now, of course, if he thought what he wasdistribute ­­ what he was distributing was oregano andit turned out to the marijuana, then we think thatwouldn't be sufficient because he would have believedwhat he was doing was innocent, and he wouldn't haveknown the facts that made his conduct illegal.In this case, there are ­­ there are plentyof facts to show that Petitioner really believed that what he was doing was illegal, and it turned out that he was correct. Again, he sold his products in little baggies and vials instead of having sort of more traditional commercial packaging. He charged $450 anAlderson Reporting CompanyHe knew what he wasBecause of theOfficial601 ounce for these products, which sort of undercuts his2 belief that he thought that they were aromatherapy3 products or things that you would actually pour into a4 bathtub.

HARRINGTON: He also acted furtively.22 You know, he sort of hid his products on his website.23 He wouldn't answer direct questions from his customers24 about which high, you know, was most like for the25 controlled substances.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial61￼1 And so we think there is certainly2 sufficient evidence to show that Petitioner in this case3 believed that ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Petitioner's5 counsel agrees that there is sufficient evidence to6 convict under a proper instruction.7 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. I mean, I think he8 has a different view of what a proper instruction is.9 And so, again, I understand that the Court10 generally remands for application of harmless error. We11 think that would be appropriate in this case,12 particularly, because the government didn't ask for this13 instruction because it was following circuit precedent14 below, and then defending a harsher instruction that was15 actually given in the case.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can we ­­ when a jury17 is told that human ingestion is enough, he has to ­­ he18 has to intend that this ­­ these bath salts are not to19 put in the bathtub, but to ingest, that's all that he ­­20 that was the only mens rea that was charged. Isn't that21 so?22 MS. HARRINGTON: It was not the only mens23 rea that was charged, Justice Ginsburg. That was the24 mens rea instruction that the government requested25 because that was what circuit precedent had said wasAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial62￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425enough. But the instruction that was actually given, told the jury it had to find that he knowingly distributed a controlled substance ­­ a substance that had the same pharmacological effects as a controlled substance.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell, you have four minutes left.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. RUSSELL: Let me start with the instruction.Justice Ginsburg, even under thegovernment's interpretation of the jury instructions as requiring the jury to find that the defendant knew about the similarity in effect, the government acknowledges it didn't require any knowledge about the similarity instruction. So the government has acknowledged that this ­­ the instruction here was inadequate, even under the government's new view of the law. And so the question here is simply whether or not they're entitled to take advantage of that, and to make a harmless error argument, based on a theory that they only developed in this Court.     But let me ­­ with respect to the generalAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial63 1 legal questions, let me start with ­­ with addressing￼2 their broad "any law will do" position. And that is3 simply, as I understand them now, premised on their4 thought that all the statute requires is culpable state5 of mind, but that's not what the statute says. It6 doesn't say distribute an analogue culpably, it says7 distribute knowingly.8 And this Court has9 knowing distribution of10 knowledge of the facts.11 exception that we've discussed that you can meet that by12 showing that there's knowledge under the law of13 conviction itself, but there is no precedent from this14 Court that gives the court ­­ gives prosecutors the15 option of either proving the facts, the defendant knew16 the facts that made the conduct unlawful, or simply that17 he acted culpably or that he knew that the conduct was18 unlawful under some law.19 Now, with respect to their fallback20 position, that it has to be illegal under a drug law,21 we're getting closer. We would agree, if they were to22 say, as some courts have said, including Hussein, which23 is a case they feature prominently in their brief, that24 it has to be a Federal anti­drug abuse law. Now, the25 truth of the matter is there's only one of those, butrepeatedly said thata prohibited item requiresAlderson Reporting CompanyAnd there may be a ­­ anOfficial641 the ­­ the value in that articulation is that it makes2 clear that the defendant doesn't have to know the name3 of the statute.4 But if the government's position is that5 it's enough that it be under State drug abuse laws, and6 Justice Alito, there are lots of State Analogue Acts,7 and there are lots of States that have been ahead of the8 government in putting on their schedules things that are9 analogues, including some of the substances in this10 case.11 That's clearly not what this Court has ever12 had in mind in interpreting the word "knowingly" in a13 statute. And it's up to Congress to decide what is14 culpable enough. And when it uses the word "knowingly,"15 it is entitled to know that that word is going to get16 the same interpretation that it has in the past. The17 government points to cases like Bryan in which the Court18 has said, in addition to knowing the facts, we must also19 know something about the law. And it says that, you20 know, willfulness is enough to establish knowing ­­21 knowing distribution. But of course, in those cases,22 it's not simply that they have some general knowledge of23 unlawfulness, they also know the facts that make the24 conduct unlawful.25 JUSTICE ALITO: A defendant who knowingly￼Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425                                                       65distributes heroin, knows that it's heroin, doesn't haveany idea that it's illegal, nevertheless has violated the law. Now, I don't see why the rule should be any different with respect to an analogue.MR. RUSSELL: I ­­ I don't say that it is. I think they have ­­ they can either ­­JUSTICE ALITO: So then the defendant doesn't have to know the legal status of ­­ of the drug.MR. RUSSELL: Again, we're talking about the government's alternative theory. The government always has the option ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sorry. If a State law calls it an analogue, he knows he's violating the State law, he knows this is an analogue.MR. RUSSELL: Well, if ­­ if he knew that he was violating a State Analogue Act that had the same definition under Federal law, I think you could then ask the jury to infer that he knew that he was violating the Federal law. But most of the time, as my colleague said, the government's evidence is simply going to be that the defendant knew that the conduct was unlawful somehow. And the jury is entitled ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: I ­­ I'm not sure that you answered Justice Alito's question fully.MR. RUSSELL: I'm sorry.OfficialAlderson Reporting Company1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 MR. RUSSELL:3 JUSTICE KENNEDY:4 MR. RUSSELL:He ­­ So ­­    Go ahead.So, Justice Alito, theOfficial5 government never has to prove the defendant's knowledge6 about the law at all, if it proves that he knows the7 facts that make the conduct unlawful. And so what we're8 objecting to is the government's alternative route to9 showing mens rea. And we agree with them up to the10 point of the fact that they think that it's enough to11 show that the defendant knew it was violating some State12 law or perhaps some provision of the FDA which regulates13 substances independent of the Controlled Substances Act.14 As a practical matter, in most cases, what15 the government ­­ the proof is going to be what the16 government described, which is simply that the defendant17 engaged in some furtive conduct that suggests that he18 knows that the substance is illegal.19 And unless the ­­ the defendant comes20 forward with some reason for the jury to think that, in21 fact, he had in mind that it violated some other law, or22 in fact, that he looked and ­­ and came to the23 conclusion it doesn't violate this Controlled Substances24 Act, then the jury is very likely to find mens rea25 established, and we don't have any problem with that.Alderson Reporting Company66￼Official67￼1 In this ­­ just to finally address the facts2 of this case. The fact that my client was distributing3 things in baggies rather than vials shows that he was4 doing this from his home business. The fact that he was5 charging large prices shows that he thought he had found6 a loophole in the Federal drug laws. There is no reason7 in the world why he would have ­­ if I could finish this8 sentence ­­ why he would have flushed his product down9 the toilet when he discovered that it contained a10 substance
