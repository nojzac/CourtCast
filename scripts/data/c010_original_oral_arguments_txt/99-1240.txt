Patricia Garrett.6 Mr. Sutton. 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 9              MR. SUTTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may10    it please the Court:11              In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act12    in 1990, Congress invoked its powers to regulate13    interstate commerce and to enforce the Fourteenth14    Amendment.  We do not challenge Congress' authority to15    pass the ADA under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, doubt16    anyone ever would bring such an across-the-board attack on17    the law, yet it is precisely the virtues of the ADA as a18    matter of Commerce Clause legislation, its breadth of19    coverage, its exacting accommodation requirements, that20    make it unsustainable as a section 5 law.21              Now, before this Court has authorized Congress22    to impose extra constitutional duties on the States, it23    has required the Congress to show that the States brought24    this loss of authority upon themselves first by engaging25    in a widespread pattern and practice of unconstitutional3 1    conduct and, second, by showing that the remedial 2    legislation is proportionate and congruent in nature. 3              QUESTION:  Let's -- 4              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, there were congressional 5    findings that there has been discrimination against the 6    disabled in voting, health services, transportation, 7    education, and so on, and there are numerous examples in 8    the legislative record, and those are areas of traditional 9    State control.  Do you think that those findings are10    somehow false, or not relevant in some way, or that the11    discrimination is just not unconstitutional, or what?12              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, they're exceedingly13    relevant, and they certainly sustain the ADA as matter of14    Commerce Clause legislation, but just as with Kimel and15    the age laws they refer only to discrimination in general.16    They don't establish constitutional violations.17              QUESTION:  Well, that's what I'm trying to press18    you on a little bit, because the findings in some19    instances are in areas that are under traditional State20 control.21              MR. SUTTON:  That's true, Your Honor, and22    there's no doubt if we had a situation where Congress had23    actually identified constitutional violations in these24    areas of State control, Congress would have section 525    authority.4 1              QUESTION:  Did the findings distinguish at all 2    between discrimination that was the result of the State as 3    opposed to, say, the county or the city? 4              MR. SUTTON:  Not at all, Your Honor.  There's no 5    distinction whatsoever between State, city and county when 6    it comes to constitutional violations.  It's usually just 7    local government and State government generically put 8    together, but the key point is in the ADA the age laws, in 9    the statement of purpose and findings, it was exactly the10    same.  In fact, in the age --11              QUESTION:  Why isn't it a constitutional12    violation when one witness said, the Essex Junction School13    System said they were not hiring me because I was using a14    wheelchair?          MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, it might well bea constitutional violation, but the fact of the matter isthat particular allegation was won by just one side of the15161718    dispute.19202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, I mean, I pick that out becausethe SG's brief is filled with references, and we have allthese amicus briefs that are filled with references alongthe lines I just said.          Now, if I -- is it that I'm supposed to countall those, and they have a whole lot here in a huge stackof briefs, and count them all and then say, well, they're5 1    just not enough, or there are enough?  Why wouldn't, say, 2    200 instances like that be enough? 3              MR. SUTTON:  Well, the first problem, Your 4    Honor, is that it wouldn't be a remedial section 5 problem 5    because, if those allegations are true, if there's no 6    rational explanation for what was done they all violate 7    State law.  They would -- all 50 States by 19 -- 8              QUESTION:  Well, they tell us, for example, that 9    a lot of States didn't have laws, to use this case,10    involving cancer, or perceptions of handicap which really11    weren't, and then they list all kinds of flaws in those12    laws in these briefs, and I suppose they're probably right13    in terms of the facts here.14              MR. SUTTON:  But Your Honor, the risk is one of15    constitutional violation.16              QUESTION:  Well, I mean, that's what I'm asking.17    That's what I'm trying to get to.  Why isn't it a18    constitutional violation where Congress has lots and lots19    of instances of States that seem to discriminate against20    handicapped people under instances where, given the21    information in front of them, for some reason or other,22    these handicapped people have not been able successfully23    to avail themselves of State law.24              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, those would be relevant25    if Congress had made a second finding, which is just6 1    critical and is what is exactly missing here, and that 2    finding had been, despite this conduct by States in local 3    areas of local control, the States weren't enforcing the 4    very antidiscrimination laws they had on the books. 5              Let's draw an analogy to the race cases.  If in 6    the early sixties every State in the country banned 7    literacy tests, all right, banned the very thing Congress 8    was trying to get at, it would not be enough for Congress 9    to say literacy tests are causing problems.  They would10    have to make a second showing which is, the States are not11    enforcing their laws on the books.12              QUESTION:  So if, in fact, in the sixties, there13    had been discrimination in the South, and we discovered14    there was a State law banning racial discrimination,15    Congress would not have been able to pass laws against16    racial discrimination in your view without --17              MR. SUTTON:  In the early sixties they would18    have been, because I think in the early sixties you would19    have been able to show that the States, those were shams.20    They were statutory Potemkin villages.  They meant21 nothing.22              QUESTION:  And today?  What about today?23              MR. SUTTON:  There's no showing on that front,24    not at all, Your Honor.  There's no -- Congress did not25    even look in the direction.  It's true they looked in the7 1    direction of -- excuse me. 2              QUESTION:  Let me ask you, suppose we have a 3    real case or a hypothetical case along the lines described 4    by Justice Breyer, a very egregious case, a person 5    absolutely confined to a wheelchair.  That person can't 6    get into the court hearing on time, or can't get into a 7    voting booth, and you have an insensitive State official. 8    In that single discrete case, could there be an action 9    brought under the Equal Protection Clause to compel the10    access, compel access to the court, compel access to the11 building?12              MR. SUTTON:  Well, I think you've got two13    possible issues there, one what type of review, would that14    be a rational basis setting, or because it's a --15              QUESTION:  That's why I'm asking.16              MR. SUTTON:  -- fundamental right, and so17    therefore would you have heightened review.18              I think there would be situations in which you19    might bring a constitutional claim, but -- and I hope I'm20    getting to your point --21              QUESTION:  Would the court be wrong to say that22    there's a quasi -- would the court be wrong to say there's23    a quasi-suspect class here, or suspect class?24              MR. SUTTON:  I don't think the issue would be25    changing rational basis scrutiny.  The issue would be8 1    whether it's a voting rights problem which gets heightened 2    review, but Your Honor, the key point on voting, access to 3    courthouses and access to voting booths, the ADA does not 4    correct that problem. 5              To the extent you think that was the 6    constitutional problem the ADA was getting at, it exempted7 all -- 8              QUESTION:  Well, what I'm trying to find out -- 9              QUESTION:  Mr. --10              QUESTION:  -- is if there's ever an equal11    protection violation on a stand-alone discrete case --12              MR. SUTTON:  Mm-hmm.13              QUESTION:  -- where a State discriminates14    against a person by reason of a severe handicap.15              MR. SUTTON:  That --16              QUESTION:  Does that state an equal protection17    violation, and if it does, why is it that the courts can18    do what Congress cannot?  That's the line of inquiry I --19              MR. SUTTON:  Why is it that the courts have more20    authority here to limit that type of State conduct than21    Congress?22              QUESTION:  Yes.  It would seem that that's one23    consequence of your argument, and I want you to address24    it.25              MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, I think if it91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9were -- if I were in the situation where I was saying thecourts had more remedial authority than the Congress I'dhave a real problem, because of course that's not what'sgoing on.  The point of section 5 is to give Congressremedial authority.          But the point I'm trying to make on thecourthouse access to buildings point is that that's notsomething the ADA addresses.  The Congressional Recordshows that by 1990 every State in the country had anarchitectural barriers law that precluded the building ofnew buildings that didn't have access.          QUESTION:  But you're willing to concede,apparently, that it is a constitutional violation not tomake special provision in public buildings for those whoare handicapped.          MR. SUTTON:  Well --          QUESTION:  That is a denial of equal protectionof the laws.          MR. SUTTON:  I'm not willing to concede that,Your Honor, because --          QUESTION:  Do you know of any case that has held          MR. SUTTON:  I don't, Your Honor and I would, infact, point the Court to Alexander --          QUESTION:  When Congress was speaking of                            1010111213141516171819202122    that?2324 2589 10 11          MR. SUTTON:  There's not.  In fact, of all theFederal --          QUESTION:  I don't know why you're running awayfrom it.  It seems to me that's the core issue in this          QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton --12    case.131415161718    one.19202122232425discrimination could it possibly have been referring tothe statutory definition of discrimination?          MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, and there's no doubtthat's what they were referring to.          QUESTION:  Is there any compatibility betweenthat and the constitutional requirement of equal1234567    protection?          QUESTION:  Whether, in fact -- whether, in fact,making special accommodation for those who arehandicapped, or the failure to do so, is a violation ofthe Constitution.  I think if it is your case is a hard          MR. SUTTON:  It's not, and there's no Federalcivil rights statute --          QUESTION:  But Mr. Sutton, isn't this anemployment case rather than an access case?          MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, it's a challengeto the ADA across the board.  There's just oneabrogation --111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But the particular claims areemployment claims, and is it not at least theoreticallypossible that refusal of employment to a person because ofa handicap would be an equal protection violation,regardless of whether the access provision was?          MR. SUTTON:  Well, if there were only arbitraryjustifications for a decision --          QUESTION:  Should they have ruled --          MR. SUTTON:  -- you have no problem.          QUESTION:  -- that nobody with an artificiallimb can ever have a job of a certain character?  Youcould say that wouldn't pass the rational basis test,couldn't you?          MR. SUTTON:  There's no evidence, Your Honor,that there are any such State laws --          QUESTION:  No, but in that kind of ahypothetical you would agree that that could be aconstitutional violation?          MR. SUTTON:  If there were -- no -- if all youhad were arbitrary justifications for that law, of courseyou would.  That's City of Cleburne, and that's all of theequal protection cases.          QUESTION:  If there were no rational basis forit, in other words.          MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.                            121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324    remedy.25              MR. SUTTON:  Oh, there can be a Federal remedy,13          QUESTION:  But there might be a rational basisfor refusing to hire a teacher who was in a wheelchair --          MR. SUTTON:  If this Court's --          QUESTION:  -- if only that the school is notproperly equipped to accommodate such a teacher.          MR. SUTTON:  This Court said that very thing ina case involving the Federal Government, where it saidbudgetary constraints alone can state a rational basis.          QUESTION:  How about Justice Stevens'hypothesis, a man with an artificial limb turned down fora teacher, just without any real basis for it, you know,we're just afraid we might not be able to handle you.MR. SUTTON:  Well, if there --QUESTION:  That would be arbitrary.MR. SUTTON:  I think that is arbitrary, and Ithink that would be a problem.  The question, though, iswhether there was evidence of that going on in theeighties, number 1, and number 2, were State laws againstthat very thing not being enforced.          QUESTION:  Well, assuming there was evidence ofthat kind of discrimination, I really don't understand theargument that the fact that there are State remedies alsoavailable makes it impermissible for there to be a Federal1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718    enforced.19              QUESTION:  So I take it if you went back to20    Justice Breyer's example and used the hypothesis of maybe21    200 examples -- I don't know how many we've got, but maybe22    that many were adduced -- and in each of those instances23    Congress had said not only, we find here is an example of24    an instance of discrimination, but Congress had also25    expressly said, and we find that in this example there was                                  14and that's why the Commerce Clause legislation is fine.The question is whether you can trump --          QUESTION:  No, I --          MR. SUTTON:  -- the Tenth or Eleventh Amendment.          QUESTION:  Why couldn't there be a FourteenthAmendment Federal remedy, even though there also was aState remedy?  I don't quite understand the thrust of yourmain argument.          MR. SUTTON:  Because the very point of section 5is to correct State conduct that violates theConstitution, and if the States aren't violating theConstitution, one --          QUESTION:  Yes, but the fact that a State remedyexists does not necessarily mean that discrimination isnot taking place.          MR. SUTTON:  I agree entirely, and that's whyone has to look at whether the State laws are being 1    no enforcement of State law to correct it, and it had 2    matched its 200 examples with 200 examples of State 3    failure to enforce, do I understand your position to be 4    that then there would be an adequate legislative predicate 5    under section 5? 6              MR. SUTTON:  Yes, and I -- the answer is yes, 7    but I just want to -- 8              QUESTION:  So that if you win this case, 9    Congress could go back and dredge up from its record its10    200 examples and, if Congress said well, we now -- you11    know, we've checked into this, and in each of these12    examples there was no State enforcement, Congress could13    then pass the act again under section 5 and it would -- on14    your view would be valid?15              MR. SUTTON:  No.  Yes to the first, but no to16    the second.17              QUESTION:  Okay.18              MR. SUTTON:  The second problem with the ADA is,19    it's unlike any section 5 law to my knowledge ever20    enacted, and certainly ever upheld by the Court, in the21    sense that it truly is a constitutional amendment in22    section 5 clothing.  It applies not just to every State,23    but every form of Government service that ever existed or24    ever will exist.25              That truly is evading Article 5 and the                                  15 1    requirement that two-thirds of each House approve a 2    constitutional amendment and, most importantly, the 3    States, three-fourths of them, get an opportunity to 4    change it, and that's exactly what would happen, and 5    that's what would be very risky about allowing that 6    hypothetical to justify the ADA. 7              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, would you -- I thought we 8    were talking just about the employment section, those of 9    the ADA, but you're saying no, it's broader than that.10              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, we've briefed the case11    that it is all of the ADA.  There's just one abrogation12    provision that applies to, you know, title I, title II,13    and title IV, so I'm not sure how you could slice it that14    we're just dealing with employment, but if, Your Honor, we15    were dealing with employment, and you had Justice Souter's16    hypothetical, 200 instances, just employment, States17    refusing to enforce, sure, you would have a problem.18              QUESTION:  Well, you would want to know,19    wouldn't you, Mr. Sutton, whether these 200 instances20    were, quote, discrimination, close quote, in the sense21    that Congress used it, or discrimination in the sense that22    it's used in the City of Cleburne --23              MR. SUTTON:  Well, I --24              QUESTION:  -- as that's different.25              MR. SUTTON:  Well, I assume, Justice Souter,16 1    that's what you were saying.  Yes.  I mean, absolutely. 2              But my -- if we're going to talk about this 3    solely as an employment case, which is fine by us, we're 4    perfectly agnostic about the issue, this case is Kimel.  I 5    mean, it's exactly like Kimel.  It's employment.  You've 6    got, in fact, a greater gap between a statutory standard 7    and a constitutional standard, and an equally anemic 8    record when it comes to constitutional violations.  I 9    mean, even --10              QUESTION:  Well, the difference that I wondered11    about is, Kimel I thought was ambiguous as to whether or12    not a rational basis test applies, and I'd be13    interested -- I know you're probably aware of the14    argument, the SG makes it, that rational basis is a test15    that courts have created in order not to intrude upon the16    province of the legislature.17              But there is no reason to have the province of18    the legislature not intruding upon the province of the19    legislature and, therefore, you don't need to apply that20    strict a matter and should respect the congressional21    judgment that, in fact, there is unreasonable22    discrimination being exhibited in these States against23    handicapped people.24              I would like to get your response to that kind25    of an argument.17 1              MR. SUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor.  It's an important 2    point.  There's no doubt that when it comes to run-of- 3    the-mill legislation, City of Cleburne is right.  We need 4    that authority to enact these 50 State laws and the 30 5    Federal laws that protect the rights of the disabled, so 6    there's just no doubt about that at all. 7              But in the section 5 context you've got two 8    other issues, the relationship between this Court and its 9    final Marbury power and the relationship between the10    Congress and the States, and that's why the section 511    inquiries are always different.  You've got a zero sum12    game.  Congress' gain is invariably the State's loss, and13    just as Congress gets a presumption of constitutionality14    in enacting these 30 Federal disability laws, so do the15    States get a presumption of constitutionality that when16    they pass these 50 State laws, 1) they're presumptively17    good and 2) they're enforcing them.18              Now, that can -- you know, that's not19    dispositive, of course.  Ultimately, if it turns out the20    States aren't enforcing them, they're just shams, well21    then they're got a problem and, you know, that's why the22    voting rights laws are --23              QUESTION:  I don't think the issue is one that24    is encompassed by getting into presumptions of25    constitutionality.  The issue, I think, that's getting18 1    raised is one about, let's say the competence of the 2    courts to make judgments, particularly when we get into 3    the rational basis area to make sound judgments and it 4    seems that the courts are not as good second-guessers 5    there, perhaps, as legislatures may be. 6              But the fact is, Congress is a legislature, and 7    it is not laboring under the judicial disability as a 8    second-guesser, so why do we -- I mean, I go back to the 9    question raised.  Why should we apply the same standard10    that we would if we were dealing with a court's review?11              MR. SUTTON:  Well, I hope I'm answering both12    questions.  If one is concerned about the institutional13    capacity of the courts versus Congress in this area, the14    last thing this Court should be doing in this case is15    making ultimately these section 5 findings itself, okay.16              So if you're going to agree with Justice Breyer17    and the suggestion in your question, Justice Souter, that18    there has to be a little more deference to Congress in19    this area, the last thing the Court should be doing is in20    a situation where they don't ask the right questions,21    constitutional violations as opposed to violating a22    statutory standard, number 1, number 2, are the State23    laws, all 50 of them on the books being enforced, the last24    thing anyone's --25              QUESTION:  You're right, but this is just a19 1    question of standard, and you're saying, look, whatever 2    standard you apply, be careful to realize that you don't 3    have, on your view, a sufficient predicate in the record 4    to pass muster on any standard.  That's one argument, and 5    I think we understand that, but why should the standard be6 the same? 7              MR. SUTTON:  Because, Your Honor, it's not easy 8    being the Supreme Court and deciding what the Constitution 9    means in all these cases, but the bottom line is the10    Marbury power rests here in this building.  It doesn't11    rest anywhere else, and clever arguments about how12    Congress needs more deference to find out when13    constitutional violations really exist is just a nice way,14    a polite way of putting the fact that they across the15    street get to decide what the Constitution means.16              I don't know how else to divide it, but that is17    what's going on, if they can enact a law that applies to18    every Government services --19              QUESTION:  Can I ask you, on this very -- the SG20    has headlined in his brief, S report number 116, at page21    18, and in big letters, current Federal and State laws are22    inadequate.  That was right out of the Senate report, so23    why wouldn't that be a finding that current Federal and24    State laws are inadequate?25              MR. SUTTON:  It is a finding, it's entitled to201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      deference, and it applies to the Commerce Clause Article I      justification for passing this law.  That does not suffice      to show there are constitutional violations, and      certainly --                QUESTION:  The question is, I suppose,      inadequate to do what, inadequate to do the good things      that need doing?                MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.                QUESTION:  Or inadequate to assure compliance      with the Constitution of the United States?                MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.                QUESTION:  And the report doesn't say the                MR. SUTTON:  No, it does not and I invite15    everyone to read it.  That's exactly what's going on.16              QUESTION:  All right.  That's the other17    question, but that's what you were answering.  Why isn't18    this a constitutional -- if Congress finds that there are19    all these problems going on with the States, and the20    current State laws are inadequate to help these21    handicapped people who are discriminated against, why22    isn't that sufficient to show the problem that permits23    them to act under section 5?24              MR. SUTTON:  I hope -- I'm fearful that I'm25    not -- I didn't hear the question, but let me try to2110111213    latter.141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9answer.  You can cut me off as soon as it appears I didn'thear what you were saying.          But they've got to be constitutional violations,Your Honor, and if they're not constitutional violations,they haven't asked the right question.          QUESTION:  And they are not constitutionalviolations because --          MR. SUTTON:  That's not the question they wereasking.  The question they were asking is precisely theone Justice Scalia asked, which is, isn't -- is thisadequate, can we do a better job.  Of course we can do abetter job.          You know, I think in 1985 the Court issued twodecisions which seemed to me to get right to the heart ofthe matter.  Not only was it --          QUESTION:  Why weren't they asking about theconstitutionality if they explicitly abrogate the State's101112131415161718    immunity?19202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  I've no idea, Your Honor.  I'velooked through the --          QUESTION:  They could only do that under theFourteenth Amendment.          MR. SUTTON:  That's exactly right.          QUESTION:  So then they must have been talkingabout the Fourteenth Amendment.22123456    1997.7          MR. SUTTON:  Not necessarily, Your Honor.  Thatdoesn't follow necessarily at all.  I mean, one you couldhave an abrogation provision, and States are free to waiveon their own.                QUESTION:  Well, Seminole wasn't decided until10    of the section 5 inquiry.  I found two.  One of them cites11    Fullilove, Representative Dellums saying there's a broad12    section 5 power.  Fullilove is no longer good law.13              The second cites Morgan v. Katzenbach and just14    has a sentence that says, embracing the broader version of15    Morgan saying that if there's an antidiscrimination issue16    out there, Congress can remedy under section 5, but that's17    not the inquiry, and as early as 1970 it was clear that18    was not the inquiry in Oregon v. Mitchell, when the Court19    invalidated Congress' effort to lower the voting age from20    21 to 18 in all States in the country.21              MR. SUTTON:  Mr. Sutton, you've made something22    in your brief of the absence of a congressional provision23    to treat the Federal Government, or Federal employment on24    a par with private sector employment.  You emphasized25    that, but I didn't see the connection between that and the                                  23               MR. SUTTON:  No, until 7 years afterwards,8    that's exactly right, but I've looked to the Congressional9    Record trying to find instances where Congress was aware 1    section 5 inquiry that's before us. 2              MR. SUTTON:  Yes, Your Honor.  It goes to the 3    second question, not the record issue but the 4    proportionality issue. 5              Congress purported to be remedying, in their 6    words, a national epidemic regarding disability 7    discrimination, and they decided that in order to do that 8    you needed money damages actions, which is really all that 9    is at stake here in light of Ex parte Young.  How can they10    say that it's a proportionate and necessary tailored11    remedy when they're not only not imposing it on private12    business in many instances, but on themselves?13              That just doesn't stand.  It's not only the14    failure to lead by example, just direction, but it doesn't15    show proportionality.  I mean, it proves our very point.16    This was not needed.  It's not proportionate to the very17    problem they were trying to correct.18              QUESTION:  What is being imposed on State19    governments that's not being imposed on private employers?20              MR. SUTTON:  Money damages actions in public21    accommodations requirement.  Title II applies to any form22    of discrimination plus access to public services.  Under23    title III those provisions, most of those provisions are24    extended to private businesses, and there are no money25    damages remedies there, which really proves the difference24 1    between the State's ability to lobby, and private 2    businesses. 3              QUESTION:  But with respect to the kinds of 4    cases that we're dealing with, with employment, there are 5    money damages against individuals. 6              MR. SUTTON:  That's true, Your Honor.  I mean, 7    again -- but if this is an employment case, which is fine 8    by us, it really is controlled by Kimel, because the gap 9    between the statutory standard and the constitutional10    standard is even broader in this case than it was in11    Kimel, and then --12              QUESTION:  Well, your -- I'm sorry.13              QUESTION:  That's a proposition a little hard to14    maintain, because in the age discrimination area this15    Court has never found a violation of the rational basis16    test, but in the handicapped area we've found a bunch of17    violations.1819202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  This Court has never found oneagainst employment, Your Honor.  If we're going to stickwith employment, there are none with respect toemployment, zero.          QUESTION:  But there are a number of other areaswhere there have been constitutional violations, but nonein the age area.          MR. SUTTON:  Well, I suspect, Your Honor, if we                            251    reviewed all of the Court's constitutional findings there2    would be cases in which an elderly person was a plaintiff3    and won a constitutional case.4              QUESTION:  Yes, but not that it was5    unconstitutional to place the discrimination on the basis6    of that person's age.7              MR. SUTTON:  I think that's true, Your Honor,8    but I mean, if you can remedy constitutional violations in9    one area by transferring it to another area, then we10    really should talk about the entire ADA, and talk about11    its biggest flaw. Its biggest flaw that it is a section --12    it is a constitutional amendment in section 5 clothing.13    It applies to every single form of Government service, and14    if they're allowed to do this, they'll do it in every15    area, rational basis scrutiny of all sorts.16              QUESTION:  May I ask you if you think the17    congressional findings might have been phrased a little18    differently if they'd been made after the Seminole19    decision?202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  It's certainly possible, YourHonor, and one of the best things I think that can be donehere is, instead of the Court having to engage in thissection 5 inquiry on the basis of the Government lawyersafter the fact, let them do it again.But I will suggest this, Your Honor.  It is not                  26 1    going to be as easy as one submits to say -- 2              QUESTION:  It seems to me you're suggesting that 3    we treat the Congress of the United States as a trial 4    court and remand the case to them to prepare better5 findings. 6              (Laughter.) 7              MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  No, Your Honor, 8    not at all.  The ADA would be invalid.   12202, Section 9    12202 would be invalid, and it would be up to them to10    decide what they wanted to do.  In fact, in City of Boerne11    this Court invalidated the RFRA.  They're back at it12    again.  They're entitled to do that.13              I will submit that there is a bright line here.14    It's constitutional violations.  U.S. Senators, U.S. House15    of Representatives Members are not going to lightly find16    States are violating the Constitution, but we want them to17    ask that question.  That's the very point of section 5.18    We want them to look out, root out this type of invidious19    discrimination, and if it's going on, have them ask the20    right question, identify it, and end it.21              QUESTION:  May I go back to the remedy question22    that Justice Ginsburg raised?  Is it your position that23    with respect to the damages remedy that you zeroed in on,24    that that would fail the proportionality test unless the25    same remedy were applied to the National Government and to27 1    private employers generally?  Is that the position that 2    you're taking? 3              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, it certainly helps our 4    case and it makes it a lot easier, but to be candid with 5    you, if they imposed this same remedy on the Federal 6    Government, I think they would still have problem, 7    precisely because it applies to every Government service, 8    but it just makes it -- 9              QUESTION:  Well, it may not be sufficient, but10    is it your position that it would be necessary to survive11    the proportionality --12              MR. SUTTON:  Not in this case, Your Honor.  The13    breadth of coverage and the gap between the statutory and14    constitutional standards are enough in this case.                If I could reserve the rest of my time for                QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Sutton.                MR. SUTTON:  Thank you.                QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, we'll hear from you.                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS1516    rebuttal.171819202122232425          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:          I want to begin by responding to what Mr. Suttonsaid in his opening, that the ADA rests securely on the28 1    Commerce Clause.  No State would ever challenge that, and 2    so what's at issue here is quite narrow. 3              Indeed, States are challenging in the lower 4    courts the Commerce Clause predicate for title II of the 5    ADA, and they are arguing that in light of this Court's 6    decisions in Lopez and Morrison that so many State 7    activities and programs are not commercial in character 8    and, thus, cannot be reached by the Commerce Clause, so 9    that were this Court to hold that the ADA is not proper10    Fourteenth Amendment legislation, there is significant11    danger that the ADA would be without a constitutional --12              QUESTION:  But has -- Mr. Gottesman, has any13    court bought that argument?  After all, there is the14    Garcia case to deal with, and --15              MR. GOTTESMAN:  So far there is one district16    court that has bought the argument, Pierce v. King, 91817    F.Supp. 932.  The issue is now pending in several courts18    of appeals on appeals by the State.19              QUESTION:  This would be an argument that could20    be made only by the State, not by a county or a city, I21 take it.22              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, no, because a county or a23    city -- if you take the Fourteenth Amendment away, the24    Fourteenth Amendment argument -- the Eleventh Amendment25    argument is available, of course, only to a State, but if29 1    you say that the ADA is not grounded in the Fourteenth 2    Amendment and courts later hold that it is not grounded in 3    the Commerce Clause, then it is not appropriate 4    legislation directed to either, as we understand it. 5              QUESTION:  I would think that if you lose the 6    Commerce Clause challenge the least of your worries is the 7    States.  You're going to have many more businesses who 8    employ people, that they're going to be exempt. 9              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, except only -- title II10    applies only to the States, and so it, losing title II is11    losing -- I'm sorry.  In that sense it applies to State12    and local governments, and if it goes down under the13    Commerce Clause then State and local governments will not14    be governed by title II.15              QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, I'm not sure that the16    record here presents much in the way of a title II claim.17    I know the Ninth Circuit has said that all employment18    disputes under the ADA are covered only by title I, not19    title II, that title II addresses public services, and I20    know the grant of certiorari covered both, ostensibly,21    because the plaintiffs' cause of action appeared to22    address both, and I think this Court probably hasn't23    decided whether all employment cases fall under title I,24    but if we thought they did, do we have to address the25    title II issue?30 1              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, no.  If you resolved in 2    this case, although the question is not presented, the 3    conflict among the circuits as to whether employment 4    discrimination also violates title II, and if you decided, 5    adversely to our position, that it does, the position we 6    advanced in the lower courts, then yes, only title I would 7    apply to employment, and only it would be at issue. 8              But we would hope that before this Court 9    resolved that important issue that has divided the courts10    of appeals, that there would be an opportunity for11 briefing.12              In this case, the petitioners never raised an13    objection to title II's application to employment, so it14    never became an issue in this case.15              Now, I want to turn to the merits of the16    Fourteenth Amendment argument and we want to suggest as a17    preliminary petitioners have never really acknowledged an18    important body of Fourteenth Amendment decisional law,19    which is that even when we're dealing with groups or20    classifications that are covered by the rational basis21    standard, it is irrational for a State to act with a22    purpose that is irrational.23              A number of Supreme Court decisions have held24    that State action that rests on invidious prejudice,25    irrational fear, false stereotypes that have evolved from31 1    those prejudices and fears, desires not to be discomforted 2    by association with disfavored classes, patronization, if 3    that's what actually motivates a State decision, that 4    itself provides the irrationality which violates the 5    Fourteenth Amendment. 6              QUESTION:  And how does one usually determine 7    that?  I mean, I would usually consider it to be 8    irrational and motivated by prejudice when there's no 9    practical reason for it.  Doesn't it boil down to the same10    thing?  You look to see whether, indeed, there's a11    rational basis for what's been done.  If there's no12    rational basis, you say it must be motivated by, you know,13    irrational prejudice or stereotyping, or whatever.14              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, surely it's the case that15    when we see that there could be no rational basis, that16    will fuel our conclusion.17              QUESTION:  I'm not sure it advances the ball.  I18    think the two boil down to the same.19              MR. GOTTESMAN:  But the irrational purpose prong20    of Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is not limited only21    to those cases where it is irrational, where the decision22    itself would have to be irrational.23              That is to say, it's a well-developed concept24    that a State may take an action where there could be some25    rational reason for the action, but we determined that321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reason is a pretext --          QUESTION:  I understand.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  -- that what really motivatedthem was hostility to the class.          QUESTION:  I just don't know how you prove that,except by looking at whether there is, in fact, a rationalbasis.  How do you prove that --          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, that problem of proof,Your Honor, is precisely why Congress found the need toadopt prophylaxis here, and -- but I want to, before I getto that, to lay out just what Congress --          QUESTION:  That puts the cart before the horse.They have to have shown unconstitutional State actionbefore they can use the prophylaxis.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Correct, so --          QUESTION:  And you're saying theunconstitutional State action is going to be based uponnot the realities out there, whether there was a rationalbasis, but whether, even though there was a rationalbasis, the States somehow were acting out of irrationalhatred of the disabled.  How do you establish that?          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well --          QUESTION:  Did Congress establish it?          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes, it did.          QUESTION:  Tell me how.33 1              MR. GOTTESMAN:  What it did was find that these 2    kinds of motivated actions are widespread.  Let's just -- 3              QUESTION:  I didn't catch the last word, Mr. --4 are what? 5              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Widespread. 6              QUESTION:  Widespread. 7              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Pervasive was their word.  What 8    they said in the findings on the face of this statute is 9    that there is pervasive prejudice, still, today, or still10    in 1990, when they enacted this statute, there is11    pervasive prejudice against persons with disabilities, a12    history of purposeful unequal treatment, outright13    intentional exclusion, stereotypical assumptions that are14    wholly false and linked to prejudice, and they said these15    animuses, or animi, have been aimed at a group which has16    been historically disfavored and which constitutes a17    discrete and insular minority.18              There is a we they way in which people think19    about persons --20              QUESTION:  That proves that prejudice exists.21    Does it prove that State action has been taken on the22    basis of that prejudice when there is rational basis for23    the State action?24              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes, because Congress went25    through enormous volumes of material that showed that34 1    State action had been taken on the basis of that 2    prejudice. 3              QUESTION:  Let's not talk about State action for 4    a minute, Mr. Gottesman.  Let's talk about the States and 5    the Eleventh Amendment section.  What findings did 6    Congress make, what examples did it use to tie in the 7    States with this sort of irrational discrimination? 8              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Fair enough, Your Honor.  Here, 9    I will talk only about States and only about employment,10    because that is the narrowest focus.11              As the Government's brief shows, there was an12    enormous volume of State discrimination across wide13    sectors, really everywhere, which is not surprising if you14    accept the premise that there are pervasive, widely held15    prevalent views that stigmatize and disadvantage persons16    with disabilities.17              QUESTION:  Now, when you say discrimination in18    answer to this question, you mean --19              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Fourteenth Amendment --20              QUESTION:  -- unconstitutional --21              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Correct.22              QUESTION:  Unconstitutional action.23              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Correct.  Congress had two --24    three kinds of evidence.  Number 1, it had individual25    incidents, and it had them in substantial number.351              QUESTION:  By people who were acting for the2    State?34    you -- here's a couple of examples.  A woman crippled by5    arthritis is denied a job as a teacher in a university6    because they don't want the students to have to look at7    her.  That is prejudice of a kind that would violate the8    Fourteenth Amendment.9 10 11 12 1314    side?151617    finding?18QUESTION:  What was the basis for that finding?MR. GOTTESMAN:  Testimony of the teacher.QUESTION:  Was there -- of the teacher?MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.QUESTION:  Was there any testimony on the otherMR. GOTTESMAN:  No, because the State --QUESTION:  Just hear one side and make aMR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.  I'll give                MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, the States were -- the19    States spoke about this statute.  They spoke in favor of20    this statute.  The States told Congress, a) we have this21    problem, and b) State laws are inadequate to deal with it.22    That's why we support the enactment of this statute.  We23    need the remedies.24              QUESTION:  One witness who says, the reason I25    didn't get promoted was my arthritis, and Congress says36 1    State -- unconsitutional state discrimination. 2              MR. GOTTESMAN:  There are hundreds of these, 3    Your Honor, not one, hundreds.  But broader than that -- 4    if Your Honor wants, I'll give you some more.  A 5    microfilmer at the Kansas Department of Transportation is 6    fired, and he is told, the reason you are being fired is 7    that we have now discovered that you have epilepsy.  He 8    has throughout his tenure there been performing above the 9    standards required for employment there.  Now, Your Honor10 can say --11              QUESTION:  That is unconstitutional12    discrimination?13              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.14              QUESTION:  That is irrational discrimination?15              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.16              QUESTION:  Whether it's good or bad --17              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.18              QUESTION:  -- maybe it shouldn't exist, but you19    think there is no rational basis.20              MR. GOTTESMAN:  That is correct, and Congress21    thought that --22              QUESTION:  On the facts of this case, could the23    plaintiffs have gone to a court of competent jurisdiction24    and established an equal protection violation?25              MR. GOTTESMAN:  They could if they could prove37 1    the motivation.  They would have to prove the motivation. 2    They would have the burden of proving the motivation, but 3    yes, if Pat Garrett was demoted from her position as 4    director of nursing because of some antipathy on the part 5    of the person who made that decision, or some irrational, 6    erroneous stereotype, that would be a case -- 7              QUESTION:  Are there cases in the State courts, 8    or in the lower Federal courts which have accepted this9 rationale?10              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, there are cases -- because11    of the prior existence of section 504, we've cited in our12    briefs some cases that were brought.  Understandably13    courts don't reach constitutional questions, so they can14    find it violates the statute, but the findings made in15    those cases are that employees were denied jobs out of16    irrational antipathy.17              QUESTION:  But if this is so evidently an equal18    protection violation, why haven't courts for the last 30,19    40, 50 years routinely entertained these challenges and20    given relief?21              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Because it is the burden on the22    plaintiffs -- first of all there have not been that many23    cases -- we -- let me back up for a minute.  We would not24    expect to see reported decisions of that.  If a plaintiff25    comes in and has the kind of evidence that would win an38 1    Equal Protection Clause, the odds are that case is going 2    to get resolved before you ever see a -- 3              QUESTION:  You're telling me that over the last 4    30 or 40 or 50 years there have been numerous cases in the 5    courts where handicapped and disabled people have 6    routinely made equal protection claims and prevailed? 7              MR. GOTTESMAN:  No, that they have made claims 8    and have prevailed under section 504, with the court not 9    reaching, as it should not reach, a constitutional10    question if it finds that the statute was violated, but11 I --12              QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, what are your other13    two arguments?  You had three, I believe.14              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes, the three prongs.  One was15    the individual cases.  Second is the studies.  Congress16    had a number of studies of State employment.  They're all17    cited in our brief.  One of those studies was performed by18    a congressionally created committee, the Advisory19    Committee on Intergovernmental Relations, whose very20    function was to police whether Congress was overregulating21    the States, unnecessarily regulating the States.22              Its membership consisted predominantly of State23    and local governmental officials, and it submitted a24    report to every Member of Congress while the ADA was under25    consideration recounting the findings of its own inquiries39 1    of State officials in which it asked State officials, can 2    you explain why there is such a low percentage of persons 3    with disabilities working for you? 4              And overwhelmingly those State officials 5    responded, yes, the problem is that middle managers, the 6    people who make these kinds of decisions, the personnel 7    decisions in our State, are afflicted with negative 8    attitudes about persons with disabilities, discomfort 9    about working among them, myths and stereotypes about the10    incapacity of people with disabilities to perform jobs,11    things that have been -- and the report goes on to say12    this.  Empirical studies over and over and over again have13    shown that these myths are false, that there is not a14    higher turnover rate among persons with disabilities.15              QUESTION:  Were these findings by Congress?16              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.  Congress -- you say are17    these findings by Congress.  Congress made extensive18    findings that these things are true, that all of these19    things are animating decisions.20              QUESTION:  This report that you're now21    describing was a report made to Congress by --22              MR. GOTTESMAN:  That's correct.  This was a23    report to Congress, and we cite six other reports by24    various -- many of them conducted by the States25    themselves, saying we have a terrible problem.  Our40 1    supervisors have qualms about hiring people with 2    disabilities.  They're uncomfortable with it. 3              So that's the second body of evidence, and the 4    third body of evidence is the evidence that Congress had 5    about the reality of the psychological attitudes in our 6    society about people with disabilities.  In accommodating 7    the spectrum, which was the report of the Civil Rights 8    Commission, they relied upon extensive bodies of 9    professional evidence that showed that there were four10    crippling attitudes that many people in our society have11    about people with disabilities.12              They are discomforted about being around them.13    They have stigmatic attitudes about them.  They think they14    are inferior, less than normal human beings, that they15    hold all kinds of erroneous stereotypes about them, that16    cancer is contagious, that epilepsy --17              QUESTION:  Do you think it is proper to leap18    from these general psychological generalizations about the19    society at large, and State employers in particular, to20    the conclusion that the States have been acting21    unconstitutionally?22              MR. GOTTESMAN:  My light is on, Your Honor.23              QUESTION:  You may answer, Mr. Gottesman,24    briefly.25              MR. GOTTESMAN:  The point is that --411 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  The answer is yes.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  No, the answer is --          (Laughter.)          MR. GOTTESMAN:  No, the answer is, they have allthree together.  It's not just, should we rely onpsychiatrists.  We have the evidence of what actually ishappening.  We have the acknowledgements of the State inthese studies, and we have the understanding of why thisis happening from the psychological studies.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gottesman.          General Waxman, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES          GENERAL WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The question was -- reference was made to thecaption in the Senate report, and it also appears in theHouse report, of Congress' conclusion that the Stateremedies were inadequate, a conclusion that was alsosupported by the 50 State Governors' committees thatexamined this issue, and the question I think that JusticeScalia asked was, inadequate to do what, because that,after all, is the issue.          Now, this is a case where a statute was enactedbefore Seminole Tribe and before Boerne, and therefore the42 1    paradigm that this Court has created for the words, the 2    precise magic words that we would now expect Congress to 3    use didn't -- can't, I think, fairly be imposed on a 4    coordinate branch of Government. 5              But the answer, Justice Scalia, to the question, 6    I think, is determined by reference to what the 7    legislative record before Congress, not only when it 8    conducted its eighteen hearings and amassed seven separate 9    complete reports in enacting the ADA, but also when it10    investigated the problems that led it to create the CRIPA11    statute, the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized12    Persons, and IDEA, and others, but looking just --13 looking --14              QUESTION:  But General Waxman, it's not magic15    words.  The whole point of City of Boerne is that when16    Congress alters the Federal balance it must consider very17    carefully the consequences of doing so, and to say that18    it's simply magic words does not do justice or respect to19    that very fundamental principle, and the Federal --20              GENERAL WAXMAN:  I absolutely --21              QUESTION:  And the Federal balance is altered22    far more under the Fourteenth Amendment than it is under23    the Commerce Clause.24              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Justice Kennedy, I agree, and I25    would say therefore that the question fairly put is43 1    whether the Disabilities Act sweeps more broadly than 2    Congress could reasonably have deemed necessary to remedy 3    and prevent the constitutional problem it found applying 4    this Court's definition of the standard, and what it found 5    were four things. 6              It found, first, that there is pervasive and 7    widespread discrimination against the disabled, which is 8    often the product of hostility, overbroad and irrational 9    stereotypes, and deliberate selective indifference, the10    hallmarks of unconstitutional intent.11              QUESTION:  General Waxman, do you agree with Mr.12    Gottesman that if the -- supposing there emerged a 55-13    year retirement law, rational basis, relied on in Kimel,14    do you agree with Mr. Gottesman's suggestion that if a15    court could be persuaded that when the legislature acted,16    that they really had it in for people over 55, that that17    would be invalid?18              GENERAL WAXMAN:  No, I -- well, I don't think a19    court would -- a court would not find that invalid,20    applying a rational basis standard, because this Court has21    had -- has held that under rational basis review of22    legislation one looks at whether there is a conceivable23    rational basis that would support a distinction, and that,24 in fact --25              QUESTION:  Well, but now, I don't want to put44 1    words in Mr. Gottesman's mouth, but I understood him to 2    say that sure, rational basis, but if you could prove that 3    although there was a rational basis for requiring people 4    to retire at 55, if the legislature that enacted that had 5    really been motivated by a dislike for people over 55, 6    then it would -- there would be a violation of equal 7    protection. 8              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, Justice -- Mr. Chief 9    Justice, this Court has made clear that as a paradigm10 of --11              QUESTION:  Are you in the process of answering12    my question?13              (Laughter.)14              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Was -- if your question was15    whether I also understood Mr. Gottesman to say that, I --16              (Laughter.)17              QUESTION:  No, no, no.18              (Laughter.)19              QUESTION:  Do you agree with Mr. Gottesman?20              GENERAL WAXMAN:  I do not agree that a21    legislature that could have had a -- a legislature that22    could have had a rational reason for doing something23    which, in fact, was motivated by invidious discrimination24    would be struck down if this Court applied rational basis25    review, but Cleburne, it seems to me, and the other cases45 1    in which this Court has dealt with and remarked on 2    discrimination against the disabled points the way to the 3    correct resolution of this case, and before I -- I do want 4    to address that, but first I'll finish -- 5              QUESTION:  Well, do you think it provided 6    rational basis as the foundation of review in Cleburne? 7              GENERAL WAXMAN:  In Cleburne -- 8              QUESTION:  Or something more? 9              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, there is a great debate10    about the answer to that question, but I will answer the11    question on the assumption that the Court in fact applied12    rational basis review, but what the Court explained was13    that rational basis review is contextual, and context,14    just like applying the proportionate and congruence test,15    is contextual, and it requires a reference to the16    historical context in which it arises.17              And what this Court said in Cleburne is, we are18    not going to look first at the facial constitutionality or19    unconstitutionality of this statute.  We're going to20    require, in the unique context of a history of pervasive21    invidious discrimination against the disabled, what this22    municipality's reasons were.  And having looked at that,23    it concluded that the -- that it must have been motivated24    by an invidious intent, because the proferred reasons were25    not, in fact, rational.46 1              Now, Cleburne, in the context of many other 2    cases in which this Court and Justices of this Court have 3    remarked on the history of pervasive invidious 4    discrimination against the disabled, provided -- 5    essentially gave Congress the blueprint in which it acted 6    in this case, and here's why. 7              QUESTION:  Do you think Congress can by law 8    establish that the disabled are a discrete minority 9    entitled to heightened scrutiny in reviewing legislation,10    or action by States?11              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Our argument doesn't depend on12    it, but I think the answer from Cleburne is yes, because13    in Cleburne what this Court said -- and I don't have the14    exact words in front of me -- was that because15    discrimination against the disabled is such a complicated16    issue, that is, because there are reasons why differential17    treatment is sometimes permitted and, indeed, perhaps the18    Constitution sometimes requires it, that we have to give19    broad deference to the legislatures, and we have to let20    legislatures deal, as they more competently can, with this21    difficult problem, unless --22              QUESTION:  We said the same thing in Kimel.  We23    said, rational basis scrutiny, much legislative latitude.24              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but25    what this Court said in Cleburne is, because of that471    unique history, absent congressional direction, we will2    apply, as a paradigm of judicial restraint, rational basis3    review.45678910111213141516171819202122232425GENERAL WAXMAN:  That --QUESTION:  That's quite different.GENERAL WAXMAN:  And I'm not suggesting to the          QUESTION:  Well, but -- I'll reread Cleburne,but Cleburne said that in order to defer to the authorityof the legislature to pass a zoning law, that did not haveto do with the authority of the legislature to declare asuspect class.contrary, Justice Kennedy.  I was responding to JusticeO'Connor's question about whether a legislature couldinstruct a court to apply a different level of scrutiny,and the language in Cleburne that says access --          QUESTION:  And you think Congress can do that?          GENERAL WAXMAN:  We -- I believe, as Cleburnesays, absent congressional direction we apply rationalbasis for review.          QUESTION:  But I persist in the point that thatdid not address Congress' authority and scope andprerogatives under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.That's quite different.          GENERAL WAXMAN:  I agree that that's notnecessarily the case, but if I can simply point out,48 1    Justice Kennedy -- this actually does go back to Justice 2    Scalia's original question -- that not only was -- I mean, 3    it is important, it is critical here to understand that 4    not only does the Congress find a massive record of 5    discrimination based on states of mind that are the 6    hallmarks of constitutional intent, but also that this 7    discrimination is the legacy of a not-too-distant past in 8    which Government practices deliberately isolated, 9    segregated, and withheld from the disabled fundamental10    rights and the chance to participate in mainstream life.11              When Justice Marshall wrote, in his separate12    opinion in Cleburne, a statement that no Justice13    contradicted, that a regime of State-mandated segregation14    and degradation that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled15    and, indeed, paralleled the worst excesses of Jim Crow --16              QUESTION:  Well now, General Waxman, are we then17    to look through separate opinions, dissenting opinions,18    and say if the majority didn't contradict them they must19    have been subscribed to by the whole Court?  We've never20 done that.21              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Not at all, Justice --22              QUESTION:  I'm surprised that you would simply23    cite an opinion like that, as if -- unless the majority24    said, gee, we don't agree with that statement, it suggests25    the majority did agree with it.49 1              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, the point 2    I'm making is more broadly that Congress itself had before 3    it a record not only of what was going on currently, but 4    what had produced it.  The Civil Rights Commission 5    prepared a report -- 6              QUESTION:  What you were citing was Justice 7    Marshall's opinion, and are you saying that Congress could 8    rely on that? 9              GENERAL WAXMAN:  I'm -- as an observation of10    historical fact, Congress could certainly rely on it, and11    he was not the only one in Cleburne to make that12    observation.  Justice Stevens, writing for himself and the13    Chief Justice, said that through ignorance and prejudice14    the mentally retarded have been subjected to a history of15    unfair and often grotesque mistreatment.16              QUESTION:  Well then, one -- Congress could make17    its record, I take it, out of statements in dissenting18    opinions from this Court.19              QUESTION:  I have to write more dissents and20    concurring opinions, I guess, if I want to be really21    influential.22 23 24 25(Laughter.)          GENERAL WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, so that I amnot -- I don't want to be misunderstood.  This is notan -- I'm using the -- Justice Marshall's categorization50 1    because I think it well-reflects the evidence that 2    Congress itself heard.  The Civil Rights Commission report 3    accommodating the spectrum which was submitted to Congress 4    at its request details at great length, and was decided -- 5    and was issued before Cleburne, the history of State- 6    sponsored intentional, pervasive isolation and segregation7 and -- 8              QUESTION:  Unconstitutional.  Did they use the9 words --10              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Yes.11              QUESTION:  -- unconstitutional?12              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Yes.  Forced -- yes, it does.13    Forced sterilization, refusal to allow --14              QUESTION:  What does?  What does?15              GENERAL WAXMAN:  The --16              QUESTION:  The congressional findings here?17              GENERAL WAXMAN:  The Civil Rights Commission18    report uses the word, unconstitutional, but whether it19    does or not, the practices -- I don't think anybody -- I20    don't think that Mr. Sutton would conclude that the21    historical practices -- and I'm not suggesting they22    persist, but we're talking here about a section 523    authority not only to deal with a pervasive current24    problem, but to remedy the effects of past intentional25    unconstitutional discrimination.51 1              The remedy for past segregation and isolation is 2    integration, and that explains in part why the 3    Disabilities Act admittedly reaches some conduct that a 4    court applying rational basis review would not deem 5    unconstitutional.  It's both.  It's that -- 6              QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, is it really rational 7    basis review?  I mean, Cleburne does -- the result seems 8    at odds with the -- with just anything goes, which had 9    been what rational basis meant.10              I thought that the Cleburne decision was very11    much like Reed v. Reed in the gender area.  That is, the12    Court purported to apply rational basis, but came to a13    result that didn't square with any prior rational basis14 decision.15              GENERAL WAXMAN:  The one thing one can certainly16    say, whatever words one uses, and Justice Stevens in his17    concurrence in Cleburne, as I recall it, basically says, I18    don't really know whether we have three distinct19    typologies.  I consider all of this rational basis review.20    It just depends on how high the justification is and how21    great the reason there is to suspect that something22    unconstitutional may be going on.23              But it is clear that what Cleburne did was, in24    looking at the actual administrative bureaucratic25    decision, as opposed to the legislative choice, require an52 1    articulation of the actual reasons in the context of 2    alleged discrimination in this unique historical area. 3              And what Congress did essentially was to 4    generalize what this Court did in Cleburne.  It took this 5    Court's specific inquiry in Cleburne in the light of the 6    Court, many instances in which the majority of this Court 7    has remarked about the history of discrimination in 8    Choate, Alexander v. Choate and other cases, and it 9    applied it to what Congress had in front of it, which was10    on the one hand a body of half-a-dozen or a dozen11    comprehensive studies detailing a widespread problem and12    historic unconstitutional practices, and over 5,00013    narrative accounts that the congressional task force14    accumulated of individual instances of discrimination15    against the handicapped, 600 of which addressed State or16    local governments which for purposes of the Fourteenth17    Amendment and State action have to be considered as one.18              QUESTION:  What about judicial findings, a19    question posed to your colleague.  One would really have20    expected, if this was a massive constitutional problem,21    that there would have been a large number of cases that22    had found the States guilty of unconstitutional action.23              GENERAL WAXMAN:  May I --24              QUESTION:  Yes.25              GENERAL WAXMAN:  May I answer?53 1              QUESTION:  Yes. 2              GENERAL WAXMAN:  At footnote 11 in our brief we 3    cite some of those decisions but, as this Court recognized 4    in Watson v. Forth Worth Bank & Trust there are many, many 5    instances in which subconscious attitudes and prejudices 6    cannot be proved to a judicial exactitude. 7              Thank you very much. 8              QUESTION:  Thank you, General Waxman. 9              Mr. Sutton, you have 5 minutes remaining.10              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON11                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS12              MR. SUTTON:  Three brief points, Your Honor.  I13    certainly hope City of Cleburne applied rational basis,14    because if it didn't the ADA has many constitutional15 problems.16              If the -- if in the area of discrimination17    against the disabled you apply heightened review, just18    consider the very problem of defining who is disabled and19    who is not under the law.   You're going to have20    underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness problems that21    would never survive heightened review, so let's hope it's22    rational basis scrutiny.  That was the very point of the23    law.24              Second, I've not heard anything today from the25    other side --54 1              QUESTION:  And how do you explain the results? 2    I mean, one could conceive of many bases that would uphold 3    that zoning provision, and yet the court not only didn't 4    attempt to justify the legislation, but held the 5    legislation to a rather stringent burden of justification. 6              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, I would disagree 7    respectfully.  When a Government lawyer comes before a 8    court, whether at the trial level or this Court, and 9    offers five explanations for a law that they all say are10    rational, it turns out they're not, they're irrational and11    driven by animus, they lose.12              QUESTION:  I thought under classic rational13    basis review the court was not only to listen to the14    Government's argument, but if there's any basis it could15    conceive -- and surely there were bases that could be16    conceived --17              MR. SUTTON:  I --18              QUESTION:  -- that were not driven by animus --19              MR. SUTTON:  To be honest with you, I've20    never -- I'm not aware that that is the Court's rule, that21    the Court's job is to conceive of rational basis.  I22    always thought that was the job of the Government lawyer23    to come before the court -- the inquiry is not exactly24    what the Government did.  It's whether there's any25    rational explanation after the fact.55 1              And, as this Court's decisions prove, there are 2    probably a dozen to two dozen of them.  There are some 3    instances where they can't come up with anything, and 4    that's exactly what happened there.  Whether it was good 5    lawyering, bad lawyering, the end result, everything they 6    identified was not rational. 7              The second thing, I've not heard anything from 8    the Government or the private respondents in their briefs 9    or today about the second half of the City of Boerne10    inquiry.  There's nothing about proportionality and, as11    the Court said in Kimel, Florida Prepaid, and City of12    Boerne itself, the issue on proportionality is whether the13    statutory standard covers, quote, substantially more14    conduct than would be found unconstitutional.  That itself15    invalidates this law.16              Now, the question of discrimination, whether it17    exists at the society or the Government level, I think18    this Court's decisions from 1985, one of them written, by19    the way, by Justice Marshall in Alexander v. Choate,20    Justice Marshall says in a 9-0 decision, the main problem21    with disability discrimination is not one of intent.  It's22    one of either trying too hard, needless paternalism, or23    not trying hard enough, unintentional neglect.  That's the24 problem.25              That's an Article I problem, and we're happy the                                  561 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ADA was enacted.  The only challenges that have been madeto it to our knowledge are in the prison setting, and it'sabout inmates and, if there's one area where maybeinterstate commerce doesn't go, it's to a prison, wherethe very point of a prison is to keep people out ofinterstate commerce, so --(Laughter.)          MR. SUTTON:  And I don't think that's a verygood example.          Unless there are any other questions --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Sutton.          QUESTION:  Well, if you have a minute, I wouldlike to go back to equal protection of the law.          Equal protection of the law might be violatedwhere a State official has a bad reason for doingsomething, though he might have a good one.  As you pointout, a court probably wouldn't catch that violation,because a court has to apply a rational basis test, butthat's for institutional reasons, so why should we applysuch a test where the institution is Congress?          So do you see what I'm -- I'm trying to get --          MR. SUTTON:  I understand exactly what you'resaying, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. SUTTON:  But to apply the test you're57 1    suggesting is one that requires the overruling of City of 2    Boerne.  The very point of City of Boerne -- 3              QUESTION:  City of Boerne, if I find City of 4    Boerne ambiguous on this point, on the point of whether 5    it's going to -- whether a court would find a violation, 6    or whether there is a violation, if I find it ambiguous on 7    that point, can't I pre-crank in my institutional 8    considerations? 9              MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor.  I would suggest10    that's just the power to use section 5 to redefine11    section 1, and that is what City of Boerne says, and12    that's what Kimel says, also a rational basis case.  But13    at the most, Your Honor, if you're going to talk about14    individual decisions by Government officials, that's why15    you need a pattern and practice.  It's a very big16    distinction between individual officials doing something17    and State laws that discriminate invidiously.  That's the18    Voting Rights Act cases, versus City of Boerne, versus19 Kimel.202122232425          Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Sutton.The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)58
