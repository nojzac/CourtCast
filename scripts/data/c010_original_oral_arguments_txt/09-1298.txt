United States.Mr. Phillips.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPSON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:The proposition that Petitioners are herechallenging is the one adopted or embraced by the Federal Circuit that says that the United States Government can declare that certain of its government contracting partners have operated in default and, under those circumstances, can reach into the government contractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion of moneys that were spent by the United States, but for services that were rendered, without question, pursuant to the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the United States Government, and that when the contractor seeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in some kind of default conduct, that the government canassert the state-secrets privilege and, in so doing,Official - Subject to Final Review4￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review51 deprive the contractor of the ability effectively to2 respond to the government's conclusion.3 Under those circumstances, it seems to me4 that the statement in this Court's decision in United5 States v. Reynolds, which is that the government is6 certainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege,7 but when it does so, it has to assume certain8 responsibilities that come from it, at least in the9 circumstances where the United States is the moving10 party.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, when the12 contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first13 aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their14 reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract15 price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.16 At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but17 I think at that time the contractors said nothing at all18 about superior knowledge and the government's obligation19 to share information that it hadn't shared.20 MR. PHILLIPS: There was nothing specific21 with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first time22 the contractors identified the superior knowledge23 problem arose, obviously, when the government took the24 extraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up25 until that point, obviously, the parties are attempting Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1 to negotiate and work to a final resolution of this2 project, as you would hope any contracting entities3 would, to bring the contract to a happy resolution,4 so-­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would expect them6 to say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going7 forward on this contract, to at least mention it. And8 to-­9 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, yes, I think you have10 to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during11 this period of time, obviously, there were consistent12 efforts and requests being made to get access to both13 the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there14 were discussions that went back and forth, and the15 district court -- or the Court of Federal Claims16 specifically held -- eventually, the information was17 forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too18 late in order to effectively allow the contract to19 proceed as -- as planned.20 So I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in21 a perfect world, maybe you would have identified this.22 But in this situation, the parties are simply trying to23 come to some kind of a resolution that allows both sides24 to be satisfied by the final -­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips -- Alderson Reporting Company6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: -- disposition.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why wasn't the need to share that technology a part of this contract or a condition to the contract? I've gone through the contract -- or, not all of it; enough of it. I haven't found anywhere in the contract that it requires the U.S. to share information with you. Does that have anything to do with what due process would require? Meaning -­Justice -­MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think -- I think,JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -­MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to pose aOfficial - Subject to Final Review7￼hypothetical. Let's assume the contract required the sharing of state secrets, and the government then invokes its privilege. Is that a different case than this one in terms of due process? Wouldn't the -­ wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a condition of the contract, require a different treatment than this situation where the government's just saying, if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the contract, then you do what every other litigant with a privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you have to --Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's usually what2 happens with other privileges.3 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And we would have4 been perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we5 had. But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal6 Claims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a7 position to resolve it.8 But I want to answer your more fundamental9 question, Your Honor, as to the -- you know, the basic10 point is, is that the background principle of law, the11 superior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the12 parties when they enter into an agreement. I mean, that13 would have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis14 case and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has15 acknowledged the superior knowledge defense. That's16 been around for a long time. It's a-- it's an17 understood basis on which the parties enter into an18 agreement. That's the first answer.19 The second answer is that you're asking us20 to put into a contract something about information that21 we don't know anything about. We -- I mean, we have22 some sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't23 know anything about the other programs that are24 identified here.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Where's Alderson Reporting Company8￼Official - Subject to Final Review91 the obligation of the government to tell you build it2 this way using the technology we already have? I3 thought your claim was that you were promised this4 information, and you structured the contract based on5 that promise.6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, our claim -- we have7 separate -- we have a series of distinct claims.8 Our first claim is that we never would have9 entered into the contract in the first place if the10 government had provided us with information based on its11 superior knowledge that the -- for instance, the weight12 specifics that we were being asked to provide or to13 supply were literally impossible to comply with based on14 what the government already knew. If we had been just15 told that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in16 the situation where we are here -­17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's a factual18 dispute about that. I think somewhere I read that there19 is a claim that they told you your weight estimates20 weren't right.21 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- I mean, that may be a22 factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I'd be happy to23 litigate that issue if -- if we can get to that point24 where we're in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of25 our particular defense. But the bottom line here is -- Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review101 and again to state the proposition as starkly as it -­2 as it is, because this is the way it comes to the Court3 from the Federal Circuit: They're saying that the4 government can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars5 against us and tell us that we cannot defend against6 that claim even though the reason why we were unable to7 comply with the contract is because of the fact that the8 government didn't provide us information either at the9 outset or as we went along.10 JUSTICE BREYER:11 is, first of all -- Justice12 -- I did have her question,13 is, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in14 this case. And you just read the two circuit court15 opinions here, and you think this is a defense coming16 out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance17 to it. That was her question, I think, as I understood18 it.19 MR. PHILLIPS: Can I answer -­20 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, it's not21 unfair. But let me give you the other question because,22 sometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that.23 And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was24 said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply25 it to government contracting, where sophisticatedThe two questions I'd have Sotomayor, sorry; I did not because what that suggests￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review111 contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their2 own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench3 into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing4 the whole monkey. That's my second question.5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: One, that this isn't a case7 that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government8 contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is9 overwhelming. Now, I'd like your views on both of10 those.11 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, it seems to me12 clearly that this is the precise situation where13 Reynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a14 legitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we15 don't know precisely what information we didn't have and16 were never entitled to. So it's very difficult to say17 how strong is our defense under these circumstances.18 What we do know is that the Court of Federal19 Claims judge looked very carefully at this and said that20 we had made an impressive showing without regard to any21 of the confidential or privileged information of a prima22 facie defense in these circumstances. So our position23 is we had a very valid defense. This is not pretextual.24 We're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to25 force the government to assert its state secrets. It's￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review121 a fairly contrived approach to litigation and, frankly,2 not something that I could imagine any circumstance in3 which we would do that.4 Two, I don't see how this throws a monkey5 wrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws6 out the monkey, because -- because the basic7 understanding here is that the government is not8 entitled to force its contractor down along this course.9 If the government has information available to it, then10 it has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming11 with the information with the contractor, either at the12 outset, which would have been the best of all13 circumstances here, or as matters go along.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Petitioners as a15 formal matter were the moving party; isn't that right?16 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, "moving17 party" I think is -- is not a self-defined concept,18 Justice Alito. The Petitioners are the plaintiffs.19 JUSTICE ALITO: They were the plaintiffs.20 And the review scheme that you outlined was known to21 them beforehand. So why do we need to look beyond that?22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because the review23 scheme also says that the very -- in 1986, in the24 Assurance case, the Federal Circuit said -- which was25 before this contract was entered into, the Federal￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review131 Circuit said the filing -- the mere filing of a2 complaint immediately vacates the contracting officer's3 rule.4 So our understanding at the time we entered5 into this agreement is that if there were a problem with6 the way the contracting officer operated, we would be7 allowed to file a claim and immediately take the8 contracting officer's rule off the table. Under those9 circumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to10 go back to the status quo ante in that situation, which11 means there's no contracting officer decision, there's12 no basis on which the government can make a claim for13 1.35 billion, now $3 billion.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that -­15 you've referred to it several times now. I thought that16 that was not a progress payment based on completed work.17 The government says that that money was advanced; you18 had not complied with what was necessary to comply with19 to get that 1.35 million. They distinguished the $1.3520 million that you legitimately received as a progress21 payment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled22 what you needed to do to get that.23 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, what had not happened24 is that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off25 by the contracting officer approving it and thereby￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review141 reducing it to a liquidated claim. But that's a vastly2 different statement than to say -- and, indeed, we have3 an argument that, at least with respect to half of that,4 that it had already effectively been approved through a5 mechanism independent of the contracting officer.6 But the bottom line here is these were7 services rendered, actually rendered. This was not some8 kind of a prepayment for services to be rendered in the9 future. That's not the nature of this contract. These10 were -- this was for work we had done, for which we had11 submitted specific claims, and for which the contracting12 officer had pending before him at the time. And so, you13 know, what the government says is that -- is that it was14 a payment and they didn't ultimately get the airplanes15 that were the ultimate desire of the contract under16 these circumstances, and that's obviously true because17 they terminated the contract a year before the airplanes18 were due to be provided to them.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are here seeking20 to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from21 this contract what you would have gotten if it had been22 successfully completed, including any profit -­23 MR. PHILLIPS: No. No, Justice Ginsburg,24 that's not true. All we are asking for is -- are the25 remedies that are fully available if you were to convert Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review151 this from a termination for default into a termination2 for convenience. And under those circumstances, what -­3 you know, that -- the government has a wonderful4 mechanism there. It protects it against the kinds of5 lost profits damages that might otherwise be available6 in a situation where you have a more traditional breach7 of contract.8 So all we're -- all we're asking for is the9 actual amount of money that we expended, that the -­10 frankly, the Court of Federal Claims explicitly found,11 and at this stage it's unchallenged, although presumably12 it might be litigable at some point, but that these were13 all reasonable, allowable, and fairly allocable costs to14 these -- to this particular contract.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why shouldn't we view16 this as if it were a dispute between two private17 contracting parties? And if we did that, perhaps one18 party would be the moving party with respect to some of19 the claims and the other party would be the moving party20 with respect to the remaining claims.21 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Alito, I think that22 is precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and23 we'd be very comfortable with that, because it's quite24 clear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way25 that -- that you articulate because of -- because of the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review161 way the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the2 government is unquestionably the moving party, the party3 seeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.354 billion -­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would -- I think it's6 questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason: You say7 that it's an implied term of this contract that the8 government has a duty to share certain information, and9 you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the10 contract. So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty,11 you are the moving party. You're saying: Court, please12 enforce this implied term of the contract.13 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, you14 could -- that's one way to articulate it. I think the15 other way to articulate it, which -- which is much more16 consistent with the reality of what's going on here, is17 that the government is making a claim for $1.35 billion18 for which -- on the basis that we did not act in a19 timely fashion. And that's the only basis that exists20 in this litigation anymore, is just the time of the21 actions that we took.22 And our answer to that claim is to say: No,23 we -- we are not at fault for the delays because you did24 not provide us the information or you did not spare us25 the burden of having to go down this path in the first￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425instance.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but then you go on to say: Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already given us -­MR. PHILLIPS: But -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- plus this additional money that we've expended.MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that just goes to Justice Alito's question about is there some way to evaluate those claims separately, and the answer is, yes, they should be evaluated separately. And -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why shouldn't we? I mean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the government has come up with a defense that makes it impossible to decide who's in the right here -­MR. PHILLIPS: Right.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why don't we just -- you know, I think the usual course taken by courts would be to leave the parties where they are. The matter can't be litigated. That would mean you would keep your $1.35 billion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the additional amount. If -- if you were that worried, you should have -- you -- you should have had more frequentprogress payments or something.Official - Subject to Final Review17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review181 Why don't we just leave you where you are,2 both you and the government, assuming we agree with you3 on all the rest?4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, to be sure, we5 would be much more comfortable in the world you just6 articulated, Justice Scalia, than we are in the Federal7 Circuit.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you would be 1.359 billion -­10 (Laughter.)11 MR. PHILLIPS: With interest.12 (Laughter.)13 JUSTICE SCALIA: With interest. I forgot14 the interest.15 MR. PHILLIPS: That's starting to add up,16 Your Honor.17 (Laughter.)18 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- and -- certainly we19 think that's -- that is the minimum that we should be20 entitled to, and maybe to some extent you could say21 we're sort of being a little greedy. But the -- the22 reality is that the standard rule is that if you take a23 contract and you say you cannot make a determination24 that the contractor has been guilty of default, then25 that contract should be, in the -- kind of the basic￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review19 1 contract law and it's also in this -- in this agreement,2 that you -- you convert it to a termination for3 convenience.4 And then the question simply is, what rights5 flow from having declared this to be a termination for6 convenience?78 that you get9 also anotherJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned the 1.3 -­ to keep the 1.35 million, but there was figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on10 top of that. 111213 wouldn't be 1415 what -- what16 amounts of money that were actually expended by the17 contractors that were reasonable, allocable, and18 allowable, by and according to the Court of Federal19 Claims, on this agreement. So, there -- and it would be20 the standard operating procedure. If you have a21 termination for convenience, where the government says,22 look, we've decided we just don't want to have this -­23 these -- we don't want these airplanes anymore, so let's24 just call it off, which the government has the right to25 do, then the question is, what are the reasonable costsMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that -- that -­ JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that certainly leaving you where you were.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. I mean, actually,￼the $1.2 billion was, was the additionalAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review201 that are, you know, sort of reallocated as a consequence2 of that? And the Court of Federal Claims -­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the government didn't4 do that. I mean, you're making it up. The government5 didn't terminate for convenience. The government6 claimed you're in default. Why would -- why should we7 force that down the government's throat when we can no8 more say that the government's wrong than we can say9 that you're wrong?10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me the -- I11 mean, the question is was the default -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you call the13 game off.14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the question is, if15 you call the game off, what -- what flows from that?16 And it seems to me that it -- you can say we'll let the17 government call it a default, I suppose, or you could18 just as easily say -- and obviously the position we19 would take is you say the government cannot call it a20 default because, in order to get some kind of a21 determination along those lines, somebody is going to22 have to make a judgment that's not an honest assessment23 of the -- of the -- of the facts of this case.24 And so, if you say it's not a default25 termination, then there's just a certain amount of --￼Alderson Reporting Company18 so we don't 1920 problem -­ 2122 to--togo 2324 that the --25 under thoseknow who's in the right here.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I -- theJUSTICE SCALIA: So why force the government to a termination for convenience?MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I would think that the more appropriate way to proceedcircumstances, given that a defaultOfficial - Subject to Final Review211 certain consequences that flow from converting it, and2 it automatically converts at that point to a termination3 for convenience. And in a termination for convenience4 situation, then you reallocate the costs5 the way that the Court of Federal Claims6 at this point.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -­8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fallacy is we're10 not -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not11 saying that it's not a default termination. We're12 saying we don't know.13 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And the question14 is-­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're saying we don't know.16 We don't know what the state-secrets thing is. The17 government is entitled to -- to make that determination,Alderson Reporting Companyin precisely has done this-­￼Official - Subject to Final Review1 termination carries with it a lot of collateral2 consequences, it exposes you to subsequent problems in3 the contracting context, it creates the possibility of4 debarment in -- in future proceedings, that rather than5 allow a finding that no one can comfortably conclude is6 the right finding to stay in place and have those7 collateral consequences flow from it, the more8 appropriate way to proceed would be to say: Look, I9 can't make a determination in this case that there10 should be a termination for default.11 And under those -- and so, therefore, the -­12 the -- under the contract, under the government13 contracting principles generally, it automatically14 converts over to a termination for convenience. And15 once that happens, then you go down the road of -- of16 evaluating those costs. And, again, the government's17 got arguments about those costs, I'm sure, and we can -­18 and we can debate those out, although, you know, I would19 commend the Court to the -­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, give us a21 way, a reasoned way, to reach the result Justice Scalia22 is suggesting, because you are being greedy. You23 admitted it. The termination -­24 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I -- I said -­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The termination for -- Alderson Reporting Company22￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: -- I could be characterizedthat way.Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A termination for convenience carries its own automatic consequences that appear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation of the default termination has been invoked because there is a risk to the United States. So, is there a reasoned way to do it -­MR. PHILLIPS: Now, are you -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to not -- to not impose that unfairness on the government? And if there's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given that you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to say you entered a contract knowing the government could invoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk of that. I mean, you always knew the government could do this.MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -- well, I don't know whether you want me to answer the second part first -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It goes back to my original question, is -­23￼question.MR. PHILLIPS: -- or go back to the originalJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you could haveAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review241 contracted around it.2 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure, and so could the3 government. I mean, the reality is that the background4 principle here is United States v. Reynolds. And United5 States v. Reynolds says that if somebody is the moving6 party, that is the party seeking affirmative relief,7 that's the party who's going to bear the burden to -­89 you whether10 contracting11 it as though the question of who is the moving party is12 determinative of this case, but in a contract situation13 the question of who's the moving party is very often14 arbitrary or fortuitous.15 If you think about it in a private setting,16 you have one contract -- one contractor who fails to17 perform or -- or provides some deficient product,18 another who decides it's not going to pay, and the19 question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter20 of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first -­21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what the payment schedule23 has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their24 money back or simply refusing to pay it at all.25 So, why in this contract situation is the Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, could I ask that principle makes any sense in this situation, because both parties have argued￼Official - Subject to Final Review251 question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving2 party -- why does -- why does that make such a3 difference?4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think that5 actually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would6 have envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago,7 used the language "moving party" rather than "plaintiff"8 or "defendant" precisely for that reason, because I9 think what the Court had in mind is the party who was10 seeking affirmative relief. And -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was thinking of a12 tort. It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort13 action.14 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, that -­15 that's the specific context, although the Court's16 language is broader than that. It just didn't talk17 about itself as a defendant in a tort action.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it can't possibly be the19 case that the question is what the payment schedule is.20 If I've paid you already and then I find your product21 deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my22 money back. If I find your product deficient before I23 pay you, then you're going to go to court and say you24 have to pay me.25 So why should that difference make a Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review261 difference with respect to the constitutional question2 before us?3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because in the one4 situation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services5 that were unquestionably rendered and which, in our6 judgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the7 obligation under this contract.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Both party has a claim here.9 One says you provided deficient performance; the other10 says you were obligated to pay me. The question of who11 has the claim and who has the affirmative defense -- it12 can be structured in either way.13 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't disagree with that,14 Justice Kagan. I think the bottom line, though, is, you15 know, what -- what -- what are -- what do principles of16 fundamental fairness tell you to do in this case?17 JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly my problem,18 because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold19 anything in your favor. It holds the opposite way. It20 says to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was21 unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and22 not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay? And it says23 such a rationale has no application in a civil forum24 where the government is not the moving party. It25 doesn't say anything about where the government is the￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425moving party.MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -­JUSTICE BREYER: And Exhibit A that it is not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of the Federal Circuit. I mean -- now, what do you want me to read to get over that impression?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, the very fact that the court says and limits its ruling to where the government is not the moving party -- I mean, if the government really -- if the court -­JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't limit it. It said the rationale is unconscionable. Now, I don't even have to go that far. I can go to "fundamentally unfair." All I want to know is what should I read to get over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of the two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing unfair? Okay?What do you want me to read to get over that impression -­MR. PHILLIPS: Well -­JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I think you do want me to read something.MR. PHILLIPS: I think -- right. Well, no,you should clearly read the Court of Federal Claimsopinion that gave rise to this in the first place, whereOfficial - Subject to Final Review27￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- where the judge says we have made -­ JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.MR. PHILLIPS: -- an impressive prima facie showing of a defense. And -- and the Federal Circuit's view is: We don't care; we're not going to let you go down that path, period.And all we're saying is that in that situation, where we've made that kind of showing, the default rule should be the government cannot reach into our pocket and -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just before we get there, that showing was based on the court's in camera review of quite a bit of already confidential information, correct?MR. PHILLIPS: And the non-privileged information that it had available to it.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the non-privileged information. So it made this judgment on the basis of a great deal of information, and yet it couldn't conclude that you were right as a matter of law, correct?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it recognized that it terminated the discovery early. And, actually, it did -- it terminated discovery very early, and -- and there are whole programs that we know nothing about. We knowabout the B-2 and the A-15. What we don't know are theOfficial - Subject to Final Review28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review291 other programs, and there's nothing in this record on2 any of that, Your Honor.34 Phillips.56 ORAL 789 Justice, and may it please the Court:10 Two basic things decide this case. First,11 the government is not affirmatively invoking the power12 of the Federal court; only the plaintiffs are. It was13 Mr. Phillips's clients who 20 years ago walked into the14 Federal court and asked that court to set aside the15 decision of the contracting officer and to award them16 over a billion dollars in damages. The government, by17 contrast, simply asked the court to dismiss the Federal18 lawsuit.19 And, second, Reynolds makes clear that the20 state-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at21 most only when the party that is relying on secret22 information is trying to use the Federal court to alter23 the legal status quo. And -­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- we've25 gotten to this point in the dispute because you say Alderson Reporting CompanyCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.General.ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYALON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief￼Official - Subject to Final Review301 they're at fault; they say you're at fault. Under the2 state-secrets doctrine, we can't resolve that question.3 Why don't we call the whole thing off? Nobody's at4 fault; that means it's terminated not for fault, but for5 convenience, and that's it.6 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, for several reasons.7 One is that is the affirmative use of the Federal courts8 to alter the legal status quo. I think the principle of9 Reynolds is1011 you altered12 is they're going along with their contract, and you13 altered it by holding them in default.14 GENERAL KATYAL: I disagree, Mr. Chief15 Justice. I think that the contract itself specifies16 that the contracting officer will decide whether or not17 there's a default termination, and once there is that,18 they owe -- once the contracting officer so decides,19 then they owe the unliquidated payments that have -­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't21 that the affirmative step with the contracting officer22 saying there's a default?23 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's certainly an24 affirmative step under the terms of the contract, but it25 is not an affirmative step of the Federal court. Ourthat -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, only because the legal status quo -- the legal status quo￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 central proposition -­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative3 step of the Federal Government. He works for you, and4 he's the one changing the status quo.5 GENERAL KATYAL: Undoubtedly the case, and6 those are the terms under the contract to which they7 agreed. Our central proposition is that in a world in8 which the Federal court doesn't know, as Justice Scalia9 said, who is right and who is wrong on a particular10 claim, it should stay its hand entirely and get out of11 the business altogether. It should follow theprinciple of doing no harm.JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct to interpret just said to mean that you think this case12 Hippocratic 1314 what you've15 should be decided under the basic principle of Reynolds,16 that the party that seeks the affirmative relief -­31￼17 seeks affirmative relief from the court is the -- is the18 party that bears the burden involving the invocation of19 the state-secrets privilege? You're not asking us to20 adopt a new test applicable in the contracts situation?21 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I don't think22 we need to go there. I do think that there are special23 arguments available in this case because it is a24 contract, as Justice Breyer said, with sophisticated25 parties who ex ante will decide who bears the burden of Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 coming into court and -- and so on.2 this is a simple principle that, in3 court doesn't know who is right and4 superior knowledge defense -- and that's the answer to5 the question that Justice Sotomayor asked to Mr.6 Phillips a moment ago about what did the Court of7 Federal Claims ultimately decide. They didn't decide8 there was a prima facie case. They said at page 245a of9 the 2001 opinion: We can't know one way or the other.10 And so -­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I --12 I'm interrupting Justice Alito because you answered his13 question very quickly. It's your position that if we14 determine you're the moving party, you lose?15 GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, no. I think -­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what your answer17 to him -­18 1920 asked21 which22 apply23 lose?2425 Sotomayor. I don't think Reynolds says that if the Alderson Reporting CompanyBut here I thinka world in which the wrong in the32￼GENERAL KATYAL: No, we -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is that -- he you whether we apply Reynolds; you didn't say part of Reynolds. Are you conceding that if we Reynolds and we find you're the moving party, youGENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely not, JusticeOfficial - Subject to Final Review331 government is the moving party, it's an automatic loss.2 I think that's a back-up argument that we have advanced3 in our brief that I think there is no reason whatsoever4 for the Court to give its view -­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk about "moving6 party." I -- I don't -- I don't know that "moving7 party" means who comes into court first. I would -- I8 would -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute,9 I would say the moving party is the party who is trying10 to use principles of law to change the contract, and11 that's the government here. The government -- the12 government is blowing the whistle; it is the government13 which is saying you are in default, and under the law,14 since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we15 can claim the money we've already paid you.16 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice -­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me the moving18 party in the -- in the context of a contract.19 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I think20 it's important to add to your definition "using legal21 principles in a Federal court," because that's I think22 what Reynolds is talking about. There's not some23 abstract moving -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Reynolds was talking about25 that because that was the fact situation in Reynolds.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review341 But I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic2 of the matter when applied to a contract situation such3 as this ought to be the party who is blowing the4 whistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the5 one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this6 result. And then we say, well, we can't tell whether7 the law requires this result or not. That, it seems to8 me, ought to be the moment of truth.9 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think,10 Justice, that's what either Reynolds is getting at or11 what this Court's subsequent decisions about a state of12 uncertainty in the law and what the role of the Federal13 courts is getting at. I think, rather, what all of14 these decisions say together is if you don't know one15 way or another, you should return; you should wind the16 clock back to the status quo ante before the lawsuit was17 filed. And at that status quo ante, there was undoubted18 a right of the government to have $1.35 billion.19 Now, I understand some of you have20 suggested, well, maybe we should just cut it even and21 they get to keep the $1.35 billion and we get to keep -­22 and we don't have to pay the $1.2 billion. I suggest23 there's no principled way to do that, which is what I24 think Mr. Phillips's answer -­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't the undoubted Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review351 right of the government before the lawsuit was filed.2 It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the3 contracting officer was correct that there had been a4 default. If he was wrong about that, it was not the5 right of the government.6 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me read7 to you the contract to which they agreed. It's at Joint8 Appendix, page 120 to '21: "If the contract is9 terminated under the default clause, the contractor10 shall, on demand, repay to the government the amount of11 unliquidated progress payments."12 And then, what happened, as a result of that13 demand letter that we sent right after the -- after the14 termination for default, was they came to us, hat in15 hand, and said: Please don't take this money from us16 right now, our banks are going to complain, and so on.17 And so we entered into a deferment agreement -­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -­19 GENERAL KATYAL: -- which is at page -­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Do you21 want to give the cite?22 GENERAL KATYAL: Joint Appendix page 342.23 And it seems to me a very odd notion of due24 process to say that somehow the fact that we agreed to25 their deferment creates some entitlement for them to Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1 keep the $1.35 billion.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have this -- this3 question about due process: The components of the due4 process analysis, it seems to me, are what is5 reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's6 unconscionable. That it seems to me is just an7 extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know8 whywedon'thavethatjustasalawof--of-- the9 Federal common law of contracts. I don't know why we10 need to elevate this to a due process analysis.11 GENERAL KATYAL: I guess I would say two12 things. One is, if you look -­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming that we're -- we14 apply Reynolds, which -­15 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And I think if you16 -- if you were to look to that background common law17 contract principle, you would look not just to Reynolds18 but to Tenet -- or excuse me, Totten, which I think19 makes clear that, at the time they signed their20 contract, they were on notice that highly classified21 information that is the subject of -- of litigation is22 something that generally can't be litigated in the23 Federal court.24 And then, if you wanted to think about due25 process and the overlay of unconscionability or whatever Alderson Reporting Company36￼Official - Subject to Final Review371 with respect to Federal contracts, you would ordinarily2 assume that the contract itself from highly3 sophisticated parties would work that out ahead of time.4 And so if they were concerned about this situation5 unfolding, they could have written into the contract6 that they should get certain information and that if the7 government invoked the state-secrets privilege, it would8 automatically terminate the contract's default and9 convert a default termination into a termination for10 convenience.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're -­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just restates the14 question of what -- what do you do if you apply the15 Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say,16 well, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I17 think that's almost a wash.18 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I don't think it19 comes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think20 the contract is undoubtedly clear that, in order to21 challenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer22 about a default termination, they have to come into23 Federal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative24 judicial relief from the Federal court, to change the25 world. We don't have to do that.￼Alderson Reporting Company67 reason they8 didn't know9JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips said the couldn't specify this information is they what it was.GENERAL KATYAL: Yes.Official - Subject to Final Review381 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I -- am I right that2 this contract did specify certain information that the3 government agreed to give the Petitioner?4 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. Some of5 that is at Joint Appendix 137 to 140.1011 what -- it was secret information.12 wouldn't even know what to ask for.13 GENERAL KATYAL: I have14 odd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar15 contract on the assumption that they're going to get16 some technology that they haven't even specified. I17 mean, this -- we're bidding for their research and18 development. They brought in Lockheed, who -- which had19 built low-technology -- low-observability planes -­20 precisely for the reason that they said they'd have the21 technology. At Joint Appendix page 1087, you see their22 bid, their offer, and I don't think anyone held a gun to23 their back to say: Enter into this.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but they -- they claim25 that you knew that it was impossible to do what theyJUSTICE GINSBURG: They-- they didn't know They didn't know -­￼Alderson Reporting Companytosay,itisaveryOfficial - Subject to Final Review391 contracted with you to do at the weight of plane which2 they promised to come across with. They say that you3 knew that because of -- of other contracts that you had4 had, and yet didn't -- didn't tell them about it.5 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me say6 two things. First, the impossibility of -­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know whether that's8 true or not, and we're never going to know it's true,9 because you came in and blew the whistle and said:10 State-secrets privilege.11 GENERAL KATYAL: Two things. One is that12 impossibility claim was separately litigated before the13 Court of Federal Claims, along with 18 other claims of14 theirs in defense to the 1.35 billion and this rest that15 we've been talking about. They've had massive16 opportunities to litigate almost all of their17 challenges, with the one exception being the superior18 knowledge aspect of this case, and much of that has19 taken place in a highly classified environment. The20 trial has taken place in -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 impossible to do it at that23 GENERAL KATYAL:24 initial weight, we thought it was impossible and warned25 them as such, and that's -- those are the citations in￼Alderson Reporting CompanyAre you saying it was not weight?I'm saying -- well, at theOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the government's brief. But -- so -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: At the weight contracted3 for?4 GENERAL KATYAL: And then we -- at the5 weight contracted for, we had warned them that it6 wasn't, and then later we relaxed to that weight7 specification. So I'm not sure that is really present8 one way or the other.9 But our central submission to you, Justice10 Scalia, is: If you're not sure, as you were saying to11 me -- you don't know who is right and who is wrong -­12 then the Federal court shouldn't be complicit in the13 process of siding and picking winners and losers in that14 circumstance -­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you ever the -­16 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, what would17 happen -­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you ever the19 moving party in the Court of Claims?40￼2021 we could be 2223 counterclaim, but that obviously means somebody else is24 the moving party. They've raised the claim.GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. I could imagine that on a counterclaim, for example.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, on a25 GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct. The -- the Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242541jurisdiction of the CFC -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If somebody wants toget money -- if somebody wants to get money from the Federal Government, they have to go to the Court of Claims, right?GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.JUSTICE BREYER: How do you -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this is a prettyconvenient rule for you, right? (Laughter.)GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's a convenient rule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they signed the contract. The CDA was on the books. They knew the deal going in, which is if they wanted to challenge the decision of the contracting officer, they would have to come in.Now, you could have structured it very differently. You could have said we -- you know, that there would have to be -- that -- that if there were a termination for default, it would automatically change into a termination for convenience -­JUSTICE ALITO: But you have the burden of -- you had the burden of proof on the issue of default. That was known, too, wasn't it?GENERAL KATYAL: We have the burden of proofOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review421 on default, but not on superior knowledge, the precise2 question here. In their rule, if you -- if you follow3 their rule, they're asking the court to proceed4 counterfactually and say that they are entitled to not5 just the 1.35, but the 1.2 billion on top of that, as if6 they had proved their superior knowledge claim. And -­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, what would -­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that -- do9 you agree that there is nothing between -- I think10 Justice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we11 just say let's -- all bets are off, everybody go home12 with what they have. But Mr. Phillips says there are13 only these two things; there's either default14 termination or termination for convenience, and nothing15 in between.16 Do you agree that that's the world that￼17 we're dealing with, those two choices and nothing18 GENERAL KATYAL: I do agree that that19 that's the way the contract is written. It20 distinguished between those two and distinguished21 between liquidated payments -- as to which the22 government has no right in the event of a default23 termination, and we're not seeking that -- and24 unliquidated payments, as to which the governmentelse? is -­25 absolute right at the moment the contracting officerAlderson Reporting Companyhas anOfficial - Subject to Final Review431 decides there has been a default termination.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care how the3 contract's written. I mean, if we're going to -- if4 we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that5 we're not going to try to apply the contract because we6 can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong,7 it's totally irrelevant what the contract says. You8 just leave the parties where they are.910 leave the11 contract.12 1314 Scalia, I15 in the business of micromanaging under the Due Process16 Clause in a contractual situation with parties that can17 protect themselves ex ante very easily. I mean, they18 say -­19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We can -- we can do it as20 a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts. And21 when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds,22 Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not --23 I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really24 definable content in our law. It seems to me it's just25 a question of the burden of persuasion.GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I am saying parties where they are under the terms of theAnd -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -­GENERAL KATYAL: Well, that -- Justice￼don't think that the Federal court should beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review44 proceed.some invokes8 GENERAL KATYAL: So even if you followed9 that reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a10 reason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still11 lose, because they still bear the burden of proof and12 persuasion on superior knowledge, the -- the excuse13 that's at issue in this case.14 Now, I don't think that would be the rule,15 that that's an appropriate rule, Justice Kennedy,16 because I think underlying Reynolds is this central17 proposition that a court shouldn't be involved,18 shouldn't be picking winning -- winners and losers19 either way, when the state of knowledge is unknowable.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: So just to make sure I21 understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had22 prevented you from being able to prove your default23 claim, that you were unable to make that showing because24 of state secrets. What would happen then?25 GENERAL KATYAL: Unable to make the showing1 At one point, the contractor has to2 He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the3 government has to go back and forth. And if at4 point, the person with the burden of persuasion5 the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's6 fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of7 contracts.￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in-­Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE KAGAN: That the -- that the -­ GENERAL KATYAL: -- in Federal court? JUSTICE KAGAN: That's right, that thesecrets that you were -- that you wanted to protect were actually the -- the key to your proving that there was a default.GENERAL KATYAL: Right. Well, in that circumstance, again, the -- I think the case would be dismissed, because they would be coming in and seeking affirmative judicial relief to void the contracting officer's decision and to get whatever damages they want and -­JUSTICE KAGAN: Let me make sure I understand, because that really does sound like a tails you win, heads you win, whatever.(Laughter.)JUSTICE KAGAN: You're saying that if the state secrets prevented you from making your affirmative case, you should win that one, too?GENERAL KATYAL: I think -- I think that that would be -- the general proposition is if the Federal court can't know one way or another who's right and who's wrong, it shouldn't grant affirmative reliefto a party, and that's --45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review461 JUSTICE SCALIA: To a moving party, and you2 are never the moving party.3 (Laughter.)4 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, again, Justice5 Scalia, that's the contract they've signed. They could6 have signed7 They say -­8 910 ability -­ 111213 give -­14 1516 the term "moving party"?17 GENERAL KATYAL: The contract didn't say18 "moving party," but it did say who had to come into19 Federal court in order to challenge the decision of thea different contract with different results.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you seem -­ GENERAL KATYAL: -- we didn't have theJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the contract -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you can't ever￼20 contracting21 and it puts2223 Sotomayor. 2425 understand.officer. And that is a -- that -- that -­ that burden on them.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And now JusticeJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I don'tYes, the default provision is decided byCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy -­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the contract containAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review471 the contracting officer, but by law you can't collect on2 that judgment once they file a complaint. So you can't3 do anything until you get the court to affirm your4 default. You are asking for a legal declaration of5 being right, that they defaulted. That's -- you're the6 one seeking -­7 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, this is8 a very important question, and I think that that's the9 impression left by their briefs and it's wrong. So the10 filing of their claim -- their claim in the Court of11 Federal Claims they say vacated the contracting12 officer's decision. That's wrong under the statute;13 605(b) in the -- in the Contracting Disputes Act says14 that a clause can be put into the contract to continue15 it in effect and require performance even if there's an16 appeal to the Court of Federal Claims, and that17 provision exists in this very contract. So -­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're going19 too fast for me, and I don't think I remember this in20 your reply brief.21 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it is. It's22 in a footnote of our reply brief, and it cites to23 605(b). And our claim is that -- that that provision24 requires -- right now we have an absolute entitlement to25 the $1.35 billion. That is what the contract says.￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That is what even the deferment agreement says that we've entered into.So we're not asking, Justice Sotomayor, for any affirmative judicial relief at all. We don't need -- we want the Court, as it does in state-secret cases such as Tenet, to stay out entirely and say -- to deny an audience to this case on the merits. And if you do what Mr. Phillips says or if you do what Justice Scalia suggested, the kind of compromise option, that is affirmatively using the power of the Federal court, granting him relief on a claim that he has not proven, and that is something I see -- I see zero precedentfor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It's granting nobody relief.

And if you didthat and you returned to the status quo ante, we wouldOfficial - Subject to Final Review48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review491 have that $1.35 billion. That is what the contract2 says. That is what their own filing in September 16,3 1991, said before the Court of Federal Claims, when they4 called that5 and owing."67 contracting8 And we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want9 to have to inquire whether it was valid. So to say "go10 away" means everybody keeps the money he has.11 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that seems12 to me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the13 Court to set aside the contracting officer's decision,14 which is what I think is forbidden by Reynolds. And it15 would be an odd rule, because it's basically a16 happenstance. If we had just simply insisted on our17 $1.35 billion at the moment that it was owed to us in18 February of 1991, we wouldn't even be having this19 conversation right now. The only reason we're having it20 is because we acceded to their own request to not take21 the $1.35 billion right away.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you write23 -- you keep saying these are sophisticated parties.24 What would the contractual term look like that would25 avoid this problem?Alderson Reporting Company$1.35 billion, quote, "money presently dueJUSTICE SCALIA: That assumes that the officer's termination for default was valid.￼Official - Subject to Final Review501 GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, I think it would be2 very simple. You could say: In the event the3 government invokes the state-secrets privilege, any4 termination5 termination67 client would ever agree to something like that?8 GENERAL KATYAL: Do I think the government9 would?for default automatically becomes afor convenience. That's one of many. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think your10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.11 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think if they12 don't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem13 with their argument, because they are saying: Read the14 contract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations15 for default and convert them all into terminations for16 convenience when the state-secrets privilege is being17 invoked. And I agree with you. I think that would be a18 very unusual contract for the government to get into.19 That is what they're demanding here, and that's20 strictly -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how do they write22 the contract? If they -- your answer can't be the only23 way they can write it is a way that you'd never accept.24 So how -- how do you contract around this problem?25 GENERAL KATYAL: Well -- well, I think there Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review511 are other ways. There's the possibility that they may2 demand extra money in exchange for greater risk. There3 may be that there may be some alternative dispute4 resolution mechanisms available. I don't know, but I5 would -- I would -­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This wouldn't be a7 problem in an alternative dispute resolution because8 that's not a court?9 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it might depend on -­10 you might have it within the military, you know, the11 equivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might12 have panels like the Helms panel. I'm not sure what the13 precise contractual arrangements would be. I do think14 that the need for this Court to be involved is a lot15 lower than, say, in the criminal context of Reynolds,16 because the government here is a repeat player with17 these contractors. They're not in the business, as our18 deferment agreement, I think, underscores of trying to19 willy-nilly advance the state-secrets privilege to20 undermine and take their money away.21 Indeed, I think since the 2003 Federal22 Circuit decision, there have only been a couple of23 instances, at most, in which -- that I'm aware of in24 which the government has invoked the state-secrets25 privilege in any sort of contracting action, and nothing Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review521 like this superior knowledge thing. And since 2009, the2 government, all together in civil court, has invoked the3 state-secrets privilege a whopping two times, to -- to4 my knowledge.5 JUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't -- it isn't a6 big practical problem. All right. Let me ask then, I7 was -- misimpression. Would you go back to Justice8 Kennedy's question for a minute? I'm -- I -- I don't9 quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how10 you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because11 the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental12 unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this13 kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends.14 It depends on many things.15 So, would you write this as a matter of16 constitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written17 as a matter of Federal common law of contracts?18 Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior19 knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it?20 And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of21 discovery law, which is what the district judge who22 ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says,23 gee, I don't really know.24 I mean, that's how I read it. How would you25 -- would you speak about this for a minute? Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review531 GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. Justice Breyer, I2 think that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this3 contractual dispute for a couple of reasons. Not just4 can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to5 other things, but also the whole notion of due process6 in contracts is odd, because the government has waived7 its sovereign immunity only since 1855. They don't have8 any freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim9 fundamental fairness on contracts. I think that is10 implicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't11 have that right.12 And so, the question becomes, is there some13 extra protection the courts should give here akin to the14 one in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the15 government using state-secrets information? And I think16 the answer to that is "no," because parties can work17 that out themselves ex ante.18 And so, my answer to you is -- I think it19 was option B -- to use the contract as the -- and20 contractual interpretation as the basic rule for a21 decision here. The contract itself specified -- and it22 was done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the23 shadow of -- of Totten that specified that they would24 have to be the moving party. They would have to come in25 and challenge the decision of the contracting officer -- Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review541 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a whole law of2 contracts, you could say, oh, the contracting parties3 could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't4 need to have rules on that, that the parties could have5 negotiated that. That's not the way the contract law6 works.7 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I do think that with8 respect to this, in this -- you know,9 thousands-and-thousands-of-page contract, I think that10 this specific set of issues could have been worked out11 in advance and, I do think, was worked out in advance.12 They knew, going in, that they bore the burden of13 walking into court, paying their attorneys, and14 everything else, to challenge the decision of the15 contracting officer. And they also knew at that moment16 the government had an undoubted right to the17 unliquidated progress payments.18 The contract they signed distinguished19 between liquidated progress payments, as to which the20 government has no right, and unliquidated payments, as21 to which default termination automatically gave that to22 the government. And the argument they're advancing here23 is, well, let's collapse those two; let's keep the $1.3524 billion, because the government hasn't given it to us25 yet.￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that unliquidated? I didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35 unliquidated?GENERAL KATYAL: Because the contract specified two payment streams. One is the work that they had reviewed and understood and said -- the government had said this is good work, we're going to pay you for it; and other work which are claims that they have made but they haven't actually been approved by the government. And I think Mr. Phillips -- I don't think that there's any sort of evidence that -- or certainly nothing that the courts below found that says that the -- that they had a right to theunliquidated progress payments.JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the other? What's the -- what's the other 1.25 billion -­GENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's also askingfor?GENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 billion that he's seeking on top of -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.GENERAL KATYAL: -- keeping 1.35 billion, asI understand it, is costs -- is extra costs incurredunder the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billionOfficial - Subject to Final Review55￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that was in 23 citation to4 605(b)? I can find it later, but -­5 GENERAL KATYAL: It's page 32, and I'd also6 refer the Court to the court of appeals appendix pagethe initial contract.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, do you have the that footnote you referred to in the -- the7 19567, which is the page of the contract itself that8 incorporates the provision. The provision is9 FAR 52.233-1(h), and it says that -- it mandates10 performance and compliance with the contract even when11 there -- in the contracting officer's decision, even12 when a decision is under appeal.13 So it is not the case whatsoever that their14 filing of this claim somehow vacated the contracting15 officer's decision. The only way that will happen is if16 this Federal Court reverses the Federal Circuit -­56￼171819 affirmative -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your view is that -­ GENERAL KATYAL: -- and grants them2021 did not stay their obligation to pay you; that provision22 required them to pay you -­23 GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the -- the25 unliquidated sums?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the complaintAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review571 GENERAL KATYAL: That's right. At that2 moment they had to pay. They knew that, and they in3 fact sent a bank letter and so on -- this is Joint4 Appendix 329 -- saying please don't do that. And then5 we entered into a deferment agreement, but we have an6 absolute right to that money right now regardless of7 what -- we don't need an affirmative decision from this8 Court in order to get that money. We're asking the9 Court to simply stay its hand and follow the Hippocratic10 principle of doing no harm in a world in which the -­11 the Court can't decide who's right and who's wrong.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if you're13 right about that, the government's absolute right, could14 you withhold it from other contracts of these15 contractors?16 GENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely right.17 The -- the Federal rules and the Contract Disputes Act18 provide us an offset so that we could -- we don't have19 to actually seek the 1.35 billion from their coffers, as20 he colorfully called it, "reaching into"; we can just21 offset it against future contracts, and the Federal22 courts would be out of the business altogether about23 that 1.35 billion.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get the extra25 money without having to go to court because then they'd Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have to go to court and challenge your offset? GENERAL KATYAL: And, again, Mr. ChiefJustice,that's the contract to which they signed. Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPSON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Kennedy, I think the answer to yourOfficial - Subject to Final ReviewquestionFederal common law principles, and indeed I would ask the Court to apply those same -- those contract principles in this context to -- it's just on the Joint Appendix on page 209.General Katyal focuses on what happens when the contracting officer takes some action. What he leaves out is the following sentence: The contractor shall have the right of appeal under the disputes clause from any determination by the contracting officer.And while the General spends an awful lot of time talking about what do you do in the Article III context, the Contracting Disputes Act specifically allows to us go to a board of contract appeals, which isnot an Article III institution. And I guarantee youis that this case can properly be decided on58￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review591 that the government would be making exactly the same2 argument if we had taken that particular route.3 It seems to me the case ought not to be4 decided on the basis of this kind of a technical5 assessment. The case ought to be decided on the basis6 of sort of where the rights are and what's the7 fundamental change and who's making the shift in one8 direction or the other.9 And if you do that -- and Justice Ginsburg,10 you specifically asked the question, am I asking for all11 or nothing? No. I think there's no question you can12 come up with a principled basis to adopt precisely the13 principle that Justice Scalia pointed out, which is to14 say we will stay our hand, we'll -- we will not uphold15 the -- the contracting officer's decision, and therefore16 we're not going to say there's a default -­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -­18 MR. PHILLIPS: -- but we're not going to go19 the extra mile and say it's a termination for20 convenience. The Court can certainly do that.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are saying there22 is another way? There's a middle way?23 MR. PHILLIPS: There is a middle way.24 There's no question about it. All I was saying in25 response to Justice Scalia's question was, you know -- Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On what principle oflaw?Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. PHILLIPS: On the principle of law that if you don't have a contract for default, then there's no basis for -- and we're not going to do any more than that; we can't decide who's right and who's wrong, and therefore we're not going to enforce the contracting officer's decision, or we're not going to do anything more than this. We're going to leave the status quo ante, which means before the contracting officer declared that there was a default under these circumstances.JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the "go away" principle of our jurisprudence, right?(Laughter.)MR. PHILLIPS: I actually get that a lot, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, I understood your papers as making only a constitutional claim.MR. PHILLIPS: No. I don't read that,Justice Kagan. I mean, we -- we certainly have a due process argument in there, but embedded in there as well is -- are a number of references to Federal common law principles as a -- as a -- obviously nonconstitutionalbasis on which to rule in our favor.60￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242561And I -- I mean, I think the Court ought to be informed in -- in making its determination about how to interpret the contracting arrangement by the question of whether this is fundamentally unfair and unconscionable, obviously, but you would probably do that as a matter of Federal common law principles in trying to decide on the -- on contracting principles or not.At the end of the day, Your Honors, this has been fundamentally unfair, and we would ask for the Court to reverse.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips, General.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)Official -
