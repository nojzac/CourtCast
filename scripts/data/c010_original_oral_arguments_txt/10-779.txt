IMS Health Incorporated.Ms. Asay.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. ASAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Under State and Federal law, doctors writeprescriptions for their patients to allow them access to drugs that the government deems too dangerous for unrestricted sale. Vermont's law allow doctors to decide whether this information that they're compelled to provide to pharmacies may be used in marketing that is directed at them.Drug companies would certainly like to have this information for marketing, but they have no First Amendment right to demand it, just as they have no right to demand access to the doctor's tax returns, his patient files, or to their competitors' business records.Vermont's law does not regulate the content3Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 of the marketing pitches and the advertising that drug2 companies provide about their products or their3 competitors' products. It regulates access to this4 information that's created in a highly regulated regime5 of prescription drugs and in the context of the6 doctor-patient relationship.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The purpose -- the8 purpose is to prevent sales representatives from9 contacting particular physicians, right?10 MS. ASAY: I disagree, Your Honor. The11 purpose of the statute is to let doctors decide whether12 sales representatives will have access to this inside13 information about what they have been prescribing to14 their patients. And what -- what the record shows is15 that what drug companies do is track and monitor doctors16 very closely to watch when they switch drugs, to watch17 the trends by which they -- doctors prescribe, by18 gender, by age. And all that information is used to19 target and to direct the marketing projects -­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they could use it for21 other purposes, right?22 MS. ASAY: The pharmaceutical manufacturers?23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.24 MS. ASAY: Under this statute they may use25 it for some limited purposes for clinical trials.4￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: So what the Chief Justice suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them from using it in order to market their drugs?MS. ASAY: The purpose is to allow doctors to decide whether the -­JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.MS. ASAY: -- the information should beavailable.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right, but that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the marketing of drugs. You're -- you're placing that impediment on it. Isn't that the obvious purpose of it? I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but let's not quibble over what the purpose is.MS. ASAY: As with any information that the -- that might inform a marketing campaign, not having the information may be -- make their marketing less effective or make it different.JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the purpose. That's the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this information to market their drugs.MS. ASAY: Again, Your Honor, the purpose is to allow doctors to make the decision, and doctors may want to allow its use or not allow its use. But thelaw -­5Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's only for that use2 that you interpose the requirement that the doctor3 consent. For all other uses you don't require the4 doctor's consent, right?5 MS. ASAY: The only -- the consent6 requirement in this statute goes to the use for7 marketing and also to the sale by the pharmacy, and that8 sale may be for other purposes as well, so there -­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Asay, are any of the10 other purposes, like for insurance purposes, cases where11 the pharmacist is paid for giving out the prescriber12 information? Here what they call data miners are paying13 the pharmacists to get this information. In the case of14 other, others who have access, do any of them also pay15 the pharmacists?16 MS. ASAY: Your Honor, there's two sort of17 answers to that. The first is that, with respect to18 pharmacies, the record shows here that the only place19 that the pharmacies disseminate their information is to20 the data vendors, and that is a commercial sale, and it21 is primarily intended for the marketing purpose.22 Insurers do have information about doctors' prescribing23 practices and patient information. They have that24 internally from their own claims and their relationships25 with doctors and patients. So insurers are not -- do6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 not need to buy the data from pharmacies. They have it2 without purchasing it.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the data is not4 private in the sense that the physician who prescribes5 knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and6 how much he prescribes and how often, because there are7 a lot of people who do know that, right?8 MS. ASAY: That's correct, Your Honor, there9 are people who know what the doctor prescribes and what10 the patient 1112 assures the13 that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the14 basis of their knowledge of information which otherhas received.JUSTICE SCALIA: So the only thing it physician, the physician who prescribes, is￼15 people have, approach him in order to market their16 drugs? That's basically all it assures the prescribing17 physician, right?18 MS. ASAY: It assures the prescribing19 physician that his information about prescribing20 practices will not be used for marketing without his21 consent. It's like the difference -­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, and he could achieve23 the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to24 talk to the marketer. When the marketer says, you know,25 I want to talk to you about a new drug, he says: I7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 don't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.2 MS. ASAY: He could not achieve the same3 result, Your Honor. What the record shows is that4 doctors are particularly concerned about having access5 to the best information and the most complete6 information to make decisions for their patients. And7 this data, as was discussed by Dr. Granday below, by8 Kesselheim, by Mr. Erhari, the former sales9 representative -- they all discussed how the data ends10 up being used to filter the information that doctors11 receive. So they receive less -­1213 argues that14 use of this15 detailing effort. Is that correct?16 MS. ASAY: It is not correct, Your Honor, to17 the extent that Respondents have suggested that18 Vermont's academic detailing program, which is called19 the evidence-based education program, uses this data.20 JUSTICE ALITO: That wasn't really my21 question. My question was does the statute permit it.22 If Vermont wanted to do that, the University of Vermont23 or some other entity wanted to do that, would the24 statute permit it?25 MS. ASAY: Well, the statute would not8JUSTICE ALITO: One of the Respondentsthe statute would permit, does permit, the information for what they call a counter­￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 permit the sale for that purpose, which is a separate2 provision of the statute, because academic detailing is3 not an exemption. They would also -- and then the4 question of whether the information would be available5 would default back to the pharmacy board rules, which6 again -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could that data be sold to8 a university for research purposes? The university9 says: We really want this information to do some10 research. Could the data be sold to the university for11 that purpose?12 MS. ASAY: Yes, Your Honor, the statute does13 permit it to be sold for health care research -­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the researcher then15 have a profile, a data bank, that is very helpful to the16 general public, and sell that to the general public, to17 the newspapers and so forth?18 MS. ASAY: We do not believe so, Your Honor,19 because of the background regulations that govern this20 information, including Pharmacy Board Rule 20, which we21 cited at page 4 of our brief, which also places22 restrictions on disclosure of patient and practitioner23 --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. It's sold to the25 researcher. The researcher then comes up with a design9￼Alderson Reporting Company8 restriction9 and-­10on the other uses would accompany the sale,JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you clarify -­Official - Subject to Final Review1 or database that is very fascinating for a number of2 reasons. Can that researcher sell it to the New England3 Journal of Medicine?4 MS. ASAY: I'm not sure if I understand5 whether the question is about the data itself or results6 drawn from the data. But to the extent that the statute7 allows the sale of the data for research, theJUSTICE KENNEDY: I still am not - I still MS. ASAY: When the -- if the pharmacy sold JUSTICE KENNEDY: The pharmacy sells to the1112 am not sure. In my hypothetical, what would happen?1314 --1516 researcher. 171819 university.20 results that are very fascinating. The researcher then21 wants to sell that to the New England Journal of22 Medicine. What result under the statute?23 MS. ASAY: The statute would have required24 the pharmacy to prevent the further dissemination of the25 data except for health care research.￼MS. ASAY: Right. If that happened -­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: The researcher is at theThe researcher has a data bank or has some10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You answered my question2 earlier that they don't sell it to anyone else. That's3 why I was trying to clarify your answer to Justice4 Kennedy, because you told me the only sale -- the5 pharmacists, they sell this to the data miners, they do6 not sell it to the other people. But now you're7 answering Justice Kennedy's question, yes, they sell it8 to universities.9 MS. ASAY: I apologize, Your Honor, if I was10 not clear. As a factual matter, we know absolutely that11 the pharmacies do not sell it to researchers. I had12 understood this to be a hypothetical, if they did. But13 as a factual matter, they do not.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does it increase the15 prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data16 about his prescribing can only be given away but can't17 be sold? Does that make him feel happier about his18 privacy?19 MS. ASAY: What it allows the doctor to do20 is to avoid an intrusive and invasive marketing21 practice.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: He can do that by saying:23 I don't want to talk to you.24 MS. ASAY: The doctor cannot -- can shut off25 any communication and any information from the11￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 pharmaceutical companies by slamming the door on the2 detailers, but that's not necessarily in the interest of3 doctors or patients. And what this -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but then5 just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their6 privacy. Now you're arguing a totally different7 purpose: It makes it easier for the physician to cut8 off approaches by drug companies that want to sell9 drugs. If that's the purpose of this statute, it's10 quite different from protecting his privacy. His11 privacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but12 you can give it away.13 MS. ASAY: Your Honor, I think the14 legislature here was using privacy to refer to the15 autonomy interest that everyone has to some degree in￼16 controlling17 them. This18 case in the19 interest in20 sheet.2122 assuming there's some form of privacy that relates to23 not being harassed because there's certainly legislative24 record of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to25 feeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a12the flow or the use of information about Court recognized in the Reporters Committee FOIA context that there was a privacythe aggregation of information on an FBI rapJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that -­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 less restrictive method, why does this have to be an2 opt-in rather than an opt-out? Because isn't an opt-out3 I call up and say I, don't want you to have this4 information? So isn't an opt-out less restrictive?5 MS. ASAY: An opt-out would not protect the6 privacy interests as much because it would assume that7 doctors want to consent. I would like to say that here8 the statute is -­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but, given the10 restrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing?11 Meaning you don't really intend to tell us that the12 State couldn't and wouldn't -- just like we got all of13 that advertising relating to the opt-out on telephone14 solicitations, virtually every American knew they could15 do it if they chose. Maybe some didn't, but a vast16 majority did. You can't really say Vermont's incapable17 of telling doctors in a mailing or in some public18 professional magazine, if you want to opt out, here's19 the number?20 MS. ASAY: Well, in fact, Your Honor, that's21 exactly what the State does. Every time that the22 doctors relicense, which is every 2 years, they get a23 form and they can make a decision one way or the other24 on the form that they receive. So it's perfectly25 tailored to allow the doctors to decide and to not13￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 restrict any marketing between a willing listener and a2 willing speaker.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another -­4 there's another purpose that I would like you to comment5 on, and that is the, the State is interested in6 promoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly7 to reduce the sale of brand name drugs. And if that's8 the purpose, why doesn't that run up against what this9 Court has said that you can't, you can't lower the10 decibel level of one speaker so that another speaker, in11 this case the generics, can be heard better?12 MS. ASAY: The State does have an interest13 in reducing health care costs here. What's important14 about this statute is the mechanism by which it allows15 doctors to decide what information and what kind of16 marketing they want, and it's different because what17 it's about is access to information in this highly18 regulated area. It's the difference between a doctor19 who prescribes a nonprescription drug and a patient who20 can take that information, walk into the pharmacy with a21 $20 bill and leave with their medication, and no one has22 learned anything about what the doctor prescribed for23 the patient, about the patient's concerns, or the24 doctor's concerns.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to lower -­14￼Alderson Reporting Company21 counter-demonstration,22 any difference whether23 is going to 2425 the abilityand you're saying it doesn't make I know where their demonstrationbe or not?MS. ASAY:of drug companies to locate the doctors that15Official - Subject to Final Review1 you want to lower your health care costs, not by direct2 regulation, but by restricting the flow of information3 to the doctors, by, to use a pejorative word, but by4 censoring what they can hear to make sure they don't5 have full information, so they will do what you want6 them to do when it comes to prescribing drugs, because7 you can't take, I gather, direct action and tell them,8 you must prescribe generics, right?9 MS. ASAY: I disagree, Your Honor, for -­10 for two reasons. The statute does not limit any of the11 information that doctors receive. So the State has not12 in any way intervened in the information that the13 pharmaceutical manufacturers can provide to the doctors.14 They are free -­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're restricting16 their -- you're -- you're making it far more burdensome17 for the manufacturers to reach their intended audience,18 right? It's as if I want -- there's a demonstration in19 town, all right? They need a permit to hold the20 demonstration. They get the permit. I want to hold a￼I disagree, Your Honor.

It's very -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think maybe you're being -- you were the one that made the argument that the State has an interest in reducing health care costs. I assume that is by selling generics. And the Chief Justice asked you a question: In effect, aren't you doing this by regulating speech? And you say no, you disagree. I don't understand that answer that you gave to the Chief Justice.MS. ASAY: It's not a restriction on speech because it's a restriction only on the access to the information that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would like to use to inform their advertising, and it's only in play if the doctors have objected to the use.JUSTICE SCALIA: The information necessary for effective speech is what you're saying, right?MS. ASAY: Your Honor, it's -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It only restricts the information necessary for really effective speech?MS. ASAY: No, I disagree.

We'll give youOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 say, you know, our product is much better than the2 generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever.3 There are arguments on both sides of those things. And4 you are making it more difficult for them to speak by5 restricting access to information that would enable6 their speech to be most effective.7 MS. ASAY: And -- their speech would be more8 effective if they had access to patient information, if9 they had access to their competitors' trade secrets.10 There's certainly other information available that they11 would like to use in marketing, but is not available to12 them by law, and it -- it's our position that in the13 same way they do not have a right to demand access to￼18 give you --19 additional time for rebuttal, so you don't -- don't20 worry that we're cutting into that.21 But you're making a judgment about how22 their -- whether or not their speech will be as23 effective or not. Don't you think they're the ones who24 are entitled to make that judgment? It doesn't mean25 that you're right or wrong. It just means that we would17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 not rely on your determination that it is -- their2 speech is just as effective. They're the ones doing the3 speaking and they think it's not.4 MS. ASAY: Again, Your Honor, I don't think5 we disagree that the -- the pharmaceutical manufacturers6 consider this information useful and helpful in7 targeting their marketing campaigns. The issue in this8 case is whether their right trumps the right of the9 doctor.10 And if you go back to -- to the source of11 this information, to the underlying transaction, the12 doctor prescribing the drug for a patient and the13 pharmacy dispensing it, the doctor and the pharmacy have14 the same stake in that transaction. And until this15 point the pharmacy has had complete control over whether16 the information gets sold into this commercial stream17 for marketing use. And all the statute does is put the18 doctor on the same -- in the same place as the pharmacy19 in terms of deciding what further use can be made of the20 information.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question?22 Do you agree with the Solicitor General's interpretation23 of the statute?24 MS. ASAY: Yes, we do, Your Honor.25 JUSTICE ALITO: Did you make that argument18￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 below? Is that a change in your position?2 MS. ASAY: It is not a change in our3 position. It is not an issue that was pressed below,4 because of the facts on the ground. There is only one5 transaction here. There's a sale from the pharmacies to6 the data vendors for these commercial purposes.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't this8 inconsistent with what you told the court of appeals?9 MS. ASAY: In our court of appeals brief,10 for example, at page 29 to 30, we describe that sentence11 of the statute as restricting both the sale of the12 information and the use for marketing. And on page -­1314 representing to us that you told the court of appeals15 the statute should be interpreted as the SG is16 interpreting it here; that's your representation?17 MS. ASAY: It is my representation that -­18 that we did not say anything contrary to that, Your19 Honor; and that it really was not pressed below. So I20 would not say that we, in our briefs below, fully laid21 out the position as the SG has, but we did not disagree22 with it, either.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's an important24 position. If you -- if that indeed was the meaning of25 the statute, you should have told the court of appeals,19JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you're￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 don't you think? Is it enough to say we didn't say no?2 You should have said yes. You should have said this is3 what it means.4 MS. ASAY: And again, Your Honor, if I could5 point also to pages 47 to 48 of our -- of our Second6 Circuit brief, we did frame the issue as whether there7 was a right to buy and sell prescription records. The8 issue has always been in the case. But again the facts9 on the ground, there has only been this one transaction,10 and that -- that really was what we were litigating11 about.12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the court of appeals13 on page 22a of the petition, summarizing what it14 understood you to be arguing, says: "The statute only15 imposes restrictions on the sale or use of such data for16 marketing or promoting a prescription drug." That was￼17 an inaccurate characterization of your --18 Circuit did not understand your argument?19 MS. ASAY: Again, Your Honor,20 think that the argument was really framed21 But we did not -­the SecondI--Idon't clearly below.22 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you please -- could23 you please answer yes or no? If you're changing your24 position, you're changing your position. It seems to me25 this is an important point, and if the Second Circuit20Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425based its decision on a misunderstanding of Vermont's interpretation of its own statute, I would think you would at least bring that out in the petition for rehearing.MS. ASAY: I -- I understand, Your Honor. JUSTICE ALITO: And you did not?MS. ASAY: We did not.JUSTICE KAGAN: And could you explain howyou're going to interpret your statute going forward and apply your statute going forward?MS. ASAY: Yes, Your Honor. We interpret the first clause of the statute to be a restriction on sale, except for sale for the exemptions that are set forth in the statute. And the other provisions of the statute: The second provision is a restriction on the use for marketing; and the third provision is a restriction that would apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers who have obtained the data for permissible purposes and -- and need to abide by the continuing restriction on the use. And the consent provision would apply to each of those parts of the statute.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll afford you 5 minutes for rebuttal.Mr. Kneedler.21Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,2 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,3 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the PETITIONERS4 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it5 please the Court:6 The Vermont statute protects important7 interests that the Vermont legislature could recognize8 in physician autonomy and control over information that9 concerns them. When a patient brings a prescription to10 a pharmacy, after that point the patient information is11 protected under HIPAA and under State law. That leaves12 two primary actors in that transaction -- the physician13 and the pharmacy. Both are professionals, both are14 subject to regulation under a comprehensive, closed15 system for the distribution of drugs.16 Prior to the time this statute was enacted,17 the pharmacy had complete control over the disposition18 of that information. What this statute does is put the19 physician, the prescriber, on an equal footing with20 respect to the pharmacy -- with the pharmacy, with21 respect to the use of the information about that22 prescriber, but only with respect to the use of the23 information in marketing to that prescriber. It is a24 narrowly drawn statute that enables the physician, not25 the State, enables the physician to determine whether22￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the information that he was required to furnish in2 connection with the prescribing of a drug will be used3 in the marketing of products to that -- to that4 physician.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he's required to6 provide it, but he would be required to provide it quite7 apart from the government regulation, right? I mean,8 the pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription9 out to.10 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's because it's a11 prescription drug. Federal and State law require a12 prescription for a prescription drug. But if this was13 not a prescription drug, a person can go into a drug14 store and purchase a nonprescription drug just like any15 other item in a drug store, not have to furnish the16 name, not have to furnish any of this information. So17 the information is furnished because of the requirement18 of a prescription which is of long standing.19 So this statute is really of a piece with a20 -- with a number of other types of regulations to21 protect -- protect privacy, for example, the Driver's22 Privacy Protection Act, where a person is required to23 furnish certain information in order to get a driver's24 license. That statute prohibits the commercial25 exploitation of that information.23￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't protect his privacy. I mean, the -- his name and -- and the extent of his prescriptions can be given away for a lot of uses. It doesn't protect his privacy.MR. KNEEDLER: It -- it -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It protect -- it enables him to protect himself against drug companies that want to talk to him.MR. KNEEDLER: And that's -- the term "privacy" is used to embrace that sort of autonomy and control over information. That's -- that's the way in which we're -­JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, so long as I know that's what you're talking about. When you say "privacy," you don't mean the prescriber's concern that people will know that he prescribed certain drugs. He doesn't care about that, right.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, he certainly does -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not protected bythis law.MR. KNEEDLER: He -- he certainly -- he certainly does care about that. And the -­Official - Subject to Final Review￼law.JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not protected by thisMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there are other -­24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 there are other principles that protect it. The -­2 the -- the State's pharmacy regulations require3 pharmacies to maintain the confidentiality -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about what this5 law protects.

KNEEDLER: Yes, well -- it -- it -- it's11 a lesser version of that, a less restrictive version of12 that, because it doesn't put either the pharmaceutical13 company or the physician in the position of an14 all-or-nothing situation.15 What -- what the law allows is the physician16 to -- to say, you can -- you can come visit me, but I17 don't want you to use this information that has18 otherwise been kept confidential under pharmacy rules to19 market to me.

For example, HIPAA, which protects the personal information of -- of persons in the health care system, that information can be used and frankly would have to be used, for example, for paying insurance claims. The insurer needs to know what prescriptions or26Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 what other medical services might have been provided.2 The same thing with respect to insurers3 controlling their costs, because there are formularies4 and preferred drug lists.

So, it -- it's -­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought our10 precedents made -- indicated that it's problematic for11 the State to make a determination about what uses12 information can be -- to what uses information can be13 put, particularly when it's an interested party as it is14 here.15 MR.

It's information about the prescriber that the18 prescriber was required to furnish in connection with19 issuing a prescription.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you told21 me that -- I thought you told me that this doesn't22 protect physician privacy to the extent of saying this23 information can't be used for academic purposes even if24 you, the physician, don't want it to be used for those25 purposes?27￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review12 again, that 34 doesn't get 56 but that doesn't mean that there is no confidentiality7 interest or no autonomy or control interest, because a8 physician practicing medicine knows that his patient's9 insurer is going to -­MR.

So it's narrowly tailored to the25 physician's use of the information about him in -- in28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 connection with how -- how he will be approached.2 It's also important to recognize that this3 is very different from the general advertising cases4 this Court has had under the commercial speech doctrine.5 This is not public advertising. This I think falls into6 the camp of Dun and Bradstreet, where you have a -- a7 targeted limited business audience, a -- a -- really8 one-on-one. It's not -- it's not radio or television9 advertising. It's one-on-one advertising in which the10 public interest11 one-on-one with12 information was13 pharmacy, so -­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the15 pharmaceutical company deems this to be the mostis -- is much more limited, and it's respect to the very person whosefirst furnished by the physician to the￼16 efficient.

KNEEDLER: But it -­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but if it becomes -­22 becomes focused and important and effective, then the23 State can prohibit it.24 MR.

Mr. Goldstein.￼ORAL ARGUMENT OF ON BEHALF OF MR. GOLDSTEIN:THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN THE RESPONDENTSYou will want to have available you to the of IMS Health, Incorporated, which in itsred briefappendix reproduces the statutes and findings. And the reason we have to look at the statutes and findings in this argument is because the case can't be decided as a matter of absolutes.We know that statutes like HIPAA do protect private information in third parties' hands and they are32Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 constitutional. On the other hand, we also know that a2 governmental restriction on the use of information could3 be used to distort the marketplace of ideas. So4 case is going to have to be decided somewhere in5 middle. And in order to do that, we're going to6 figure out where in the middle Vermont ended up.7 Now, in doing that I want to clarify8 three things in the questioning of the first half hour.9 They are about what the practice are -- practices are at10 issue here; what this statute does, actually what's the11 rule; and why is it that Vermont did it.12 So as to Justice Ginsburg's question, are13 there other sales, the State gave you the correct answer14 that the pharmacy companies don't sell to researchers,15 but that's somewhat misleading. They sell to us, and we16 sell to the researchers, we sell to the government, the17 intermediaries like IMS Health. That's because we're18 the aggregator. So it is not correct to say that the19 only sale is for pharmaceutical marketing.20 Second, on the important question of what21 this statute -­22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I asked whether there are23 sales to any other entities.24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, and I said the State25 gave you the accurate answer. But the implication of33thethe have toI think￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the answer I think was not quite correct, because there2 are sales for purposes other than for marketing.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if this was a general4 sale provision, then that would include those sales that5 you're talking about?6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It would not, because the7 point would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a8 minute, because all the exemptions -- right? So9 there's -- there's a debate that Justice Alito focused10 on about what does the statute mean, and I do want to11 turn to that in a second.12 But to jump ahead to your question, Justice13 Kagan, assume that it's a general sale prohibition.14 Then there are all the exemptions and the exemptions15 take all of these other uses out from the sale16 prohibition: for academic research, to go to the17 government, and for clinical trials, for health care18 research. Those are all exempted from the general sale19 prohibition.20 So let's do turn, if you don't mind, to what21 it is the statute actually does. It is an important22 point. First, I am going to come to our brief, but I23 just want to read something. For your later reference24 I'm going to have been reading from page 42 of PhRMA's25 brief, and this is what -- what the State told the34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Second Circuit, quote: "Data vendors may continue to2 acquire, edit, and sell this information to whomever3 they choose4 information5 6so long as that person does not use thefor detailing."In turn, the Second Circuit -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was your page again? MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry. That's going to be78 from the PhRMA brief, the other red brief at page 42, at9 the top of the page.10 So, to whomever they choose, so long as that11 person does not use the information for detailing. The12 Second Circuit said: Okay, you're the State; here's how13 we understand the statute. The statute only imposed -­14 quoting again, this is from 22A, it's the language that15 Justice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes16 "restrictions on the sale or use of such data for17 marketing or promoting a prescription drug." So that's18 what they understood the statute to do.19 Now, then the question becomes why did they20 do it? This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really21 hard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge22 what the point is here. And the State tries to deny23 that the purpose here is to limit the information24 getting into the hands of the doctor. We don't have to25 rely on the State's lawyers. The State legislature was35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 very helpful here.2 So if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief3 now, page 1a, okay. Right at the top, the State says4 their goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom5 of it -- containing health care costs.6 Then in finding number 2 they explain why7 they did it: "There is a strong link between8 pharmaceutical marketing activities, health care9 spending and the health of Vermonters."10 Then finding number 3: "The goals of11 marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals12 of the State."13 And my favorite, obviously, is number 4:14 "The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State15 determined, was operating in conflict with the goals of16 the State." They didn't like the marketplace of ideas.17 Now, it is true, we acknowledge, that18 another thing the State wanted to do was to give the19 doctors some more control. It's in -- it's in -- there20 is an opt-out option.21 But can I just take you to how the State22 explained what it was doing? That's just going to be on23 page 7. Now, the State's lawyer and the Solicitor24 General have explained to you that they believe that25 doctors were concerned only with marketing and only with36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 marketing to them. That's not true. Finding 29. We2 have to go all the way to number 29 to get to this goal3 of the State: "Health care professionals in Vermont" -­4 I'm on page 7: "Health care professionals in Vermont5 who write prescriptions for their patients have a6 reasonable expectation that the information in that7 prescription, including their own identity and that of8 the patient, will not be used for purposes other than9 the filling and processing of the payment for that10 prescription."11 It's not just about pharmaceutical12 marketing. The doctors say -- we all love this; there's13 stuff about us in our daily lives that we wish was14 entirely private. The doctors here said: Hey, it would15 be great for us if this information, we had complete16 control over it. Doctors also would love if medical17 malpractice judgments weren't broadly known. There are18 all kinds of government records they would prefer not to19 be out into the public sphere.20 But then we ask ourselves, all right -- and21 that's why I asked you to have this brief available -­22 what did the State do? Did the State in fact enact a23 general privacy provision? Is it like HIPAA or instead24 is all that the State did here target the use for25 marketing, while it allows the use of the same data for37￼Alderson Reporting Company17 care costs,18 interests.19 20and that is the physician's privacyMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can sell thisto whomever you want, right?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could sell to itOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the opposite message by insurers and also by the2 government?3 So here's the statute. It appears on page 94 of the appendix. I want to start with subsection A5 because the State helpfully reiterates its goals here.6 The second half of this paragraph: "The State sought to7 ensure costs are contained in the private health care8 sector, as well as for State purchasers of prescription9 drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and10 ensuring prescribers received unbiased information."11 That's what they're trying to do. They're trying to12 say: We would like the drug companies to have a harder13 time finding the doctors while the insurance companies14 and the State have an easy time finding the doctors.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there is another16 interest here besides the State's concern about health￼21 information 222324 a journalist who wants to expose physicians in a25 particular area who prescribe a lot of a particular38Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425medication.Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the public can discern well, this is the guy who is treating these people; we don't like these people, so we're going to Pickett outside his clinic.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, nothing prevents you from doing that, right?MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, don't you think that's protecting physicians' privacy, to prevent that from happening?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, I apologize. We're allowed to do it before and after the statute, is my point. Remember, what the statute does is -- and this was the debate that Justice Alito tried to point us to about what the statute actually does and the Second Circuit, what it understood the statute to mean. And I should also say the cert petition didn't say that there was a problem with that.Vermont picked out one thing. It said: Look, when drug companies can find the doctors easily, they can persuade the doctors to use more expensive drugs. We pay a lot for drugs. We would prefer that39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 not happen, so we're going to make it harder. And the2 State will have its counter-detailing program, it will3 have its drug utilization review program, and insurers4 will advocate for less expensive drugs. All the other5 uses are still permitted.6 If Vermont were serious about protecting the7 doctors' privacy, as opposed to kind of a, a right of8 publicity, a control over information about them, it9 wouldn't have all these exemptions; it would have a10 provision that says this is private information.11 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose -­12 suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year13 study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides14 -- finds the following. They say: We have found that15 when drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that16 the doctor find out what's curable, what the drug does,17 how much it costs; and by the way, all those things18 apply no matter who the doctor is. Who the doctor is,19 is irrelevant. And therefore marketing that focuses20 upon who the doctor is and what his previous practices21 were is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore22 we find that it is a false and deceptive practice under23 section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the24 following prior practices of the doctor in selling him25 new drugs, because it's irrelevant and because it's40￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 false and because it's harmful. And they enact that as2 a -- as a rule of the Federal Trade Commission.3 Does the Constitution of the United States4 forbid them, having made those findings in detail, from5 controlling advertising to prevent what they have6 determined is a false and misleading practice?7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do know -- I don't know,8 but I do know the First Amendment applies to the rule.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, nobody says it doesn't10 apply. The question -­11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They -- they do. I've got a12 couple people -­13 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what14 they're saying for the present purposes. I'm￼15 interested, 161718 to know the 192021 industry. 222324 Commission's specialists and experts in false and25 deceptive advertising concludes that this is a false and41surprisingly enough, in what I'm saying. (Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: So therefore I would like answer.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: This is a highly regulatedMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: If the Federal TradeAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425deceptive practice, are you going to say that the Constitution of the United States forbids them from doing that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: I am, but I'm also going to say that I don't have to win that argument to win this case.JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, when you say you are, is there any precedent that says they can't regulate false and misleading practice? Of course you see where I'm going.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do.JUSTICE BREYER: If they can, why can'tVermont?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. If it's actually false and misleading. You can't just -­biased -­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they said it wasMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -­Official - Subject to Final Review￼JUSTICE BREYER: -- and they -- they have made a study of it in the legislature and that's their conclusion.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that the government can say that because speech is so influential it is false and biased. But I will say, Justice Breyer, in my defense that -­42Alderson Reporting Company12 mean false. 34 And what we 56 only on one 789 argued as aJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't take "biased" to "Biased" means one-sided.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's exactly right. like -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You state the true facts side and not the other.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.JUSTICE SCALIA: This case has not been case restricting false advertising, has it? MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's a case abouttrue advertising.Justice Breyer, can I just make one pointOfficial - Subject to Final Review1011 restricting 1213 really quick? And that is, you dissented in Thompson v.14 Western States and your dissent in that case says these15 are drugs, the compounded drugs that have not been16 approved by the FDA, and I'm very concerned that you're17 evading the FDA regulatory requirements about truthful18 advertising.19 These are the opposite drugs. These are the20 drugs that all the messages that are being conveyed here21 have been preapproved by the FDA. This is truthful and22 accurate speech, and the State only wants one side of23 the debate to get out.24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's where I was going.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.￼43Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: I chose an example that's beyond your case.MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's why it's called a hypothetical.JUSTICE BREYER: But that's why I wondered how you would respond to that. So -- I thought that was one that was going to be obviously constitutional, but you're going to stop me there. So -- so what I want to say-­different?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: -- is how is thisMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.Official - Subject to Final Review￼JUSTICE BREYER: And I suppose I don't know the extent to which this does or does not promote unbiased information from going to the doctors, and isn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the Vermont legislature rather than this Court to decide?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. A couple of things about that. First, as I said, these are messages that have been cleared by the experts. The FDA has to review all the detailing communications.Second, the doctors do get to say: I don't want you to come visit me. They do that all the time. My dad's a doctor; he doesn't visit with detailers.44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 This is instead a rule about whether you can talk2 about -- about someone, not talk to someone.3 The drug companies and the intermediaries4 are talking about drug -- about prescriber practices,5 and you can decide who you want to try and approach.6 There's nothing alleged to be false or misleading.7 Third, the way the First Amendment works in8 the marketplace of ideas that so upsets Vermont is that9 both sides get to tell their story, right? The thing10 that is supposed to be biased here is that the drug11 companies have too much money. That is not a basis for12 restricting speech.13 The way it works is if the message is14 accurate, as the FDA has determined it to be, the drug15 companies can go make their pitch. Vermont can come16 along and make the opposite pitch. Terrific. So can17 insurance companies.18 But what you can't do is have a rule that19 says one side is going to have a much harder time20 getting to their audience.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Goldstein, I -- I22 understand your argument and I have a difficulty. Today23 with the Internet and with computers, there's virtually24 no privacy individuals have. Any transaction you do25 could be spread across the world instantaneously, and45￼Alderson Reporting Company1 for the longest time catalogs would2 address to other catalogers, and if3 product from one company, you would4 catalogs from 50 million others.sell your name and you bought oneget a thousandOfficial - Subject to Final Review5 Today the industry is policing that, in part6 to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an7 opt-out option. And so, if you're a consumer who8 doesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving9 you the right to opt out, so they don't sell your10 address.11 If there is, as I see, some interest that12 the State legitimately has in protecting that part of13 the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I14 didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want15 you to do other things with it, all I did was this16 transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a17 difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out?18 Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a19 transaction in which you're doing just that transaction20 and not others is something we can protect?21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It can. And let me explain22 why it is that that rule -- and let me typify it for23 you. There is a pending bill in the Congress called the24 McCain-Kerry Consumer Protection Act and it does what25 you're talking about. It says we're not just going to46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 leave it to the industry; we're going to have a set of2 governmental rules.3 Let me distinguish that bill from what goes4 on under Act 80. What that says is that if you are a5 consumer and you engage in a transaction, you have the6 right to opt out of any unauthorized uses, because it's7 just between you and the business, right?8 So there are three differences between that9 and this. The first is the structure of the statute.10 That's not what this statute does. This statute says11 every use of the information is just fine, except this12 one, this one that allows one speaker who we don't13 really like to go out and convey its message.14 The second difference is the public15 importance of the speech involved. What that consumer16 information would be used for is to make some random17 consumer pitch to you or about you. This is information18 about lifesaving medications where the detailer goes in19 and talks about double blind scientific studies that are20 responsible for the development of drugs that have21 caused 40 percent of the increase in the lifespan of the22 American public. So there's a tremendous difference in23 the public importance.24 The third is the fundamentally different25 nature of the privacy interest. Unlike your consumer47￼Alderson Reporting Company1 transaction2 can call up3 prescribing4over the Internet, this is a doctor. You any doctor's office and find out what their practice is. It's part of their business. Imagine the following conversation, if youOfficial - Subject to Final Review5 will, and that is, and -- and if you want to look for a6 place in the common law where this comes from, it would7 be section 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,8 what things are private and what aren't. It asks9 whether a reasonable person would be outraged.10 If one doctor were to say to another one,11 you know what, Dr. Smith told people that three out of12 four times I prescribe Aciphex for -- as a proton pump13 inhibitor, would anybody be outraged about that? No.14 But if you knew that the -- the company that you bought15 from on the Internet was selling that information or if16 they were giving away private medical information, you17 would genuinely be outraged.18 So, Justice Sotomayor, the reason I started19 this argument about it has to end up in the middle is we20 know that statutes like that have to be constitutional.21 At the same time, we know that the government can use22 controls over information to really distort speech. So23 the question is, what happens in this statute? And this24 statute has a structure that's not intended to protect25 privacy. It would look totally different.48￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read in one of the briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient came in and said I don't want my doctor's information sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies are not respecting those limitations.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't I read this statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are doing, which is giving people some control outside of the limited transaction that they're engaged in?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. A couple of things. Remember, the patients have nothing to do with this.The State doesn't give any control to the patient. That would be true before or after. So we're talking about the doctors.I -- I did concede, when I read you finding 29 at page 7 of the appendix, that this does give a little bit more control to the doctor. I mean, it just does.JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I stop you?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that this statutedoesn't give the patient any control. But the patient49Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is already taken care of by the Federal law. You can't2 -- I mean, the patient is protected. The question is3 whether the physician should be as well.4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I agree, Justice Ginsburg.5 Justice Sotomayor in her question to me said, why don't6 I read this as giving -- she said that they aren't7 giving patients options about what happens with this8 prescription information. My only point was this9 statute doesn't change it.10 You're quite right that our -- our position11 is no threat to the protection of private health12 information, which is reasonably regarded as extremely13 confidential. So, on the question of whether it give14 some greater control, it does. But what -- the thing15 you have to focus on here is the line that it draws in16 when it gives greater control is a line that's intended17 to discriminate against a speaker.18 You have to look, take -- I'll give you an19 example of this, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network. The20 City of Cincinnati came to you and said, look, we've21 eliminated the commercial news racks, and these people22 who want to sell their commercial stuff should use23 something other than news racks. We're targeting the24 blight that comes from commercial news racks. This25 Court said: Look, you can't redefine your interests to50￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reflect your statute. You can't -­JUSTICE BREYER: Could the Federal Power -­the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say, we want you to collect certain information about who is using what natural gas and give it to the fire department? It's for the fire department in case of emergency, and what we don't want to have happen is it's used to stove manufacturers to sell homeowners gas stoves.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.JUSTICE BREYER: They could do that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's LAPD v. UnitedReporting.JUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine. If they could do that, why can't they do this?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because the key point in LAPD v. United Reporting is that it's in the hands of the government. Let me -- the fact -­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, this isinformation -- see, this is information that starts off being collected because the government requires it to be collected. So it's there for that reason. And the government says we want you to get this information, it's done for this purpose, so, you know, other purposes, and we don't want it to be used for commercial advertising purposes. That's what they say they've done51Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in this statute.MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's what they say.They're just not right. The -­(Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN: This information -- I would direct you to the amicus brief -- you don't have to pull it out right now, but for later. The brief of the National Association of Chain Drugstores, if you just make a reference, on pages 10 to 11 collects the history of how this information has been gathered. And they make the point that the Court did in the first 30 minutes, that of course the doctor is going to put his name on the prescription. We have to be able to call the doctor and say: I can't read your handwriting.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a statute in which the pharmacy cannot give the information or sell the information to anybody; it must remain with the pharmacy.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: A copy of the prescription must be given to the State of Vermont. The State of Vermont then has the same restrictions that this statute has. That would be LAPD.MR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be LAPD. If52Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the -- it would be almost LAPD.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what -- and I want to3 know what your answer would be. If LAPD is correct -­4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what ruling would we6 have to make in my hypothetical case?7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. If it's in the hands8 ofthe--soletmejustmakesureIamonthesame9 page. I am going to answer your question directly.1011 anyone else. The government gets a copy of it. That12 does not make it LAPD. If the pharmacy was government­13 owned, that would be LAPD. Now, let me answer your14 hypothetical. Right? LAPD, it was an arrest record, it15 was in the hands only of the State. The Court said:16 Look, this is the State's information. Justice17 Ginsburg's concurrence says: It's like a subsidy, the18 decision whether to give it out or not.19 Now, in your hypothetical, which is it is in20 a private hand, but it is banned for any other use -­21 that would be a real privacy statute. I think that it22 would still be unconstitutional, but it would be much23 closer.24 The reason it might be unconstitutional is25 twofold. First, that the privacy interest in it I think53The pharmacy can't disclose it directly to￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is not very significant, because it's how the doctor2 runs his or her business, and second it would still3 allow the discrimination. If you were convinced in your4 hypothetical that what Vermont was trying to do is what5 it said it was doing here in its findings, and that is,6 to make it harder for the drug companies to reach the7 audience and make it easier for the insurance company8 and the government to reach their audience, Greater New9 Orleans Broadcasting, which involves a ban on private10 casino speech but not tribal and governmental speech,11 says discriminating against speakers like that is very12 troubling. So that's I think how your hypothetical -­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you're saying I14 think to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier15 question by saying the State cannot constitutionally16 stop the spread of information. So if the State said to17 the pharmacy, all you can do is fill the prescription,18 that's what doctors think pharmacies are doing, and19 that's all you can do, you're saying that's20 unconstitutional?21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I am saying that that's22 unconstitutional. I am also saying that the reason is23 very specific to this kind of information, that is that24 it would allow speaker discrimination, and I am also25 saying most emphatically that is not this case. That54￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would be a much closer case. It would look much more like a real privacy statute.What I would take from the hypothetical is not the lesson we should lose -- and you should never take that lesson -­(Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- but the -- but instead the lesson that that's what's so different about this statute. This statute, as in all the language quoted earlier, says Katie bar the door, do whatever you want to do with this stuff, just don't do something we disagree with when it comes to the message.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're really -- you are really hinging your argument on the discrimination aspect -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: I am -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that --that drug companies or detailers are being treated differently than any other user of this information?MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is a principal part of our argument. I did say before in describing the Kerry-McCain bill, that there were three things, not just the discrimination, but the greater public interest of the -- the detailer speech and the lower privacy interest, so I wouldn't throw those out.55Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Now can I just preempt an argument that my2 friend from the Vermont -- State of Vermont is going to3 say in her rebuttal? And that, is she's going to come4 and say that, look, the insurance companies are actually5 paying for the drugs. All their -- this exception is6 not one that's about advocacy, and I just want to make7 sure we all know ahead of time because I don't get a8 surrebuttal, that that's not accurate.9 So if -- if you still have the IMS brief10 with you at page 53 this time, so at page 53 the first11 paragraph is about the State's own use of this12 information for a variety of purposes. There is -- the13 reply brief for the State introduces a debate about14 today whether they are using the NPI data for15 counter-detailing. There is no dispute that they use it16 for other State programs, like the drug utilization17 program -- that's the quotes in the first paragraph.18 But the better paragraph is going to be -- it's the19 second paragraph, it starts, the State -- "the statute's20 parallel formulary compliance exemption." And this21 paragraph talks about advocacy by the insurance22 companies. So it's not just that the drug -- insurance23 company says to the doctor, I'll pay for -- $5 for this24 drug, but the insurance companies take PI data under the25 exemption in the statute, go to doctors and say we56￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 really think this cheaper drug would be better. That is2 straight-out speaker discrimination.3 So we quote Kolassa: "Insurance companies4 are using physician-identifiable information to call5 physicians to try to get them to comply with6 formularies, to try to get them to change their7 prescribing in a way that may or may not be in the8 patient's best interests. In just" -- this is a further9 quote -- "In just the last couple of years there has10 been an amazing increase in the amount of information11 provided by payers, insurers that will send scientific12 documents to physicians" -- I've rolled over to page13 53 -- "will call when physicians are prescribing too14 much or too little of a product and provide them with15 information." It goes on and on -- "virtually several16 times a day."17 So that is the message that I would take18 away from the argument, and that is we are emphatically19 in favor of the constitutionality of HIPAA, of the20 McCain-Kerry bill, the things that concerned you. You21 have to decide this case in the middle about what22 Vermont actually did, and it was unbelievably candid23 about what it was trying to do. It said the marketplace24 of ideas doesn't work for us, and so it designed a25 statute -- and you can decide this case very narrowly on57￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the ground that what Vermont did is it went too far is2 in just saying we're not actually trying to protect3 privacy; what we're trying to do is give the doctors4 control when it suits our own best interests.5 I do want to preempt one other last6 argument, and that is the suggestion that this isn't7 paternalistic at all. Right? We just let the doctors8 decide. But the State's goal, what the State is trying9 to do, is paternalistic. The reason the State picked10 this one exemption, the reason it picked between these11 speakers, is because it doesn't want this message to get12 to the doctors. And if you can keep -­13 JUSTICE BREYER: It used to be true there14 was something called a regulated industry.15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.16 JUSTICE BREYER: And selling was within17 activity among many.￼181920 regulations 212223 those should be reexamined?24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I thankfully am not.25 Here are the -- here are the cases. This was theMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.JUSTICE BREYER: And there were lots of that could be imposed upon selling.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure, right.JUSTICE BREYER: Are you saying that all58Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 argument that was made and rejected in Virginia Board of2 Pharmacy which was about a pharmacy rule. They said3 that it would be unprofessional. Then the Solicitor4 General in the person of Mr. Kneedler came you to in5 Thompson v. Western States and said we need to stop this6 compounded drug marketing because this is heavily7 regulated; this is a closed market, and the Court said,8 I'm sorry, no. The nature of a marketplace of ideas is9 you get to say your piece and the other side gets to say10 their piece. The FDA heavily regulates this area, the11 information12 valuable.1314 objection I15 exception and if the State didn't -- didn't push its own16 contrary program?17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We would have much less of18 an objection, and that's no accident. Let me just say19 this is not a flaw in the drafting. The State really20 wanted to push its counter message, and thankfully so.21 This government has a real interest here. Insurers have22 a real interest here, but so does the other side of the23 debate, and what the State doesn't get to do is just24 pick sides and prevent the debate from happening.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would -- if you59is perfectly accurate and it's incrediblyCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have no take it, if there were not the academic￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 were truly concerned about physician privacy -­2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You didn't want4 people to know that this physician prescribed this drug5 more often because it tells you a lot about his6 practice -­7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. Sure.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that he may not9 want known, how would you -- how would you write this10 statute?11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You would take Justice12 Kennedy's hypothetical, and I don't think the Court has13 to confront whether such a statute would be14 constitutional because it would be very different.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you remind me16 what Justice Kennedy said?17 (Laughter.)18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. He said the rule is19 the pharmacy can't give it to anybody.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Who's -­21 JUSTICE KAGAN: How about the pharmacy can't22 sell it to anybody?23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't -- I don't24 understand why that protects privacy. That protects25 against commercialization, but I don't think the60￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 government has nearly as much interest in2 commercialization as it does in actual privacy. Section3 652D of the restatement of torts doesn't talk about the4 outrage of being able to use -- we have a capitalist5 economy, and we sell newspapers and books and that sort6 of thing. Commercialization isn't a bad thing. It's a7 question of whether privacy is genuinely protected.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you do it -­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not exactly not this10 case but just in the abstract, do we have a rule that if11 there are two statutes, A, the statute is passed for a12 bad purpose, B, the statute is not passed for a bad13 purpose, if the statute is otherwise the same, are they14 both unconstitutional or just one and why? And what15 case do I look to other than maybe Church of Lukumi?16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You look to -- yes, we17 win -- Thompson v. Western States. Remember what the18 government's argument there was: If you allow the19 marketing of compounded drugs that are not FDA approved20 you will evade the very important FDA regulatory21 program. That was a perfectly important rationale, and22 the Court said but it also has the purpose of keeping23 information out of the hands of doctors. It's24 unconstitutional.25 I'll give you another example. Grosjean,61￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Minneapolis Star and -- Raglan -- those are cases about2 taxing the instruments of communication. So a tax on3 newsprint, a tax on ink; and the Court said we're not4 worried about your bad motive, you have a very important5 rationale in trying to raise revenue, that's a perfectly6 valid purpose; but what you're also doing is you're7 picking out the press and you're making it harder to8 speak; it's unconstitutional.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This -- this is, Mr.10 Kneedler explained this is the government's information.11 Why can't -- you wouldn't have to have it if it weren't12 prescription. It was the fact that it has to be13 prescribed that requires this information. The14 government frequently controls the use to which15 information can be put. It makes me file a tax return,16 and it doesn't allow, you know, dissemination of that.17 It restricts it.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably it20 could say that if an accountant prepares my tax return,21 that accountant can't sell it, either.￼222324 different? 25MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is this anyMR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, okay. Two pieces to the62Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 puzzle. The first is why can't I demand it from the2 IRS? Okay? And second is going to be why can't the3 accountant give it away? The first one is LAPD, and4 it's the same true -- the same thing is true of campaign5 finance reports. The government has plenary authority;6 when you give information to the government, what the7 government then does with the information.8 The important lesson to be derived from LAPD9 is that nine members of the Court seemingly agreed -­10 and I defended the statute in that case -- nine members11 of the court in that case agreed that if this had been12 private reports rather than the government's reports,13 then the statute would have been unconstitutional.14 The reason your tax preparer can't give it15 away, the reason I can't give away attorney-client16 secrets, the reason that the government is going to be17 able to tell Internet companies that they can't give18 await the consumer information is that it's really19 private. But what if, instead, the government had a20 rule that says tax preparers can't give out tax21 information when it will encourage people to protest22 against their taxes? But if it will encourage people to23 comply with their taxes, it's perfectly fine. You can't24 draw lines that are intended to discriminate against25 speakers. That's the main principle of our case.63￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Thank you very much.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.3 Ms. Asay, you have five minutes.4 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY5 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS6 MS. ASAY: I would like to begin with the7 point that my friend was making about the use of the8 information by insurance companies. Insurers are not9 similarly situated to pharmaceutical manufacturers.10 Insurers receive information directly from doctors and11 parents in the ordinary course of their business and12 they use it as part of providing and paying for care to13 patients.14 And when my friend described the fact that15 insurers do that with doctors' information as speaker16 discrimination, I would like to point out that -- the -­17 not only the record but the examples, for example, that18 PhRMA points to on page 126 their brief show that19 insurers have patient information for that purpose as20 well. HIPAA allows those uses of both patient and21 prescriber information to manage benefits.22 So, to argue that pharmaceutical23 manufacturers are being discriminated against if they24 don't have access to the same health care information25 that we provide to our insurance companies would -­64￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 would begin to raise serious questions about a statute2 like HIPAA. And that -- that just highlights that in3 this area of -- of private information and information4 control that many of these statutes are structured in5 such a way that there are expected and intended and6 permissible uses of information, and other uses for7 which people are allowed to have control over the8 further use of their information. And here we're9 talking about the control allotted to doctors.10 We place an enormous amount of trust in11 doctors to make the right treatment decisions for their12 patients. Part of their ability to make that, those13 decisions depends on the information that they receive.14 And what doctors have said to the Vermont legislature15 and to the Court in this case is that many of them find16 this practice objectionable and that it is not helpful17 to them or to their patients to have their information18 monitored for this marketing purpose. And all that they19 have asked for is the right to object. And I would like20 to-­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Asay, I want to22 give you the chance to respond to a point that was23 highlighted by your friend, which is the fourth24 legislative finding, which does seem to say that the25 State is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance65￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 in the marketplace of ideas.2 MS. ASAY: Thank you, Your Honor.3 The findings, first of all, have to be taken4 as they were adopted, which was in support of not this5 statute even as it was written, but as a much larger6 bill that contained many sections, including a provision7 that created the evidence based education program which8 is a -- a clinical -- a -- a program to provide9 voluntary education to doctors, and to the statute as it10 used to be written, which -- which not only had this11 provision for the doctors' choice and the use of the12 information, but also mandated that pharmaceutical13 detailers provide information affirmatively as part of14 the marketing process.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have -- were16 there -- were there findings with respect to the statute17 as enacted?18 MS. ASAY: There are no findings that19 accompany the amendment that resulted in this statute.20 And to -- to return to, I think Justice21 Kennedy's point from earlier, the statute, I think, has22 to stand or fall on the restriction that it -- that it23 allows for doctors. The Court, for example, in O'Brien24 discussed the fact that striking down a statute because25 the court disagreed with the record would -- would66￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 simply mean that the legislature could adopt the same2 statute again on a different record.3 We would say here that what -- what's -- the4 question before the Court really is, may doctors have5 this opportunity to control the use of their information6 about -- their nonpublic information about their7 prescribing practices as a marketing tool or not, and8 that -- that -- that should be the -- the focus of the9 Court's inquiry.10 I would also like to just return to the11 point that -- that I believe I was making earlier that12 this statute is so different from the cases in which the13 Court has considered restrictions on the direct14 commercial advertising and the provision of information15 to the public.16 This is an entirely nonpublic commercial17 transmission of data. It -- it starts with a private18 commercial transaction, it's a private commercial19 exchange between the data vendors and the pharmacies.20 It's used in a way that it is never disclosed publicly,21 never included in the advertising message. There's no22 restriction here on the information that's provided to23 doctors. The truthful information that the FDA permits24 to be provided about prescription drugs. And there's no25 restriction on any exchange between a willing listener67￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and a willing speaker.I believe my friend suggested that -- thatanyone could call a doctor's office and find out by asking what the doctor prescribed. Pharmaceutical manufacturers can do that as well. And if the doctor volunteers that information, there can be that exchange of information. The statute does not restrict it.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it there's -­ there's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I want you to fill this prescription in a particular place, a particular pharmacy because I know that pharmacy doesn't sell the information. They can't do that, can they?MS. ASAY: I don't believe they can, YourHonor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Counsel.
