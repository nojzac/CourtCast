New York standard, none of the three entities23   should be permitted to intervene.  And, third, the24   report's approach to intervention involves this Court in25   deciding intramural disputes between and among water3Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:            South Carolina seeks an equitableapportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River.Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all usersof the river within their boundaries.            For three reasons, this Court should notadopt the Special Master's recommendation thatCharlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water SupplyProject be permitted to intervene as parties in thisoriginal action:First, the report articulates the wrongAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   users in one State. 2               With respect to the first point, the Special 3   Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in 4   deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should 5   be allowed to intervene as a party. 6               The Special Master sought to distill from 7   this Court's cases three principles that we would submit 8   are not the appropriate principles in deciding an 9   intervenor's status.10               First, the report overemphasizes the, quote,11   "direct stake," although the master found that the12   equitable apportionment had no specific impact on13   individual users of the water.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought your15   friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard16 applied?17               MR. FREDERICK:  Your Honor, part of what you18   will be deciding in this case is the appropriate19   standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we20   respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New21   York factors.  Instead, the report distilled from other22   cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the23   principles that she thought should apply to govern an24   intervenor's status, and those three principles, we25   would submit, are incorrect.4￼Alderson Reporting Company171819202122232425   different.  They were not an equitable apportionmentOfficial1234   appropriate parties.  There was no finding of inadequate5   representation by either State to support any of the            Under the New Jersey v. New York standard,the master did not make findings that would beappropriate to determine the intervenor status here as 6   intervenor’s request to participate as parties.  There 7   was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense 8   that it was truly compelling.  It's hard to argue in 9   cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in10   the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors11   would have met the compelling interest standard here.12               And, finally, the New York-New Jersey13   standard talks about having interests that are apart14   from other interests.  But both Charlotte and the15   Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on16   behalf of all users of North Carolina water.  They￼simply happen to be the largest ones.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Frederick, we -- we hada case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, inwhich it was a State against State case, but we allowedthe oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene.case?Now, why is that any different from thisMR. FREDERICK:  First, the interests were5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   where the water -- 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why does that make any 3   difference? 4               MR. FREDERICK:  This Court has said for 200 5   years that water is a unique resource within the 6   sovereign control of States. 7               In the Maryland case, the Court permitted 8   intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued 9   the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a10   declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional.11   There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in12   Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and13   eight other States who were not parens patriae of the14   various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed15   the original action, I think the Court appropriately16   considered that interests of judicial efficiency called17   for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the18   original action in this case.19               And finally, the Court only devoted two20   sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey21   v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the22   intervention.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, well, these – these24   are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to25   when we are going to allow intervention or not?  Do –-6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if 2   I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected 3   intervention that has been recommended by the Special4 Master? 5               MR. FREDERICK:  I don't think I can recall a 6   case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to 7   Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court 8   rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana 9   citizens as parties in an original action over10   Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an11   interstate bridge.  And the reason --12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand your13   basic argument that each State should represent its own14   constituents.  But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply15   Project in a different category?  Because it straddles16   both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it17   would be treated as a stepchild by both States.18               MR. FREDERICK:  No, in fact,19   Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest20   claim to intervention in this case.21               Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union22   County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part23   of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District,24   should be permitted to have water purchased from the25   South Carolina side of the boundary.  So what's7￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   happening with that water project is the water is sucked 2   out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union 3   County's consumption under a Union County permit with 4   the State of North Carolina.  Union County, therefore, 5   is acting as any other user of water, along with 6   Charlotte and all other users of water in North7 Carolina. 8               The Catawba Project is not here to intervene 9   to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of10   the boundary.  Those are adequately protected, we11   submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the12   State.  So in effect the Union County, North Carolina,13   claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which14   they are seeking to protect through their intervention15   is no different than the other interests of North16   Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect --17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, except that these --18   these three entities are the principal entities that are19   guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially20   what the -- what the dispute is about.21               MR. FREDERICK:  The dispute is about the22   transfer of water and consumption of water in toto.  The￼23 24 25Court --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but the focus -- thefocus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers,8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 isn't it? 2               MR. FREDERICK:  The focus of the complaint 3   highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they 4   are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out 5   of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be 6   counted on -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  And these three 8   entities account for a very large proportion of those 9   interbasin transfers.  Isn't it the case that any -- any10   decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will11   necessarily impact directly these three entities?12               MR. FREDERICK:  No.13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?14               MR. FREDERICK:  Because in an equitable15   apportionment case, this Court decides which share of16   the water is allocable to each State.  It is a question17   of State law how each State shall determine the18   intrastate allocations of the water.  So --19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that, but I'm20   talking about the real world.  If -- if indeed North21   Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of22   this Court says that it's taking too much because of23   interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three24   entities are going to be out of luck.25               MR. FREDERICK:  We take the real world, Your9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases 2   tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding 3   an equitable apportionment between two States -- water, 4   of course, is fungible.  It's a series of molecules that 5   do not accord property rights in any one entity or user. 6   They all divine from the State itself. 7               So if North Carolina, in its exercise of 8   parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte 9   should have a larger share than what it currently has,10   that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as11   a political entity to decide among its users.  It does12   not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an13   equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will14   ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is.  That is￼1516171819202122232425not what we are seeking, and that's not what aninjunction from this Court equitably apportioning theCatawba River would necessarily decide.             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Frederick, if thiswere an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by therule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts indealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respectto the trial judge's determination.            So even though the civil rules are notbinding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   sound approach that we should adopt?  Just as a court of 2   appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so 3   we should give a healthy measure of deference to the 4   Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful. 5               MR. FREDERICK:  No, for several reasons, 6   Justice Ginsburg.  First, in any appellate review 7   Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal 8   test that would be applied.  Our initial submission is 9   the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test.10   So you would first need to determine, we would submit,11   what is the correct legal test for submission.  That is￼1213141516171819202122232425a de novo review standard.            But secondly, the Court has said in numerousoriginal cases it does not apply deference, although itgives appropriate respect to special masters, and sothere would be no basis for applying a deferencestandard to a special master ruling on a question of lawthat fundamentally is about what this Court's originaljurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, in fact, we've neverrejected a special master's desire to -- to haveintervenors in the case.            MR. FREDERICK:  Well, virtually every case,Justice Scalia --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that oil case that I11Alderson Reporting Company1   mentioned.  I forget the name of it.  The tax --23456   special master recommendation in that case.  The Court7 8 9OfficialMR. FREDERICK:  Maryland v. Louisiana.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  What had the SpecialMaster recommended in that case?MR. FREDERICK:  There was actually no     decided it on its motion directly to this Court.                 Virtually all of the cases that we cited in     the blue brief highlight the fact that special masters10   routinely reject motions to intervene.  It is the rare11   situation in which a special master would allow12   intervention.13               And the only example that the other side can14   come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which15   finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating16   in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to17   intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be18   tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and19   that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate.  You20   --2122   back a little?  I think you just said there was no23   special master's recommendation in24   Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745.  In25   the footnote 21, it said:  "The master recommended that12￼JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Frederick, can we goAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   we grant the motion of 17 pipeline companies to 2   intervene as plaintiffs."  And then it says:  "It is not 3   unusual to permit intervention of private parties in 4   original actions." 5               MR. FREDERICK:  And the case that it cited 6   is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from 7   this Court's docket in the 1920s.  What the Court 8   decided in 1932, Justice Ginsburg, in the Wyoming and 9   Colorado case was that in situations involving10   interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users11   of a State are deemed to be represented by the State.12   The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case13   was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether14   States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility15   to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water.16               The Maryland case, as I said before, did not17   analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would18   submit that in light of the other circumstances of the19   case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge20   involving Federal, State, and private companies, in21   which there was multiple litigation pending in various22   forums, it was an exercise of the Court's decision to23   efficiently decide the Commerce Clause challenge to24   allow those pipeline companies in, where some of those25   pipeline companies were not represented by States that13￼Alderson Reporting Companywere parties in the case.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I guess IOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg.  But9 I think --10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I don't know11   that you've actually addressed the operative question of12   what amount of discretion, if any, are we going to give13   to special masters to determine when they require the14   presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read15   the Special Master to be suggesting.  These are the16   three biggest users of water, at least one of them17   straddles both States, another has a potential license.18   And so that each of them has a different situation than19   a normal water user.20               So, you're -- all you're begging is the21   question of whether we just say you can't.  But why ishaven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's firstquestion about whether there was a recommendation fromthe Special Master or not.            MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I -- I will -- Iobviously forgot about footnote 21 of the Court's￼22232425   original jurisdiction principle.  Those are actions thatthe "you can't" compelled, either by our case law or byany original jurisdiction principle?MR. FREDERICK:  Well, let's start with the14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, 2   which this Court could sit without a special master 3   and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of 4   nine.  The fact that it appoints a special master to 5   assist and facilitate that effort does not imbue the 6   actions of that person delegated that responsibility 7   with something akin to the deference given to district 8   judges in making various fact findings. 9               Secondly, on a question of law, as10   intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are11   talking about the scope and contours of this Court's12   exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has13   said is that there are two interests that are ultimately14   being protected:  One is the dignity interest of the15   State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject,16   water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is17   doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it18   allows the Court to expect each State to represent19   adequately all of the users of water in that State.20               So, for those reasons, we think that a21   special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with22   the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a23   special master’s --24               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we've -- we've25   allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States.15￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4   apportionment.  And -- and I think the -- the scope of 5   the relief is important.  And that is because the State 6   seeking the relief is assuming the risk that the relief 7   that it wants to get from that State is an inadequate 8   form of relief. 9               Here the form of relief South Carolina seeks10   goes only against North Carolina.  We cannot get an11   equitable apportionment with Charlotte or the Catawba12   Project.  We can only get it from North Carolina.We have allowed one State to sue another State and aprivate party.MR. FREDERICK:  Not in an equitable￼1314151617181920212223   only in an ancillary way.  It is an -- part of an24   application to the FERC.  The FERC here is saying it25   does not affect it because the license itself will not16 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don’t --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I see your light's on, butcan we take this case on the assumption that nothingthat you obtain in the way of relief will affect DukePower under the comprehensive relicensing agreement?MR. FREDERICK:  Yes --             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Don't we have to take thecase on the assumption that their rights under thatagreement might be affected?            MR. FREDERICK:  They might be affected, butAlderson Reporting Company10111213141516171819202122232425the CRA itself disclaim any impact on the equitableapportionment action pending here.            If I could save the balance of my time.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Frederick.            Mr. Miller.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER             ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,                   AS AMICUS CURIAE,                SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF            MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            In order to intervene in an original actionin this Court, a citizen of a State that is a party tothe action must show a compelling interest, separatefrom that of other citizens, that is not properly17Official1234567   CRA -- says it doesn't affect water rights.  The final8   environmental impact statement from FERC says it doesn't9   affect apportionment interstate issues.  Both FERC anddictate minimum --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But are you saying you arenot seeking a result that’s inconsistent in any waywith that agreement?            MR. FREDERICK:  Neither the agreement –- andthis is at page 51 to 52 of our brief, citing 39 of the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   represented by the State.  In an equitable apportionment 2   action, the interest that is at stake is not a private 3   property interest in water.  Rather, it is the sovereign 4   interest of a State in a particular share of the 5   waters of an interstate river.  For that reason, a 6   private interest in water is not an appropriate basis 7   for intervention in such a proceeding. 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on, I suppose, 9   on what you mean by “is not properly represented by the10   State.”  If you think the State does not have a11   sufficient interest to defend that -- that particular12   right vigorously, might that not be -- might not that13 qualify?14               MR. MILLER:  Well, I think that the interest15   that the private party has is a State law property16   interest in water, and that’s an interest that simply17   isn't at stake in an equitable apportionment action.18   The only thing that this Court is deciding is what share19   of the river does each State get.20               The Court in an equitable apportionment21   action does not decide the purely intrastate question of22   how will that share be allocated.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you could say that24   realistically when you are talking about an individual25   water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal18￼Alderson Reporting Company2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9about the biggest entities that are going to be affectedby the apportionment, it really doesn't ring true to me.            MR. MILLER:  Well, that -- I mean, in NewJersey v. New York, Philadelphia, which sought tointervene in that case, constituted a majority of thewater users within the State of Philadelphia.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did the special masterthink Philadelphia should have been let in?master --Official1   resident of Charlotte perhaps.  But when you are talking￼1011121314151617   recommendations are reviewed by this Court de novo.  The18   Court is not sitting in an appellate capacity.  This is19   a case within its original jurisdiction, and this Court20   has an independent responsibility to make a21   determination, even on factual questions and a fortiori22   on questions of intervention.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but we haven't -- we24   haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what25   would facilitate the proceeding.  Much of the discovery19MR. MILLER:  I don't recall what the specialJUSTICE SCALIA:  The answer is no.            MR. MILLER:  -- said in that case.  But thisCourt has held in, for example, Colorado v. New Mexico,that even on purely factual questions, the specialmaster is -- who makes recommendations, and thoseAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   in the case has already focused on these three entities,2 hasn't it? 3               MR. MILLER:  That's right.  And to the4 extent -- 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:  So to say that they are 6   just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is –- is 7   really very unrealistic. 8               MR. MILLER:  Well, to the -- I mean, to the 9   extent that they have valuable information to provide,10   third-party discovery can take account of that, as can11   amicus participation.  It would be entirely appropriate12   for parties that have information or a special13   perspective on the case to present an amicus submission14   to the Special Master or to this Court.  And it's -- but15   that -- that's not a basis for allowing them to become16   full parties through intervention.17               And then, to the extent that there's a18   concern about the management of this case, I think it's19   important to keep in mind that the rule recommended by20   the Special Master and the rule that the would-be21   intervenors are urging this Court to adopt would, of22   course, apply not just in this litigation, but in every23   equitable apportionment action.  And not only does it24   make the litigation of those actions much more difficult25   to have additional non-State parties in, but it makes it20￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   much more difficult for those cases to be settled. 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if that -- if and 3   when that is the case, the Special Master will not want 4   them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters 5   have not wanted them to come in, in the past.  I don't 6   think that's going to change. 7               MR. MILLER:  I -- I guess what I would 8   say is that I don't think that, either in the 9   recommendation of the Special Master in this case or in10   the submissions of the -- the would-be intervenors, that11   there’s really any logical limiting principle that12   would not allow, as a matter of routine, large water13   users to come in to equitable apportionment actions.14               And that's inappropriate for the more15   fundamental reason that these original actions in this16   Court are not ordinary cases.  This Court has said that17   sitting in judgment between two sovereigns is one of the18   most grave -- grave and delicate responsibilities the19   Court has, and it’s a sparingly exercised jurisdiction20   reserved for the most serious of issues, issues of such21   importance that, if the States were independent22   countries, would be resolved through treaties or --23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not reserved24   exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and25   another State.  We've allowed it to cover suits between21￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   a State and another State and private citizens of the 2   other State. 3               MR. MILLER:  Yes.  And when a State brings 4   such an action or seeks to bring such an action, it 5   can't simply file a complaint as of right.  It has to 6   seek this Court's permission to file the complaint.  And 7   this Court can review the complaint at that time and 8   look at who the parties are and figure out whether it's 9   an appropriate case for the exercise of this Court's10   jurisdiction.  And that, in our view, is a much more￼111213141516171819202122232425appropriate way to proceed, making that determination atthe outset on the basis of the State's complaint, ratherthan through piecemeal litigation as different non-Stateparties --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, here the complaintwas South Carolina's complaint, and these areintervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina'sside.            MR. MILLER:  That's where they were seekingto intervene on North Carolina's side as defendants.That's right.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And as representing theposition of the United States, would you address theFERC license that Duke Energy is raising?            MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Under section22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   27 of the Federal Power Act, which is 16 U.S.C. 821, the 2   Power Act does not affect State law water rights.  So 3   State law water rights are taken as a given, and it's up 4   to the licensee to have the necessary State water 5   rights, and a FERC license does not in any way alter the 6   distribution of State law property rights in water. 7               And what the commission has said in this 8   case in the final environmental impact statement with 9   respect to Duke's relicensing application, which is10   available on the commission Web site, it cited section11   27 and it said:  "Any license that is issued will not12   impose requirements, including minimum flows, that13   infringe on water rights or apportionments."  So the14   commission is aware of the pendency of this case.15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it isn't a matter of16   infringing on water rights or apportionments.  I mean,17   that does not exclude, it seems to me, the revocation of18   the license or the denial of a renewal of the license19   because Duke Power does not have enough water.  That20   wouldn't preclude that, would it?21               MR. MILLER:  Well, the -- the nature of this22   proceeding makes that outcome not -- not something that23   would happen even if South Carolina were to prevail,24   because what South Carolina is seeking is to get more25   water flowing downstream to it, and so the -- the23￼Alderson Reporting Company171819202122232425requiring that they let more water flow through wouldnot be in conflict with the licensing requirement, but--            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And why isn't DukePower -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then?lawyers.MR. MILLER:  I mean, I --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They have smart24Official 1   licensing conditions, which generally impose minimum 2   flow requirements at each of the various dams operated 3   by Duke, would be easier to satisfy, not harder to 4   satisfy, if South Carolina were -- had an entitlement to 5   get even more water flowing through -- 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't 7   understand that.  I don't understand that. 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens to North 9   Carolina if it has less water?  What does it do with10   respect to Duke?11               MR. MILLER:  Well, Duke -- Duke's dams –-12   the licensing condition is that each dam allow a certain13   amount of water to flow through, under the current14   license that they are operating under, and there are15   different minimum flow requirements under the renewal16   license that is being sought.  But an order in effect￼Alderson Reporting Company1234   large consumer of water.  In fact, it's the largest5   consumer of water on the Catawba system because of its6   coal and nuclear power plants which use waterOfficial            MR. MILLER:  Well, they -- I mean, onepossibility is, of course, that Duke is -- in additionto obviously being an operator of dams, Duke is a very7   evaporatively for cooling of the power plants.  So --89 10 11 12 1316   the Court referred to in New Jersey v. New York, which17   were not entitled to intervene.18               I would also point out in further response,19   Mr. Chief Justice, to your question, that Duke is a            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it may also mean itwhen it has to increase the outflow, the level of itsimpoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability togenerate power, which in turn may -- may affect itslicense.￼                 MR. MILLER:  It -- it may have some effect14   on its ability to -- to generate power.  But that makes15   it a large industrial user of water, akin to those that20   North Carolina corporation, which may be why it's21   seeking to come in on the North Carolina side of this22 case.2324   these kinds of cases are not ordinary cases.  They25   involve sovereign interests, and I think what's25But I -- I want to return to the idea thatAlderson Reporting Company1   important about that is that the interest --2               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Miller, if I -- if I3   understood your argument, you are saying that Duke's4   interests are really with South Carolina, or -- to5   increase the flow.  But I would think then it would be6   North Carolina who would be objecting to their7   participation in the case rather than South Carolina.8   And they don't.  They -- they welcomed them in, as I 91011121314151617181920remember the papers.            MR. MILLER:  As I said, Duke is an operatorof thermal power plants that are large consumers ofwater, and some of those are located in North Carolina.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Bartolomucci.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CHRISTOPHER BARTOLOMUCCI              ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENORS            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:            The Special Master correctly concluded thatOfficial￼     Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply21   Project should intervene in this original action.  Her22   recommendation deserves some deference because she is in23   the best position to know whether these parties would24   assist her in the adjudication of this complex dispute.25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is our original26Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   jurisdiction.  I regard the Special Master as more akin 2   to a law clerk than a district judge.  We don't defer to 3   somebody who's an aide that we have assigned to help us 4   gather things here.  I think on legal questions of 5   intervention we have to decide de novo. 6               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Our claim is not that the 7   Special Master should get deference on legal questions, 8   but she should get deference on -- on the narrow 9   question of whether it would be helpful to her to have10   these intervenors in the case.  She has --11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But tell me what she12   said that makes them helpful.  What can they provide13   that couldn't be done by merely an amici submission?14               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, she pointed out,15   for example, that Duke Energy, which controls the flow16   of this river and is participating in the FERC17   proceedings, would establish a -- a direct link between18   this adjudication and what's going on before the FERC.19   And of course those two proceedings have -- have a lot20   of interaction.  I think it's also fair to --21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, your adversary has22   just said none, according to the terms of the license23   and what the FERC has said.  So why is -- why don't we24   just take what FERC has said --25                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Oh, I think --27￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5   action.  There could be a conflict between the decree 6   that comes down, if one comes down in this Court, and 7   the terms of the FERC license. 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I think all FERC said 9   is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would10   require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina.11   And that's quite different from whether -- whether a12   severe reduction in the water that Duke can use would --13   would affect the -- the nature of the license given by14 FERC.15               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, Duke of course16   pulled together 69 other stakeholders to join the17   comprehensive relicensing agreement to -- to smooth18   FERC's acceptance of -- of the new license.  And this19   original action is -- will pit the two Carolinas, each20   of which seeks to maximize their share of the river, and21   those interests work at odds with the CRA, which22   endorses a compromise middle flow position that –- that23   neither of the Carolinas seeks to defend in this action.24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, let me tell25   you what I'm very worried about.  This is our original28 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- at face value?MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  I think FERC has not saidthat there will be no effect, that there would be noeffect upon the licensing proceeding from the original￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   jurisdiction, a delicate jurisdiction that allows us to 2   resolve disputes between sovereign States.  And I look 3   out and I see all sorts of private parties intervening 4   in a way that would give them party status.  And I think 5   that's compromising what our original jurisdiction is 6   supposed to be about. 7               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Mr. Chief Justice, 8   private parties and cities have intervened in the past 9   in original actions and have been named as defendants in10   original actions.11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But even in the New12   Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that13   would have allowed the intervention did say that in14   general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction15   cases with non-State parties.  That was even the16   dissenters.  So you start out with in general it's not17   wise to let these people come in.18               And following up on the Chief's question, a19   State can't be sued without its consent.  And it's true20   here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but21   it's initiating the action against a sister State.  The22   Special Master's recommendation would require the State23   to have as its direct adversary three parties who are24   not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion25   of original jurisdiction.  It's a controversy between29￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   State can only sue a proper party defendant.  WhetherOfficialtwo States.            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, in -- JusticeGinsburg, in the case of New Jersey v. New York, NewYork City was a party defendant, and in this case theCity of Charlotte occupies the exact same position asNew York City.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's because the Statechoseto sue it as a party defendant.￼MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  It did, but of course a1213141516171819202122232425   on the North Carolina side of the river.  Duke’s -- Duke30the question is intervention or whether it's naming acity as a defendant in an original action, both have topass the test of is this city or non-State a properparty defendant?            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're -- all of theintervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to makesure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right?            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  That -- that is not theirexclusive interest.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, their -- well,they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water.            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  No.  Duke Energy, forexample, doesn't have an interest in maximizing the flowAlderson Reporting Company12345678   to intervene, it said:  Oh, Charlotte, you can file an9   amicus brief as to any dispositive motion.  Well, thatEnergy's interest is in preserving the -- the flowcompromise reflected in the CRA.Official            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- to theextent they have differing interests, why aren't thoseinterests fully satisfied by amicus participation?            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, when -- when SouthCarolina first opposed, for example, Charlotte's motion￼10111213141516171819202122   question.  If we grant intervention in this type of case23   and there is no reason it would be three -- I mean, in24   the next case, it could be 20 different intervenors, and25   they are filing exceptions every other week that we have31kind of amicus participation is vastly different frombeing able to shape the record on which the -- the keyissues in this case are finally decided.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Shape the record,but intervention status would give you the right toappeal, right?            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  It would allow us to seekleave to file exceptions to an --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right, and appealthe normal case.MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's myAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   to review and adjudicate because they are not bound by2   whether or not the State that is on their side wants to3   file exceptions.4               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, let me say two5   things, Mr. Chief Justice:  If the proposed decree6 7 8 9affects the interests of Charlotte or the joint ventureor Duke, I think they ought to be allowed to fileexceptions, which this Court can grant leave or not.￼            As to the specter of 20 possibleintervenors --10111213   disputes over water use?  That just drags us right into            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how does that get usto avoid involvement in interstate -- intrastate1415161718192021   equitable apportionment cases.  In New Jersey v. New22   York, for example, this Court entered a decree, which23   enjoined the flow of the Delaware River to New York City24   above a specified level.  I think 411 cubic feet peryour problems among your water users.            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, South Carolina andthe United States present this vision of an equitableapportionment action in which the Special Master simplydivides up the flow of the river, and then it's up toeach State to subdivide among its users.25 second.But that is not what has happened in32Alderson Reporting Company7 8 9            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And North Carolina,as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of itsconstituents as it sees fit.10111213141516171819202122   because it's a bi-State entity.  Neither -- and both of23 24 25the Carolinas is -- are affirmatively hostile to part ofthe operations of the joint venture.            When the joint venture --33Official1               And -- and that is the kind of decree that2   South Carolina, I believe, is seeking in this case.  If3   you look at paragraph 2 of South Carolina's prayer for4   relief, they want an injunction against the interbasin5   transfers currently being carried -- carried out by6   Charlotte and the joint venture.  So this --￼            You and your fellow prospective intervenorsjust have to do what citizens do all the time, which isconvince North Carolina, one, and you can help them, toget as much water as they can; and, two, when they getit or if they lose it, whatever they are left it, togive it to you, rather than the other parties.            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, as to Duke --Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained, Duke's interest isnot in maximizing the share -- North Carolina's share ofthe river.            The joint venture of the Catawba River WaterSupply Project is not represented by either StateAlderson Reporting Company7 8 9They can just come right in here, as if they were aState, and participate in the case.then I just wonder why you are here in an originalaction.                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice,10   I think this -- this is not a novel proposition.  The111213141516171819202122232425   don't want all you guys here?  How do we say that that34Official123456   district court.

BARTOLOMUCCI:  We --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that your position?Then what happens to the Special Master who says, no, IAlderson Reporting Company1415 is -- 1617   not telling us the truth?18               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  I think the question is,19   should the Court accept the Special Master's20   recommendation?  And I would disagree with South21   Carolina, when it says that she applied the wrong legal22 test.23               She did apply New Jersey v. New York.  She24   did find that the intervenors were not properly25   represented by the party States.35Official 1   master abused his or her discretion by saying no? 2               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  We are saying that the 3   Special Master got it right, when she said that you have 4   to show a compelling interest that's not properly 5   represented by a party State, and she applied the New 6   Jersey v. New York test, finding, at page 27 of her 7   report, that neither Charlotte nor the joint venture 8   are properly represented. 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you see the issue10   before us as being was she right or wrong, even though11   Nevada said -- I'm sorry -- that North Carolina said12   that it was going to adequately represent each of these13   interests, but that just wasn't correct?￼MR.

And my question is:  How do we decide13   once we say -- beyond the Special Master can let these14   people in with party status -- what users can come in15   where, obviously, we are not going to allow all users of16   the river water to come in, so which ones can and which17   ones can't?18               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Certainly, our position19   is not that mere users of water or all users of water20   may intervene in original action.21               You have to show a compelling interest22   that’s not properly represented, and that's going to23   depend upon the specific facts of the case.24               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And is it automatic then?25   Is it automatic then?  Or is it just that, when that36JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They -- because they useAlderson Reporting Company 1   condition is met, the Special Master can permit the 2   intervention? 3               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  No, Justice Scalia.  I 4   would say it's not automatic because there are some 5   other considerations the Special Master can bring to6 bear. 7   For example, timeliness -- you can't show up 20 years 8   after the litigation has started, like the City of 9   Philadelphia, and expect to get in.  You --101112131415   Master's determination of that is not final.

BARTOLOMUCCI:  It is discretionary, andif -- if the Special Master believes that -- that thiscomplex multiyear water rights dispute would be aided bythe presence of a -- of a limited number of intervenorswho have a very special interest in the case, thenthat's something that, for institutional --37JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, of course, the SpecialAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what's special2   about it?  I mean, let's say I own a little farm on3 4 5 6 7 8 9the banks of the Catawba, and I take water out to -- sothe cows have something to drink, why does Charlotte geta special status just because they take a lot?            I'm affected by how much water runs throughthere.            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, Charlotte hasspecial status because South Carolina seeks specificrelief -- injunctive relief -- against Charlotte'sinterbasin transfer.￼1011121314   draw out and use on my farm.  That's a compelling            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, and thatrelief will affect how much water is available for me to15161718   farm is going to go down.  It seems to me that, when you19   say they have a special interest, you are just sayinginterest.water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, theI -- you know, in times of drought, this20   they have got a big interest.21               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  It's not just that it’s22   -- it’s a big interest, and it surely is, but they are23   singled out in South Carolina's complaint, and24   injunctive relief is sought against them, which, I25   think, brings into the play the rule this Court38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   announced in Kentucky v. Indiana, which is that, if a 2   plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is 3   seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that 4   citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the 5   litigation and defend its interests. 6               That's what Charlotte is seeking in this 7   case.  The joint venture, of course, is not represented 8   by either State fully because both States are hostile to 9   at least part of what the joint venture does.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say the11   interest -- the dispute is really in effect between12   company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South13   Carolina.  I mean, do we -- we would not accept an￼141516171819202122232425original action if they sued each other, right?            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  No -- well, of course –-            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we let them justuse the States as, you know, a façade to get intothis Court and have their dispute adjudicated here?            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  No.  As in Kentucky v.Indiana, if there are improper parties in originalaction, they -- they can be dismissed, but I think it'snoteworthy that the Court allowed the New Jerseylitigation to proceed with New York City as a partydefendant.            And Charlotte's position is truly39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   indistinguishable from the position of -- of New York 2   City in that action, with -- with the sole exception 3   that Charlotte seeks to intervene, whereas New York City 4   was named as a party defendant. 5               South Carolina invokes the principle that it 6   is the master of its complaint, and we would agree with 7   that, in part.  A plaintiff is the master of the 8   allegations in claims it seeks to make, but a plaintiff 9   is not a master of the universe of -- of interests that10   -- that may be affected by the lawsuit they have -- they11   have brought.  That’s --￼121314151617   be a very similar analysis.  I think that the question18   whether a proposed defendant -- and of course, you need19     leave from this Court to file an original action or to20   name someone as a defendant in an original action.  I            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think the same --the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming aprivate party defendant, as you would urge forintervention by a private party defendant?MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Yes.  I think there would21   think, in both cases, it raises the question:  Is –- is22   this entity a proper party defendant or is the entity a23 proper24   intervenor?25I think it's a similar analysis.40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial12345   Stevens:  The -- the complaint prays for North Carolina6   to stop authorizing the interbasin transfers being            JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question:In what respect does the relief sought against the citydiffer from the relief sought against the State?MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  In this respect, Justice 7   carried out by Charlotte and the joint venture.  But -- 8   but Charlotte and the joint venture are the entities 9   whose primary conduct, if you will, would be affected by10   that injunction.  They are the parties who are carrying11   out the interbasin transfers, and they would have to12   stop those transfers if -- if authorization was13   withdrawn by North Carolina.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Wouldn’t it – would15   it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that16   all the issue that she was going to address was the17   relative equitable apportionment between North Carolina18   and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina19   wanted an injunction directed against the City of20   Charlotte, that's up to North Carolina?  North Carolina21   can divvy up its water however it wants.22               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  I think it would not be23   surprising if she came down -- if she were to come down24   with a decree, it would not be surprising that -- that25   it would decide whether or not to allow Charlotte's41￼Alderson Reporting Company1   interbasin transfers to continue.2               Because that's -- that was much like what3   was decided, for example, in New Jersey v. New York.4   There was the proposed diversion of water to New York5   City, and the Court there ultimately entered a partial6   injunction that banned flows to New York City above a7   certain level.  So --Official89 10 11 12 13 1416   case without deciding whether especially particularly17   massive uses are appropriate or not.18               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Not just massive.19   There's -- it's no accident that South Carolina focuses20   upon these interbasin transfers, because they inflict a21   special injury, in South Carolina's view.22               The interbasin transfers take water out of23   the river basin, and -- and so it doesn't come back to24   South Carolina within the basin.  Other types of uses of25   water are non-consumptive, in the sense that the water42            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, in -- in decidingwhat's equitable as between the two States, I guess the-- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master,initially, will have to decide what uses of water by oneState or the other are not equitable uses --            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  And, Justice Scalia --￼                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and go beyond what is15   reasonable.  So I don't see how you could decide theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   can be treated and eventually gets to South Carolina 2   within that basin. 3               But South Carolina has targeted these 4   interbasin transfers because they are entirely, 5   100 percent consumptive, in the sense that -- that once 6   the water has left the basin -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Dead losses to South8 Carolina. 9               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  -- it does -- it does not10 come back.11               JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the percentage,12   approximately, of the river that flows into South13   Carolina that the three intervenors account for?14               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  I don't think I have done15   that math, Justice Breyer.16               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, about.17               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Yes.  I can tell you that18   Charlotte's authorization is -- is 33 million gallons a19 day.20               JUSTICE BREYER:  Out of what?  Out of what?21               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, the flow of the22   River -- the minimum flow of the river, under the –-23   under the CRA is 1100 cubic feet per second, so24   unfortunately you’d have to -- you’d have to convert from25 cfs to --43￼Alderson Reporting Company1               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, do they2   account for, like -- there’s a certain amount of water3   in dispute.  There are some people who want to4   intervene.  Are the people who intervene -- do they5   account more like 1 percent of all the water that’s in6   dispute, or do they account for more like 50 percent?78 to me. 9That seems like a pretty relevant questionOfficial￼            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, I -- it's asignificant proportion.10111213   proportion.  It's not --14               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, significant – is15   that more like 3 percent, or is it more like 90 percent?16   I mean, nobody has ever bothered to look at that in this17   whole case?JUSTICE BREYER:  You must have some idea.MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  It’s a significant1819   calculation.  I will say that they are significantMR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, I haven’t done that20212223   what you mean by the water in dispute.  If the main24   gravamen of the complaint is interbasin transfers, they25   -- they occupy a huge proportion of that.44enough that South Carolina seeks a specific injunctionagainst those interbasin transfers.JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I guess it depends onAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  And as the Special Masterread it, IBTs are --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, that's -- I agree.That's a good point, but -- so what percentage if –-what percentage of the interbasin transfers do theyaccount for?            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Well, they represent,actually, 100 percent of the interbasin transfers --             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.141516171819202122232425interbasin transfer people.            MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  These are the -- the IBTsOfficial￼10111213   Justice Scalia said is correct.  These are the MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  -- being carried out.JUSTICE BREYER:  So insofar -- so insofar aswhat they are after is interbasin transfers, just whatat issue. JUSTICE BREYER:  That’s helpful.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Browning.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.               ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT            MR. BROWNING:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            Let me turn to two questions that Justice45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   Scalia asked Mr. Frederick, but I think his response 2   needs clarification from North Carolina's perspective. 3               The first question dealt with Maryland v. 4   Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case, 5   in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to 6   intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in 7   that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to 8   those 17 pipeline companies.  That is factually 9   incorrect.  In that case, two of those pipeline10   companies -- the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Company was11   a resident of the State of Michigan, one of the12   complaining States in that case, as well as the National13   Gas Pipeline Company of America was an Illinois14   corporation.15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maryland v.16   Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies,17   and they were allowed to intervene.  This is not that.18   This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of19   the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with20   the water whatever it will.21               It strikes me as very different than22   Maryland v. Louisiana.23               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, in Maryland v.24   Louisiana, that was a taxation case, a case that goes to25   a fundamental interest of the States, the power of46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   taxation.23   apply to taxing these particular companies?  Could the4   -- could the State have taxed other companies after the5   decree issued?6               MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor, as the7   Plaintiff States were seeking to attack the Louisiana8   tax at issue.  So it would have general applicability.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did -- did the decree only￼ 91011121314151617            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As -- as theallocation would in this case, presumably.             MR. BROWNING:  Well, I don’t -- and thatquestion --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that yes or no?  I --you say yes, it would have general applicability.            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  Yes,Justice Scalia.            Your Honor, South Carolina has said that18   this case is about consumption of water in toto.  But19   when you look at their bill of complaint, that is simply20   not the case.  When you look at the question presented21   in their leave for -- their motion for leave to file a22   bill of complaint, it starts out whether North23   Carolina's interbasin transfer statute is invalid under24   the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.25   And when you look at the allegations in the bill of47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   complaint, it is specifically focused on interbasin 2   transfers.  It asserts that they are inequitable, and it 3   is seeking injunctive relief with respect to those 4   interbasin transfers.  We -- 5               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how is just this 6   involved?  Is there -- because I am amazed that this is 7   now coming to me for the first time.  All this case is 8   about is interbasin transfers and that you account for 9   100 percent of them, you three.  Is that -- is that10   right?  Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody￼1112131415161718192021   right to intervene.  But if it was about California22   generally, maybe they wouldn't.23               So what I want to know is, what's the water24   that is at issue in this complaint and how much of the25   water that is at issue in this complaint do the three48might tell me it's not right.             (Laughter.)            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, there are --there are very few interbasin transfers.question.JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- that's not myMR. BROWNING:  Yes.  Yes.             JUSTICE BREYER:  I want -- I’m trying –-look, if Alaska sued California and the complaint was wewant San Francisco back, San Francisco might have aAlderson Reporting Company1   intervenors account for?  That seems like a fairly2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9simple empirical question.            MR. BROWNING:  Yes.            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I'm trying toget the answer to.            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- thetwo intervenors that have interbasin transfers accountfor the vast majority of the water that is consumed as aresult of an interbasin transfer.Official￼101112   Charlotte at 9 million gallons per day.  The second --13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, my basic14   concern is that -- and I will let you finish if there is15   more to the answer.  I'm sorry.            In the 2006 study that was done by DukeEnergy, the largest interbasin transfer is the City of16171819   for divided argument.  Your proposal was that they be20   divided 10, 10, and 10.  You didn't even want to be21   here.            Private parties are going to hijack ouroriginal jurisdiction, and it was highlighted for mewhen I read your motion, the motion of private parties22               As they view the case and as you view the23   case, it's got so little to do with the State that the24   State didn't even want to come here and argue the case.25               MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, that was an49Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9accommodation from the State of North Carolina withrespect to the intervenors.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You thought theirparticipation here before this Court on a question inoriginal jurisdiction was more important than yours, andyou represent the State.16171819   that we are ceding our sovereignty.  With respect toOfficial            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, the interventionmotion directly affects each of these intervenors, andthey have a right to be heard with respect to thatintervention motion.￼101112131415   constituents.  You are the State.  You are coming here            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why can't yourepresent them?MR. BROWNING:  Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They are yourdirectly, not even going to district court, and you seemto be ceding your sovereignty over to them.MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, we do not believe202122232425   Energy:  Duke is -- has 11 dams in North and SouthDuke Energy and the Catawba River Water Supply Project,North Carolina does not and cannot adequately representtheir interests with respect to Duke Energy.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?MR. BROWNING:  Okay, with respect to Duke50Alderson Reporting Company7 8 9their North Carolina interests.            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, theirOfficial1   Carolina.  As a result of those dams, Duke Energy2   controls the flow of the river into South Carolina.  As3   --4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you are going to5   defend all of their interests as it affects North6   Carolina, right?  You are not incapable of protecting￼interests are inseparable, specifically with regard toDuke Energy.101112131415161718192021   the previous license.  Now, South Carolina has come into22   Court and has attacked that agreement.23               Duke has a very real and substantial24   interest with respect to that agreement.  But --25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is -- what's51            Duke negotiated, over a period of severalyears, a comprehensive relicensing agreement, withvarious agencies of North Carolina, various agencies ofSouth Carolina, and stakeholders up and down this river.            As a result of that negotiated agreement,there was -- the CRA was put in place, which isessentially a request that FERC issue a license inaccordance with the provisions of that agreement.            That agreement would set a minimum flow ofwater into South Carolina that is much, much higher thanAlderson Reporting Company5 6 7 8 9Carolina's interest?            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, North Carolinawill defend these interbasin transfers, but with respectto Duke Energy, we are not aligned with Duke Energybecause Duke has a very real interest in preserving --1011121314151617   out in the CRA.  Although North Carolina supports --1819202122232425            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't it your interestto -- to resist that?            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  Not onlyare we resisting that --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And your interest isto defend the CRA, right?            MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, North Carolinawill resist having South Carolina have a greater flow52Official1234   there telling me why Duke has an interest.

BROWNING:  Well, we believe that theyhave a right to be heard because of their compellinginterests that are affected in this case.            South Carolina is seeking to change the CRA,to have a flow of water that is much higher than is setAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of water than --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You haven't answered myquestion.            MR. BROWNING:  I'm sorry.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it in your interestnot to support the CRA?            MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  It is inour interest because even --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You would like -- youwould like, in this litigation against the two States,for the Special Master to undo the -- your obligationsunder the CRA?            MR. BROWNING:  That will, ultimately, be ourrequest in this case because South Carolina has attackedthat agreement.            From North Carolina's perspective, SouthCarolina is receiving much more water under thisnegotiated agreement than they could ever hope toachieve in an equitable apportionment action.            So at the end of the day, we will be askingthis Court to issue a decree that sets a flow ofwater less than --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you are prepared totell us right now -- this is what you are saying to us:We will not represent the interest of Duke?53Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. BROWNING:  We will not represent theinterest of Duke, given their --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you prepared to saythe same thing with respect to your city?            MR. BROWNING:  With respect --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And to your -- and tothe CRWSP?            MR. BROWNING:  With respect to the city, wehave said in our briefs that we will defend thisOfficial￼10   interbasin transfer.  We believe that we will represent11   the City of Charlotte with respect to that regard, but12   we also support their intervention motions because we do13   not believe that it would result in them impeaching the14   interests of North Carolina.15               And more importantly, the Special Master got16   it right, that there is -- this is a specific attack on17   the City of Charlotte and its unique interests.  It is18   seeking injunctive relief that will cripple the largest19   city in North and South Carolina.20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it's an21   attack on -- if it's an attack on Charlotte, I would22   expect the State to be standing there protecting it and23   not feel that they can't do that without Charlotte,24   itself, coming into the case.25               MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, we will defend54Alderson Reporting Company23 24 25transfer, pursuant to the North Carolina statute forUnion County.            But what the complaint doesn't disclose is55--Official1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   that is an interstate entity.  It -- its interests have12   been expressly attacked, the interbasin transfer.  Souththis interbasin transfer, but the fact of the matter isinjunctive relief is sought as against Charlotte, andthere is something to be said for fairness in allowingthat entity to be present in this Court.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you --             MR. BROWNING:  Now, turning --             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you prepared to saythat you are not adequately defending the interest ofthe CRWSP?￼MR. BROWNING:  Correct, Your Honor, that13141516   question.

They have an interbasinMR. BROWNING:  Yes.  We --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- them.  Are you notgoing to support this -- the joint venture in property?MR. BROWNING:  We -- we cannot represent theAlderson Reporting Company1   that the other half of that joint venture also has an2   interbasin transfer with respect to Lancaster County,3   South Carolina.4               So South Carolina can hardly attack the5   Union County interbasin transfer while simultaneously6   defending the Lancaster County, South Carolina,7   interbasin transfer.8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's go back to theOfficial￼ 9   question of couldn't the Special Master receive the10   information she wants if these three entities come in as11 amici?1213   party status.  They can engage in discovery.  They can14   protract the case.

BROWNING:  Your Honor, if that werethe -- the standard, there would never be interventionmotions in any of these proceedings.            The fact of the matter is that theseentities have unique interests, and with respect to twoof those interests -- Duke Energy and the Catawba RiverWater Supply Project -- their interests are not56Coming in as intervenors, they have fullAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9represented by either State.            All three of them have been expresslyattacked in the complaint, and fairness dictates theyshould have an opportunity to be heard.            Thank you.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Frederick, you have 2 minutes.        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK               ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFOfficial￼1011   Mr. Chief Justice.  First --MR. FREDERICK:  I have four points,1213141516   it exceeds North Carolina's equitable apportionment.  We17   are here to get our fair share of the river vis-à-vis            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me, are you seekinginjunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors?            MR. FREDERICK:  No.  We seek an injunctionenjoining the interbasin transfer statute to the extent18   North Carolina.19               And Duke's CRA application expressly20   disclaims any -- any ability to go into the interbasin21   transfer.  That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion22   for leave to file exceptions.23               The FERC has said it will not affect, in24   giving its license, the equitable apportionment action25   now pending before you.57Alderson Reporting Company9 10 11was based upon a very hard negotiated agreement among anumber of entities.13141516171819202122232425   energy producer.  And the United States here is saying,58Official1               In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it2   does not affect State water uses.  So the only issue3   here is whether or not those expressed disclaimers4   should be given effect when South Carolina is simply5   seeking to determine, as between the two States, the6 rights.78   agreement on which the license is based.  The licenseJUSTICE SCALIA:  But it affects the￼                 MR. FREDERICK:  The license hasn't been12   issued, Justice Scalia.  It's still pending.            And that's what FERC has before it, and FERChas said that the CRA will not affect what license isissued, but I want to go back to a fundamental --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you willing toconcede that if whatever you ask for here affects thatlicense, once its issued, that then Duke'sintervention is proper?            MR. FREDERICK:  No, because the UnitedStates can enter -- can affect the interests andrepresent the interests of its licensees.            Duke's interest is completely derivative ofthe United States' power to confer a license on anAlderson Reporting Company1234   States granting a license.  It's the license we5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among anumber of entities, and that agreement goes out thewindow once -- on the basis of this lawsuit.            MR. FREDERICK:  The agreement is a privatecontract among various water users, and it is nodifferent than the fact that all users of this riverwill be affected, one way or the other, by whateverdecree this Court issues, whether they are on the SouthCarolina side or the North Carolina side.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            The case is submitted.
