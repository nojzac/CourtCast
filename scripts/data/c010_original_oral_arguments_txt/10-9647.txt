Hobbs.Welcome back.(Laughter.)ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. STEVENSON: Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't changed yourmind in thehaven't. Iinterim, have you?(Laughter.)MR. STEVENSON: No, Justice Scalia, Ido want to emphasize -- yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you start -- IOfficial￼know that Enmund and Tison has to do with death eligibility with respect to adults, but it does draw a line between death eligibility with respect to intentionality or not, or recklessness.Assuming for the sake of argument that some be interested in whether a line should be juveniles who intended or didn't intend respect to their eligibility for lifeof us mightcreated fordeath, withwithout parole, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, how3Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 would we write that? Would -- would we just import all2 the Enmund and Tison jurisprudence? Or would we say3 something different with respect to juveniles?4 MR. STEVENSON: Well, I -- I think you --5 you could do that. In fact, in Graham, the Court makes6 these statements that they're trying to exempt and7 shield juveniles who did not kill, quote, "or did not8 intend to kill." And that language could be a9 organizing the Court's thinking on this issue.10 And, obviously, in this case where11 wasn't a requirement of the specific intent to12 was required in the Alabama case, that -- that13 dictate a certain different outcome. I think the14 challenge with that is that juvenile status, juvenile15 intent, is a much more complicated issue, and that for16 many of the same reasons that are problematic with how17 kids function at the first stage of these trials, it18 would be hard --19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That has to do with your20 general rule, which -- which we shouldn't impose it at21 all.22 MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's right.23 But --24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if we go even to25 your second step rule -­4basis forthere kill that might￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425bifurcate --MR. STEVENSON: I think --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assuming weMR. STEVENSON: Yes, I hear --OfficialJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- then -- then we still have the question of when do we permit a mandatory imposition of --MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think there's no question, Justice Sotomayor, there would be morejustification for those crimes where there is an intent to kill, because this Court in its jurisprudence had recognized that kind of hierarchy which you've outlined and is exhibited in Enmund and then in the Court's other cases.Now, it's true that in -- in Arkansas under this provision, an adult would still be subject to the death penalty, because they used this "recklessness" language so that even the focus on "intent to kill" that we addressed in Enmund might not categorically protect these other juveniles, which I think the Court can rightly acknowledge have diminished culpability.It's also worth noting that in many of these States where there are children being sentenced to life without parole, there is no confusion about this. They are being convicted of homicide offenses for which there5￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is no intent to kill. No dispute. Those jurisdictions, those provisions would likely be addressed by the Enmund analysis.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in fact, Jackson was convicted with a non-intent, just a felony --MR. STEVENSON: Well, it would -- you're absolutely right that it's felony murder, but it's a little different. In Arkansas, if you cooperate or give aid to someone who commits a crime, even if it's not intentional, if it's a reckless indifference to life, you can be found guilty of what is capital felony murder. And the Arkansas court has interpreted that to mean for an adult you'd be subject to the death penalty. And here Kuntrell Jackson was subject to life without parole.The State argues that there was support for that and even some kind of intent, because there was a dispute about the words -- just quickly, you know, these three --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't matter. MR. STEVENSON: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The jury didn't haveto -- all the jury found was that he didn't meet his affirmative burden of proving.MR. STEVENSON: That's correct. That's6Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 exactly right.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he didn't counsel --3 they didn't make a finding --4 MR. STEVENSON: That's exactly right.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as to what words were6 used and what the intent was.7 MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's exactly8 right. And the dissenters at the Arkansas Supreme Court9 relied on that in making the determination that they did10 not conclude that intent had been established here in a11 way that would support the judgment that -- that we12 seek.13 But that goes back to one of the earlier14 questions that was posed about what happens at the guilt15 phase. Is it -- Justice Kennedy, it is true that in16 Alabama and in most jurisdictions, you would not be17 permitted to tell the jury what the sentencing outcome18 would be. And in many of these cases, there -- there19 isn't a lesser included. That's going to be up to20 the -- to the prosecution in -- in some of these crimes.21 And there are a range of offenses for which that would22 not help a jury kind of deal with the -- the kind of --23 the choice that --24 JUSTICE ALITO: Is that really -- is that25 true under the law of Arkansas? In most jurisdictions,7￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 I would think if -- if someone's charged with the2 highest degree of homicide, the defense can request an3 instruction on -- you don't have to have a separate4 charge on a lesser included offense; the defense can5 request an instruction on lesser included offenses if it6 would be supported by the evidence.7 MR. STEVENSON: It -- it would really8 depend, Justice Alito, on the facts. For example, one9 of our provisions in Alabama makes the -- the crime sort10 of a -- a homicide, a capital crime, if the victim is11 under the age of 14. You're not entitled to some12 diminished culpability, some other kind of homicide13 charge unless there's something else going on that would14 support that. Our laws and this Court's law say there15 has to be evidence in support of that lesser included16 instruction before the court is constitutionally17 obligated to provide it. And so, for that reason, it's￼18 not a given 1920 scheme that21 cases is that it does put the sentencer in a very22 difficult situation, where there is no ability to23 consider the age; there is no ability to consider the24 factual diminished culpability that might exist in one25 case or the other; no ability in either of these cases8that that would happen.And I think the challenge with the mandatory we've been talking about in both of theseAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to consider the fact that an older codefendant got a lesser sentence. That there is something else going on here that -- that goes beyond just the particulars of this crime and this particular offender's culpability.JUSTICE BREYER: Before we leave it,could -- what was the instruction the jury was given? Was it you find him guilty if he was deliberately indifferent, if he was recklessly -- what are the words they used?MR. STEVENSON: It's a reckless indifferenceto life.JUSTICE BREYER: If he was recklessly indifferent to life.MR. STEVENSON: And if he gave aid or assistance to someone in that capacity, and thequestion, Justice Breyer, turned on -- on this statement made that the -- the codefendant who testified against Kuntrell Jackson --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes.MR. STEVENSON: -- initially told the police he -- that he came in and said, "we ain't playin'," and then he testified that he said, "I thought you all were playing."JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure reckless indifference means that. Meaning, if he knew they were9Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425carrying guns, doesn't that make him liable for the reckless indifference --MR. STEVENSON: Well --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether he thought they would use them or not?MR. STEVENSON: Yes, and that's what the State argued here, is that the fact that he hadknowledge of this gun and that they went in there made him guilty of reckless indifference even though it didn't create the kind of intent to kill that -- that we typically require for these kinds of showings.That's again why there was a significance around this language, that if you come in and you say something declaratory that suggests that it's directed at the victim, it might help kind of support that intent finding if you don't --JUSTICE BREYER: Reckless -- reckless indifference to life suffices for the death penalty for an adult.MR. STEVENSON: Yes. What -- what the Courtdoes --JUSTICE BREYER: But -- so, you'd -- if that's right, then we'd -- you would have to argue on, if we took this tack --MR. STEVENSON: That -­10Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you could --JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I don't know thatMR. STEVENSON: That's --OfficialJUSTICE BREYER: -- but that you cannot sentence a juvenile to life without parole for murder unless he, e.g., specifically intends the death or something equivalent, but something stronger than reckless indifference to life.MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's correct, Justice Breyer. And, again, I think that this Court knows its own precedents, but as you'll recall, Tison followed Enmund, and in Tison v. Arizona is when the Court allowed there to be this kind of room around this intent standard in the way that you've just described.JUSTICE ALITO: So, you would draw the line at -- at a specific intent to kill?MR. STEVENSON: Again, my -- I would -- I would categorically prohibit no matter what the intent is. I think particularly for children at this age.What I think this case highlights, what's meant by "I thought you all were playing" versus "we ain't playin'" isn't a very good indicator of whether someone should be subject to life without parole.JUSTICE ALITO: What if it was a lot clearer? What if they had said, okay, before we go in,11￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 let's understand what's going on here; Shields has2 got -- has got the sawed-off shotgun, and if we need to3 use it, we'll use it; we'll do whatever it takes to --4 to bring this off?5 MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think the evidence --6 JUSTICE ALITO: There might not be a7 specific intent --8 MR. STEVENSON: Yes.9 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to kill there.10 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. I think the evidence11 that would support a finding of aggravated murder would12 obviously be stronger, but even there -- and this is13 what the Court points out in -- in Roper, the -- that14 the decisionmaking of children, that the thinking of15 children is categorically different. They're not16 thinking three steps ahead; they're not thinking about17 consequences; they're not actually experienced enough18 with the world to understand how they deal with their19 frustrations in the same way that an adult is. And so,20 their judgments about what they intend to do, their21 declarations, mean something very, very different.22 And one of the factors that we haven't23 talked about, but I just want to emphasize, is it's not24 just their inherent internal attributes; it's also the25 external circumstances that they find themselves in.12￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Kuntrell Jackson was born in a household where there was2 nothing but violence and guns and people shooting each3 other. His grandmother shot his uncle. His mother shot4 a neighbor. His brother shot someone. They were all5 put to jail.6 But, unlike an adult, these children don't7 have the ability to escape. A child of 14 cannot leave8 his criminogenic or violent environment. They have no9 control over that. And because --10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- I'm sorry; go ahead.11 MR. STEVENSON: And just because of that, I12 think it does reinforce why even their judgments, their13 so-called intentional judgments, reflect a very14 different kind of understanding of their character,15 their potential for rehabilitation, than it would with16 an adult.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: One of the arguments that18 the State makes is that when you look at all these19 numbers, the number that is most different between this20 pair of cases and Graham is the denominator. And I'm21 wondering whether you would address that. What kind of22 denominator we should be using here and how it compares23 to the denominators that we've used in past cases.24 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. I think, first of all,25 it is true that homicide offenses are -- are less common13￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 than non-homicidic offenses. In Graham, this Court2 looked at a range of non-homicide crimes, and that was a3 huge number, 300,000. That's largely because we were4 talking about a multitude of offenses and here we are5 talking about a single offense.6 I think the fact that there have been 7,0007 children arrested for -- for homicide and non-negligent8 murder -- manslaughter over this 40-year time period and9 only 79 children have been sentenced to life without10 parole is a significant fact that reinforces our claim11 that this is a very rare sentence. That is 1 percent.12 And the fact that it's over 40 years, that's also true13 forthe79.Wegottothat--14 JUSTICE ALITO: It's arrests to start out15 with; it's not -- it's not convictions.16 MR. STEVENSON: That's right.17 JUSTICE ALITO: And it's not for the type of18 offense for which one could be sentenced to life19 imprisonment without parole. It's a broader category of20 homicide offenses.21 MR. STEVENSON: Well, you're absolutely22 right, Justice Alito, on the first point, that these are23 arrest data. Of course, that's what we used in Graham,24 because, again, in this cohort, conviction data simply25 is very difficult to get. But it's not true that only14￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425children arrested for aggravated murder are subject to life without parole. As I've mentioned, in the States that create the largest population of these kids, all kinds of homicide can subject you to life without parole. So, it is true --JUSTICE ALITO: Is it true that in the States that permit life without parole for a minor homicide -- a minor murder, a person -- a minor convicted of -- of murder, that that is permitted for every non-negligent homicide?MR. STEVENSON: In some States, yes.That is, to the extent that you are -- you get convicted of murder, some of these States -- South Dakota and Pennsylvania come to mind -- whether it's first degree or second degree, you're subject to life imprisonment without parole and it is a mandatory sentence.JUSTICE ALITO: Some States, but not in all of the States.true.JUSTICE ALITO: That's got a very imprecise denominator.offenses.MR. STEVENSON: Yes. JUSTICE ALITO: -- for15Official￼MR. STEVENSON: Not inall States. That'sa really -- you've You have arrests --a broader category ofAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. But I don't -- I don't2 think --3 JUSTICE ALITO: We don't know how much4 smaller that number would be if we narrowed it down5 appropriately, do we?6 MR. STEVENSON: Well, we can't get beyond7 what the data tell us. But I want to suggest it's no8 less precise than what this Court had to deal with in9 Graham. In Graham, we talked about 380,000 non-homicide10 offenders. Half of that class were people convicted of11 drug crimes, which no one has suggested would subject12 you to life without parole. Another 60,000 were13 convicted of assaults. And kids get into fights all the14 time. But we used the aggregate of all of those numbers15 when we made that comparison.16 So, I'd actually argue that we're dealing17 here with a category definition that is much more18 precise than what we dealt with in Graham.19 And, Justice Kagan, to return to your20 question we do have some precedents that help us with21 this. In Coker v. Georgia, this Court was trying to22 make an assessment about the propriety of the death23 penalty for the crime of rape. And what this Court24 noted was that 9 out of 10 of the juries that made decisions25 about life versus death chose life. And there we were16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 talking about kind of a death rate, if you will, of 102 percent. Here, with a larger universe, we're talking3 about a rate of 1 percent.4 JUSTICE BREYER: How do you -- think about5 this, which is not your favorite position, but it's a6 position you've taken. It's -- it's the same question I7 asked before. If I say, well, doesn't there have to be8 some line, 3 years old, you'll say "of course." Ten9 years old? You say "of course," but nobody -- there's10 no problem with sentencing 10-year-olds to life without11 parole. Twelve years old? Well, hum. Now, maybe, your12 opponents want to defend that one. Thirteen years old,13 14 years old? And, of course, I'm walking right into14 the buzz saw: Well, leave it up to the legislature.15 But suppose that -- that there's something16 to be said for not leaving it up to the legislature, at17 least for the numbers that were in that range. But how18 would you defend the cutoff at -- for no life without19 parole at, say, 14, older than 14, rather than older20 than 15, rather than older than 13?21 What kind of argument is there that isn't22 totally random for picking that number as the age below23 which you cannot impose life without parole even for the24 most horrendous murder?17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. I think two nonrandom2 arguments can be made for two ages. I'll start with the3 young age of 14.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.5 MR. STEVENSON: When you consider the fact6 that 13 jurisdictions have thought about this and have7 all but one set the age above 14, I think we can then8 rely on that to make a determination that if there's a9 minimum age, it's above 14.10 I think we can also, consistent with this11 Court's precedents, look at the frequency of the12 sentence for this population. Most States have never13 sentenced a child to -- to life without parole for a14 crime at 14. They've just never done it. Thirty-two15 States, there are no children 14 and younger serving16 life without parole. And so, I think that allows this17 Court in a very nonrandom way to defend that judgment.18 But I also think a nonrandom argument can be19 made to draw the line at 18; that is, offenders under20 the age of 18. That's exactly what this Court has done21 in Roper. It's what this Court has done in Graham.22 What we've relied on about juvenile status is applicable23 to that pool. I concede that these other indicia are24 not quite as compelling.25 JUSTICE BREYER: Eighteen, you use for a lot18￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324  of purposes.  Eighteen -- you could say, okay, 18.  The  difficulty with 18 is you're running into 2300.              MR. STEVENSON:  That's correct.              JUSTICE BREYER:  Not 79.              MR. STEVENSON:  That's right.              JUSTICE BREYER:  And the difficulty is that.  In Roper, it said, well, don't worry so much about --about not having the death penalty -- the other one.Don't worry so much about it because there's always lifewithout parole.              MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.              JUSTICE BREYER:  And the fact that  18-year-olds or 17-year-olds in many respects are quite  mature or at least can be.              MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.              JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, that makes 18 seem  not quite right.              MR. STEVENSON:  Well --              JUSTICE BREYER:  Or -- but there's a problem  with each of them.  So, that's where I'm trying--              MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, but I guess just on  that point, Justice Breyer, I think you're right that  the indicia are more complicated, but I want to just  stress that they're less meaningful here, because with19Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 mandatory sentences, they don't tell you the same thing2 they do in these other contexts.3 But I also think it's true that we have4 recognized that up until the age of 18, you are a5 juvenile. Your status is coherent with what the Court6 has recognized in these other cases. And so, I do think7 it's defensible there. While it's true that you're more8 developed than a child of 14 or a child of 10, it's also9 true that you're not an adult. And we make that10 distinction in lots of ways.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other12 distinction that you have been able to think of, growing13 out of the14 the cutoff15 is between16 like that?17literature or growing out of the law, wherefor some roughly comparable series of things14 and 15 or between 14 and 16, or somethingOfficial￼MR. STEVENSON: Well, yes, this Court in18 Thompson made a distinction between offenders that were19 under the age of 15, 15 and younger, then older20 offenders. And for 20 some years, the law in this21 country was you could not subject younger offenders to22 the death penalty in ways that you could older23 offenders. And so, there's clearly precedent for that,24 and we've appended also lots of statutes, I mean, that25 also make those kinds of distinctions. I mean, we do20Alderson Reporting Company1 draw these lines frequently in a range of areas, not2 just dealing with the constitutional questions that3 we're dealing with here.4 But just kind of to complete my analysis,5 Justice Kagan, about these comparisons, the other point6 that I'll -- I'll reference is that, in Thompson, this7 Court was also struggling over this question about8 frequency and rarity. And what the Court did there is9 actually look at the number of juveniles that were10 sentenced to death under the age of 16 that were on11 death row and compared them to the number of people on12 death row at the time, and they noted that it was13 .36 percent of the population of people on death row.14 If you did the same thing here, the15 Sentencing Project reports that there are over 41,00016 people in the United States serving sentences of life17 imprisonment without parole. And if you compare our18 number of 79 to that, that's actually, again, a lower19 proportion of people serving life without parole than20 the Court found to be constitutionally significant in21 Thompson.22 So, I think Thompson and Coker all reinforce23 what we're saying here, that this is an exceedingly rare24 sentence where the majority of States have never chose25 to impose it. And that would provide a basis for this21Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 Court to conclude that it is cruel and unusual.2 JUSTICE ALITO: In Coker --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stevenson, you're4 making an argument now in Jackson's case, and Jackson5 was the felony murder case. And I think at least in6 your brief, you made the argument it was just7 happenstance, bad luck, that in Jackson's case the shop8 attendant was killed. And in Graham's case, the person9 who was assaulted survived.10 But your argument to us seems to make no11 distinction between the two cases.12 MR. STEVENSON: No -- no, I -- I don't13 intend to do that Justice Ginsburg. I think -- I think14 there is a distinction. There's no question that15 there's a stronger argument that, by traditional16 measures, there's lower culpability in Kuntrell17 Jackson's case. He was not found to have specifically18 intended to kill. In the State of Alabama, he could not19 have been subject to life without parole, and there are20 States where he would not be subject to that, based on21 his degree of culpability.22 I -- I guess my -- my point is, is that even23 there, there is a challenge if the Court wants to engage24 in that kind of thinking. What children intend, because25 they are children, is a very complicated question. It's22Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 a very different question.2 I don't mean to concede that it's an3 irrelevant question. I think the Court absolutely can4 and should conclude that there is diminished culpability5 in the Jackson case, and that's evident based on the6 facts of the crime. Actually, it was the dissenter7 in the Jackson case that made this observation about the8 consequences of crime. And, of course, for many9 non-homicide crimes, there are these kind of fortuities10 that sometimes prevent death wonderfully, and we were11 grateful for that.12 My point is that the differences between13 children and adults, these internal attributes, if you14 will, these deficits in judgment, are not15 crime-specific. The person who intends to kill doesn't16 actually have any better judgment, any more character,17 any more maturity, any more impulse control than the18 person who doesn't. And a way of characterizing a rule19 would be to recognize that and -- and to create a20 categorical ban.21 If there are no further questions, I'll --22 I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.24 Mr. Holt.25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT G. HOLT23Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MR. HOLT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:            The decision below falls squarely within theframework of Roper and Graham, and there are threereasons to affirm this judgment:  First, murder is theworst of all crimes.  Society has drawn that line.            Second, legislatures have the power toauthorize sentences that are commensurate with crimeslike murder.            Third, Jackson has not demonstrated anyconsensus in this case against the practice, and, infact, there is a supermajority of States and ofgovernments that authorize this sentence.            The landscape of this case is -- isdifferent than Graham, because in Graham no one was --no one was killed.  Terrance Graham was lucky no one waskilled, because he acted with a reckless disregard forhuman life as well, but it's an important thing in ourlaw that the law punishes the -- the result, the harmthat is inflicted.            And if I could, go to the Arkansas statute.Jackson was charged with the highest crime you could becharged with in Arkansas -- it was capital felonymurder -- in that the legislature has set out several24Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 enumerated, several violent felonies that if you commit2 this particular crime -- and aggravated robbery is one3 of them -- if you commit that crime and in the course4 and furtherance of that, you or an accomplice act with5 extreme indifference to the value of human life during6 the commission of it or in the flight from it, then you7 are guilty of capital felony murder.8 So, in this case the jury was called9 upon -- because there were other accomplices with10 Kuntrell Jackson, they were called on to determine11 whether or not Kuntrell Jackson acted as an accomplice,12 whether he aided and assisted and whether or not he or13 an accomplice acted with extreme indifference to the14 value of human life.15 In that process, Kuntrell Jackson asserted16 the affirmative defense that essentially is available17 for capital murder. He said that, I did not have -- I18 was not the triggerman, and I did not -- I did not19 commit the homicide offense, and I did not aid or20 procure counsel. All of those are listed -- the exact21 words of the affirmative defense are listed in our brief22 at page 4. And -- but he asserted that defense.23 The Arkansas Supreme Court noted in its24 opinion that in his challenge to the sufficiency of the25 evidence, that there was sufficient evidence to convict25Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 him of capital murder and that the jury was well within2 its right to believe that he said that he -- that when3 he walked in and took -- took the lead in this robbery4 that he said, "We ain't playin'," and after that, the5 clerk responded that she was going to call the police --6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I know7 that this seems like block building, but I think of law8 as sort of logical. If you're involved in a felony and9 you counsel the felony where someone dies, under10 Arkansas law, you're guilty of felony murder, correct?11 MR. HOLT: Of capital felony murder, yes,12 Your Honor.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. So, whether or14 not that he intended to counsel the crime, he was guilty15 of felony murder, unless he could prove the affirmative16 defense, right?17 MR. HOLT: Yes, Your Honor.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, obviously, he didn't19 prove the affirmative defense, but that doesn't mean20 that the jury actually found that he used one set of21 words or another. It just means that they didn't22 believe he had proven by his burden of proof that he had23 not counseled, correct?24 MR. HOLT: That's correct. The Arkansas25 Supreme Court said they could -- they could accept that26Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as -- they pointed to that as --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As a possibility for thejury.            MR. HOLT:  As a possibility, yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But not that it was an actual finding by the jury.            MR. HOLT:  No.  No, Your Honor.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.            MR. HOLT:  It was not an actualbecause an actual -- in regard to sentencesyears, we don't require that individualizedresponsibility that we do, for instance, inpenalty case.  So --findingin terms ofa deathnot?MR. HOLT:  Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER:  He aided.  Is that right orMR. HOLT: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If that's right,27Official            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well -- so, ina 13-year-old or a 14-year-old is in a getaway car andknowingly accepts the money that someone gets from arobbery and intends to drive off with it, and that otherperson shoots the teller and kills him, then thatindividual who is 14 years old is guilty of felonymurder, capital felony murder?Alderson Reporting CompanyArkansas, if￼1 do -- do you think that such a person is less culpable,2 knowing only that, than a person who actually takes out3 a gun and shoots the teller? Morally speaking.4 5 6 78 question is9 able to tell that to the jury or judge who's going to10 impose the sentence? What is the argument for not11 allowing a judge or a jury at least to think about that12 question, before they have -- before imposing mandatory13 life without parole?14 MR. HOLT: Well, Your Honor, that -- that --15 telling a jury about that doesn't go to their guilt.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I know. I mean, my17 obvious point is that -- that the Arkansas system, once18 we have he was the getaway driver or assisted the19 getaway driver, they must sentence him at that age, or20 despite that age, to life without parole.21 And so, the other side is saying, well, at22 the very least -- he has three other positions -- but at23 the very least, the Constitution -- maybe it's the Due24 Process Clause -- requires the sentencer to take that25 into account, the fact that he was just the28OfficialMR. HOLT: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.MR. HOLT: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if the answer to that "yes," what is the argument for not being￼Alderson Reporting Company1 assistant/getaway driver and may not have thought about2 the murder in reality and may not have expected it in3 reality. Why not have to take that into account in4 sentencing? That's the argument.5 I want to hear directly your answer to that,6 which is taking the fourth or possibly the weakest of7 his positions or the least radical. What is your answer8 to that one?9 MR. HOLT: Your Honor, it's -- a legislative10 judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline11 for -- for all murderers, whether they're juvenile12 murderers, whether they're getaway drivers. And when13 you -- when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets14 you liability for being a capital murderer, then that's15 the -- that is the minimum sentence.16 What he's gotten, on account of his youth,17 is he's gotten -- this -- this Court decided in Roper in18 that he could not -- he could not get the death penalty.19 All of those individualized characteristics that would20 get him the lesser penalty, he doesn't even have to put21 on. It's swept off the table because he is not exposed.22 And that -- those are all those factors in terms of what23 he -- what he might -- that might mitigate.24 So, he would actually sort of be25 double-dipping to come back again and say, oh, and by29Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 the way, I'm a youth, and so I should get even -- I2 should get not the lesser punishment; I should get the3 lesser, lesser punishment.4 So, there's a certain symmetry that this5 case has with -- with the Graham case, in that the6 Graham case was very specific about the way it defined7 itself. One commentator has made the note that the8 majority opinion in Graham contained the word9 non-homicide 47 times.10 Graham essentially said what it wasn't. It11 wasn't a homicide. It was that other line that society12 draws between homicide and every other crime. And13 crimes are -- the criminal statutes are scalar. There's14 a certain amount of culpability that's built into each15 one of those, whether it be capital murder or16 first-degree murder or second-degree murder. And it17 does go on what you know, the -- the knowledge that you18 have. Maturity is taken into consideration, or19 immaturity is taken into consideration in capital murder20 in that you can't get the worst -- if you've been shown21 to do these acts, you can't get the worst punishment.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the standard in23 Arkansas for moving a child from the juvenile system?24 We heard, I think, in Alabama it was -- was age 13?25 MR. HOLT: Yes. Your Honor -­30Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was age 12.2 MR. HOLT: Yes. Your Honor, Arkansas has3 sort of a three-tier system. The age for moving into4 the adult system is 14. And -- but the middle-tier5 system in Arkansas is called extended juvenile6 jurisdiction. And in that particular case -- in those7 cases, the prosecutor can move to take a younger age and8 put in -- and it's a blended sentence between the -- and9 a youth is just found delinquent of a crime and not --10 and not found guilty.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what are the12 factors the judges and prosecutors use in making that13 determination?14 MR. HOLT: Your Honor, at age 14 -- and it's15 the specific -- there are specific crimes that a16 prosecutor would move a case into an adult court. It is17 the prosecutor's discretion weighing -- there are 1018 different factors that include the severity of the19 offense, the -- and -- but they also take into20 consideration the maturity of the -- of the youth,21 the --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you submit23 that as a justification for your scheme, why couldn't24 those same factors be applied to the judge -- by the25 sentencing judge after the conviction? In other words,31Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 all of the -- all of the discretion is up front before2 the conviction.3 MR. HOLT: Well, there is discretion up4 front, and that is the only -- that is the only instance5 when a defendant can actually challenge a transfer,6 where a prosecutor decides to put it. But there are7 also -- so, there is -- there's discretion at the front8 end.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess my point is, if10 the concern is that -- that we have too indefinite11 standards, too few specifics to guide the judge in12 determining whether there should be a life sentence, the13 same criticism could apply to the determination to send14 him -- put him in the adult system at the outset.15 MR. HOLT: Well, Your Honor, the -- it is --16 admittedly, it is at the discretion of the prosecutor on17 those ages to move it into the --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume discretion is19 guided by certain standards, or it's no discretion at20 all. So, there are standards.21 MR. HOLT: Well, Your Honor, the -- the22 prosecutor -- that -- that decision to move it in there23 is challengeable. It is reviewable by a court. He24 moves -- the juvenile moves it to transfer it to -- back25 to juvenile. That is appealed. That was done in this32Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 case, and then the Arkansas -- the Arkansas Court of2 Appeals reviewed that decision and said that the3 court -- the court's decision was not erroneous. So,4 that -- that is the discretion that one would exercise5 on the front end.6 Again, on the latter end, this Court has7 said in Harmelin that the individualized sentencing is8 not required, and, in fact, the -- all of the -- all of9 the -- the mitigating circumstances that would -- that10 have been considered because it's -- he's -- the death11 penalty has been taken off the table. That's a big --12 that's a big deal, especially in a case like this one13 where Kuntrell Jackson -- we believe the evidence showed14 that he also acted with reckless indifference to the15 value of human life, based -- based on the evidence in16 this case. That he would be -- by way of analogy, that17 he would be a Tison offender himself.18 But irrespective of that, the legislature in19 Arkansas -- it's -- the legislative judgment has been20 that the minimum sentence that a person can receive for21 committing a capital murder in Arkansas is life without22 parole.23 I would like to clarify one point that I24 think -- earlier that was made. The two other25 individuals in this particular case were -- one was a33Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 cousin who testified against Mr. Jackson, and he was 15.2 He had turned 15 the day before this robbery. And the3 second, the second individual, the triggerman, was -- he4 was also 14, and he received a -- a sentence of life5 without parole as well.6 It's our position that -- as is Alabama's,7 that the main -- the principal justification in this8 case lies with the -- the retributive principle that9 society needs to convey the message that people like10 Laurie -- that Laurie Troup's life, the victim in this11 case, was more important than the money in that cash12 register. The harm here was irrevocable. And this kind13 -- the punishment for this -- it's qualitative -- death14 -- the death penalty is qualitatively different.15 But the punishment for -- for this crime16 reinforces the sanctity of human life, and it expresses17 the State's moral outrage that something like this could18 happen. We think that the respect due life is -- is19 what this message conveys, and it conveys it more as a20 life-without-parole sentence than it does life-without.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say the sanctity of22 human life, but you're dealing with a 14-year-old being23 sentenced to life in prison, so he will die in prison24 without any hope. I mean, essentially, you're making a25 14-year-old a throwaway person.34Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 MR. HOLT: Your Honor, I would -- I'd2 respectfully disagree that he's a throwaway person. The3 -- we want to -- we want him to come to an understanding4 of his own humanity. We want him to realize the5 enormity of his crime. I can only speak for Arkansas,6 but in Arkansas, instances -- it's not in the record,7 but this particular petitioner, Jackson has made efforts8 to obtain his GED; he has taken anger management9 classes. You can -- juvenile life without parole --10 people serving this sentence --111213 programs in 1415161718 that he may19 commutation20 he will -- or perhaps retroactive legislation --21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.22 MR. HOLT: -- if the legislature comes to23 another view.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought he was life25 without parole. I thought he was sentenced to lifeOfficialJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.MR. HOLT: -- are enrolled in vo-techthe prison.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What hope does he have? MR. HOLT: Excuse me?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What hope does he have? MR. HOLT: Your Honor, he has -- the hope have is that he -- is an application for through the parole board. Other than that,￼35Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425without parole.  How can the parole board --            MR. HOLT:  Oh, what I'm saying is the paroleboard is -- reviews applications for commutation inArkansas.  So, he -- this particular -- this Petitionerhas not --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How many commutations oflife imprisonment sentences are ordered every year inArkansas?            MR. HOLT:  Your Honor, I don't have figureson that -- on how many per year, but there is a casethat -- that listed -- it's Rogers v. State.  It is a1979 case that actually listed -- 30 clemency requestswere granted in the last 5 years from that opinion.They were life sentences.JUSTICE KENNEDY: From life sentences? From life without parole?            MR. HOLT:  Well, life without -- life andlife without parole in Arkansas are the same type ofsentence, but --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know how old Laurie Troup was when she was shot?            MR. HOLT:  Yes, Your Honor.  Laurie Troupwas 28 years old when she was shot.  She was discoveredby her mother and her 11-year-old son.JUSTICE BREYER: I understand the arguments,36Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 which are very good ones, for the importance of Arkansas2 emphasizing the importance of life and not killing3 people. But a person who is an adult who is faced with4 the death penalty, which is certainly a strong statement5 along your lines, is permitted by the Constitution6 nonetheless to make any mitigating argument he wants.7 And Arkansas has to do that. They have to let him make8 any mitigating argument he wants.9 And so, the argument here is basically,10 well, the same is true when a 14-year-old, because of11 the lack of maturity, faces life without parole. And12 that seems to me the hard issue in this case. Just13 as -- just as the death penalty is unique for anyone14 and, therefore, requires mitigating elements, isn't the15 life without parole special enough for an adolescent16 that you have to let him at least make any mitigating17 arguments he wants?18 Now, Arkansas hasn't really expressed a view19 in its legislation on that question, or maybe it has and20 just rejected it. But I don't know. That's -- if you21 want to say something about that, I'd be interested.22 MR. HOLT: That's -- that's not a view23 that -- that I know that's been expressed.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But I mean, that's25 what their brief is filled with on the other side,37Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 basically. And so is Roper.2 MR. HOLT: Yes, Your Honor. But death is --3 death is qualitatively different. And -- and that's4 been taken off the table. I think that all of -- all of5 those things that he would put to get the -- that he6 would -- that he would put forward to get the lesser7 sentence is -- initially is that he would just get a --8 as I said, a lesser, lesser sentence.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say that Arkansas10 has no life with parole?11 MR. HOLT: Your Honor, the only provision --12 and this does go to show that Arkansas has thought about13 this in ways, has taken deliberate steps. In its14 extended juvenile jurisdiction, there is the provision15 that -- that a -- for instance, a 14-year-old in this16 particular case, if -- if they had deemed that they17 would go in extended juvenile jurisdiction, could18 receive a life penalty, except it is life with parole,19 yes. So, that is -- that --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not available21 to an adult. That's only in the --22 MR. HOLT: That's not available to an adult.23 No, Your Honor.24 As I -- as I was saying, the -- there's a25 certain constitutional symmetry to this case and to38Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 Graham's case because -- because Graham committed a -- a2 non-homicide offense and he was a youth, and so he had3 twice-diminished punishment. But he only received one4 diminishment in his -- in his punishment, because he5 had -- he was -- he had twice-diminished culpability.6 In this particular case, Jackson does not have7 twice-diminished culpability. He has -- he is a youth.8 Even if he were to -- even if we were to say9 that, well, he didn't pull the trigger, or we can't show10 that he didn't -- that he acted -- didn't act with11 reckless indifference, even if we were to say that that12 was twice-diminished, he is still criminally13 responsible. There's not a -- there's not a special14 class of not guilty by reason of youth. He is still15 criminally responsible for what he did.16 And -- and a -- teenagers must know that if17 you commit the worst crime, you will get the worst18 punishment that's available under the Constitution. And19 so, the symmetry here is that -- that Terrance Graham20 was the lucky one. It's not that Kuntrell Jackson was21 the unlucky one. This is a -- when you go into a place22 with a sawed-off shotgun, it's a dangerous activity;23 it's inherently dangerous. And what was left out of the24 calculus a minute -- a few minutes ago was the fact that25 he could -- it's not just kill or intend to kill, but39Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425foresee what could happen.            And, certainly, the evidence in this casedemonstrated that Kuntrell Jackson could foresee that atan armed robbery, someone could get hurt.  And that'swhat the law punishes, is the result.            If there are no further questions --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Stevenson, you have 8 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. STEVENSON:  Just -- just a few points.            Justice Kennedy, I just want to kind ofremark, there is some literature out there aboutcommutation in Arkansas.  And it was actually quitecommon up until 1980, and this case that my colleaguereferenced was prior to that date.  But since then, it'sbeen very uncommon.  There's only been one commutationsince 2007 with the -- with the current governor, andthat was for a non-homicide offense.            I -- I also want to say, just kind ofconsistent with my earlier argument, that this Court didstrike down mandatory death sentences inWoodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana formany of the reasons that the Court has highlighted herethat made that sentence unconstitutional and40Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 inappropriate. And we think that in the same way, the2 Court could certainly do that here.3 But my final point is really to just say we4 are not suggesting that States should not be able to5 impose very harsh punishments and6 on even children who commit these7 crimes. That's not our position.8 The State of Arkansas9 Alabama have parole boards in place. They can even10 impose sentences that give them the authority to11 maintain control of the lives of these children for the12 rest of their natural lives.13 What we are arguing is that they cannot do14 so with no hope of release, that that would be15 incompatible with child status. And that's the rule of16 Roper. That's the logic of Roper and Graham. It could17 be argued that every person is more than the worst thing18 they've ever done. And a policymaker and a19 decisionmaker might consider that in constructing what20 kind of sentences to impose and what kind of regime to21 create, and that's totally up to the legislatures.22 But what this Court has said is that23 children are uniquely more than their worst act. They24 are quintessentially children in a way that the25 Constitution requires that we respect their child41Officialvery severe sentenceskinds of violentand the State of￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425status.            And our argument is simple.  Our argument isthat it would be unusual to recognize that in virtuallyevery area of the law, but when a crime is committed, tosimply abandon it, to simply ignore it.  Roper andGraham teach us that we can't do that consistently withour Eighth Amendment prohibitions.            And so, for that reason, it is unusual, andit's our judgment that it would be cruel to declarethese children fit only to die in prison given what wenow know about their status, about their development,and about their potential.            And for those reasons, we would ask thisCourt to reverse the lower court judgments and grantrelief in this case, Jackson v. Arkansas.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Stevenson, Mr. Holt.            The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was
