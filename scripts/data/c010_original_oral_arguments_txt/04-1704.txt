OLSON          ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704          MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Respondents dispute the wisdom, efficacy, andconstitutionality of Ohio's franchise tax system, butthey face two insurmountable obstacles in this Court.First, they cannot demonstrate any actual, concrete,and direct injury as a result of Ohio's investment taxcredit to satisfy the irreducible minimum requirementfor standing in this Court.  Secondly, the facialDormant Commerce Clause challenge that they bring iswithout merit.          Ohio imposes no burdens or tariffs oninterstate commerce.  Its investment incentive programis available on equal terms to in-State, out-of-State,local, or interstate businesses.  It isnondiscriminatory, and it stimulates, rather than31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 impedes, commerce.2 Respondents are not injured when a business3 with which they do not compete receives a reduction in4 their taxes as a result of a tax credit. Respondents5 pay no higher taxes for products. They suffer no6 coercion because of a tax credit that is given to7 others. Their tax burden is not increased by Ohio's8 investment tax credit, nor will it be lessened if it is9 eliminated.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, who would have11 -- who would have standing? I understand your argument12 that Ohio taxpayers don't, but are there people who13 would have standing?14 MR. OLSON: I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg.15 In some of this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause cases,16 competitors, who are arguably injured because they are17 paying a higher tax against the -- compared to the18 company that's receiving the benefit -- in a couple of19 cases, this Court has recognized customers of companies20 that are paying higher products, and, therefore,21 potentially higher prices, for the products that they22 purchase. And, in one or two cases, States have been23 recognized for purposes of standing. But --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think there has to be25 somebody who can challenge it, though.41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. OLSON: No, we don't think that at all.2 As this Court --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of our opinions say4 that, don't they, that --5 MR. OLSON: Well --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: --7 that there has to be --8 MR. OLSON: What --9 the strongest statement is init's not necessarily trueJustice Scalia, I think                                   the Valley Forge case, at10 page 489, where the Court said, "If Respondents have no11 -- the argument that if Respondents have no standing to12 sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to13 find standing." This would convert "standing" into a14 requirement that must be observed only when satisfied.15 But the fact is that under any standard articulated by16 this Court in its article III cases, the Respondents17 here do not having standing. The effect of the tax is18 very "uncertain, hypothetical, or speculative," to use19 the words of this Court, with respect to them. They20 cannot demonstrate that they are affected by it. And21 as --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I had asked you23 the question, because I wanted to know whether this24 case was distinguishable from Flast in that regard,25 although I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge.51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 That -- Flast seemed to be a case that fit that2 description, that there was no one who would have a3 better claim for injury, in fact.4 MR. OLSON: Well, nonetheless, the Court made5 that distinction in the Flast case with respect to the6 Establishment Clause, and, specifically, the spending7 and taxing powers exercised by Congress. And the Court8 determined, in that case, that the Establishment Clause9 was a specific limitation on spending authority. The10 Court has been very careful, and many Justices of this11 Court, individually, have said that that distinction in12 that case will not be extended beyond the Establishment13 Clause, in the context of spending, in connection14 a religious conviction, or the establishment of a15 religion. The Court has indicated, frequently, I16 think, that that is not going to be extended.with17 At any rate, it wouldn't be extended --18 logic of Flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway.19 This is not an application of the spending power by20 Congress or the taxing power by Congress. This is the21 Commerce Clause, which is a permissive grant of22 authority to Congress, and, at most, under the Dormant23 Commerce Clause, a limitation on the States.24 These respondents are not remotely25 what this Court has said are the irreducible61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOclose tominimums.Washington, DC 20005the￼1 Even if they --2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to the3 claims that are before us. But there was standing4 below for5 challenge67 there was8 - the municipal taxpayers, with respect to the property9 taxes. That was the --the municipal taxpayers with respect to theirto the property taxes.MR. OLSON:  We believed, at the time, thatstanding with respect to the property taxes -10 11 1213 these --14 you know,15 the same sort of supplemental jurisdiction that allows16 the Federal court to consider purely State law claims17 if they have jurisdiction of another related Federal18 claim?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.MR. OLSON:  -- basis for the --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, why isn't --why aren't the present claims brought under --within the same nucleus of operative facts,19 MR. OLSON: The Court has never treated20 article III standing that way, Mr. Chief Justice. The21 Court has said, "a standing is not dispensed in gross"22 -- that was the Lewis versus Casey case -- that23 standing has to looked at -- be looked at individually24 with respect to the claim. Furthermore, this -- there25 was not an identical nucleus of facts. I mean, it is the71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 -- the property tax exemption was issued pursuant to a2 contract between the company here, DaimlerChrysler, and3 the City of Toledo. The State tax --4CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But just to get -- Idon't dispute the standing of the municipalon the property tax issue?MR. OLSON:  We did not, and do not.  Now, I --be arguments that might be made, that are5 mean, you6 taxpayers78 there may9 not before this Court, with respect to the whole idea10 of --11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's an12 article III issue, I think that's always before us.13 MR. OLSON: Well, with respect to the14 municipal taxpayers and the -- and whether there would15 be standing to challenge the property tax exemption.16 That's not an issue that has been briefed here. It's --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I was thinking18 if your -- if the argument is that the claims that19 you're concerned about today can be piggybacked onto20 the other21 there's a2223 rather significant change in the Court's article III24 standing jurisprudence. It would, furthermore, allow25 the tail to wag the dog, the exception to swallow theones, then we do have to consider whetherpig to piggyback them onto.MR. OLSON:  Yes.  But that would require a81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rule.  If anybody could bring any kind of a case atall, then all manner of cases of -- with -- for whichthe Court had no jurisdiction at all could be alongwith them.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  In any case, it's clear thatthat -- that that entity no longer has standing, isn'tit?          MR. OLSON:  No, the -- there's a separateentity, called Kim's Auto.  That --standing.--JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.MR.

OLSON:  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The former standing of Kim'sAuto cannot allow this suit to proceed, under anytheory --          MR.

OLSON:  That's --91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you have to havestanding during the entire --          MR. OLSON:  That's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- process --          MR. OLSON:  That's absolutely correct.  Butthe Chief Justice was asking me about the municipalproperty taxpayers with respect to the claim concerningthe property tax exemption.  Those plaintiffs --respondents are still in the case.  That's not Kim'sAuto.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but the only person whocould give them standing, even by this associationaltheory, is gone.          MR. OLSON:  No, there are -- there are stillproperty tax -- some of the respondents that are stillin the case are property taxpayers.  Kim's Auto --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But --          MR. OLSON:  -- wasn't the only one.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they are not propertytaxpayers who have standing under any -- under theargument that you've just made.          MR. OLSON:  With respect to --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The only property-taxindividual who had standing was somebody whose land hadbeen condemned.  None of these other people in it have101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425had their land condemned --          MR. OLSON:  In --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- have they?          MR. OLSON:  In fairness, Justice Scalia, Ithink that there are other respondents who claim to beproperty taxpayers in the City of Toledo, aside fromKim's Auto.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whose land has beencondemned.          MR. OLSON:  No.  They are -- they arecomplaining about the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but --          MR. OLSON:  -- property tax --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but you say that aproperty taxowner, simply by being -- simply by beingsubject to the property tax, does not having standing. Isn't that your position?          MR. OLSON:  No, we're saying -- we -- theproperty -- under this Court's jurisprudence, municipaltaxpayers have been permitted, under somecircumstances, to challenge municipal actions,irrespective of the imminent domain proceeding.  So,there is that separate issue that's in the case.          If I might, I would like to spend a moment ortwo with respect to the merits of this case, because it111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 is a very 23 some sort4 to the location of businesses or the drawing of5 businesses within the State, which is --important issue.Nearly every State in the United States hasof incentive program.  This -- with respect6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I don't mean to7 deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there8 was one point in your brief that was of concern to me.9 That is, you said that you questioned whether,10 assuming we accept your argument on standing, it would11 be appropriate to return this case to the court of12 appeals with instructions that it be remanded to the13 State court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle14 one to. And you said that would not be right.15 MR. OLSON: No. We believe that the case was16 properly removed, and, therefore, there's not counsel17 fees with respect to the removal statute; that the18 proper resolution would be to vacate the Sixth Circuit19 decision and then remand to the district court for a20 dismissal because of lack of standing, or the Court --21 this Court hasn't resolved whether it would be a22 dismissal or a remand to the -- to the State court. We23 don't believe that there would be standing under State24 court taxpayer or State -- Ohio jurisprudence, either.25 If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reserve the balance of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          Mr. Cole.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE          ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1724          MR. COLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleasethe Court:          We agree with DaimlerChrysler's position,both as to standing and as to the merits.  TheRespondents' grievance as taxpayers, the sole standingargument they press here, is a textbook example of thegeneralized public grievance that the Court hasrepeatedly rejected as a basis for -- or for standing. Respondents' only claimed taxpayer harm is theirassertion that the State fist loses money as a resultof the investment tax credit.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do they have standingin State court?          MR. COLE:  Your Honor, we do not believe thatthey have standing in State court, either.  Ohio has ataxpayer standing doctrine much like the Federaltaxpayer standing doctrine.  They would need to showsome unique harm separable to them.  I believe thelanguage is that they would have to show that theycontribute to a special fund.  And that's out of a case131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 called Masterson, in Ohio. There is a separate Sheward2 case that the Respondents cite in, I believe, footnote3 5 of their brief. We don't believe that this falls4 within the Sheward exception to standing, in Ohio.5 There's a certain exception that allows certain case6 of great public importance to go directly to the7 Supreme Court, but we do not believe that --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --9 MR. COLE: -- this would fall within that.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what about the11 municipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we12 were talking about earlier?13 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they have15 standing?16 MR. COLE: Yes. And I wanted to respond a17 little bit to Justice Scalia's point. I think what18 they're trying to claim is, because they have municipal19 taxpayer standing to challenge the property tax20 exemption, that that somehow allows them, then, to21 sweep in their challenge to the investment tax credit,22 as well. We don't dispute that they have municipal23 taxpayer standing to challenge the property tax24 exemption. We do, however, dispute whether or not that25 gives them standing to also challenge the ITC.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's because it's a2 local -- it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the3 distinction you're making?4 MR. COLE: Well, the property tax exemption5 is a State tax program, Your Honor, but it requires6 action by 78910 the local 111213local city leaders --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, that's --MR. COLE:  -- to --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would be challengingaction --MR. COLE:  It --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- rather than the State --MR. COLE:  It --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- action, and that's how1415 you distinguish the municipal taxpayer.16 MR. COLE: In a sense, that's right, Your17 Honor. This Court has noted that the relationship18 between a municipal citizen and a municipal corporation19 is akin to between a shareholder and a corporation,20 generally, and that, in some instances, that will allow21 the municipal citizens to challenge the actions of22 their municipal leaders, in a sense. This property tax23 exemption involves that type of action. It would, in a24 sense, be a challenge to that, and, I think, cognizable25 under the Court's municipal taxpayer --151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, a tax -- just --so, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge the State tax,because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in NewYork City can challenge the city tax, because it's not.          MR. COLE:  Your Honor, when looked at from anumerical basis, I agree that the distinction might notseem to carry a lot of weight.  The Court, however, hasnot looked at it in terms of numbers, it has looked atit in terms of the, quote, "special relationship" thatarises between a municipal citizen and a -- and acorporation.  And presumably that special relationshipexists independent of the size of the municipality.          But, in any event, whether or not they havemunicipal taxpayer standing to challenge the propertytax exemption, there's no way to somehow grow that intostanding to challenge the separate enactment by theOhio General Assembly.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's also aredressability problem, too, isn't there?  I mean,assuming they could, is there any -- would actionagainst the Assembly eliminate their tax?          MR. COLE:  It wouldn't, Your Honor, although --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?          MR.problem with,COLE:  -- I think it puts a point on thein a sense, trying to grow a standing.  You16Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 ask, would it redress? And I guess the question is,2 redress what? I mean, they don't have any separate3 harm associated with the investment tax credit that's4 constitutionally cognizable.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are some -- at least6 it's arguable that there's Federal municipal taxpayer7 standing. And certainly some States have said that8 there is. And that -- and whatever Ohio might or might not9 do is not relevant to this proceeding. We don't know10 that. I'm -- you've given your opinion on what it11 would be.12 MR. COLE: Well, that's correct, Your Honor,13 but, still, there needs to be some way to grow the14 municipal 15161718 question. 1920 my only suggestion was that, even if there21 taxpayer standing to challenge a property tax22 exemption, which we've conceded below, that doesn't23 somehow confer standing to challenge of separate24 enactment by Ohio's General Assembly. Respondents, in25 their brief, talk about this notion of ancillary171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOtaxpayer standing into --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's a -- MR. COLE: -- standing to -- JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's theThat's quite different. And -- MR. COLE: Right. Exactly, YourHonor.  Andis municipalpiggybacking￼1 standing, but that -- the case they cited -- and they --2 principally, they talk about the Flast case, where,3 in addition to considering the Establishment Clause4 challenge, the Court also, in a footnote, mentioned the5 free-exercise challenge and the question of whether6 there would be separate standing for that.7 But there, in the Flast case, it was a8 situation where they were using two theories to attack9 the same legislative enactment. Here, they're trying10 to attack a statute which they haven't shown causes11 them any harm. And so, the case is -- the challenge12 that they are bringing is, in a sense, an abstract13 challenge. It isn't one that's in a -- in a form14 that's judicially cognizable. That's why this15 ancillary standing theory, which would represent a16 dramatic expansion of the Court's article III17 jurisprudence, would not be a sound constitutional18 interpretation. It would allow the Court to interject19 itself into disputes where there's no injury to any --20 no concrete injury to any specifically identified21 plaintiff.22 Article III's case for a controversy23 requirement is supposed to ensure that when the Court24 takes action, it takes action in the context of a25 particular concrete harm, and it can do its legal181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 analysis against the backdrop of this plaintiff who's2 been harmed in this manner. These plaintiffs can't3 meet that. They haven't shown any harm to themselves,4 any judicially cognizable harm, under article III.5 If I could, for a moment, Your Honors, I'd6 also like to turn to the merits, briefly, of the7 Respondents' claim.8 We believe Respondents' claim also fails on9 the merits of the Dormant Commerce Clause. Ohio10 provides a benefit for those who invest in the State;11 but Respondents have not, and cannot, identify any12 burden that the ITC places on interstate commerce.13 Absent that burden, their Dormant Commerce Clause claim14 fails.15 JUSTICE BREYER: On the merits, I think that16 their claim is -- take company A and company B. Both17 are located in Toledo, both hire a certain number of18 people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount19 of property, and have a certain amount of business.20 Identical. And they're charged a tax. And now, what --21 company B, when it's thinking of building a new plant22 or make new investment in machinery, if it goes to23 Wisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all24 those things that were already in Ohio. And,25 therefore, the people who sell land or machinery in191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Wisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought,2 because that old tax, which really had nothing to do3 with this new investment, is now less because of the4 new investment. So, that hurts businesses in5 Wisconsin.6 As I understand it, that's their claim. And7 if I've got it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me.8 MR. COLE: Well, I don't think that -- that's9 not the way that I understand their --10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.11 MR. COLE: -- claim, Your Honor.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then I'm probably13 wrong.14 [Laughter.]15 MR. COLE: I understand their claim -- I16 understand their claim more to be that two identically17 situated businesses, if -- both have the same tax bill18 --one builds a new facility in Ohio, one builds a new19 facility in Wisconsin. The one who builds the new20 facility in Ohio is going to have a lower tax bill than21 the one who builds the new facility in Wisconsin.22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, that -- that is true,23 and then the effect of that is that firms that now do24 business in Ohio won't build their new facility in25 Wisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Ohio.  And that hurts businesses and others inWisconsin.          MR. COLE:  Your --          JUSTICE BREYER:  You were saying they have noharm?  I think they're pointing to that harm.          MR. COLE:  Well, Your Honor, first, I'd notethat's not a harm that they face, of course, going backto --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is the harm --          MR. COLE:  -- standing issue, but --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- they think -- well, theycan tell me.  All right.          MR. COLE:  Yes.  But --[Laughter.]          MR. COLE:  -- separately, Your Honor, I thinkwhat -- in this Court's Dormant Commerce Clausejurisprudence, when the Court has talked about"burden," in the past, the Court has talked about thesituation where activity out of State is somehowassessed a tax.  That is, the tax in State A goes up asa result of activities in State B.  The Westinghousecase is a perfect example.  There, there was a New Yorktax that increased for each export transaction thatoccurred outside the State.  In a sense, New York wasexporting the tax burden to activities that existed in211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 some other State. And that's the sense in which the2 Court has used the word "burden" in its past cases, not3 this more amorphous sense that Plaintiffs -- or4 Respondents are pushing here.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There isn't -- the tax6 credit doesn't give them -- require them to buy, in7 State. I mean, the purchase -- whatever they equip the8 plant with can come from vendors and manufacturers, out9 of State?10 MR. COLE: That's absolutely right, Your11 Honor. There's no limit on where the taxpayer12 purchases the equipment they install in the State.13 There's no limit -- no effect on where the goods from14 the factory go. There's no limit on who you can hire15 to work in the factory, or where they come from.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the credit's available17 to out-of-State companies.18 MR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. The19 credit is available independent of whether you already20 have a presence in Ohio, whether you've never had a21 presence in Ohio, whether you've never even paid taxes22 in Ohio before. Certainly, if you invested within the23 State, you're now going to have a corporate franchise24 tax bill, and the credit would be useful to you at that25 point. But you could have had no pre-existing221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 relationship with the State at all, as a taxpayer, and2 still take advantage of this tax credit. It's equally3 available to all comers.4 The only question is, What do you do in the5 State of Ohio? Do you invest money in the State of6 Ohio? And the credit turns on the amount of that7 activity in Ohio. If DaimlerChrysler establishes a new8 plant in Missouri or Montana or California, it, in no9 way, impacts the credit that they receive in Ohio.10 They're not deprived of that credit. It doesn't become11 of a -- of a lower value because of their decision to12 invest elsewhere.13 And so, under this Court's --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it would be15 of higher value if they invest it in Ohio. I mean,16 that's all --17 MR. COLE: Interestingly, Your Honor, it --18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, the Ohio19 legislators were not doing this irrationally.20 MR. COLE: I would -- I would hope not, Your21 Honor. I mean, I think the sense is that it increases22 investment in Ohio. And that's what this Court has23 called a "laudable goal" of State economic policy, is24 to try to increase investment within the State to25 benefit the citizens of the State. Certainly, that's -- 231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼12 sense, at 34 couple of5 spurs investment that otherwise would not have taken6 place anywhere else, of course that's just positive7 sum. That's new economic development that wouldn't8 have occurred, but for this incentive, or incentives9 like it.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That -- in somethe expense of the citizens in other States.MR. COLE:  I don't know, Your Honor.  Aresponses to that.  First, to the extent this10 Of course, at some level there's going to be11 competition for where these manufacturing facilities12 are located. But, again, this Court has noted that13 competition among the States for their share -- or14 their fair share of interstate commerce is not, in and15 of itself, a Commerce Clause problem. The question is16 only when that competition becomes discriminatory in17 some way. And what the Court has meant by18 "discriminatory" is, Does it somehow tax your decision19 to be somewhere else? When you decide to be in20 Missouri, does that increase your Ohio tax bill over21 what it would otherwise be?22 Camps Newfound, perfect example. You decide23 that you're going to serve an interstate clientele,24 your tax bill goes up above what it would be if you25 didn't serve an interstate clientele. And Ohio's tax241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 credit doesn't have that characteristic that the Court2 has found so troubling.3 In fact, looking back through the Court's4 cases, over and over again this notion of burden comes5 up, and -- whereby, "burden," it means "imposing taxes6 on the business of other State," all the way back to7 Guy versus Baltimore, "You can't build up your commerce8 by means of an -- unequal and oppressive burdens upon9 the industry and business of other States."10 So, certainly if Ohio were attempting to tax11 DaimlerChrysler, or treat DaimlerChrysler worse because12 it had put a plant in Missouri, that would create a13 Dormant Commerce Clause question. But here, there's14 simply nothing like that. In fact, Respondents' theory15 would dramatically expand this Court's Dormant Commerce16 Clause jurisprudence, and would strike down a whole17 swath of State laws that have engendered substantial18 investment-backed expectation at this point. Billions19 of dollars have been invested by thousands of companies20 in reliance on various forms of locational credits,21 whether it be job incentive credits, whether it be22 investment tax credits, whether it be environmental23 cleanup credits. All of those credits would be at risk24 under the theory that Plaintiffs espouse.25 Your Honors, this Court has more than once251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 noted that the Commerce Clause demands that the States2 must sink or swim together, but it has never suggested3 that the States must be indifferent between those two4 options.5 to swim.6 economies7Frankly, Your Honor, the States would preferITCs like Ohio's help the States keep theirafloat.Respondents disagree with this, as a policy8 matter, but that debate belongs in Ohio's statehouse,9 not here. The ITC is not protectionist, and it imposes10 no burden on interstate commerce. And, thus, it does11 not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.12 Ohio respectfully urges the Court to reverse13 the decision below or, in the alternative, to vacate14 the decision for lack of standing.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?16 Would the case be any different if, instead of a tax17 credit, they offered a cash subsidy?18 MR. COLE: Your Honor, I don't actually think19 it would be any different, in the sense that neither20 one of those two would violate the Dormant Commerce21 Clause. Of course, this Court has noted, in various22 cases, albeit in dicta, that subsidies ordinarily do23 not run afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause. I think24 this tax credit ends up having the same economic25 impact. And, for all the reasons I stated about a lack 261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 of burden, even if some tax credits that might be like2 subsidies could create a Dormant Commerce Clause3 problem, this tax credit does not. It imposes no4 burden on 56789 1012 I'd like to begin with the question of13 standing, and then turn to the Commerce Clause merits.14 Let me begin at the point where Petitioners15 and Respondents agree on the question of standing. The16 original lawsuit brought by Respondents in the Ohio17 State Court raised two claims, one challenging the18 investment tax credit that's before this Court today,19 the other challenging the property tax exemption. The20 point on which Petitioners and Respondents agree is21 that Respondents do have standing, in their status as22 municipal taxpayers, to bring their challenge to the23 property tax exemption. And, indeed, the district24 court agreed and found that there was standing, in the25 district court's judgment, to reach both parts of the271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOout-of-State activities.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Cole.Mr. Enrich.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER ENRICH    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. ENRICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 11 please the Court:￼1 case on the basis of the Respondents' municipal2 taxpayer standing.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any authority at6 all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or7 controversy requirement? I mean, it's one thing to say8 you can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's9 a case or controversy. I'm -- I don't know of any10 authority that says that you can -- you can take a11 matter that is not a constitutional case or controversy12 and latch it onto something that does qualify.13 MR. ENRICH: Justice Ginsburg, there are two14 reasons why we believe that there is such a basis.15 First, there are cases -- one case in this Court, in16 Flast v. Cohen, where the Court has found that standing17 to raise one claim extended, as well, to raise, in that18 case, a free-exercise claim. There are a number of19 such cases in the courts of appeals. Wright and Miller20 has recognized a concept of what they refer to as21 "ancillary standing" on that basis.22 But the second point that we think is perhaps23 more important is, once there is one claim in the case24 that satisfies the article III "case and controversy"25 requirement, then there is a case or controversy here.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 The question that then faces this Court is, how far2 should it reach in addressing the other claims which3 are part of that very same case or controversy?4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it was pointed out5 that, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the6 same spending on the part of the Federal Government.7 Here, you have apples and oranges. The property tax is8 quite discrete from the investment tax credit.9 MR. ENRICH: That is true, Your Honor. And10 in at least some11 reached a second12 part of the same13 Sierra Club case14 example of that.15 In the16 challenge both arise out of the very same transaction,17 out of a deal that was entered into between the City of18 Toledo and DaimlerChrysler --of the circuit court cases, they haveclaim where the -- where a differenttransaction was being attacked.  Thethat we cite in our brief is one goodpresent case, the two issues that we19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I back you up20 just a bit before we talk about piggybacking? This21 Court hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have22 standing in this sort of situation, have they?23 MR. ENRICH: No, this Court has not ever had24 to address the question of municipal taxpayer standing,25 except in Establishment Clause contexts.291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you want us to2 piggyback, we -- and if it is an article III question -3 - we would have to decide that issue before we can4 decide whether we can piggyback your current claims5 onto it.6 MR. ENRICH: Mr. Chief Justice, you would at7 least have to decide the question of whether municipal8 taxpayer standing was -- satisfied the article III9 requirements under your standing doctrines. If you10 found that it satisfied the article III requirements,11 then that would suffice to bring this case or12 controversy past the article III threshold --13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And you agree14 that the --15 MR. ENRICH: -- bring us to prudential16 threshold.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you agree that18 the municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax19 question is an open issue before this Court. We have20 not had a holding on that.21 MR. ENRICH: That's absolutely correct, Your22 Honor. We would suggest that, in keeping with the23 consistent holdings of every circuit court that has24 addressed this topic, it would make sense for this25 Court to acknowledge municipal taxpayer standing, or,301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 at the very least, to acknowledge that the obstacles,2 any obstacles to municipal taxpayer standing, are3 prudential obstacles, rather than article III4 obstacles.5 There are actually other reasons why we6 believe the article III barrier is crossed. We believe7 that this case -- that, as Judge Posner wrote in a8 recent opinion that we referenced in a letter to the9 Court -- it came out after our brief was filed -- in10 his analysis of the taxpayer standing cases, he11 concluded that the Court's burden on taxpayer standing12 was based on prudential, not on constitutional grounds.13 We believe his analysis is correct.14 Once this becomes a question of the15 prudential standards, we believe that the very16 particular factual history of this case provides ample17 reason for the Court to find that there should be18 standing in this particular case to reach the19 investment tax-credit claim.20 Respondents brought this case in the Ohio21 State courts largely out of a recognition that the22 standards for standing were different in the State and23 Federal courts in this area. In fact, if Petitioners24 felt that we didn't have standing in Ohio, perhaps the25 wisest strategy for them would have been to oppose311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 standing there. But, instead, they chose to remove the2 case to the Federal court. And there, we requested3 that the case be remanded to the State courts, because4 we identified to the district court the risk, that if5 the Federal court kept the case, we might find6 ourselves, years later, before a higher court that7 might say, "But you don't have standing," and require8 us to go back and begin all over in the State courts.9 Petitioners, at that time, argued that, in10 fact, we did have standing. And the district court so11 held. And then Petitioners have not again raised the12 question of standing until before this Court.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Have you found any other14 instance in which -- any case -- there was a absolute15 lack of standing, prudential standing, but the Court16 waived that, because it was prudential and not17 constitutional?18 MR. ENRICH: Yes, Justice Breyer.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Which one?20 MR. ENRICH: In Craig v. Boren, this is21 exactly what the -- this Court did. There, the one22 plaintiff who provided standing for a sex23 discrimination claim no longer had standing by the time24 the case was adjudicated. The plaintiff who ultimately25 had standing to keep the case going was one who,321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 although she suffered an actual injury, was not -- was2 asserting third-party rights, and so, did not satisfy3 prudential standing requirements.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the case use the phrase5 "capable of repetition and evading review," or -- which6 is a mootness --7 8 9MR. ENRICH:  I actually --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just have to read Craig --MR. ENRICH:  -- don't believe that --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- on the --MR. ENRICH:  -- they did use that concept inthink that's a concept that has come into10 1112 Craig. I13 this Court's jurisprudence more frequently in later14 cases --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem in Craig, with16 the name plaintiff, is, it wasn't a class action, an17 18-year-old sent to turn 21 in the fullness of time.18 But I didn't understand your answer about the beer19 seller whose standing saved the case, at least in the20 view of the majority of this Court. She had a real21 pocketbook injury. She was not able to sell her beer22 to the thirsty boys. So --23 [Laughter.]24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I don't understand why25 that's an example of a loose standing connection. I331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 mean, she surely had an -- a pocketbook injury. True,2 she was complaining about a denial of equal protection3 to the fraternity brothers, but that she had an injury,4 in fact, there was no doubt.5 MR. ENRICH: Justice Ginsburg, the premise6 behind our argument is that the article III hurdle is7 cleared on other grounds, on grounds that I've already8 discussed and we can certainly reiterate. The question9 then becomes -- on prudential grounds. And that is the10 issue that was presented in Craig, that she had a11 direct injury, but she was in -- she did not satisfy12 the prudential standards because she was asserting13 third-party rights. And what this Court there held14 was, because the parties had adjudicated the issue15 below without objecting about standing, that the Court16 would proceed to the merits.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG:18 standing below. The problem19 turned 21 while the case was20 There was standing below. He was 18 when the21 litigation started.22 MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor, that -- and,23 similarly, we believe that there was standing, and24 still is standing, for the Plaintiffs to be in this25 Court on article III grounds because of the continuing341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOThere was no lack ofwas that the -- Craigpending in this Court.￼1 pendency of our challenge to the property tax exemption2 as municipal taxpayers. We --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, could I ask about4 the ancillary doctrine? You say the case you cite to5 establish it is Flast versus Cohen. Was the doctrine6 discussed in Flast versus Cohen, or are you relying7 simply on the fact that Flast versus Cohen involved8 both an Establishment Clause and a free-exercise9 challenge, and the Court only discussed the10 Establishment Clause challenge?11 MR. ENRICH: No, Justice Scalia, in a12 footnote in Flast, the Court specifically says, "Having13 now decided that there's Establishment Clause standing,14 we can also reach the free-exercise question without15 discussing whether there would be" --16 17 18 19 2021 footnote.22 footnotes, normally.23 [Laughter.]24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In any event, they were25 attacking the same thing. So, your case is different,351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  I --MR. ENRICH:  -- "independent standing" --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I had not --MR. ENRICH:  -- "for that claim" --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- recollected thatI will -- I will find it.  I don't read￼1 at least to that extent, that you have two discrete2 taxes.3 MR. ENRICH: It is, indeed, Your Honor. We4 acknowledge that, although, again, as I say, in some of5 the lower court cases there have been challenges where6 the claim that the plaintiffs did not have standing7 with regard to was challenging a different outcome in8 the same transaction or occurrence. The specific9 example was a challenge to an environmental impact10 statement, where the plaintiffs had standing to11 challenge certain elements, but did not have standing12 to challenge the potential -- the failure of this13 impact statement to consider impacts on indigenous14 tribes. And the District -- the District of Columbia15 Circuit held that they did have standing, based on16 their other standing claims, to reach that claim, as17 well.1819 Ohio were20 which did21 Ohio, but22 which did23 no question that such attacks would violate the24 Commerce Clause by facially discriminating in favor of25 in-State business activity.

ENRICH: No, Your Honor, we are not7 suggesting that any tax measure which gives an -- which8 encourages businesses to locate in the jurisdiction,9 poses a Commerce Clause problem.

The part of the tax --￼1 this case, they're getting, effectively, taxed at a2 lower rate, because they make an investment in Ohio.3 MR.

ENRICH:  They --JUSTICE SCALIA:  The only one who gets theof the lower -- the lower income tax rate andproperty tax rate is someone who is located10 advantage11 the lower12 in the State. It's exactly the same.13 MR. ENRICH: Well, I'm -- in the case of a14 lower income tax rate, Your Honor -- it's a different15 situation for the lower property tax rate, but take the16 lower income tax rate first -- the lower income tax17 rate will reduce the tax burden on all businesses,18 wherever their manufacturing capacity is located, who19 have a taxable business presence in Ohio. There is no20 discrimination based on where they locate any activity.21 If they locate new activity in Ohio, more of their22 income will be subjected to that lower rate of tax, but23 that is not discriminating between two businesses,24 based on where they locate their activity.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I told you, you have to381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425locate -- you'd have to locate in the low-tax State toget advantage of the low -- of the low tax.          MR. ENRICH:  That's not true, Your Honor.The way that corporate income taxes work, they look ata tax -- an apportioned share of the worldwide incomeof the business.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then all the --but all you're saying -- but you have to do business inthe State with the lower income tax rate to get theadvantage of the lower rate.          MR. ENRICH:  Yes.  If you're not doingbusiness in the State, then you will not pay any tax.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that --          MR. ENRICH:  If --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- would seem topresent the same Commerce Clause problem that you'reposing for us today.          MR. ENRICH:  Well, Your Honor, a businessthat doesn't have a business presence in the State ofOhio will not pay any Ohio tax.  It is not subject toany burden.  It is not discriminated against in anyway.  That's the same situation for the property tax.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Likewise, a business thatdoes not locate in Ohio is not subject to the -- to thehigher Ohio tax, which has been reduced for them.391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼12345 entirely, 6MR.

ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. The7 discrimination here is not between those businesses8 which are not present at all in Ohio and those which9 are doing their manufacturing in Ohio, the10 discrimination is between those who are doing business11 in Ohio, but not locating their new manufacturing12 activity in Ohio, and those who do business in Ohio,13 but do locate their new manufacturing activity. This14 is the same situation that the Court has confronted15 over and over again. In Boston Stock, the16 discrimination only affected those purchasers or17 sellers of stock where the transactions had sufficient18 nexus with New York to be subject to New York's tax.19 The problem was that, of that universe of transactions,20 the ones where the sale was made on a New York exchange21 were subjected to a lower rate of tax than the ones22 that were transacted on an out-of-State exchange.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the legislation that24 established this tax benefit -- was it controversial?25 Were there those who opposed it as a giveaway to --401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR.

Isn't that theplace to fight out this thing?  Isn't your basicobjection here that you don't agree that a State shouldgive tax credits to business, and that's somethingthat, you know, is in the political arena, and let thepeople fight it out?          MR. ENRICH:  Justice Scalia, our objection --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why should that be an issuethat a court should decide?          MR. ENRICH:  -- our objection is that whenStates use discriminatory tax measures as a way toprovide tax benefits to those businesses that locate inthe jurisdiction, that it leads to a competitionbetween the States that ends up hurting taxpayers, likeRespondents here, by reducing the ability of the Statesto generate tax revenues from business.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but what you call --          MR. ENRICH:  This Court has --411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what you call2 discrimination is any differential. In fact, in this3 case, the effective tax differential is a quid pro quo4 for an investment. And, basically, your argument boils5 down to saying that there's discrimination whenever the6 State offers a quid pro quo for an advantage and7 somebody decides not to take advantage of it.8 MR. ENRICH: Your Honor --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's not discrimination.10 That is simply the effect of a free choice, and any11 business is free to make that choice.1213 that that14 that this15 discriminatory tax provisions. In Bacchus Imports,16 anyone could move to Hawaii and produce pineapple wine17 and receive the benefit of the tax exemption. In18 Boston Stock, anyone could make their transactions on19 the New York exchanges, rather than an out-of-State20 exchange, and get the benefit of the lower rate.21 What this Court has consistently said is,22 when the benefit that is given is -- takes the form of23 a credit, an exemption, a reduction in a tax which24 applies to out-of-State businesses, transactions, and25 activities, that that constitutes the kind of421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. ENRICH:  Your Honor, weis exactly the situation inCourt has previously struckwould suggestmany of the casesdown as facially￼1 discrimination --234 forbids. 56 argument,7 there was8 transactions. But that was the case in --9 MR. ENRICH: Yes. And --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the tax. And there is --11 there's no such parallel here.12 MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor, there is a very13 precise parallel here. The corporate income tax14 imposed by Ohio applies to any business that transacts15 business in Ohio, whether or not it has manufacturing16 presence.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same18 question I asked your adversary? Suppose, instead of a19 tax credit, they said, "We'll pay for the construction20 cost of a building, or we'll give you a piece of real21 estate, in order to get you to come in. Part of big22 redevelopment progress" --23 MR. ENRICH: Yes.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- "program, we would give25 you this parcel of real estate." Would that also be431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh.MR. ENRICH:  -- that the Commerce ClauseJUSTICE SOUTER:  I could -- I could see yourif, for example, in the tax exchange case,not taxation being made of the out-of-State￼1 subject to the same analysis?2 MR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor, it would not.3 As this Court has suggested, as far back as Hughes v.4 Alexandria Scrap, when the State is essentially acting5 as a participant in the market, deploying its own6 resources --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, they wouldn't be acting8 -- other than the one transaction, "We'll give you one9 particular benefit in this new development progress --10 project, with no further participation as a market11 participant or anything like that," that would -- it12 seems to me that would fit right into your analysis.13 MR. ENRICH: Well, in terms of its economic14 effect, it would, Your Honor, but this Court, in cases15 like Camps Newfoundland, has recognized a significant16 distinction between cash subsidies, on the one hand,17 and tax benefits, on the other, largely because the tax18 that is reduced is a tax which does involve an exercise19 of what this Court has called "a primeval governmental20 activity," and constitutes a kind of regulation which21 brings it within the scope of the Dormant Commerce22 Clause; whereas, in -- ordinarily, a direct subsidy23 paid out of the general funds of the State does not24 involve any such regulatory impact on interstate25 commerce.441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in terms of2 discrimination and economic impact, they really are the3 same?4 MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. In fact,5 there's a wide, wide continuum. At the one end, there6 is the standard -- the pure tariff. On the other end,7 there is providing training for workers or8 infrastructure for a plant. This Court has clearly9 recognized that tariffs are unconstitutional. There is10 no suggestion that providing training or infrastructure11 would be. All of those have the same economic effect.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but they're -- what our13 opinions hold are that there are some matters of14 producing 151617 there are 181920 has the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem,21 as far as the Commerce Clause is concerned. And what22 you're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that23 effect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in24 Ohio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's25 relieving, from a tax that applies to both in-State and451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOthe same result as a cash subsidy --MR. ENRICH:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that are no good, butother matters that are perfectly okay.MR. ENRICH:  That --JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the mere fact that it￼1 out-of-State businesses, only in-State business.2 That's -- that was the Hawaii case, and all the other3 cases you cite. But what your argument here is that4 the mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the5 Commerce Clause. And I don't know --6789 a measureMR. ENRICH:  No, Your Honor --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- any case --MR. ENRICH:  -- what we're suggesting is thatwhich has the identical effect, and is10 structured very much like a provision which applies a11 tax to those businesses who engage in out-of-State12 activity, while excusing from tax those businesses that13 engage in in-State activity, is a tariff, by another14 name. And this provision, as --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Except the criterion is not16 mere in-State activity. The criterion is a particular17 in-State activity, an investment, as to which the18 credit is a quid pro quo. And the opportunity to make19 that investment is open to every business, presently20 in-State, presently out-of-State, no matter where21 domiciled.22 MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. And, in that23 respect, this is no different than, for instance, the24 Westinghouse Electric case, which granted -- which25 struck down a grant of a credit against a corporate461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 income tax that was available to any business that2 chose to locate some of its export activity in the3 State of New York. Again --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that tax did apply to5 out-of-State businesses --6 MR. ENRICH: It was --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and they got no reduction8 --9 MR. ENRICH: It was exactly --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?11 MR. ENRICH: -- the same tax as the tax in12 question here, Your Honor. It was a corporate income13 tax apportioned on the basis of the ordinary three14 factors that Ohio uses, on the basis of where the15 company's sales are located, where the company's16 payroll is located, where the company's property is17 located. The two taxes, in Westinghouse and here, were18 identical. There were some small differences in19 exactly the way that the credit was structured, but the20 underlying taxes were, in all respects, identical.21 The problem that the Court recognized in22 Westinghouse is that by giving a credit that was23 restricted to a particular kind of in-State activity,24 and not to its out-of-State counterpart, the State was25 effectively providing a benefit to in-State business471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and a burden on out-of-State business that constitutedthe functional equivalent of a tariff, and the Courtstruck it down.  Now --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Some States --Counsel, some States have homestead exemptions toproperty taxes for people when they're buying homes inthe State.  That -- those would be invalid under yourtheory?          MR. ENRICH:  Your Honor, I don't believe thatthey would be.  Again, a homesteader who buys aproperty in another State is not going to owe any taxto --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but that --          MR. ENRICH:  -- Ohio.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that person mayhave another piece of property in the -- in the otherState.          MR. ENRICH:  But --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And he's not gettingthe benefit of this, because his homestead -- he livessomewhere else.          MR. ENRICH:  Your Honor, we would suggestthat the question is whether the tax scheme in questionin the State whose provision is being challengedimposes differential burdens on two different entities481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 based on where they locate some activity. In the case2 of the homestead exemption, the State offering the3 homestead exemption is not saying, "We'll tax you if4 you locate outside the State." Perhaps some other5 State is taxing them. But, again, this Court has6 repeatedly avoided judging the legitimacy of one7 State's tax by the question of what other States did.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're two9 identical pieces of property, and they'll say -- one10 say, "You're going to be taxed at a lower rate if11 that's where you're living, if that's your homestead;12 but if you happen to live outside the State, you're going13 to get taxed at a higher rate." It would seem to be14 very similar to what you're challenging here.15 MR. ENRICH: Your Honor, maybe I'm not16 understanding your example. Are you imagining that the17 State that's offering the homestead exemption was18 imposing a tax on the property located outside the19 State?20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's imposing tax21 on property in the State at a higher rate if it's not22 the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't23 live in the State.24 MR. ENRICH: Okay. So, that is a provision25 that, I think, does raise at least some questions. It's one491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 where I think there are strong justifications outside2 of the effect on interstate commerce that very well3 might provide ample justification for it. It raises --4 and the question on which we have asked this Court to5 grant cert about the property tax exemption raises6 precisely the question of what sorts of conditions on a7 property tax exemption do, and what sorts do not,8 constitute discrimination against interstate commerce.9 I would suggest that there would be ample opportunity10 to distinguish something like the homestead provision,11 which is directed at a quite different purpose than12 encouraging in-State economic activity from --13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the same14 purpose. There's some place -- they want people to15 move in -- into the District here, for16 like Ohio wants businesses to move in.17 MR. ENRICH: I would suggest18 Commerce Clause is much more concerned19 relocate businesses than with efforts to protect20 individuals from burdens of local property taxation.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: A lot of money in building22 homes.23 MR. ENRICH: That is true, Your Honor.24 We would suggest that that raises a very25 different set of questions from the facially501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOexample, justthat thewith efforts to￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425discriminatory distinction between out-of-Statebusinesses who are subjected to the tax, in the case ofthe Ohio investment tax credit, and in-Statebusinesses, which are excused from paying that sametax, which is, again, exactly what a tariff does, YourHonor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON          ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704          MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          In the first place, this is article IIIstanding that we're talking about, not prudentialconsiderations of standing, as the Court made veryclear in Valley Forge, where a taxpayer seeks to employa Federal court to air grievances about the conduct ofGovernment or the allocation of power in the Federalsystem.  The "case and controversies" requirement ofarticle III is not met.          With respect to the issue of municipaltaxpayer standing, the Court would have to determinethat that did exist, something that has not happenedbefore, and then would piggyback onto that claim achallenge to a separate tax by a separate Governmentunder a separate claim arising out of a separate511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 transaction. The deal between DaimlerChrysler and2 Toledo was separate from the tax granted by the3 investment tax credit under the State's system.4 Respondents state, in the first page of their5 brief, that, because all of these States do these6 things, these investment tax credits have only minimal7 effect on business transactions. That's the first page8 of their brief. That's harmful to their standing,9 that's harmful to their Commerce Clause challenge.10 Ohio only taxes in-State activity. It uses a11 constitutionally appropriate apportionment formula to12 determine how much of the interstate business's13 activity is attributable to Ohio, and only taxes that.14 So that if there is a benefit given because someone15 comes to the State and builds a plant there, it may16 result, actually, in increased taxes in Ohio, because17 the plant will raise the proportion of business being18 done in Ohio. But what Ohio does not do is -- what19 this Court has held unconstitutional -- is, tax the20 out-of-State activity, or burden the out-of-State21 activity, or make interstate commerce itself more22 burdensome.23 As the Court has pointed out in questions,24 Justices have pointed out in questions, this same issue25 could be raised with respect to the State of Nevada.521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 There's no franchise tax in the State of Nevada, and2 same with other States. Some States offer accelerated3 permitting requirements or relaxed environmental rules4 or different educate -- employment standards, all5 matters of State regulation. This Court has said that6 competition between States for commerce lies at the7 heart of a free-trade society. That is what's going on8 here. States are competing with appropriate permissive9 incentives to do business within the State. This is,10 as this Court said, a laudable purpose for State11 activity.12 What the Respondents would do would13 nationalize State tax systems. You couldn't have a14 more beneficial tax system in Massachusetts than in15 Ohio, because that would provide some sort of a burden,16 under the Respondent's theory. The same with other17 regulations by States of business. We would have a18 system where this Court would be deciding -- all States19 would have to have uniform taxation, uniform systems of20 regulations, the very antithesis of federalism.21 JUSTICE BREYER: If you have --22 MR. OLSON: Now, what I would --23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- dog license -- dog24 license costs $10, but you have to pay 20 if you invest25 next time in Wisconsin.531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425[Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  By the way, we're not goingto do it that way, we're just going to say you payhalf.          MR. OLSON:  If you have your dog inWisconsin, you may pay whatever --          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.          MR. OLSON:  -- Wisconsin decides --          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  But, you see -- but mypoint is --          MR. OLSON:  If --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- separate tax in Ohio, andwe're going to double it, though, if your nextinvestment is in some --          MR. OLSON:  That would be --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- other State.          MR. OLSON:  That would be something thisCourt would be severely concerned with.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct.  Now, all we do is,we say, "We're not going to double it.  You're going topay the same.  But everybody invests here, pays half."          MR. OLSON:  Well, again, that's -- and Ithink that goes to Justice Souter's point, that there'sa relationship between the tax system and theinvestment.541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          We should end on the point that every --virtually every State has this kind of system, not justbecause of competition with States, but to find theright location, a depressed area within a State.  Andthis is important with respect to businesses in theUnited States competing with foreign countries.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't believe inharmonization, Mr. Olson?[Laughter.]          MR. OLSON:  We don't believe that the DormantCommerce Clause stands the -- stands for theproposition that these regulations should benationalized.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          The case is submitted.          [Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40055Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
