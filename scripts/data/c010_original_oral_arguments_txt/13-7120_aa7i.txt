United States.      Ms. Menendez.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. MENENDEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Mere possession of a short­barreled shotgunis not a violent felony within the definition of theArmed Career Criminal Act's residual clause because itis neither similar in the degree of risk nor similar inkind to the enumerated offenses set forth in thelanguage that immediately precedes that clause.  Andthis Court has repeatedly held that those enumeratedoffenses provide important both qualitative andquantitative parameters to lower courts in examiningwhether a particular predicate offense counts as aviolent felony.      Just 6 years ago in Begay, this Court madeclear that the enumerated offenses must be similar ­­I'm sorry, a question predicate offense must be similarin kind to one of the enumerated offenses as well as3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 similar in degree of risk. And when that proper2 framework is applied to the question of mere possession3 of a short­barreled shotgun, it satisfies neither test.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Should the Court ­­5 should the Court take into account that in the6 sentencing guidelines a possession of a short­barreled7 shotgun is ranked under career, is under the career8 offenses?9 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, in Guideline10 Amendment 674 in 2004, which Your Honor asks about, the11 Sentencing Commission included mere possession of an12 unregistered short­barreled shotgun or possession of a13 short­barreled shotgun as a crime of violence. But it14 did not do so after an examination of the empirical data15 or an assessment of the pool of data that gives us great16 confidence in the Sentencing Commission's decisions.17 In marked contrast, Your Honor, in 1991,18 when the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 43319 that concluded that being a felon in possession of a20 firearm should not count as a crime of violence under21 the guidelines, it reached that conclusion after an22 extensive examination of empirical data. The difference23 between the adoption of those two amendments highlights24 the reason that the Sentencing Commission's decision on25 this point does not deserve deference in this case.4Alderson Reporting Company11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 JUSTICE ALITO:13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14 JUSTICE ALITO:    Is it ­­Is it possible ­­    I'm sorry.Is it possible for anyOfficial￼1 An additional consideration, Your Honor, is2 that in making that decision in 2004, the Sentencing3 Commission was not anticipating the guidance that this4 Court provided in James, Begay, Chambers, and Sykes, and5 it doesn't engage in any of the proper analysis. So6 whether we look at it as the Sentencing Commission not7 serving their traditional role as factfinders and the8 keepers of empirical data or whether we acknowledge the9 fact that it preceded very important guidance from this10 Court, I don't think it controls this Court's decision.15 possession offense to qualify as a violent felony?16 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I believe it17 would be possible for a very rare possession offense to18 qualify as a violent felony if the possession alone19 presents a serious potential risk of injury.20 Respectfully, I believe the flaw with the other side's21 position in this case is their entire analysis is based22 not on the risk inherent in the mere possession, but on23 the risk inherent in committing a further violent crime24 with that weapon. And so I believe that any mere25 possession of a firearm, including a short­barreled5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 firearm, is not going to satisfy the definition.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if I understand the3 government's argument, it's that there's a very strong4 correlation between possession in this case and use for5 criminal purposes of a kind that clearly would pose a6 risk of ­­ of violent conduct and injury. So are you7 saying that we never can take that kind of correlation8 into account, that possession crimes just have to be9 treated in a box, and we can't think about whether the10 possession of something increases the risk of use which11 then will pose a serious risk of injury?12 MS. MENENDEZ: Your ­­ Your Honor, my13 response is twofold. First, although the government has14 asserted that correlation, they have not substantiated15 it in any way. And there's no data before the Court16 that supports the claim that merely possessing a17 short­barreled shotgun is somehow connected with18 frequent or even regular use.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: So ­­ so that seems right,20 that it's a question to pose to the government. It's21 like, what's in back of this correlation? But is your22 argument, then, they haven't made their empirical case23 or even if they had lots of statistics, it still24 wouldn't be enough?25 MS. MENENDEZ: And that is correct, Your6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Honor. I think even if they had made the empirical2 case, it wouldn't be enough. And here's why.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: is there any other4 use for a short­barreled shotgun?5 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, as many as 40,0006 Americans have purchased these weapons legally,7 registered them lawfully and have found that they serve8 some purpose. Whether that purpose is in hunting for a9 person of a smaller stature or home defense, the10 question before the Court is not whether there is some11 reason to have them. Many people believe there is. The12 question is whether merely possessing such a weapon is a13 violent felony. And with due respect, Your Honor, I14 don't think there's any support for the assertion that15 these are somehow uniquely more dangerous.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: People have purchased this17 even though it's criminal to possess it?18 MS. MENENDEZ: It is not, Your Honor. In19 fact, it's fully lawful to possess a short­barreled20 shotgun in many States as long as it's registered21 federally, somebody passes a background check, and pays22 a $200 tax. And the government's own statistics23 document, Your Honor, that as many as tens of thousands24 of Americans have followed those processes in order to25 legally purchase or own one of these weapons. And, in7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 fact, I was surprised in doing the research for this2 case that you can get these on line in States where3 their possession is legal as long as you comply with the4 Federal regulations.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many States is it6 illegal, do you remember?7 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I believe there's8 10 States that outright ban possession regardless of9 compliance with Federal regulations. And then in the10 remainder of the States, the question is whether, if its11 possession is legal in compliance with either State12 registrations or always in compliance with the Federal13 registrations.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just a factual question.15 On his plea for this possession, was he charged with16 another crime?17 MS. MENENDEZ: Yes, he was, Your Honor. He18 was charged with a ­­ a marijuana­related crime. And19 both of those were pleaded guilty to with Alford pleas,20 Your Honor.21 Your Honor, I think the question is how much22 speculation is permitted. And as Your Honor correctly23 points out, it is our position that even if the24 government brought forth better data, that still25 wouldn't justify allowing mere possession to count as a8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 crime of violence. The reason, I think, is inherent in2 this Court's jurisprudence from James, Begay, and the3 other cases. We have to begin this with a consideration4 of the elements. In fact, in the James case ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO: But you said that a6 possession offense could qualify. So if someone7 possesses a nuclear bomb, that could qualify?8 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I think that9 might be ­­10 JUSTICE ALITO:11 weapon, that could qualify?12 MS. MENENDEZ: And I think that is the13 precise thing that could qualify. And here is why, with14 due respect, Your Honor. Possessing a biological or a15 chemical agent, by itself, presents a substantial risk,16 just alone, even if it's under your bed.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do we know that?18 You ­­ you could make the same argument that you've just19 made, that we don't know what the ­­ the risk is that20 this will, in the case of a biological weapon, the risk21 that it will cause an infection unintentionally. We22 don't know that. That statistic is no more available23 than the statistic on sawed­off shotguns, is it?24 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I suspect that we25 would be better able to document the certainty that even9Alderson Reporting CompanyA biological or chemical      JUSTICE ALITO:thing about any weapon.      MS.

MENENDEZ: Your Honor, that ­­ that might be appropriate, or perhaps the science alone. But that demonstrates the difference with this. This is no more dangerous than any other firearm if it's kept in a locked gun safe, kept in a closet, kept under a mattress, under a bed or any of the other myriad places. We've highlighted for the Court 14 different cases on page 14 of our reply brief where such a weapon was found in completely nonviolent circumstances, somewhere in a home or even in a trunk, in a locked gun safe.possession does not pose the kind of substantial risk10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that this statute is talking about. I think that when2 we get into the very, I'm sure, hypothetical instance of3 the bomb that's inherently dangerous, like a biological4 agent, that might be different even untouched, Your5 Honor.6 JUSTICE ALITO: Rockets would not be ­­7 illegal possession of a rocket, that wouldn't be a8 violent felony in your submission. Maybe that's right.9 MS. MENENDEZ:10 Your Honor.11 JUSTICE ALITO:12 MS. MENENDEZ:13 in a crime of violence or in any other circumstance14 would be. And, in fact, Your Honor, I think that in15 many of these cases, for instance possession of a16 biological agent or a nuclear weapon, the person would17 likely be charged with some sort of terrorism offense,18 which would, by itself, trigger the Armed Career19 Criminal Act if they were free to go on and commit20 future crimes, which I ­­ I somewhat doubt.21 In this case, though, I think there's22 nothing different about mere possession of a23 short­barreled shotgun as compared to other firearms24 that could be simply possessed. They are simply not25 enough.11Alderson Reporting CompanyI believe that's correct, That's correct.I believe that using a rocketOfficial￼1 Your Honors, this Court's jurisprudence2 clearly requires a categorical assessment of the3 question, not an imagining of what further crimes could4 ever happen as a result of the offense, but a looking at5 what comes from the elements itself. I'd encourage the6 Court to remember its decision in James. In James, the7 Court first examined the elements of the burglary, the8 attempted burglary statute in question, and noted that9 mere possession of burglary tools was not enough to10 constitute a violation of that attempted burglary11 statute. And in part, because an overt act toward12 entry, which presented the same sort of risk as the13 burglary itself was present, the Court found that that14 could present a risk sufficient to trigger the residual15 clause.16 This is very different.17 like mere possession of the burglary18 not be enough, than it is completing19 act.20 Your Honor, the government uses the Court's21 language of ordinary case to invite this Court to engage22 in substantial speculation about someone ­­ what someone23 might do with a short­barreled shotgun. And with due24 respect, I don't believe that was the purpose of the25 ordinary case doctrine whatsoever. In fact, in James,12Alderson Reporting CompanyThis is much moretools, which wouldan additional overtOfficial￼1 the ordinary case doctrine was borne not to enable2 rampant and creative speculation, but to limit rampant3 and creative speculation.4 JUSTICE BREYER: But what you have ­­ what5 were the numbers, if they're there, about how many6 people are injured as a result of possession of a7 short­barreled shotgun?8 MS. MENENDEZ:9 JUSTICE BREYER:10 idea?11 MS. MENENDEZ:12 statistics that demonstrate, Your Honor, a correlation13 between mere possession of a short­barreled shotgun14 and ­­15 JUSTICE BREYER: That's not what I'm16 thinking of. I'm thinking of do we have a statistic17 that says how many people are injured, forgetting how ­­18 whether it's possession or not possession or anything19 else?20 MS. MENENDEZ: We don't have that, either,21 Your Honor. We do have statistics offered both in our22 brief and some reference in opposing counsel's brief23 about how short­barreled shotguns are at most a de24 minimis, de minimis percentage of harm from weapons in25 general across the country, but that doesn't answer Your13Alderson Reporting CompanyThere are no statistics.  So we have absolutely noWe have ­­ we have noOfficial￼1 Honor's question. And Your Honor, I think that that is2 precisely why the Begay formulation remains very3 important in this case.4 This case, unlike Sykes, which had an ample5 amount of data, although I think we could discuss at6 length how useful that data is and how much data can be7 manipulated, but there was a great deal of data8 documenting deaths and injuries. And therefore, this9 Court found that the examination of the nature of the10 offense and whether it was purposeful, violent or11 aggressive was redundant. That's not the case here,12 Your Honor, because we don't have the statistical13 analysis to make the risk assessment easy.14 I do think, though, that common sense weighs15 heavily in favor of Mr. Johnson. And that is, as Your16 Honor indicated in the Doe opinion many years ago on the17 First Circuit, that merely possessing something is a18 very far cry from using it in a crime. And the19 government's entire analysis requires this Court to20 assume that these weapons are most commonly possessed21 only for the purpose of being used in a crime. That's22 simply not supported by the data, and it's not even23 supported by the case law provided by the government.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Do we know25 how many possession crimes have been prosecuted,14Alderson Reporting Company25 Criminal Act.Official￼1 possession for short­barreled shotguns?2 MS. MENENDEZ: I don't have that statistic,3 I apologize, Your Honor. I can say that, having been an4 assistant Federal defender for quite a long time, we5 don't see these very commonly, but we do see people6 prosecuted for possessing a short­barreled shotgun7 that's not federally registered. It's not an incredibly8 frequent crime.9 However, this has greater implications,10 obviously, Your Honor, because approximately 600 people11 every year suffer the greater penalties of the Armed12 Career Criminal Act as a result of enhancements such as13 this.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:15 It's about 600 a year?16 MS. MENENDEZ:17 more or less, Your Honor.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:19 talking about 35,000 people or 40,000 who own the20 shotguns legally.21 MS. MENENDEZ: Oh, I apologize, Your Honor.22 I ­­ I provided Your Honor an incorrect statistic. I'm23 talking about people whose current conviction is for24 felon in possession, triggering the Armed Career15Alderson Reporting CompanyThat's what I mean.More or less.  So we're600 ACCA cases each year,Official￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see what you mean.2 MS. MENENDEZ: I apologize. I ­­ I do not3 know how many people nationwide are prosecuted for4 violation of one of the several States that outright5 bans these or for violating some other portion. I do6 know that they're not very common in the State of7 Minnesota, which is where our statute arises.8 Your Honors, it's also important to keep in9 mind that in Minnesota as well as almost every place10 else that this is criminalized or criminalized if not11 properly registered, that constructive possession of the12 weapon alone is enough to make somebody guilty. This13 doesn't have to be on or near their person. It14 certainly need not be used in a crime or possessed with15 the intent to use it in a future crime. And, in fact,16 some of the cases that we've proffered to the Court17 involve possessing this in nothing more than a locked18 gun case. That is simply not the sort of active,19 purposeful, violent and aggressive or risky conduct that20 the Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause is21 designed to apply to.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: When you say "constructive23 possession," what does that mean?24 MS. MENENDEZ: That means where you don't25 have an item directly on your person, Your Honor, but16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 you have the intent, at least in the Eighth Circuit,2 it's the intent to exercise dominion and control and the3 power to do so. So, for instance, I have constructive4 possession of the items in my briefcase, even though I5 don't have them with me and I have constructive6 possession of items in my home, even though that's back7 in Minnesota. And so that demonstrates, Your Honor, the8 broad application of mere possession crimes and how far9 removed they can be from the parade of horribles, with10 due respect, that the government suggests these are11 inherently intrinsically tied to.12 Your Honor, I'd also invite the Court to13 examine closely the cases cited by opposing counsel in14 their brief, because while they do cite 16 cases in15 their brief in which mere ­­ I'm sorry, in which16 short­barreled shotguns were used in violent crimes,17 it's important for the Court to note that in only two of18 those cases was there actually a conviction for a19 weapons offense or mere possession of a weapon. So in20 only two of those cases was the prior offense actually21 before the Court today even being considered.22 In the other 14, and indeed also in those23 two, the person was convicted of the far more serious24 crime of violence that the weapon was used during,25 ranging from assault to capital murder. And as Justice17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Gruender, in his dissent in the Vincent case in the2 Eighth Circuit made very clear, in such a case, that3 much more serious offense would readily trigger4 application of the Armed Career Criminal Act and we5 wouldn't need to resort to the overinclusive6 interpretation proffered by the Government.7 JUSTICE ALITO: What are ­­ what do you8 think is the basis for a State legislature's prohibiting9 the possession of a short­barreled shotgun or a10 short­barreled shotgun that is not properly registered?11 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I can't say what12 all the State legislatures' bases were, although I would13 note that Michigan just last year changed its mind and14 made these lawful. But I think that many State15 legislatures, and indeed Congress in 1934 when it16 decided to regulate these weapons, were persuaded by at17 least the reputation of this gun, that it was associated18 with gangster activity in the Prohibition era.19 With due respect, although I am not at all20 disagreeing that States are within their rights to ban21 possession of this weapon, that reputation is somewhat22 dated, and in fact today, you can get far more lethal23 and far more intimidating weapons without even24 triggering the application.25 JUSTICE ALITO:18Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, do you think thatOfficial￼1 those State legislatures came to the conclusion that2 there was a strong correlation between the possession of3 a short­barreled shotgun and the use of that weapon in4 committing crimes?5 MS. MENENDEZ: I think they may have come to6 that conclusion. I'm unaware of them doing so based on7 data, Your Honor, including the Minnesota Act. I am8 unaware of even the National Firearms Act, when it was9 adopted in 1934, relying on actual statistics about the10 danger presented by this weapon ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO:12 MS. MENENDEZ::13 JUSTICE ALITO:14 when it listed the specifically enumerated offenses in15 the Armed Career Criminal Act? Is this the sort of16 thing with respect to which it is reasonable to expect17 that there will be empirical evidence, or is this the18 sort of thing, the sort of decision that legislatures19 make based in ­­ on an impressionistic way and taking20 into account common sense?21 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I don't know22 whether Congress, when it passed the residual clause,23 assumed that we would come to such statistical analysis24 of the ­­25 JUSTICE ALITO:19Alderson Reporting CompanyDo you think Congress ­­­­ as opposed to ­­­­ had statistics before itWell, when they saidOfficial￼1 burglary is a violent offense, do you think they had2 statistics about the percentage of all burglar ­­ of all3 burglaries that occur within the United States that4 result in violence?5 MS. MENENDEZ: I don't believe so, Your6 Honor. I think burglary motivated the Armed Career7 Criminal Act in the first place. Burglary and robbery8 seem to be the two ­­ the two predicate offenses that9 most specifically the court ­­ I mean, I'm sorry,10 Congress intended to include as triggering prior11 offenses. Why? I think it's because they had the12 belief that an armed burglar would be more dangerous13 than an unarmed burglar and wanted to capture people who14 were repeat and persistent property offenders who would15 then later possess a gun.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that is a17 reasonable conclusion for the national legislature to18 reach in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, why is19 it not equally defensible for a State legislature to20 make the same decision with respect to the illegal21 possession of a sawed­off shotgun?22 MS. MENENDEZ: It's absolutely appropriate23 for them to make that decision. That should not control24 this Court's decision about whether merely possessing25 that unlawful weapon is a violent felony. That decision20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 has to be governed by the residual clause language, and2 it doesn't satisfy ­­3 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that that4 judgment on the part of legislature is entitled to any5 respect from this Court?6 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, certainly it7 matters that some legislatures have chosen to ban it,8 but I think it matters even more that most legislatures9 and the United States Congress do not outlaw this10 weapon. They permit it to be possessed when lawfully11 registered. And even in 19 ­­12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's what I'm13 talking about, the cases where it is possessed14 illegally, either because it is flatly banned or that it15 is possessed by somebody who will not register it for16 whatever reason, very possibly because that person17 doesn't want it known that he or she possesses the18 weapon.19 MS. MENENDEZ: Certainly, Your Honor. Or20 because they're unaware of the registration requirement,21 which in almost every State will nonetheless make it a22 criminal conduct, or because they're unaware of the23 characteristics of the weapon that require it to be24 registered, which in some States doesn't protect one25 from the conviction.21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Your Honor, I think it's important, if we're2 using the opinion of legislatures and Congress to help3 us determine whether this is a violent felony, it's4 important to recognize that it is widely legal.5 But you are right that the question before6 the Court is the unlawful possession and whether7 unlawful possession of a firearm is a violent felony.8 JUSTICE BREYER: What should we do if we9 think that the reason that the legislature has made10 possession unlawful is because the legislature believes11 that possession will lead to a risk of physical injury?12 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I don't think13 that answers the question. I think the question has to14 be grounded in the residual clause, and the residual15 clause requires not just the possibility of future16 injury, but that the offense itself, when examined17 categorically and based on its element, creates a18 substantial ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it says ­­ it says if20 I use those words, I could repeat the same question and21 say the reason that the legislature makes it unlawful to22 possess a sawed­off shotgun is because the legislature23 believes that the possession, that's the crime, presents24 a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.25 That's why they made it unlawful. What other reason22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼ 1   could there have been?  And therefore, their judgment is 2   the same words that the statute uses, but for the word3 otherwise.4 MS. MENENDEZ: Your Honor, I ­­ I ­­ I don't 5   think there's any suggestion that either the Minnesota 6   legislature or the other minority legislatures that have 7   reached that conclusion did so based on an understanding ­­8 JUSTICE BREYER: What other reason would 9   they have had for making possession unlawful?10 MS. MENENDEZ: Because I think there's a11   strong belief that firearms in general are unlawful,12   that certain types of fire are ­­ are dangerous, that13   certain types of firearms are more dangerous than14   others, and that's appropriate.

I23   want to know what your answer is.JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm just saying what other reason could they have had for making this a crime, the possession ­­MS. MENENDEZ: Perhaps ­­JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ unless they thought that possession presents a serious potential risk of physical24 MS. MENENDEZ: Perhaps they were, in fact, 25 adopting a different standard which is: We, as the23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Minnesota legislature, hypothetically, are going to ban2 this weapon because we believe that it is somewhat more3 dangerous than other weapons, and we would prefer it is4 not possessed. I don't think we can assume that they5 went this far, and this is the question the Court has to6 answer.7 Also, Your Honor, the Michigan legislature,8 for instance, obviously disagreed when they recently9 changed their law to no longer prohibit mere possession10 of a short­barreled shotgun.11 I do think it is a recognition, Your Honor,12 that legislatures think these are dangerous weapons, and13 they are dangerous weapons, but that does not make their14 mere possession violative of the residual clause of the15 Armed Career Criminal Act. I think it's very important16 in every case that we tie the examination not to a17 possible thing that could be done with the gun in the18 future, but to the actual risk presented by mere19 possession. In the same way that in the James case the20 Court was motivated by the fact that something more than21 mere possession of burglary tools was required, here22 something more than mere possession of the weapon should23 be required.24 We would be having a much different25 conversation if we were talking about a different part24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of Section 924 of Title 18, 924(c), which penalizes2 using a weapon, even a short­barreled shotgun, during a3 crime of violence. That could certainly be a violent4 felony. But the mere possession ­­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You pointed out in your6 brief that explosives ­­ one of the enumerated crimes is7 use of explosives, but is no ­­ anywhere a crime of8 possession.9 MS. MENENDEZ: That's correct, Your Honor,10 and I'm glad you reminded me because that was an11 important point for me to make, is that when we look at12 these enumerated offenses as providing guidance for the13 residual clause, it is very important that Congress14 adopted use of explosives rather than possession. And15 in fact, in the legislative history, in 1986, they gave16 examples of the sorts of things they believed would be17 included by that provision, and it was not mere18 possession of explosives.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Has any legislature20 prohibited the possession of explosives?21 MS. MENENDEZ: I am sure that some have,22 using certain language.23 JUSTICE ALITO: They just flatly prohibited,24 within our State, you cannot possess any explosives.25 Has any legislature done that?25Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. MENENDEZ: I'm not aware of that, Your Honor. I apologize, I don't know. I'm sure ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think it's a possibility that there are States in which explosives cannot be used for demolition purposes?MS. MENENDEZ: No, I don't think that's likely, Your Honor. But nonetheless, Your Honor, when Congress was adopting this language, they chose to put "use of" prior to the term "explosives." If they wanted it to be more inclusive, they could have certainly made it more inclusive. They did not. In fact, the examples given were the use of explosives to destroy energy facilities or transportation facilities.I see that I ­­ will reserve the rest of mytime for rebuttal, if I might. Thank you, Your Honors. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Bash.      ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN F. BASHON BEHALF OF UNITED STATESMR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The ordinary case of possession of asawed­off shotgun is possession in connection withserious criminal activity.  That is the judgment thatCongress, State legislatures, this Court in Miller and26Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Heller, and lower courts have reached for 8 decades.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If that's the case, how3 many charges do you have that are for mere possession,4 not involved with an underlying crime?5 MR. BASH: Most of these charges are brought6 at the State level, so I don't have sort of the7 comprehensive statistics. But what I will point out is8 that Petitioner has now had two briefs to come forward9 with examples of law­abiding citizens just kind of10 caught up in this sawed­off shotgun regime.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She raises 14 cases in12 her reply brief.13 MR. BASH: If you look at all of those14 cases, Your Honor, the vast majority of them, both cited15 in the opening brief and in the reply brief, involved16 people involved in other very serious criminal activity,17 meth dealing, sexual abuse, assaults. So those cases18 only verify what I think has been this Court's judgment19 in Heller and Miller, Congress's judgment, the judgment20 of State legislatures for a long time, that these are21 exclusively used for unlawful purposes.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why haven't they been23 outlawed federally and why is it only a minority of24 States that have outlawed their ­­ just their25 possession, not their registration?27Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. BASH: Because I think what the National2 Firearm Act reflects, and this was reflected in Attorney3 General Cummings' arguments in favor of the law when it4 was under consideration, is that if you're willing to5 disclose your fingerprints and photograph to the Federal6 Government and undergo a background check ­­ that's only7 by regulation, but undergo a background check, it8 dissipates the chance that you're going to be involved9 in crimes.10 Gang members, terrorists, and bank robbers11 do not go around disclosing their fingerprints and12 photograph to the government. So there are some13 atypical gun collections who build collection of, I14 think, rare firearms, and those are the sorts of15 applications the ATF sees.16 But I just want to emphasize the point17 about, sort of, how many of these things are lawfully18 registered. We made a good faith attempt at an estimate19 in our brief, and it's 140,000 lawfully registered ever.20 It appears that the vast majority of those are to law21 enforcement agencies or to the manufacturers themselves.22 Just by way of comparison, the Congressional23 Research Service put out a gun control analysis in 201224 that estimated that there are currently 82 million25 shotguns of all varieties, either in private hands or28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 available for purchase by private citizens. So the2 number of ­­ whether it's 40,000, 50,000 ever, is a3 vanishingly small number of sawed­off shotguns that have4 been lawfully registered. I think ­­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG:6 one of these briefs that7 these weapons are lawful8 for use in self­defense?9 MR. BASH: There is something like that in      Wasn't there something ina manufacturer in States wherehas advertised them as ideal10 one of the briefs. I don't think a manufacturer's, sort11 of, market strategy should govern the analysis. It12 certainly shouldn't refute this Court's judgment,13 Congress's judgment, the judgment of State legislatures14 for decades, that these weapons have no lawful uses.15 And I am not aware of, for example, a spike in16 applications for registrations for sawed­off shotguns to17 the ATF, which you might expect to see if these weapons18 were suddenly being in common use for self­defense.19 I just wanted to address a point that I20 think Justice Kagan raised with my friend, which was,21 are we, sort of, solely relying on a correlative22 relationship between the enumerated offense and the23 potential for violence. I think it's a great deal more24 than a correlative relationship. I think it's actually25 precisely the same relationship between the crime and29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the potential for violence present for burglary,2 attempted burglary, extortion, which is to say this:3 The enumerated crime enables the potential for violence4 in a but­for causal sense, but the offender has to take5 an additional act of volition to bring the violence to6 fruition.7 So, for example, with a burglary or an8 attempted burglary, a burglar could say, if I'm9 confronted by a homeowner or police officer, I am going10 to flee. I am not going to attack anybody or I am going11 to give up. The burglary enables that confrontation to12 occur, but the offender has to take an additional act of13 volition to actually bring violence to fruition.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: I would think the analogy to15 that is the person who uses the sawed­off shotgun in a16 crime, but decides: I'm not going to shoot it. And17 then you say: It doesn't really matter if you're not18 going to shoot it; you just used it in a criminal19 activity, that's enough for us.20 But this is a good deal more attenuated than21 that because this person could, for whatever reason,22 maybe because he wants to commit a crime in the future23 or maybe he's one of the odd collectors or people who24 think that this is good for self­defense, this person25 could have kept it in a locked closet, in a safe deposit30Alderson Reporting Company9 that. It's what this Court10 short­barreled shotguns are11 abiding citizens for lawful12 JUSTICE KAGAN:said in Heller when it saidnot typically used by lawpurposes.But they are two separateof this gun and use of thisthe one into the other forOfficial￼1 box, and never have brought it out and never have any2 potential for use in a crime. I mean, it would be one3 thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of4 serious injury, but this is a step further.5 MR. BASH: I agree that a necessary premise6 of our argument is that the ordinary case of possession7 is possession in connection with crimes. So if you8 don't buy that, we're in trouble. But you should buy13 offenses, right, possession14 gun. And you're converting15 purposes of ACCA.16 MR. BASH: And that makes total sense, and17 let me explain why. If it wasn't like that, clause 2 of18 the definition of violent felony ­­ it's at 11a of our19 statutory appendix ­­ would do no work. The whole point20 of that clause is to capture situations that were21 pregnant with the possibility of violence but where the22 apprehender was offended before the violence occurred.23 If an offender used a firearm against somebody, he would24 be squarely within clause 1, which is the use of force25 or the threatened or attempted use of force against31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 somebody.2 The whole point of clause 2 is when you3 catch someone who put themselves in the position to do4 violence but the violence didn't materialize on that5 occasion, they still fall within clause 2, and that6 makes sense because that sort of behavior is reflective7 of the armed career criminal. I mean, this is the8 weapon of choice historically, along with machine guns,9 of the armed career criminal. So it would be kind of10 odd if the illegal possession of this weapon didn't11 satisfy ­­ didn't count as a predicate under the Armed12 Career Criminal Act.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think the same would14 be true of a felon in possession?15 MR. BASH: No, and I think that's an16 important difference. I think the felon in possession17 statute reflects a slightly different judgment. It's18 the judgment that someone who has committed a felony,19 whether it's a violent felony or, you know, bank fraud20 or something, has revealed themselves to be an21 irresponsible person who can't be trusted with a22 firearm. I think in that sense, it's more prophylactic23 in nature, but you certainly don't have ­­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: I would think that in the25 felon ­­ a felon in possession law, I mean, honestly,32Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 I'm sure the numbers dwarf the sawed­off shotguns, and2 the whole point of that is, yes, they're people who have3 shown themselves to be irresponsible, who have shown4 themselves perhaps to use weapons irresponsibly, and5 they're going to do it again, and there's a pretty6 strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that makes7 Congress pass that law.8 MR. BASH: I think that's an accurate9 description of felon in possession, but there are,10 nevertheless, felons who legitimately want a handgun,11 which has been in common use for decades, for12 self­defense or for target practice or whatever.13 The judgment that this Court has rendered14 and that Congress has rendered is that these weapons do15 not have other purposes in the ordinary case, and I16 think that distinguishes really a sawed­off shotgun17 offense almost from any other ­­18 JUSTICE BREYER: Where did Congress say19 that? Where? Where? I mean, a felon in possession has20 a gun, and you say he might keep it upstairs in his21 closet, in the back of a car, in his hand, many places22 he might possess it, and he might never use it for a23 crime. Recognizing that, you say that doesn't fall24 within the statute. Just substitute the words25 "sawed­off shotgun." In the closet, back of a car,33Alderson Reporting Company20 MR. BASH:21 unlawful possession of22 (Laughter.)23 JUSTICE BREYER:24 to say that, and all I25 lack of knowledge of which is which, and therefore I34Official￼1 glass case, maybe in his hand, maybe in somebody else's2 hand. Maybe he just says to somebody: I have a3 sawed­off shotgun up there; give me your money.4 All right? All those things are possible5 with either. And so since they're possible with either,6 on what basis do we write an opinion that says that you7 win with the sawed­off shotgun, but you lose with almost8 every other kind of gun. What's our theory? What lines9 would there be in that opinion?10 MR. BASH: Here's the line. When you have a11 firearm that has historically been exclusively12 associated with violence, unlike a handgun, but just13 like a sawed­off shotgun ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER:15 there for a second, because16 40,000 or more people in 1017 even make it unlawful. So how can we say it's more18 associated with crime than, what, a handgun or a19 regular ­­ or a torpedo? I don't know. My goodness, stop rightwhat we heard was there areStates and others that don'tI think we would contend thata torpedo ­­      I realized you were goingput that in was to express my ownAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 can't just speak ex cathedra and say this. I would have2 to have some proof.3 MR. BASH: I understand the uncertainty in a4 case without empirical data. It was the same5 uncertainty that the Court had in James, where it said6 we don't have empirical data to make the judgment. And7 in both James and Sykes, the Court said at the end of8 the day in some of these ACCA cases we need to rely on9 our common sense judgment. But here I think what I hope10 would be the Court's common sense judgment ­­11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't ­­ I mean,12 I've seen a lot of movies. James Cagney used to, but I13 can't use that.14 MR. BASH: Well, let me just say ­­ let me15 just say where I ­­ where I think you can ground the16 common sense judgment. We've set forward in the brief17 Federal statutes, State statutes, the legislative18 history, Senate and House reports saying these weapons19 are exclusively associated with lawbreaking and crime.20 There is a history of that. That's why they've been21 regulated. And I think, to go to a colloquy that my22 colleague was having with one of the members of the23 bench, the judgment of State legislatures and the24 Federal Congress is not something sort of to be cast25 away as the product of superstition. State legislators,35Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Congresspeople, talk with their constituents, they speakwith law enforcement agencies.  They exercise reasonablejudgment based on the facts on the ground when theyenact laws like this.      And I don't think it can be really disputed,as Justice Alito was alluding to earlier, that thoselegislatures have made a judgment that these weapons areexclusively associated with crime.  And I think that's amuch better factual record ­­JUSTICE BREYER: We couldn't say the same thing with a Saturday night special?      MR. BASH:with the term.      JUSTICE BREYER:Saturday night specialreally used very, veryI don't know.  I'm not familiar      They used to be.

They were viewed ­­ that was one of the firstthings that people tried to get banned afterassassinations and so forth.MR. BASH: I'm not saying that our argument couldn't apply to any other weapons. I imagine we'd have a similar case on unlawful possession of machine guns, for example.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:JUSTICE BREYER:   How many ­­No, no.  This isn't a36Alderson Reporting Company1 machine gun. It's a pistol, a handgun.Official￼23 don't 456 think7 judicial consensus over decades that these are8 exclusively used in crimes.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we ­­ but we10 know that's not true. We know there are 40,00011 registered that by ­­ and, you know, and you yourself I12 think said or ­­ that if you're willing to give your13 photograph and fingerprint or whatever to the Federal14 Government, you're probably not going to use it15 illegally. So we know it's not true that these are16 exclusively used in criminal activity.17 MR. BASH: Well, I think there's two points18 in that. One was the point I was alluding to earlier,19 which is not only that Congress thinks sort of this20 process ameliorates the ­­ the normal effect of21 possession of a sawed­off shotgun and that these are22 actually registered in extraordinarily small numbers23 relative to total gun population.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what number25 would be enough? I mean if we had 100,00037MR. BASH: We'd have to do the work. I mean to cut off ­­JUSTICE BREYER: No.MR. BASH: We'd have to do the work. Here Iwe have done the work.  We have a legislative andAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 registrations, does that mean that it's no longer2 conduct that presents a serious potential risk?3 MR. BASH: I'm not sure. I want to give you4 two answers to that question. I mean, the first is5 that, as this Court said in James, the relevant data6 point is convictions. So there's no convictions for7 lawful possession of a sawed­off shotgun. The relevant8 data point is how many convictions for unlawful9 possession are associated with otherwise nonviolent10 activity, and Petitioner hasn't really pointed to any11 cases of sort of law­abiding citizens using them for12 other reasons.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then ­­ then14 is possession, possession of explosives, an offense15 under this enhancement provision?16 MR. BASH: I think we'd run the same17 analysis, and we talk about this at pages 47 to 48 of18 our brief, which is to say explosives regulated by the19 NFA, which are defined to be explosives designed as20 weapons, yes, it's pretty much the same analysis we'd21 run through which ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the23 statute ­­ even though the statute says use of24 explosives is covered?25 MR. BASH: And I don't think ­­38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You'd say, well,2 under the catch­all phrase, mere possession is covered.3 MR. BASH: No. And there's no redundancy,4 because ­­ maybe we explained this unclearly. What we5 tried to explain is that the use of explosives would6 encompass a felony conviction for the use of any7 explosives. So there are felony convictions for the use8 of TNT or dynamite, explosives that are not inherently9 dangerous in character, but could be used unlawfully.10 The possession offense under the reasoning11 that we've set forth in the brief would apply to12 weaponized explosives, those regulated under the NFA13 because they're designed as ­­ as weapons, napalm and14 things like that, not to the unlawful possession of TNT,15 even though the unlawful use of TNT would fall under the16 use of explosives statute provided as a felony. So I17 don't think there's any redundancy created there.18 And I guess just to wrap up this colloquy, I19 think it's possible to imagine an alternative universe20 where sawed­off shotguns developed as self­defense21 weapons in ordinary use. In that case, the ordinary22 case analysis would look very different. You would say,23 well, maybe there are some people who unlawfully acquire24 these, just like some people unlawfully acquire handguns25 for self­defense. But this Court has never recognized this,39Alderson Reporting Company21 MR. BASH:22 exact same connection.23 see it with extortion,24 to burglary. When you25 narrowly, as Justice Scalia would have defined it in40Official￼1 this Court said very clearly in Heller in2 distinguishing Miller, that these are not in lawful use3 by law­abiding citizens.4 That's not the way the real world looks. In5 the real world these are unlawfully possessed for use in6 crime. And once you accept that proposition, the final7 step of our analysis is that when these items are8 brought to crimes, it seriously increases the chance9 that someone is going to be killed or wounded. We've10 set forth the characteristics of the weapon and the sort11 of damage they do. I won't repeat that. But I don't12 even really hear Petitioner to dispute that in the13 ordinary case, when the ­­ in what we call the ordinary14 case, when these are brought to crimes, they massively15 increase the chance ­­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a17 second step, unlike the others. When you're engaged in18 a burglary, the ­­ the risk is there. When it's mere19 possession, the risk isn't there. You have to take an20 additional step of taking it and using it in a crime.And I think burglary has the Burglar ­­ maybe it's easier tobut the same analysis would apply­­ extortion, as defined mostAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 James to be a threat of violence to person or property,2 that itself does not create the possibility of violence.3 It's only if the extortionist is willing to follow4 through on the threat to take an additional step, just5 like the additional step of using a firearm, that the6 violence materializes.7 So the sort of connection between the8 underlying offense and violence that Congress had in9 mind did contemplate an additional step by the offender10 himself.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, or the12 homeowner could happen to have a short­barreled shotgun13 and shoot the burglar.14 MR. BASH: But remember ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then the violence16 doesn't depend on any additional act by the burglar.17 MR. BASH: It does, Mr. Chief Justice,18 because the statute says violence to another. So if19 the ­­ if the homeowner clocks the burglar, that's not20 the violence the statute contemplates. And I suppose21 you could imagine fanciful scenarios where the police22 officer accidentally shoots the homeowner, but surely23 that's not the sort of ordinary case violence that this24 statute had in mind.25 So I think ­­41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the parallel2 you're drawing is that3 risk of violence until4 MR. BASH:5 Like I said, I think it's most clear in extortion. I6 mean, even ­­ the Court suggested in James thatburglary itself doesn't present athe burglar pulls a gun?Or ­­ or attacks the homeowner.7 extortion could be even much broader to include8 blackmail and sort of prototypical extortion. But even9 if we just accept Justice Scalia's view of extortion,10 which is that it's a threat to person or property, there11 must be some number of extortionists that say: Well,12 I'm going to make the threat, but I'm actually not going13 to follow through on the threat. And the violence ­­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the ­­ what15 about the analogy to ­­ explosives, you say that there16 could be lawful possession because explosives, it's use17 that's given as an enumerated crime.18 MR. BASH: And what we would say is, by19 parity of reasoning to what we've set forth in the brief20 with respect to firearms, weaponized explosives, that is21 to say explosives that only have a use as a weapon,22 could fall under the residual clause.23 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there ­­ the proposition24 then that I must accept I think for you to prevail is25 possession of that which is normally used or has a very42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425serious risk of being used in a way that risks physicalinjury to another falls within the statute.  And insteadof drawing a line between possession and some other useof the thing, we say sometimes possession is in itselfwithin the statute, sometimes it's not.  If you possessthose things that have as a predominant useparticipation in a matter that's likely to causephysical injury to another, that's within the statute.If that's the proposition, is there any case wheresimple possession of anything has been interpreted asfalling within this language?  I don't know the answerto that.      MR. BASH:cases?      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. BASH:this issue in ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:this issue in ­­      MR.

I think theFirst Circuit.      But it's this issue.area I could look at?I think there's a case out of theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Obviously the setting can change the analysis to some2 degree. But I believe there's a Fourth Circuit. Maybe3 my co ­­ my opponent will have a better recollection of4 that.5 JUSTICE BREYER: There's a Fourth Circuit6 case and then this line right here. Okay.7 MR. BASH: I ­­ I don't mean to suggest that8 there's no other cases. I would not be surprised if9 there were possession of machine gun and short­barreled10 rifle and silencer; in other words, the very firearms11 covered by the NFA. Also, I think short­barreled12 shotguns are, just to underscore the point, more often13 used in crimes, and so you're14 proliferation of cases there.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG:16 Isn't it ­­ burglar tools are17 Possession of burglar tools will not get you under ACCA.18 MR. BASH: This Court reserved that question19 in James in a footnote, because I think some States20 purportedly had defined attempted burglary to be21 something like possession or to include something like22 possession of burglar tools. I think we'd have a much23 harder case there because there's a longer chain of24 attenuation.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:44Alderson Reporting Companygoing to see a Why not burglar tools?outside, right?Pardon ­­Official￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 There's no other use for burglar tools than in burglary.3 MR. BASH: I think that's true. I think4 we'd have to build through the practical case, one, that5 burglar tools ­­ the mere possession of burglar tools is6 sort of inevitably associated with committing burglary.7 It may be that there's a lot of people who acquire them,8 think about committing burglary, but don't make the sort9 of attempt that James contemplated will result in a10 confrontation, and then it's more attenuated because11 you're linking up this burglary ­­ burglary tools with12 committing burglary and then burglary with the13 confrontation.14 I think it's a much tighter nexus here. I15 think if you ask an ordinary congressperson whether they16 think there's a tighter connection between possession of17 a sawed­off shotgun and acts of violence rather than,18 you know, possession of a crowbar and acts of violence,19 I think most people would say, yes, that's sort of the20 common sense answer that most legislators would give.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm a little still22 confused about the felony possession, okay? You say23 that's not a crime of violence. I ­­ I don't know how24 to differentiate that from this because most felons, in25 possession of a gun, I'm sure the statistics would show,45Alderson Reporting CompanyBut there's no other use.Official￼1 are committing crimes. So if the question is the risk2 of injury to others, it would be a felon possessing a3 handgun of any kind and not a common citizen. Because,4 yes, common citizens more often than not, we hope, use5 guns that they possess for lawful purposes; but felons,6 I would think, just as a matter of logic, what Justice7 Alito was asking, that felons more often than not use8 guns in illegal activities.9 MR. BASH: I ­­ I don't know. And for10 one ­­ for one thing, we have a ­­ the judgment of the11 sentencing commission here that we're in full accord12 with that possession of a sawed­off shotgun is13 fundamentally different than felony possession.14 And they see ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I understand that.16 I just want you to give me some sort of analytical17 approach on when to judge that ­­ when to judge that18 risk, or how to differentiate that risk ­­19 MR. BASH: I think the analytical ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ so that everything,21 no ­­ every possession crime doesn't become a crime of22 violence.23 MR. BASH: I understand the concern. And I24 think the analytical line to draw is that weapons that25 by their nature are exclusively associated, or in the46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 ordinary case, associated with violent crimes count2 under ACCA. I don't think that the felon in possession3 statute reflects quite the judgment that every felon4 that possesses a firearm is going to commit acts of5 violence with it. I think it reflects the sort of6 prophylactic concern that these folks have proven7 themselves irresponsible lawbreakers ­­ even if they8 committed a nonviolence felony and they've, you know,9 lost their ability to responsibly care for firearms and10 to handle firearms. I do think it's a different11 judgment than the judgment of why people can't12 unlawfully possess mortars and artillery pieces and13 torpedoes and ­­ and sawed­off rifles and shotguns and14 machine guns. I think it's a different judgment.15 The Court ­­ Petitioner has really not16 refuted the historical understanding that these are17 uniquely and purely associated with crime. And I think18 a few thousand registrations since 1934, lawfully, does19 not refute the common sense conclusion that the unlawful20 possession of a sawed­off shotgun is associated with21 crime.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That ­­ you're ­­ is23 that the 40,000 you're talking about?24 MR. BASH: I'm sorry ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say a few47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 thousand, is that the same statistic as ­­2 MR. BASH: Yes. And I'll just say it's3 140,000; we think it's a great deal lower than that.4 That's the total number of registrations since 1934. As5 we say in the brief, we can't have perfect certainty,6 but it appears that the majority are registered with law7 enforcement or manufacturers.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I might have used a9 different word than a few thousand.1011 or ­­ 1213141516 Act in general, and the residual clause in particular,17 has caused no end of problems for this Court. Are you18 aware of any efforts made by the Justice Department to19 propose legislation revising either the ­­ either the20 Act in general or the residual clause?21 MR. BASH: I am not aware of those efforts.22 That doesn't mean they don't exist, but I, standing23 here, am not aware of the efforts. But I ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: What would you think, which25 I once suggested and certainly didn't have the nerve to48MR.

BASH: A few dozen thousand.JUSTICE ALITO: In the Armed Career CriminalAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 follow through, that it's more likely that the2 Department of Justice, with the aid of the sentencing3 commission, could get the relevant statistics than it is4 that a defendant could. So if no statistics appear, we5 should draw a presumption against the department.6 MR. BASH:7 otherwise in James.8 JUSTICE BREYER:9 MR. BASH:Well,11 JUSTICE BREYER: But could you do something,12 that is to say, even without legislation? Is it13 possible that the department, through its statistical14 gathering resources, and it has some, working with the15 sentencing commission, could help us more on the ­­ on16 the underlying statistical data that would give us a17 clue as to what was dangerous and what was not?18 MR. BASH: I think ­­ I think that's19 conceivable. I'm not familiar with all the sort of20 statistical resources of the Department of Justice. But21 I just want to emphasize, this is the clear case. This22 is the case where Congress and State legislatures and23 this Court in Heller and Miller have said for decades.24 So I don't think there's a fair argument that criminals25 are not on notice that possession of an unlawful shotgun49So, I10 statutory stare decisis holding that ­­ that governs ­­Alderson Reporting Companythis Court has heldYes, yes.

Maybe in a closercase down the road you say, well, the department couldhave come up with statistics, and that would be ­­ youknow, we're going to rule against the department forthat reason.  But, I mean, we have a quote from JudgeBoudin in the brief in the Shaw case, where, you know,anyone that watches television or reads the newspaperknows that these are especially associated with crimes.So I don't think it came as a surprise to Mr. Johnsonthat when he commits two robberies and one illegalpossession of a sawed­off shotgun, eventually that'sgoing to catch up with him.If the Court has no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Menendez, you have four minutesremaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMS. MENENDEZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just briefly. You're ­­ with respect toJustice Breyer's question, there are a couple of relatedcontexts where there are some appellate decisions.  TheEighth Circuit in Archer, which is cited in our brief,has held that possession of a concealed weapon is not aviolent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.50Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 In addition, in the Fourth ­­ I'm sorry, the2 Ninth Circuit in a case called Fish, which I am not sure3 whether we've cited it in our brief, but it's a 20044 decision, held that possession of a pipe bomb was not a5 crime of violence under the sentencing guideline6 provision, not the Armed Career Criminal Act.7 And I do agree with my opposing counsel that8 there's been one decision that went the way we disagree9 with in the Fourth Circuit about possession of a weapon10 in prison, which I think is a very different11 circumstance.12 Your Honors, I do think that it's important13 to look at James, comparing attempted burglary as to14 burglary. I think it gives us a great deal of guidance.15 In James, the Court found that there wasn't any textual16 justification for treating those differently. Here we17 have a very clear textual justification in terms of use18 of explosives, which gives us a strong signal that mere19 possession wasn't contemplated. The government invites20 this Court to do pretty convoluted reasoning, adopting21 an unstated definition from a totally unrelated statute22 in Title 26. And assuming that Congress meant when it23 said use of explosives, that all things listed in the24 National Firearms Act would be included by mere25 possession, I don't think we can make that leap.51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Your Honors, it's also not true that there2 is a unanimous belief that these are inherently3 unjustifiable weapons. In fact, I think that the fact4 is most legislatures allow these to be possessed in some5 context or another, and Michigan has just indicated that6 perhaps the old historical reputation of this weapon is7 no longer deserved. But this Court doesn't have to like8 the short­barreled shotgun or decide that it's even an9 appropriate weapon for punish ­­ or for possession in10 order to agree that we can't assume from its possession11 alone that someone has only nefarious purpose.12 In addition, Your Honors, the relevant13 analysis has to begin with the offense. And the14 government tries over and over again to say, well, it's15 obvious that these would only be possessed for nefarious16 reason, but they cannot substantiate that. They17 disagree with the 14 cases I encourage the Court to look18 at from page 14 of our reply brief, that those are mere19 possession cases. By characterizing the people who20 possessed those weapons, they were found during the21 course of investigations of other crimes, but that22 doesn't mean a single one of those possession acts was23 actually possession during a crime. And this Court24 certainly can't assume that merely because a criminal or25 a bad person had possessed the weapon, that they52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 possessed it for nefarious purposes.2 Finally, Your Honors, I would really3 encourage the Court to consider the ­­ the rule of4 lenity and its application in this case. The government5 has not brought statistics nor clear, decisive, textual6 argument that mandate the application of one of the most7 onerous sentencing provisions that we see in Federal8 courts every day. This statute is applied to 600 people9 a year. It lacks all clarity. And while this Court10 need not get into whether it is unconstitutionally vague11 and the baby should go out with the bath water, the12 Court can certainly decide that Congress did not speak13 clearly on this question, and that it should not be14 applied to Mr. Johnson.15 Unless there are any further questions, I16 appreciate the opportunity to present argument.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
