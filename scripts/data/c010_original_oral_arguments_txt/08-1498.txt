Humanitarian Law Project and thecross-petition.            Mr. Cole.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLEOfficial￼ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.       MR. COLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it101112131415   the Kurdistan Workers Party.  Specifically, they seek to16   advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to17   write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish18   rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human19   rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful20   conflict resolution.  It is undisputed that the21   Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of22   lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support23   only lawful ends.24               The government has a concededly compelling25   interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even4please the Court:            This as-applied challenge asks whether thegovernment can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and theHumanitarian Law Project to speak in association withAlderson Reporting Company8 9101112131415161718is inapplicable where the government prohibits purespeech --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But, Mr. Cole, don't youagree that some of the speech could be regulated?            MR. COLE:  Some of my clients’ speech?            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Some of the speech of yourclient.            MR. COLE:  I don't think -- I don't thinkany of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless thegovernment can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that thisCourt applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure19   speech.  So, no, I don't -- I --202122232425            JUSTICE STEVENS:  You think all of the speech atissue is protected?            MR. COLE:  I think that certainly all of thespeech that I've just identified, which is the core --bit.JUSTICE STEVENS:  You identified quite a5Official1   tried to defend these prohibitions under strict2   scrutiny.  Instead, it rests its entire case on the3   proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a4   regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be5   upheld under O'Brien.6               That view is mistaken for two fundamental7   reasons.  First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien￼Alderson Reporting CompanyHonor.Official1               MR. COLE:  Right.  Yes.  It’s core -- and2   I think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political3   speech on issues of public concern.  It is advocating4   only lawful, peaceable activities.  This Court has never5 6 7 8 9upheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech onissues of public concern.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, could thegovernment, I assume -- I assume you will say "yes" --could the government forbid any NGO or otherorganization or person from giving tsunami aid to one ofthese organizations, from giving them money?￼10111213141516171819   government could prohibit that.  Then the next question20   is:  Could the government prohibit speech instructing21   the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?22               MR. COLE:  Right.  And I think -- - I think,23   Your Honor, that the answer is no, for the -- unless the24   government can meet the higher standard of scrutiny that25   applies when you’re regulating speech.6MR. COLE:  I think money is different, Your            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could they -- could thegovernment prohibit that?            MR. COLE:  I think money is differentbecause it's -- it's conduct, not speech.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  Let's assume theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Brandenburg? 2               MR. COLE:  Well, I don't know whether it 3   would necessarily be Brandenburg.  I think for -- in 4   order to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor, 5   all the Court has to find is that when the speech 6   advocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the 7   sort advocated here, that's not sufficient.  I think 8   specific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard, 9   which is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate --10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but if you get11   tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for12   terrorist money.  So why can't the government forbid13   teaching how to get that money?14               MR. COLE:  Well, again, Your Honor, that --15   if the government -- if the connection between the16   speech and the government's concern were sufficiently17   close, then maybe it could.  But the problem --18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why can't there19   be --￼202122232425            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then what's the test?Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?            MR. COLE:  I think the test is whether the-- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think thetest is whether the speech has been provided withspecific intent or knowledge that it will further7Alderson Reporting Companyunlawful, terrorist ends of the group.            CHIEF JUSTICE:  What if it goes --           JUSTICE ALITO:  And that applies -- 8   and you are giving them advice on how to run a 9   hospital, but the government decides that anything that10   legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that11   group's terrorist activities.  Can the government makeOfficial12345   the mere existence of a group?  Let's say you have the6   Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on7   some purely mundane issue.  The Nazis have a hospital,CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if it goes to￼1213141516171819202122232425that kind of determination?            I'm thinking of something like Regan v.Wald --            MR. COLE:  Right.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where they say,look, you can't travel to Cuba because we don't want todo anything that legitimizes the regime.            MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, two answers.            Does your question refer to the Nazi Partytoday or the Nazi Party during World War II?            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I meant duringWorld War II.           MR. COLE:  Okay.           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I’m just trying to find8Alderson Reporting Company23 24 25were essentially O'Brien cases.            And, in fact, in Regan the Courtdistinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the9Official1   an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of2   the issue today.3               MR. COLE:  Right, right.  So I think -- the4   reason I ask, Your Honor, is that it may make a5   difference if we are at war.  The law of treason6   prohibits aid --7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I didn't -- my8   hypothetical was confusing.  I didn't mean to suggest we￼ 910111213141517   better.  People are going to like their hospital.  So18   the party, the group, will be legitimized.19               MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, I think all the20   Court held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible21   for the government to regulate conduct -- not speech --22   travel, and economic transactions, not speech.  Thosewere at war.           MR. COLE:  Okay.           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I meant to hypothesizea group that the government could reasonably determineshould not be supported in any way --            MR. COLE:  Right.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- because it16   legitimizes it.  It's going to make their hospital runAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   board from a prohibition directed at a group, the2   Communist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where3   the Court held that --4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you can't travel5   there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can6   meet with and discuss lawful activities with people7   there.  If you can't get there, you can't speak.89 10            MR. COLE:  That's right, Your Honor.  Butthat -- but that's essentially an O'Brien situation.The prohibition is on a conduct, whether it's￼11   draft card burning or travel.  The individual who seeks12   to engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for13   speech purposes.  But the Court says the government has14   a freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and,15   therefore, as long as you’re regulating the16   non-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply17   O'Brien.  But what this Court has said is that when --1819202122232425            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could the governmentstop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists?            MR. COLE:  From meeting?  No, I don't think--            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just meeting, travelingto one of these countries to actually do your teachingto a terrorist -- let's say the law said you'reprohibited from traveling to meet any of these10Alderson Reporting Company7 8 91012   apply to different political groups.  It applied to13   anyone who sought to travel to Cuba.  And it was about                 MR. COLE:  No, but the whole point of the     Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this11   Court said, it was an across-the-board ban.  It did not1415161718192021   wherever it  occurs.22 23 24 25            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what about the -- whatabout the hypothetical?            MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, with respect to thehypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be11Official1   individuals.  How would that be different than the Cuba2 situation?3               MR. COLE:  Well, then, if it's -- if it's4   traveling for the purpose of association, then it would5   be targeted at association, not at the conduct of6   travel.  The whole --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it's no differentthan the Cuba situation.￼travel.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose it's a banjust for travel to meet with terrorist organizations,Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.            MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, then I think -- Ithink that's -- that’s different from this case, right,because this case -- suppose it's a ban on speechAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234   Justice says:  In any context, support ultimately will5   inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we6   have a governmental interest in not allowing that.whether the government's interest in banning that travelis unrelated to the associational or speech purposes.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's what the Chief 7               MR. COLE:  There's no -- there’s no dispute, 8   Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest 9   in cutting off aid to terrorism.  The question is whether10   it can do  so by criminalizing pure speech.11               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it hasn't criminalized12   speech.  It has criminalized providing aid and13   assistance to these organizations.  Most of that aid and￼1415161718192021   in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia.  Imagine a22   statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States23   Government.  And it had three provisions:  One, you can't24   assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and25   weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;12assistance that is prohibited is not in the form ofspeech, but it happens to include speech as well.MR. COLE:  Right, but, Justice Scalia --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think that’s quitedifferent from a law that is directed explicitly atspeech.MR. COLE:  Well, I don’t -- I think it's notAlderson Reporting Company89 10what is at issue here, not --           MR. COLE:  Well, but --121314151617181920   that's prohibited.  So, for example --21 22 23 24 25            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  When they provide abenefit, right?            MR. COLE:  So, for example, under that view,the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times,all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons --13your clients are free to do that.           MR. COLE:  Well --Official1   three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government.2   If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy,3   we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech.4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not the right --5   that's not the right number three.  The right number6   three is you cannot advise and assist an organization7   that is seeking to overthrow the government.  That's￼                JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- not independently promoting11   the objectives of these terrorist organizations.  Your --           JUSTICE SCALIA:  But when they assistthe organization by providing advice, that's a differentmatter.            MR. COLE:  Well, the government says ifthey -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group,they -- and they’re providing a benefit to the government,Alderson Reporting Company4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we -- we can crossthat bridge when we come to it.           MR. COLE:  But --           JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is an as-appliedchallenge, and we are talking about the kind of adviceand assistance that your clients want to give.editorial.MR. COLE:  Right, and, Your Honor, there'sJUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a New York TimesMR. COLE:  Well, it is, though.  It is, Your20212223   not about whether you meet with them.  It's about24   whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly25   coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and14Official1   Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to2   Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they’re all3   criminals.  President Carter --￼1011   no --12131415   Honor.  I mean, it’s -- Ralph Fertig is not the New York16   Times, and he's not President Carter, but it's the same17   sort of support, right?  President Carter --18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  No, no.  I thought19   that he was -- he wants to meet with the people.  TheNew York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them howgreat their editorial was.MR. COLE:  No, but it's not about -- it'sAlderson Reporting Company23 24 25            MR. COLE:  Well, I think -- I think ifyou -- if you specifically intend and know that your aidwill further the group in its terrorist activities, then15Official 1   accepting and then publishing his editorial.  That is -- 2   that would be providing a service.  It would -- 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on what 4   "coordinating" means, doesn't it?  And we can determine 5   that in the next case. 6               MR. COLE:  Well, let me -- let me also 7   answer it this way, Justice Scalia:  If you look at the 8   specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it 9   includes writing and distributing literature in10   conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the11   United States advocating their support.  How is that￼12131415   behalf of the Kurds.  That's your words.  All right.16   Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals.  Hypothetical17   one, your clients, let's say, or some other people,18   know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to19   pretend they're a political advocacy organization,20   but to go around shooting the people who don't agree21   with them.  Okay?  Case one, the hypothetical defendant22   knows it.  In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.different from the New York Times?            JUSTICE BREYER:  Supposing that -- what yousay is you want to engage in political advocacy onAlderson Reporting Company1   it's not protected speech.  But if you're -- if youOfficial 2 3 4 5   training?  No form of training or expert assistance can 6   be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends 7   to further -- that the training will be used to carry 8   out terrorist activities? 9               MR. COLE:  Well, Justice Alito, this is an10   as-applied challenge.  So the question simply is whetherdon't know that and you don't intend that, and in thiscase --JUSTICE ALITO:  And that goes for all forms of￼11121314151617181920   Amendment.  That's not your position?21               MR. COLE:  No.  I think -- I think, again,22   it depends upon the form of speech.  There may be some forms23   of training that are so closely connected to the -- to24   the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to25   proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in16training in what international human rights consist of,in how to advocate for international human rights, andhow to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies.That's the speech that's at issue here.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just out of curiosity,I thought your position was that no form of training orassistance could be prohibited -- -MR. COLE:  No, I was just --JUSTICE ALITO:  -- consistent with the FirstAlderson Reporting Company1234   organizations.  And the theory of the legislation is5   that when you aid any of their enterprises you’reto proscribe is the existence of these terrorist6   aiding the organization.  Hamas, for example, gained7 8 9support among -- among the Palestinians by activitiesthat are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals,all sorts of things.Officialmilitary exercises.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The end that Congress seeks￼10111213   activities.  Why isn't that a reasonable connection?14   Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot15   be separated from assistance to their terroristMR. COLE:  Right.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that is what fosters theterrorist organization and enables the terrorist16   activities.17               MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, Your Honor,18   that is precisely the argument that the United States19   made to this Court in Scales.  And here I’m quoting20   from the government's brief:  "Active membership can be21   proscribed even though the activity be expended along22   lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any23   kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal24   purposes."2517That was with respect to an organizationAlderson Reporting CompanyJonge.Official 1   that Congress spent 10 years studying, made findings 2   that it was an international conspiracy directed and 3   controlled by the Soviet Union with the aim of 4   overthrowing the United States by force and violence, 5   using terrorism.  And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales 6   held you've got to distinguish between that aid and 7   support and membership which is furthering the lawful 8   activities and that which is furthering the illegal 9   activities; otherwise you are penalizing the exercise of10   lawful speech.  The Court said the same thing in De￼111213141516171819202122   difficult case for me.  And the second paragraph, page23   17, you say:  "The narrow focus of plaintiffs' claims in24   this Court means that the case does not involve the25   propriety of banning financial or other tangible18            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Cole, as I remember,Scales upheld a conviction, wasn’t --            MR. COLE:  It did, Justice Ginsburg, butonly because it interpreted the statute to be -- to belimited to specific -- to members -- active membershipthat is specifically intended to further the illegalends of the group, precisely --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it didn’t -- it was nota statute which involves banning financial or other tangiblesupport, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is aAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9support."MR. COLE:  Right.Official           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then you say:  "Nor does itinvolve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violentactivity."           But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo,that is tantamount to material support.            MR. COLE:  Well, I -- right, but --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the speech istantamount to material support in that it legitimizes,encourages, or strengthens the organization.￼10111213   that, Justice Kennedy.  First, that is what the United14   States argued in Scales.  And, again, the Court, not only1516171819202122232425in Scales but in a host of cases striking downCommunist Party statute, said you have to distinguishbetween aid that’s intended to further lawful activityand aid that’s intended to further illegal activitywhen it's in the form of protected activity --association, here speech and association.            And, secondly --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  In those cases, the realquestion was whether membership was enough, wasn’t it?            MR. COLE:  Active membership --           JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.19MR. COLE:  Well, two things in response toAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9           MR. COLE:  -- which the government saysconstitutes more than mere nominal membership.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this is support.  It'sdifferent.            MR. COLE:  Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge,one of these cases, one of this Court's first FirstAmendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jongeaided the Communist Party in its illegal ends byconducting a meeting for them and being their leadOfficial￼10   speaker at the meeting.  And this Court said:  We've got11   to look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the12   meeting; yes, he was a member of the Communist Party;13   yes, he solicited people to join the Communist Party.14   But what did he do?  He advocated lawful peaceable15   activities.  And this Court said --16171819202122232425            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there wasn't a statuteon the books that prohibited material support --            MR. COLE:  Well, I don't think it would --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And here there is, and thisis in aid of that prohibition.            MR. COLE:  Right, but Your Honor, what would-- if Congress came along after the Communist Party casesand said, okay, you've said we can't make it a crime tocriminalize membership in the Communist Party; we arenow going to make it a crime to speak in conjunction20Alderson Reporting Company121314151617   accepted Congress's findings.  Congress's findings wereOfficial 1   with the Communist Party -- do you think the 2   decisions would have come out any differently? 3   I don't think so, because this Court has said that 4   speech is different from money, that it -- 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's very 6   unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations 7   with the Communist Party.  Those cases involved 8   philosophy.  The Communist Party was -- was -- was more 9   than a -- than an organization that -- that had some10   unlawful ends.  It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of11   extreme socialism.  And -- and many people subscribed to￼that philosophy.            I don't think that Hamas or any of theseterrorist organizations represent such a philosophicalorganization.MR. COLE:  Your Honor, this -- this Court1819202122232425   philosophical reasons.  These terrorist organizationsnot that this was a philosophical debating society, butthat it was an international criminal conspiracydirected by our enemy to overthrow us through terrorism.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That may be, but peoplejoined it for philosophical reasons.MR. COLE:  Oh, sure --JUSTICE SCALIA:  They joined it for21Alderson Reporting Company 2 3 4 5   don't think that's fair, Justice Scalia.  The 6   Humanitarian Law Project has no interest in furthering 7   terrorism, but the Kurdistan Workers Party are the 8   principal representatives of the -- of the Kurds in 9   Turkey.  They do have an interest in protecting the10   rights of the Kurds.  They do have an interest injoining them or assisting them is to assist thosepractical objectives.Official1   have very practical objectives.  And the only reason forMR. COLE:  Well, I don't think that's -- I￼11121314151617   appeals.  There are a lot of groups on the list.  I18   think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned,19   and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that20   if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect21   to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would22   be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda,23   and I’ll throw in the Taliban.24               MR. COLE:  Yes.  We didn't actually concede25   that, Your Honor.  That's a misstatement on the part of22encouraging the Kurdistan Workers Party to -- to disavowviolence and engage in lawful peaceful means ofresolving their disputes --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Cole -- JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Cole, would youdistinguish -- I think this came up in the court ofAlderson Reporting Company1   the government.  If you look at the --           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- but Al-Qaeda andthe Taliban?Official 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   constitutional question.  And I think there are two10   reasons why it might pose a different constitutional11   question.  One is -- and that was -- I’m picking up on my12   question back to Mr. Chief Justice, is it during wartime13   or not?  And during wartime, Congress has broader powers14   pursuant to the treason --15               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But I want to be sure I16   understand that point.  You think the issue in this case            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then -- then as --suppose the group is not the two that we have here --MR. COLE:  Right.            MR. COLE:  Right.  What we said, for therecord, is that it would pose a very different￼171819202122232425would be different if we were at war?            MR. COLE:  I think it might be different ifwe were at war with these groups.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if that's true, whyaren't we now at war, with regard to our opposition tothese organizations?            MR. COLE:  Well --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  What is the difference,as a practical matter?23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1               MR. COLE:  Well -- well, two things, Your2   Honor.  With respect to -- it might be different if3   you -- if you’re talking about treason.  Tokyo Rose,4   for example, was engaged in speech, but she was doing so5   with -- with the purpose of aiding the enemy and the6   specific intent of betraying the United States.  And7   that's what's required.  And what the Supreme Court has8 91011121314151617181920said is that the -- the aid has to be to --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But my question that Iwant to be sure you are focusing on --           MR. COLE:  Yes.           JUSTICE STEVENS -- but in the issues in thisvery case --            MR. COLE:  Right.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- would they be differentif we were now at war?            MR. COLE:  I think it would depend, YourHonor, because the -- what -- what treason requires isaid to the enemy, and aid might be in the form of speech.But it also requires a specific intent to betray the￼21   United States.  And when you aid someone with whom we22   are at war, there is an -- there may well be an intent23   to betray the United States.  There is no betrayal of24   the United States here.25               And, number two --24Alderson Reporting Company1234   to one of our allies?  And we’re seeking to gain the5 6 7 8 9assistance of these allies against those terrorists whoaim their terrorism at us, and yet --            MR. COLE:  Right.            MR. COLE:  Well --Official            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, in a way there is.What about -- what about aiding organizations that areacting criminally, killing innocent civilians, with regard            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- we -- we are supposed toallow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizationsthat are directing their violence against them?￼10111213141516171819   killing Americans?  And there just isn't.20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you've21   picked -- you've picked hypotheticals that are very easy22   for you.  What about personnel?  Is there a connection23   between providing personnel that participate in legal24   activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, and the25   organization can then say, well, because you are25            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't that asufficiently serious reason for the government to dowhat it's done here?            MR. COLE:  I think the question, Your Honor,is there -- is there any realistic nexus between writingan op-ed, advocating before Congress, urging a group touse lawful nonviolent means to resolve its disputes, andAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   providing this personnel, we can take them out and shift 2   them to bombmaking? 3               MR. COLE:  Right.  And -- and -- and I guess 4   my answer to that would be it would depend upon whether 5   the -- the -- what is being prohibited is speech.  If 6   what is being prohibited is speech, I'm not sure that it 7   would be permissible for the government to say we’re 8   going to criminalize your speech, even though it’s 9   advocating lawful activities, because --10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one of the11   things that’s being prohibited here that you challenge12   is providing personnel.13               MR. COLE:  That's right.  And -- and that's14   exactly what De Jonge was essentially charged with.  And15   the Communist Party was, again, found to be engaged in16   criminal activity, to be a criminal syndicate,17   essentially, by the Oregon statute.  The Court didn't18   question that.  At that time it was illegal to even￼19202122232425advocate illegal activity.            He was charged with providing his person,personnel, by conducting a meeting under the auspices ofthe Communist Party and providing the lead speech there.And the Court said, even though the argument was --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is yourargument limited to personnel that engages in speech, or26Alderson Reporting Company 91011121314151617            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  When -- but the way youdefine the speech that you want protected is speech thatis advocating some lawful activity.            MR. COLE:  Right.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what’s unlawfulabout teaching people medicine and how to cure peoplefrom infection?            MR. COLE:  If -- if that were what they weredoing, Your Honor, if it was teaching, then it would beOfficial1   does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the --2   if there are any, Hamas hospitals?3               MR. COLE:  Right.  Our argument, Your Honor,4   is -- again, this is an as-applied challenge with respect to5   the particular speech that our clients seek to engage in,6   so it would not -- it would not require the Court to7   decide whether any nonspeech assistance could be8   proscribed.  In fact --￼18   protected by the First Amendment.  But if -- I took19   Chief Justice Roberts's question --20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you see no21   difference -- you’re not advocating a difference in22   this case between training that could reasonably be used23   in terrorist activities, because teaching people how to24   care for the ill could be used to teach people how to25 care for the wounded.Alderson Reporting Company271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. COLE:  Right.  Right.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  And thepolitical speech that your group is advocating, i.e.,the petitioning -- you’re not willing to draw adistinction?            MR. COLE:  No, no.  I --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are saying to us thecase stands and falls on whether or not we accept thatthis statute regulates conduct as opposed to speech?16171819202122232425            MR. COLE:  Yes.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- was whether there wasa way in your challenge, or whether you are advocatingany difference in the nature of the speech, that it's --this is an as-applied challenge.            MR. COLE:  Yes.  Exactly.  And that's --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so the question --because the only answer you have given us is if it'slawful speech, it's protected.            MR. COLE:  No, I -- I think -- I think, Your28Official￼101112131415   training.  And what -- the question I asked you --            MR. COLE:  No.  Justice Sotomayor, what I'msuggesting is, number one, the statute regulates speech.It regulates speech because of what it conveys.Therefore, the --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it regulatesAlderson Reporting Company3 4 5 6 7 8 9advocating solely lawful activity of the type at issuehere, I think the connection between the government’s --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So give me an analyticalframework to address that question.            MR. COLE:  All right.  Well, I --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government saysunder O'Brien even the speech that you want -- forgetOfficial1   Honor, that the answer -- maybe I wasn't clear in2   responding to Justice Alito.  But with respect to speech￼10   about the tsunami aid speech.  Let's just talk about the111213141516171819   compelling interest.  And if -- certainly there would be20   if it's -- meets Brandenburg.  I think there might be if21   it is specifically intended or known that it will further22   terrorist activity.  But where -- with respect to our23 24 25speech, there's really no realistic likelihood that thespeech that's being expressed here will further --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We have to be conscious of29political petitioning speech, the petitioning for --            MR. COLE:  Right.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there a differenceand under what analytical framework would we reach it?            MR. COLE:  Well, I think the question -- thequestion at the -- at the -- at the bottom would bewhether there is a sufficient connection between thespeech which is being expressed and the government'sAlderson Reporting Companybest case?Official 1   the white light.  I have just one -- one question. 2               The old equity rule was that you don't 3   enjoin a criminal statute; you wait until something 4   happens.  And the reason is then we have specific facts. 5   And if we said that here, you would say, oh, you’re 6   chilling speech. 7               What's your best case in the precedents of 8   this Court for our entertaining an challenge that -- 9   this is not really -- we usually talk about as-applied10   after the fact.  Coates, there was a conviction.￼1112131415161718192021   Justice Ginsburg.  I thought I was, and maybe --22   but the answer would be we are in a military conflict23   with the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.  This Court has24   recognized that.  It’s authorized by the authorization25   to use military force.  Therefore, treason law might be30MR. COLE:  Right.

COLE:  Oh, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   applicable, number one. 2               Number two, it’s not clear that the Al-Qaeda 3   engages in any lawful activities at all, and the -- the 4   principle this Court established with respect to the 5   Communist Party, a group that clearly engaged in illegal 6   activities of a very, very dangerous kind, but also 7   engaged in lawful activities, is that that’s -- that that 8   the group has to be a dual-purpose group.  And here 9   there’s absolutely no dispute that the Kurdistan10   Workers Party and the LTTE engage in a wide variety of11   lawful activities and that all our clients seek to do12   is support those lawful activities.  Thank you.￼131415161718   Mr. Chief Justice.  This may take some time.19               (Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Cole.General Kagan.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGANON BEHALF OF ERIC H. HOLDER, JR., ET AL.    GENERAL KAGAN:  With your permission,20               GENERAL KAGAN:  I'm sure it will on the21   other side, too.22               Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the23 Court:24               The material support statute is a vital25   weapon in this nation's continuing struggle against31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   international terrorism.  The statute prohibits, in 2   terms that ordinary people can understand, the provision 3   of material resources, material resources of all kinds, 4   to foreign groups that engage in terrorist acts that 5   threaten the security of the United States or its6 citizens. 7 8   Petitioners' independent advocacy.  Petitioners can say 9   or write whatever they wish about the PKK or the LTTE,10   and all their activities both legal and illegal.  WhatThe statute does not prohibit in any way￼111213141516171819202122232425Petitioners --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If a terrorist wasarrested in the United States from one of these groups,would they be barred under the statute from serving astheir attorney in a U.S. court?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Sotomayor, if -- ifthere are --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that materialsupport under the definition that you have beenadvocating?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Sotomayor, I believethat that would be excluded from the statute -- should beexcluded from the statute, and indeed even Petitionershave never suggested --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but I'm asking you why.32Alderson Reporting CompanyGENERAL KAGAN:  It can --Official 1               GENERAL KAGAN:  Because I think that there 2   the canon of constitutional avoidance would clearly come 3   into play.  If there is a criminal defendant, even a 4   civil defendant where there may be Sixth Amendment 5   issues, where there may be due process issues, it6 would -- 7 8   ask you something?  I mean, part of the First Amendment 9   is the right for the -- to petition the government for10   redress of grievances.  Putting aside all of the otherJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so can I -- can I￼1112131415161718192021222324   advocacy.  But the statute, in fact, does not cover their25   independent advocacy.  Judge Fertig and all the rest ofaid they are claiming, the tsunami aid, the training andother things, can the statute constitutionally be readto bar them from petitioning legitimate agencies,legitimate government agencies, to peacefully, using thewords of the Constitution, to effect legal change?            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that -- that's part ofwhat they’re claiming their speech involves --GENERAL KAGAN:  The statute --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- training and doingthat.legitimately be read to -- to include their independentGENERAL KAGAN:  The statute cannot33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6   right of the people peaceably to assemble?  Now, mind 7   you, I understand this is the right of U.S. citizens in 8   the United States.  But what in the First Amendment or 9   even in this statute could justify Congress from barring10   individuals to petition peacefully United -- world11   agencies or even U.S. agencies --12               GENERAL KAGAN:  Again, the statute --13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for the recognition14   of a -- of a legitimate goal?15               GENERAL KAGAN:  Again, the statute does not16   prohibit the Petitioners from petitioning peacefully.17   What the statute does is to prohibit Petitioners from18   giving support to foreign terrorist organizations in19   their ability to petition international organizations.20   And that's a very different thing.  It's a different21   thing for several reasons.22               First, remember that these are foreign23   organizations, and as several of you have suggested, the24   ability of Congress and of the Executive Branch to25   regulate the relationships between Americans and foreign34the Petitioners can lobby Congress, can lobbyinternational organizations --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that doesn't --GENERAL KAGAN:  -- as they see fit.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- answer -- what is the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   governments or foreign organization has long been 2   acknowledged by this Court.  It was acknowledged in 3   cases like Regan and Zemel and others, not only with 4   respect to nations with which we are at war, but with 5   respect to foreign nations and other entities as well -- 6   foreign nationals. 7               And in fact, the Petitioners' supposed First 8   Amendment claims really are not speech claims at all. 9   They are all association claims.  Petitioners can do10   whatever independent advocacy they wish.  What11   Petitioners cannot do is to provide support to a foreign12   terrorist organization.  And there, indeed, the￼1314151617181920   wish.  They’re making clear that it's only in21   connection with lawful activity of the group, and indeed22   it's to train them in using lawful means to achievegovernment's position is that the Association Clausedoes not extend that far to give Americans, Americancitizens, the ability to deal in whatever way they wishwith foreign nations --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it isn't--GENERAL KAGAN:  -- or foreign organizations.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- whatever way they23   their end.2425   there has to be strictly independent advocacy.  You35And I thought you went further than sayingAlderson Reporting Company 1   recognized in your brief that they could meet with 2   members of these terrorist organizations.  They could 3   meet and communicate with them, but they can't 4   communicate advice on how to pursue their goals through 5   lawful means? 6               GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Ginsburg, you’re 7   exactly right that, in addition to engaging in 8   independent advocacy, Petitioners can meet with members 9   of the foreign terrorist organizations, can join the10   foreign terrorist organizations, that membership is not11   prohibited by the statute.  What the statute does12   prohibit is active support of all kinds, both13   material --Official￼1415   advocate to the association?  There are many kinds of16   advocacy.  You can advocate to the world that they are17   right.  Can you advocate to the association that you18   should change your ways, that you should use Lexis to19   find international law precedents, et cetera?20               GENERAL KAGAN:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.21   If -- if Judge Fertig or the other Petitioners wanted to22   say to these organizations, you should change your ways,23   nothing in the statute --24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And suppose the25   organization's board of directors agrees with that and36JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can they -- can theyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   wants them to address the general membership on that 2   point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the 3   organization. 4               GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Kennedy, I want 5   first -- I’m going to answer your question, and I’m 6   going to say that that's still not covered, but I want 7   also to make a general point, which is that this Court 8   can exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this 9   case, and it will be irrelevant to the case at hand, and10   that would be so for two reasons.11               First, because with respect to overbreadth,12   all of those uncertain or even unconstitutional13   applications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the14   ocean full of completely legitimate applications of this15   statute.  And, second, because those hypotheticals have￼16171819   challenge.  And to the extent that the Court thinks that20   there are certain categories of activity that thenothing to do with this case.            Mr. Cole said several times, I heard, thisis an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied21   statute could not prohibit that would raise serious22   constitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I23   disagree with, but there may be some.  To the extent24   that that's true, the Court can -- can put those off to25   another day, another --37Alderson Reporting Company1               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, wait.  They want to2   apply.  They want to do --3 4 5 6 7 8 9           GENERAL KAGAN:  I’m sorry.           JUSTICE BREYER:  They say in this case thatthey want to provide training in the issue ofhumanitarian international law, and they want to providetraining and expert advice and assistance in respect tohow you petition the UN.Official￼            Now focusing on those two things, and goingback to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the1011   government's interest in the following?  Under O'Brien12   or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching13   have a First Amendment interest -- training?  Yes.  And14   what about teaching about advocacy?  That's what they15   are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy.16   Yes.  Therefore there is a First Amendment interest17181920   in not having terrorism.  But there is a less21   restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that22   situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as23   saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably24   would believe that their teaching, assistance,25   training, would not significantly aid this organization38implicated, seriously.            Now, when that is seriously implicated,there is also a government interest, on the other side,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty. 2               Now, what is the government's interest in 3   not accepting that interpretation?  The First Amendment 4   is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they 5   describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less 6   restrictive way of going about it.  And they have to be 7   reasonable in what they think.  Now, what's the 8   objection to that? 9               GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Breyer, I think the10   objection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with11   his hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually12   perfectly aligned with this case.  You can't give13   tsunami aid, but the question is:  Can you instruct￼141516171819   talking about tsunami aid.  I am talking about the20   instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how21   to do something, and that something is the kind of thing22   that the First Amendment protects.23               GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, that something, which24   is the teaching the foreign terrorist organization how25   to petition international bodies in order to get various39these organizations about how to get tsunami aid?            And then these organizations get tsunamiaid, and they, in fact, use that aid in such a way thatthey also have more money to --JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.  I’m notAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   kinds of support, financial or otherwise, that will 2   strengthen those organizations in everything that they 3   do.  What Congress decided -- 4               JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine, and if a reasonable 5   person would know that, that it's going to help them, 6   then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a 7   reasonable person would think it was going to help them 8   in their unlawful activities.  But we're not -- 9               GENERAL KAGAN:  Congress was the reasonable10   person here.  And Congress reasonably decided that when11   you help a terrorist -- foreign terrorist organization's12   legal activities, you’re also helping the foreign13   terrorist organization's illegal activities.14               Hezbollah builds bombs.  Hezbollah also15   builds homes.  What Congress decided was when you help16   Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah17   build bombs.  That's the entire theory behind this18   statute, and it's a reasonable theory for exactly the19   kinds of reasons that Justice Kennedy was suggesting by20   that hypothetical.21               JUSTICE ALITO:  And doesn't that lead to --22   kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere23   membership could be prohibited?  Could you explain how24   someone could be a member of one of these organizations25   without providing a service to the organization?  Simply40￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   by lending one's name as a member -- that might be 2   regarded as a service.  If you attended a meeting and 3   you helped to arrange the chairs in advance or clean up 4   afterwards, you’d be providing a service to the 5   organization. 6               GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I actually don't 7   think -- I mean, Congress clearly did not mean to 8   include that.  And I think that the normal words that 9   Congress used make that pretty clear.  When you think10   about personnel, when you think about training, when you11   think about expert advice and assistance, even when you12   think about service, you -- the notion that I am serving13   a terrorist organization simply by the act of membership14   I think would not be correct.  And --15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you say Congress16   clearly did not intend that?  You know, I would have17   guessed that you are providing a service or personnel18   when you make yourself a member of the organization.19   Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it?20               GENERAL KAGAN:  That is certainly not the21   way the government reads the statute, and that's not the22   way the government has ever read the statute.  And,23   indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief,24   believes that there are certain kinds of joint25   activities that would be allowed by the statute.41￼Alderson Reporting Company151617   thing in here which says:  Don't construe this statute18   in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights.  So19202122232425it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights.            GENERAL KAGAN:  And I think you are exactlyright about that.            JUSTICE BREYER:  And is there any evidence thatsomething like that would, in fact, but for the realm ofideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Breyer, I believe42Official 1               Now, that's not to say that Congress could 2   not have gone farther.  In this specific context, where 3   one is regulating dealings with a foreign organization, 4   it's possible that Congress could have gone further. 5   But we understand the statute and -- and I think there's 6   a -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only 7   material support, a true service, something that will 8   help the foreign organization in whatever it does. 9               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, but petitioning the10   United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them11   -- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something12   that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in13   their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas.14 Now --￼GENERAL KAGAN:  This would be --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and then Congress put aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress2   thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and3   legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in4   fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the5   illegal and illegitimate goals.6               Congress made findings about the fungibility7   of these resources.  Congress said over and over that89 10 11 12 13these organizations have no firewalls, no organizationalfirewalls --           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- but you --           GENERAL KAGAN:  -- no financial firewalls.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say that the -- notonly the membership, but they can meet and they can￼14   discuss.  And I don't understand the line between15   meeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing16   things with them, and instructing them on how they can17   pursue their goals through lawful means.18               GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I agree19   with you that there may be some hard cases that are at20   the borderline between the two, as there are in most21   statutes; that there may be hard cases.  This is not one22 of them.23               And I think it would -- it's very24   instructive for the Court -- I'm sure you’ve all done25   this -- but to actually go back and look at the43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   Petitioners’ complaints in this case and look at Judge 2   Fertig's declarations in this case, because what they 3   show is the extensiveness of the activities that they -- 4   of the services that they wish to offer to these foreign 5   terrorist organizations and the value that those 6   services are going to give those foreign terrorist 7   organizations. 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, you've 9   talked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about10   the legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating11   illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all12   that, and legitimizing the group.13               Is that an argument you've made before this14   Court or below?  I looked at your briefs, and I thought15   it's almost all about:  This is O'Brien, this is16   conduct, this is not speech.  I didn't see the argument17   that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is18   the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate19   activities to take place.20               GENERAL KAGAN:  No, I believe we -- we have,21   Mr. Chief Justice, although if we didn't emphasize it22   enough, I -- I will plead error, because I think that it23   is an -- a crucial point to this case.  But I think in24   the part of our brief --25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have -- I44￼Alderson Reporting Company23 24 25advice is not speech?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Alito, I think thatthe -- the training and advice clauses are, of course,45Official 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   to me your case is all about O'Brien.  I'm not sure you have 9   an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is10   satisfied.  If we disagree with you and think that some11   of this activity is speech, I don't see the argument12   that you've presented on strict scrutiny.13               GENERAL KAGAN:  I think that that’s right,14   Mr. Chief Justice, that we have not specifically15   addressed the strict scrutiny argument.  I think this16   would pass a strict scrutiny standard, but I actually17   think that to the extent that the Court thought a strict18   scrutiny standard were appropriate, a remand might be in19   order, that no Court has ever actually gone off on that20   ground, that --21               JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is O'Brien the correct22   standard?  How can you argue that training and providingdon't mean to -- do you have particular references towhere in your brief you made the argument?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes.  In the part of ourbrief where we discuss the application of the O'Brienstandard, and we say what are the governmental intereststhere.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, I know.  It seems￼Alderson Reporting Company1   part of a statute which regulates material support and2   resources of all kinds, and to the extent that what3   you're saying is, you know, training and advice, those4   are always speech restrictions if you find them in a5   statute, I think that that's not right.6               I mean, if you think about the range of7   things that training can involve:  Training how to89 10 11 12 13 14Official     build a bomb, training how to fly a plane, training how     to use sophisticated communications equipment, and     training how to engage --                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about training to --                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What's involved     here -- I think they said that they want to train them     how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a15   lawful, rather than a terrorist, way.  And that is16   speech.  It is not conduct.  They want to engage in17   advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of18   these groups.19               GENERAL KAGAN:  Congress, of course, allowed20   them to engage in all the advocacy that they wish on21   behalf of these groups.  Indeed, Congress did not22   prohibit --2324   communicate, and you say they can communicate.  And I25   still am having trouble with the line of what they can46￼JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they want toAlderson Reporting Company5 6 7 8 9provision of actual support, services to theorganizations that the organization can use in itsactivities, both legal and illegal.101112131415   be a service.  In other words, not an amicus brief just16   to make sure that we understand each other.  The22 23 24 25service that --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then it seems to me thatyour opponent's argument here today is prohibited.            GENERAL KAGAN:  No, no, no, because47Officialcommunicate and what they can't.            GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I think if they are1234   not prohibit that.  What the statute prohibits is theengaged in just discussion of ideas, this statute does            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you stick with theargument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicusbrief?￼GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Kennedy --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think I'm right insaying it that that was the argument below.GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, I think that would17   Petitioners can file amicus briefs in a case that might18   involve the PKK or the LTTE for themselves, but to the19   extent that a lawyer drafts an amicus brief for the PKK20   or for the LTTE, that that's the amicus party, then that21   indeed would be prohibited.  That's the kind ofAlderson Reporting Company23 24 25is if somebody drafted an amicus brief --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can we can everOfficial 1   Petitioners here are arguing for themselves.  What I'm 2   suggesting is Petitioners can do all the advocacy they 3   want, can engage in courts in any way they wish.  The 4   only thing that's prohibited is if the PKK hired a 5   lawyer to write an amicus brief on its behalf.  At that6 point -- 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  General, I understand, 8   I could be wrong, that many petitioners or respondents 9   go out to the industry and say we need some amicus10   briefs, and they flood in from all sides.  Would that be11   illegal?  Because the -- the organization --￼1213141516171819202122   themselves, there would be no problem.  The only problemGENERAL KAGAN:  Well, if the PKK --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- came out and said weneed a brief -- amicus briefs from law professors?From --            GENERAL KAGAN:  If -- if the PKK or the LTTEor Al-Qaeda or any of the other organizations on thislist said we want amicus briefs, and somebody providedan amicus brief --separate --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Without pay.GENERAL KAGAN:  -- for themselves -- for48Alderson Reporting Company19202122232425   statute.  What Congress did, when in response to someOfficial 1 2 3 4   harmonica would be unlawful.  You are teaching -- 5   training them in a lawful -- in a specialized activity. 6   So how do we -- there has to be something more than 7   merely a congressional finding that any training is bad. 8               GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I think here we have 9   the congressional definition of what kind of training10   is bad, and that definition focuses on training in11   specialized activities.  Now, you say, well, maybe12   training a -- playing a harmonica is a specialized13   activity.  I think the first thing I would say is there14   are not a whole lot of people going around trying to15   teach Al-Qaeda how to play harmonicas.16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, Mohammed Atta and his17   harmonica quartet might tour the country and make a lot18   of money.  Right?GENERAL KAGAN:  -- for the PKK itself.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under the definition ofthis statute, teaching these members to play the￼GENERAL KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  I --(Laughter.)GENERAL KAGAN:  But I don't mean to make funof the hypothetical at all, Justice Sotomayor, because Ithink you’re raising an important point, but it'sreally a point that goes to how to sensibly read a49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 lower court decisions, it further clarified and defined2 the word “training” and the word “expert advice and3 assistance,” I have to say I think that Congress's own4 responses here -- I mean, they -- Congress was both5 responsive and responsible, that it really took into6 account court decisions and tried to go back to the7 statute and --8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in that -- on the --9 just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried10 about the lawyer. You’re saying that a -- a group abroad11 which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume12 they do -- want to hire a lawyer. And this lawyer is supposed13 to file some amicus briefs and do other activities. You’re14 saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute,15 and that's constitutional?16 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, first of all,17 Justice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I18 -- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount19 of uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with20 respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect21 to this challenge --22 JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know if that's23 what you’re saying, what I just said: that an24 organization has American citizens, engages in25 terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the50￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who 2   does legal work like filing amicus briefs. 3               GENERAL KAGAN:  To the extent that there is 4   any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to 5   representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or 6   a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases, 7   that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in 8   civil cases, then the government believes that the 9   statute should be read so as not to include that.10               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do these hypotheticals11   make any difference?  This is an as-applied challenge.12   We should look to the activities that this organization13   wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there14   is an overbreadth problem.  And that seems to me -- I'mOfficial￼15161718   speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal.  That19   being the case, of what relevance are thesenot even sure that the Petitioners assert that here.            Clearly, the -- the broad scope of thisstatute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of20   hypotheticals?  It's a lot of fun, and it's very21 22 23 24 25interesting, but we can deal with all of that when thesituations arise, can't we?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I -- I do think thatthe answer to that is yes, Justice Scalia.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The answer on the other51Alderson Reporting Company1   side is:  All we want to do is speak about lawful2   activities.  We’re not supplying any guns, any3   communication equipment.  We just want to speak about4 5 6 7 8 9lawful activities.            And I go back to my failure to understand yourline between, yes, you can communicate with thesepeople, but you can't communicate about going abouttheir aims through peaceful means.1011121314   communicate on -- I don't mean to interrupt.  But youOfficial￼            GENERAL KAGAN:  No, I think my line is youcan communicate, but you can't provide material support.You can't make a donation, whether it's tangible orintangible.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  You can151617181920   on your own, for sure.  Independent advocacy of all kinds21   is not touched by this statute.  In addition to that --22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Justice Ginsburg's23   question is:  Can you advocate peaceful means?  And let's24   assume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get25   more interest in their organization, the organization52can communicate on your own, but you can't communicatewith them? GENERAL KAGAN:  No --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, okay.GENERAL KAGAN:  -- you can communicate with --Alderson Reporting Company6 7 8 9            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And here's how to do it.And here's how to go to the U.N., and here's how toapply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief.Official1   becomes stronger for all purposes.  Can you do that?2   That was Justice Ginsburg's question.3               GENERAL KAGAN:  Can you say to an4   organization:  Look, you guys really should lay down your5   arms.  And two things --￼            GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, now you can't,because when you tell people here's how to apply foraid and here's how to represent yourself withininternational organizations or within the U.S. Congress,you've given them an extremely valuable skill that theycan use for all kinds of purposes, legal or illegal.And it's not sufficient for the Petitioners --1011121314151617   communicate, but the communications are censored.  That’s18   -- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you19   can attend meetings, you can discuss things, but thereJUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you can -- you can20   are only -- there’s a certain point at which the discussion21   must stop, right?22               GENERAL KAGAN:  The discussion must stop23   when you -- when you go over the line into giving24   valuable advice, training, support to these25   organizations.  At that point --53Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask a sort of basic 2   question that I’ve had trouble with throughout the 3   whole argument?  We’re talking about whether this is an 4   as-applied challenge or on its face.  And what the 5   district judge did was hold part of the statute 6   unconstitutional as being too vague:  the words “training” 7   and “advice,” et cetera.  Why isn't that a facial8 decision? 9               GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, the -- both the10   lower courts -- I think the district court and the11   court of appeals, I think, had a kind of confused analysis12   here, which is that they said, well, it's vague as applied.13   The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague14   on its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here,15   and yet they appeared to incorporate aspects of overbreadth16   analysis into their as-applied claim.  I think --17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unless you're in an18   overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an19   as-applied challenge.  A statute can be vague as applied￼202122232425to certain conduct, although the core conduct that itcovers is clearly covered.            GENERAL KAGAN:  No, that's --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have cases like that.            GENERAL KAGAN:  That's exactly right,Justice Scalia, and -- and -- and with respect to the54Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9as-applied vagueness claim, the government's position isthere's -- there's -- there -- it's not vague, becauseyou can go through these declarations, you can gothrough these complaints, and you can know exactly what'sincluded within --same -- not.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but I have theGENERAL KAGAN:  -- the statute and what'sOfficial￼1012   because there hasn't been a prosecution.  And vagueness                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I had the same question as11   Justice Stevens.  It's a very odd as-applied challenge1314151617181920   applied to certain things.  Or maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I21   am missing some case.as applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, itseems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague.I don’t understand that, but --GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, it --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I can't -- I can'tthink of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in adeclaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as22               GENERAL KAGAN:  No, I -- I -- I don't think23   you are wrong, Justice Kennedy, and especially with24   respect to a case where all the activity is -- clearly25   fits in one box or the other.  In other words, you can55Alderson Reporting Company10111213   always are when it comes to applying statutes.  TheOfficial1   go through the complaints, you can go through the2   declarations, and know exactly what is covered and what's3   not covered.  All the independent --4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that’s -- I'm5   not -- I'm not sure that's right.  I mean, expert advice or6   assistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell,7   you know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know,8   resolution or whatever.  Is that expert advice?  Is that9   specialized knowledge?  And I understand training,￼service, personnel, but that one's a little hard to --              GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, as I said,Mr. Chief Justice, there will be some hard cases, there1415161718192021222324   pretty clear in this case.  If you read the declarations,25   if you read the complaints, the expertise of these56question is never are there hard cases.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, my -- my pointis that this --            GENERAL KAGAN:  The question is theindeterminacy.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  My point is thateven knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hardto decide whether that's based on specialized knowledgeor not.GENERAL KAGAN:  I think it -- it actually isAlderson Reporting Company3456   brought under this Act?  It was my understanding that7   those were for supplying weapons, supplying otherOfficial1   parties actually shines through.  Judge Fertig is proud2   of his expertise, justifiably so.  He has --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does this -- what --what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it haveany resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have8   equipment.  Are there any prosecutions that are -- that￼9 10 1113141516171819202122232425aim at training to pursue the organization's aimsthrough peaceful means?                 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I think12   that this is not the typical case.  This is, of course,a case that might never have reached this Court, exceptthat it was brought as a declaratory judgment action.For the most part, what the government prosecutes arecases which involve a wide variety of support to foreignterrorist organizations.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Specifically, does thisparticular man have to be prosecuted?            GENERAL KAGAN:  I'm sorry?            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is this particularindividual in risk of being prosecuted if he makes thespeech to the United Nations?            GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Stevens, I dobelieve that this individual can make whatever speeches57Alderson Reporting Company4 5 6 7 8 9a different thing.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  And is there evidence thathe would be prosecuted if he --            GENERAL KAGAN:  Of course, that's a10111213   somebody for making a potential speech?  That's really14   what we are fighting about, I think.Official1   he wants at the United Nations.  To the extent that he2   is acting as a representative or as an agent of the PKK,3   he does fall within the contours of the statute.  That'sdifferent thing as to how prosecutorial judgment is usedto decide which are the high-priority cases and whichare the low-priority cases.￼            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But in essence, this is anaction to enjoin a potential prosecution against15               GENERAL KAGAN:  Again, the government did16   not bring this action.  Judge Fertig and the Petitioners17   brought this action to try to get a declaratory18   judgment.  As applied to them, the statute indeed19202122232425covers their various efforts or proposed activities ofbeing an agent of, of representing the PKK and the LTTE,that falls within the statute and I think makes theas-applied claim here not vague at all.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.            Mr. Cole, we’ll give you 5 minutes.               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE58Alderson Reporting Company18192021222324   as-applied challenge on declaratory relief.  The25   government doesn't seem to object to that procedure.59Official1234   of strict scrutiny.  The -- the -- Justice Kennedy, you5   asked, and a number of the Justices asked, doesn't itON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.  MR. COLE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I want to start by addressing the question 6   make a difference that what they've done is prohibited a 7   wide range of conduct and just some of that is speech? 8               Well, that's precisely an accurate 9   description of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen10   v. California.  It forbade breaches of peace through11   loud noises, through horse racing in the streets,12   through any kind of offensive conduct.  But when13   California applied that statute to the words on Mr.14   Cohen's jacket and then argued because we are not15   interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested16   in preserving the peace, however it’s breached, O'Brien17   should apply, the Court said no.  We deal here with the￼conviction resting solely upon speech, not upon anyseparately identifiable conduct.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I agree.  And thatwas as applied to a conviction.MR. COLE:  That's right.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just haven't seen anAlderson Reporting Company1415   to me.  They said:  We’ve been doing this kind of16   lawful activity.  We think it's our right, but we’re171819202122232425not going to risk going to jail for 15 years to doit.            The government has spent a decade arguingthat our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannotinform about international human rights.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If O'Brien applies, whatremains of your case?            MR. COLE:  If O'Brien applies, then I thinkthe Court would still be applying the scrutiny that60Official 1               MR. COLE:  No.  Well, the government doesn't 2   object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v. 3   Wisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent.  But, 4   again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet 5   with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact, 6   the House report says that you are free to speak with 7   and on behalf of a designated group. 8               But then you have a statute that says, if 9   you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them10   anything that’s derived from specialized knowledge, if11   you tell them anything of specific skill, you're --12   you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for13 15 years.￼That's why the Humanitarian Law Project cameAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable 2   fit between the specific speech that's at issue here, 3   speech on issues of public concern, advocating only 4   lawful activity, and the -- and that the government 5   legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support 6   for terrorism?  Now -- 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That analysis of the 8   activities that you are proposing has not been done by 9   the lower courts, correct?10               MR. COLE:  Well, the lower courts struck --11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They -- they haven't --12   they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --13               MR. COLE:  Right.  The --14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- none of the courts15   either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the16   reasonable fit --17               MR. COLE:  No, and, in fact, the government18   has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict19   scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy20   strict scrutiny.  And under this -- under Cohen, strict￼21 22 23 24 25scrutiny is what must be applied here.            In addition --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why don't -- whydon't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strictscrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply61Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6   not content neutral.  This is a statute that doesn't bar 7   all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech.  It permits 8   unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they 9   advocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even10   if they are advocating peace.11               So -- so there are -- the -- the lower12   court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our13   clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right14   to engage in this activity.  I think you can reach that15   result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by16   applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is17   so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact,18   undermines the fit, because people are chilled from19   engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want20   to prohibit.21               All right, if I am told you -- you -- you’ll22   go to jail if you tell them anything that’s derived from23 special --24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Cole, there were25   congressional findings that money is fungible first for62here?            MR. COLE:  I think it would be appropriateto remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny ifyou read it that O'Brien doesn't apply.O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911   to teach them how to advocate for lawful human rights12   or --131415161718   in Sri Lanka.  So what’s left is solely -- has nothing19   to do with money.Officialterrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money forlegitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off andused for illegitimate means.            MR. COLE:  Right.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, why isn't that enough,either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard,reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teachthese groups how to get money?￼                 MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, one -- well, we’re not10   -- we’re not teaching them how to get money.  We’re seeking            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, one of your -- oneof your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is toteach them how to get aid for tsunami relief.            MR. COLE:  Right.  That -- that claim hasbeen mooted because the LTTE is no longer -- has no role20               Secondly, Congress only made a finding about21   money.  At the same time that it made a finding that22   money is fungible, it said this is a statute -- and23   this is from the House report -- only affects one’s24   contribution of financial and material resources and25   does not prohibit speaking in concert with and on behalf63Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324of designated groups.Well, that suggests that Congress thoughtthat what our clients want to do is -- should be protected. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.MR. COLE: And we have suggested that you should, therefore, interpret the statute in -- consistent withthat. Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
