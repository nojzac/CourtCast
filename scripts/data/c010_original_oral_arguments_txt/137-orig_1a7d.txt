Wyoming and North Dakota.General Bullock.ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCKON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFMR. BULLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The Tongue and Powder Rivers are the onlysignificant water supply in a 10,000-square-mile area in Montana and Wyoming, and this Court is being asked to decide whether the compact allows Wyoming to take the return flows that Montana farmers in that area have always relied on or, instead, affords protection to both States. Our exception should be sustained for three reasons.First, the plain language of the compact preserves the water supply each State was receiving as of 1950. Second, contrary to the compact's purposes, the Master's interpretation would allow individual water users to alter those amounts. And, third, the Master's policy determinations about efficiency add ambiguity to the principles underlying a century of western water3Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 law. On that -­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Bullock, would3 you please point to the precise language of the compact4 that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the5 amount of water diverted -- which freezes consumption as6 of January 1st, 1950?7 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor. In the8 compact, it's at the appendix of the Master's first9 interim report. Two areas: first, the preamble10 provides for an equitable division/apportionment11 water; and then the operative provision, article12 states that the uses existing as of January 1st,13 in each signatory State shall continue to be enjoyed.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the uses existing15 is irrigation.16 I don't see where it says -- and so I can17 understand, the amount of water diverted can't be18 increased.19 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, the whole of20 article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that21 it's the full allocation of the water. So V(B) is water22 after 1950; V(A) is prior. And in order for the status23 quo to be -- remain -- for the appropriative right to24 beneficial uses existing in Montana as of 1950, there25 needs to be a water supply. And also operative to that,4of the V(A), 1950,￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 it's within the definitions at article II(H), is2 beneficial use. And that's a derivation or departure3 from the general prior appropriation law, because it's4 that use by which a5 when usefully used.6 JUSTICE7 language in article8 -- simply restate the issue before us, what is a9 beneficial use by the upstream owner?10 MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it need not11 because in article II(H) it defines what a beneficial12 use is, and that's that use by which the water supply of13 a basin is depleted. And it's that depletion that -- as14 of 1950, so it wasn't a full consumption of water in15 Wyoming, and that depletion is the return flow upon16 which Montanans rely.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the essence18 -- that's the essence of the argument before us. The19 depletion was the amount of water that was taken from20 this water source to irrigate the crops. The -- the21 issue now before us is whether beneficial use means22 consumption or it means use, isn't it?23 I -- you're begging the question in my mind,24 because I don't -- what source do you have for the fact25 that a return flow is beneficial use?5water supply is depletedKENNEDY: But why doesn't theV(A) -- and this is not too helpful￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, the return flow is2 the basis of Montana's water right, so that the return3 flow under the compact isn't actually beneficial use.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not actually5 true. Their water right was the beneficial use that6 your pre-1950 consumers used, meaning you had consumers7 who were irrigating their own crops, who were doing8 other things with the water. The rights protected are9 their pre-1950 uses. You're putting -- you're -- you're10 still equating consumption as -- as being their use, but11 I don't know where you get that equation from.MR. BULLOCK: The equation, Your Honor, that is the same thing as -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As use.MR. BULLOCK: -- as use?1213 consumption 1415161718 the Special19 exploring -- I mean, the beneficial use reflects the20 historic consumptive use. It's from his own textbook.21 It's on page 82. The Master says that a senior's right22 is limited to the amount he originally beneficially23 applied and consumptively used; that is, the amount24 received at the point of use minus the runoff.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could someone pre-19506￼JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.MR. BULLOCK: Well, we could go actually to Master, who himself had stated that whenAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 who irrigated crops change the crops?2 MR. BULLOCK: It's -- it's an open question,3 Your Honor. Yes, they certainly could, but not if it4 impacted a downstream appropriator, as per this compact.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How in the world do any6 States monitor that? The change in crops, the change in7 irrigation methods, the change in anything that would8 cause a difference in return flow? Let's assume global9 warming in some form or another evaporated more water,10 and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused11 a greater evaporation. Is that a breach of the compact?12 So two questions embedded in there. How13 does any State monitor that, the change in crops or14 change in irrigation methods? And, second, how far does15 it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their16 water?17 MR. BULLOCK: To the first question, Your18 Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that19 this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its20 maximum practical limit. So each individual downstream21 knows how much water they should be getting. I mean, we22 have 80 years of measurements on one of these rivers23 alone, and you could go online right now and find out24 what the flow is at the State line occurring as of this25 morning.7￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425So a piece of it that this is something we've been doing for a long time in the west as far as knowing what water is in the river, where it is, and throughout, you know, downstream appropriation.To the second question -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all that shows is -­or might show in a particular case, is that the amount of water is reduced. Now the -- then the question is have the senior appropriators or the upstream appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're right -- again right where we started from. And then you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using the appropriative right.MR. BULLOCK: And, Your Honor, you don't -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the -- so the flows don't necessarily answer the question.MR. BULLOCK: Well, Your Honor, it's ultimately up to each State to administer their rights and their water intrastate. But this is a compact among sovereigns. So what we need, what Montana needs, is to get that supply of water that it was receiving as of 1950.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you -- this is8Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 where it's been talking about beneficial uses. What the2 compact said -- says is appropriative rights to3 beneficial uses. And to me that suggests, which I4 always understood to be the way water law worked in the5 west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water,6 and the appropriative right is you have the right to7 take out however much you were taking out. And the fact8 that less comes back, that's something different. That9 doesn't affect your appropriation.10 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, even at the time11 of the compact, that Wyoming recognized their paper12 rights, that appropriative right was much more than the13 actual use occurring. So you can't read beneficial use14 out of -- especially under this compact, but in any.15 Even under the general common law, you only have an16 appropriative right for the beneficial use, and all17 along -­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that19 what's going on here? The beneficial use is irrigation20 of crops. They have an appropriative right to take out21 so much flow for that. That's all they're doing.22 They're doing it now, just as they were back then. They23 just use up more of it once they've taken it out.24 MR. BULLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, two things,25 the first of which, the beneficial use is -- I mean, we9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 can't read this definition of beneficial use out of the2 contract -- or out of the compact. And it is a3 contract, actually, among States. And, also, though -­4 second of which, though, that it's also a fundamental5 tenet of prior appropriation law -- is the downstream6 irrigator takes, given the same conditions as when he7 first got his or her right.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Given the same conditions.9 But is there any evidence, or can you say anything from10 the record or any other place, going back to 1950 -- I11 assume in 1950 people knew how much the different12 landowners were taking out of the stream of the river in13 Wyoming to use for irrigation and other such purposes.14 They knew that.15 Is there any indication they knew at that16 time how much each individual landowner was putting17 back? I think the answer is "no." But I'd be very18 interested if it's "yes." And I think it would help you19 a lot if it's "yes," because I'm -­20 (Laughter.)21 JUSTICE BREYER: To tell you the truth, I'm22 pretty skeptical of the fact that they're writing an23 appropriation right into this about regulating something24 they don't even know about.25 MR. BULLOCK: Effectively, Your Honor, it10￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 could be yes.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't say it could3 be yes. I would like you to tell me if the answer is4 yes, and then, of course, I'm going to ask you -­5 MR. BULLOCK: Sure.6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where in the record I7 find something that says that they knew how much each8 individual landowner is putting back into this river in9 Wyoming. And I think you can't answer that question,10 can you?11 MR. BULLOCK: I certainly cannot answer12 that, and they didn't need to know, from the13 perspective -­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they didn't? In other15 words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but16 you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they17 were regulating here is they're saying, not only you18 get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to19 do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but20 they didn't even know what the number was, whether it21 was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is22 ambiguous? I think -- I think I can go that far with23 you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go24 further.2511￼I mean, that's my basic question. It's -­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 did you see what it was? Was I clear? Not too?2 MR. BULLOCK: I -­3 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying, how can you4 read this treaty to require landowners to put back5 amounts into the river that they didn't even know what6 they were?7 MR. BULLOCK: First, Your Honor, the8 individual landowner does not have to put water back in9 that they didn't even know what they were. What they do10 need to do is make sure that the beneficial -- the11 appropriative right to beneficial use is existing in12 both States. The Solicitor General pointed out that we13 don't break up V(A) and V(B) and put one group priority14 over the other, but existing as of 1950 in both States15 shall continue to be enjoyed. So the only way that we16 can continue to enjoy the rights in Montana downstream17 is to ensure that we have the water supplies that we18 had -­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say you get the20 same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to21 Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not22 putting back enough to meet that amount? You don't care23 what private owner it comes from? It's up to Wyoming to24 figure out who has to be cut back?25 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't say we -­12￼Alderson Reporting Company12345 what -- the 6JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you. (Laughter.)MR. BULLOCK: Sorry?JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I think that is answer is yes, isn't it?Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. BULLOCK: Yes, but -- but, Your Honor, 7 we don't say the exact same quantity of water. We say8 under like water supplies.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under like water supplies,10 yes.11 MR. BULLOCK: Yes. And -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you tell me the -- I13 didn't get the page of the Special Master's report which14 you asserted adopts your -- your definition of15 beneficial use. What page was it?16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought you referred us,17 just while you're going through your notes, to page 82,18 and there's an intriguing footnote where the Special19 Master talks about his own -- his own book. But that20 doesn't seem to me to be conclusive on your point,21 because he's saying the area is confused. And his point22 -- it seems to me it brings up what the special -- I'm23 taking over your answer to Justice Scalia's question.24 It is page 82, footnote -­25 MR. BULLOCK: Footnote 15, yes, Your Honor.13￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425page, yes. about -­say it says.JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's a footnote on that MR. BULLOCK: And there he's talkingJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to say what youOfficial - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE ALITO: If your understanding is correct, would the result be that landowners in Wyoming would only be allowed to consume as much as they consumed in 1950, but landowners in Montana could take advantage of improved irrigation techniques and use much more of the -- they could divert the same amount of water, but they could use much more of it?￼be the case.MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, that would notJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't it?MR. BULLOCK: First, for the irrigators in Montana -- I mean, one of the things -- Montana sought to have a system of interstate administration. Montana -- or Wyoming, through storage, through curtailing consumption by post-'50 users, or otherwise can administer its water rights in however it so deems. So, ultimately, that's a decision of the State of how it administers the water rights and the consumption of that amount that it has.14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 For Montana, we can't increase consumption2 any more than the water that we would have received at3 that point. So to the extent that Montana allows an4 individual irrigator to go to 100 percent of consumption5 of its water right, then in our system in Montana, we6 have to deal with what's going to happen to the7 subsequent appropriator right downstream.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what happens9 Montana law?under10 MR. BULLOCK: Under Montana law, if11 an injury, and that's -- that's actually -- and12 Special Master pointed this out in another one of his13 footnotes, that that still would be actionable. Like a14 change from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation, to15 the extent that it deprives a downstream user of waters16 that they're relying on, that they could bring an17 action.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but your people can do19 that. Your people can get more use out of the same20 amount of water diverted by going to sprinkler21 irrigation, whereas the people in Wyoming can't. That's22 a little unfair, it seems to me. Right?23 MR. BULLOCK: Both can, Your Honor. I mean,24 that -- that is -- I guess the presumption is that we25 would have the water to use it, and Wyoming is actually15there's the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 getting a lot more production by consuming a lot more of2 the water within its right.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your people are entitled to4 take out the same amount they took out before, right?5 Pre-1950?6 MR. BULLOCK: Under like water supply7 conditions -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas the people in9 Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same10 amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that11 they had before. Whereas downstream your people can12 take out the same amount and whereas before 20 percent13 of it used to go back into the stream, they can now make14 use of that whole 20 percent through sprinkler15 irrigation, right? It gives you a great advantage.16 I mean, maybe that's the way it was written,17 but -- but don't tell me that this is even-handed,18 because it -­19 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, I don't think that20 it does give us a great advantage, because we still have21 to deal with the same amount of water supply that we22 would have had. So, at that point, if we switch to23 sprinkler irrigation, the first irrigator does that,24 there's going to be a shortage down river unless we make25 it up through additional storage or other causes. So -­16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have ultimate2 liability to Montana -- pardon me -- to North Dakota for3 -- for overuse?4 MR. BULLOCK: We do a little bit, Your5 Honor. There's the picture of the basin in the first6 appendix.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I won't -- I won't8 get into that, but it does seem to me that the Chief9 Justice asked the question, if you're entitled to take10 the water, you can use it for any purpose. I -- I take11 it the answer to that is it has to be a beneficial use,12 it has to be for approximately the same crop, but that13 brings us to this -- to this gray area that the Special14 Master refers to on page 82 as confusing. And I15 think -- was it page 65 -- he talks about this is a16 confusing area of the law.17 What is your best authority for your18 position? What is the best authority? Do you have a19 case or a -- a paragraph in a treatise that's -­20 MR. BULLOCK: Sure. Yes, Your Honor. In21 1992, the Utah Supreme Court framed the question: This22 court's called upon to determine the applicable law when23 the use of new technology impacts -­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Utah case is your best25 case?17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. BULLOCK: That's -- that's the only case2 that any of the parties cited that actually deals with3 the change from sprinkler -- or flood to sprinkler4 irrigation. And what that said is if the return flow5 goes to the same river which it came from, that6 subsequent irrigators or downstream appropriators have7 the right to rely on that.8 And I guess I'd say that my second best case9 is the Special Master's own footnote. It's 69/12, where10 he says that, you know, even though State change11 procedures don't typically apply to crop or -- changes12 in crop irrigation techniques, this does not mean13 there's no way to challenge increases in efficiency.14 Downstream water users, for example, could sue to enjoin15 an upstream appropriator from increasing consumption or16 to force the upstream appropriator to replace lost17 runoff.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think your best19 point is not all of that stuff, but simply the20 definition section, which very clearly makes a21 distinction between beneficial use and diversion. And22 your point is that what is guaranteed is not the23 diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the24 beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water,25 not -- not the total amount diverted.18￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425If -- if there were not both of those definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your case would be a little harder. But with the two of those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial use rather than -- it could have said diversion, appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say that. It said to beneficial use.Well, why -- why define beneficial use that way if you don't mean it? That's your best point, isn't it?MR. BULLOCK: I -- I agree, Your Honor. (Laughter.)MR. BULLOCK: I was trying to -- I believeJustice Kennedy asked for a case or a treatise, so that's -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, all right.MR. BULLOCK: But I agree that the plain language -- and especially in an area where there's so much ambiguities the Special Master acknowledges, why change the status quo of what was occurring? And that's -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand why that's a good -- good answer. I mean, thebeneficial use is that use by which the water supply is depleted. Well, the use here is irrigation. It doesn't19Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 say irrigation up to the technological development in2 1950. They're still taking out the same amount of water3 for that beneficial use. They're using it to irrigate.4 And if they5 that's just67 depleting more from the basin, and that's -- I mean, you8 can have beneficial use for non-consumptive purposes.get better at it so they use more, well, too bad for you.MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, but they're9 JUSTICE BREYER: That's back where -- that's10 where I was here, too. See, I can't get too far -- I11 mean, you have the word "depletion" in that definition.12 I -- I -- that might help you. But I'm thinking in13 accordance with the doctrine of appropriation, what does14 that doctrine, that legal doctrine, say about use and15 return? And that's why we're -- we're -- why I was16 thinking it seems totally unclear.17 It talks about seepage, the cases, which I18 gather is different from return. Okay. So could they19 have really meant net? And what struck me is that they20 couldn't, which -- which you were beginning to address,21 too, is that they couldn't have meant net because the22 water law at that time is unlikely to have meant net for23 the reason that they didn't -- you don't know what's￼24 coming back. 25Do you see? It's not just -- I see your20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 point. Your point is, well, Wyoming knew how much was2 going into Wyoming. But that's not my point. My point3 is what -- what's the water law? What's the law of4 appropriation at that time in respect to return flows?5 And if people didn't measure return flows in general, I6 suspect in an ambiguous area they would have analogized7 it to seepage, which is what the -- what the Special8 Master thought.9 MR. BULLOCK: Your Honor, the10 though, deal with adjoining landowners -­11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they -­12 MR. BULLOCK: -- not the same13 and the Special Master acknowledged that.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.seepage cases,river flow,￼15 MR. BULLOCK: That -- and I guess what I was16 earlier trying to explain is certainly each appropriator17 knows how much water it would -- would be receiving,18 what the flows typically are, and they all basically19 judge on that. But I guess if there's any ambiguity -­20 and the law wasn't necessarily clear as of 1950 on21 conversions from flood to sprinkler irrigation, but what22 we were trying to do is preserve those uses in both23 States existing as of January 1st, 1950, and we can't do24 that without a water supply.25 Other than the text, I think that the next21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 place that one would look in interpreting the compact2 would be the legislative history. And I think that the3 report to the Senate was real good in saying that -­4 and this is part of -- it's appended to motion --5 Montana's brief in response to the motion to dismiss the6 bill of complaint. At 3a it says, "It's clear then that7 the demand of one State upon another for a supply8 different from that now obtaining under present9 conditions of supply and diversion is not contemplated,10 nor would such a demand have a legal standing."11 So what they were trying to do in 1950 is12 protect what each State was doing.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that again -­14 where at?15 MR. BULLOCK: That's at 3a of the appendix,16 Montana's motion -- or the response to Wyoming's motion17 to dismiss the bill of complaint.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Bullock, assume19 that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same20 amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and21 I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with22 this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming23 do? It can't tell the -- the farmers go back to the old24 way of irrigating or go back to a different crop?25 MR. BULLOCK: No -- I mean, no, Justice22￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Ginsburg. Wyoming could choose to reduce groundwater2 pumping. They could choose to curtail irrigation on3 post-1950. They could choose to release storage. I4 mean, they've -- they've built, I think, 15 new5 reservoirs in Wyoming since the date of the compact.6 They could choose to release water from that to fulfill7 those rights.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you say it doesn't -­9 they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether10 farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in11 1950 -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950;12 they just have to know what the total amount is, and13 Wyoming can make that up?14 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So really -- I'm sorry.16 The issue is, are both of you -- both of you have pre­17 and post-1950 users?18 MR. BULLOCK: Yes, Your Honor.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And I -- I20 guess this goes to the second question, which was sort21 of not really addressed. The Special Master said, well,22 you could cut back your post-1950 users and satisfy all23 of the needs of your pre-1950 users. Why isn't that the24 answer? Why isn't that an answer that should be25 respected, because you can satisfy all of the pre-195023￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 needs that you have potentially?2 MR. BULLOCK: No, Your Honor, we can't3 necessarily satisfy all the needs. The drafters did say4 even as of 1950 that this basin reached its maximum5 practicable limit for irrigation, and that's from the6 October -- the last of the drafters meetings. So -- so,7 the water supply as of then, without additional storage,8 had already hit that limit. And, ultimately, what we9 need, though, is -- each State will administer10 intrastate, but we still should be able to rely on the11 ability to get a supply of water to meet those needs as12 of 1950 under like water supply conditions.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before any 1950 use?14 Post-1950 users are permitted?15 MR. BULLOCK: We're still at the stage of16 discovery, but, yes, likely that's how it would occur,17 Your Honor.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't this a19 premature lawsuit? Because I think really the essence20 of your claim is we need the pre-1950 water flow. We21 don't care who it comes from. And what -- all the22 Special Master said, in my mind, was the difference -­23 you can't look to what the pre-1950s were doing in this24 situation, but I haven't addressed what the posts are25 going to do or have been doing and whether that's right,24￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 and that's depriving you of the water flow.2 I don't know if he answered that question.3 Are you, in fact, entitled to a minimum amount of water4 flow? That's really what should be the point of the5 issue, isn't it?6 MR. BULLOCK: It is, or that quantity under7 like water supply conditions. I don't think it's8 premature. We've tried to administer this compact,9 actually made calls in 2004 and 2006; and as a result of10 not getting11 water-short12 13the water, knowing -- believing we're in a time, that's when we filed this action.I'd like to reserve my time if I may.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michael.￼1415 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KENNETH MICHAEL16 ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT WYOMING17 MR. MICHAEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it18 please the Court:19 The Court has identified in previous20 questioning this case at this point in this issue21 involves whether a Wyoming or a Montana diverter may22 change cropping patterns, may change various23 technologies in irrigated agriculture, and change up and24 down, depending on the year and the fallowing of land25 and that sort of thing, the amount of water that is25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 actually consumed by crops. And I think the Court has2 identified the critical fact that a water right, a3 classic western water right, appropriative right as in4 article V(A), is made up of the right to divert an5 amount of water at a head gate in an irrigation6 situation, put it on a defined quantity of land, and use7 it for a purpose, irrigation, that's defined by the8 State. Wyoming has had such a -- a system in place for9 many years and controls those issues but does not and10 has not attempted to measure consumptive.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what is the12 controlling principle in answering the question that I13 think you properly put? Could these irrigators switch14 to something like rice, which absorbs a tremendous15 amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops16 it must be reasonably close to the earlier beneficial17 use? What is -- what is the standard that we look to,18 to answer that question?19 MR. MICHAEL: The standard is the standard20 of waste, practical irrigation.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The standard of?22 MR. MICHAEL: Waste, of not wasting water,23 practical irrigation. The irrigation right is a general24 right, and if rice were to double the amount of25 consumptive use by the crop, that would be permissible26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 if the previous use had not been affected by an2 abandonment action, because the amount of water was3 being reasonably used for the former crop and the crop4 has changed. So it's not a question of -- of percentage5 change.6789 suppose theJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought -­MR. MICHAEL: It's a question -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the first -­first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water 50 percent by seepage. The second crop that to still absorbs just 50 percent of the10 and returns11 they switch12 water but because of the -- of the pattern, the other 5013 percent just evaporates?14 MR. MICHAEL: The -- the way that the water15 is -- there's -- there's a basket, Your Honor. There's16 a basket that starts with a quantity that's taken at the17 head gate, 4 cubic feet per second put on the -- on the18 field. And within that quantity there -- there's19 multiple -- two components, basically: the amount20 consumed by the crop -- I should say the amount consumed21 by the crop or depleted by other elements, ditches,22 seepage, other types of things, deep percolation into23 the ground -- and -- and the other component which is24 water that's not lost but can return or go somewhere.25 It's not evaporated; there's no transpiration. So￼27Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 there's those two components.2 And if that -- if that quantity, that3 division changes, that's perfectly permissible within4 the use of the water right. And the reason for that was5 set out in Wiel's -- Samuel Wiel's text in 1911, carried6 forward in texts and cases ever since, that -- and in7 the Binning case, a 1940 case in Wyoming; which is the8 water while it's in the stream in the public common is9 -- is not under the possession and control -- the10 personal property control of the irrigator.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we're dealing here with12 a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water13 law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot14 overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact15 that article V(A) says appropriative rights to the16 beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River17 System existing as of January 1, 1950. Appropriative18 rights not to diversion, not to diversion for beneficial19 uses, but appropriative rights to the beneficial uses,20 which is defined -- which is defined in the compact to21 say "that use by which the water supply of a drainage22 basin is depleted when usefully employed."23 And it could have said diversion, but it24 didn't say that, and I notice that the Government's25 brief uses -- seems to use the words interchangeably,28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 "depletion" and "diversion." They're not2 interchangeable. They're defined quite separately in3 this thing. And besides which I find it implausible4 that Montana signed on to, well, we don't know how much5 water we're going to get; it depends, you know, upon how6 much stuff was -- was flowing back before, but we're not7 guaranteed that that will be flowing back again.8 You combine those two things, and I -- I -­9 what do you do about that definition?10 MR. MICHAEL: Your Honor, the definition has11 two components, the classic beneficial -- the component12 that would come from a classic beneficial use13 definition, which is useful employment for the14 activities of man, a beneficial purpose, which -- a non­15 wasteful purpose. That's the start.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not how it's17 defined.18 MR. MICHAEL: That's -- that's the last19 portion. That's the second part.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine.21 MR. MICHAEL: The first part is use by which22 the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted. In23 the western United States, a drainage basin -­24 appropriable water is not all the water in the air and25 on the land and dropping from the sky; appropriable29￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425water is water confined in a water course. The Binning case made that clear. Until the water returned from the field into a water course, it was not appropriable by the downstream user. So this definition -- by using the-­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you addressing the word "depleted"?MR. MICHAEL: I'm addressing the word "supply" of the drainage basin; and then it is depleted. Use by which the supply, the water supply of a drainage basin, is depleted.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you saying that "depleted" means only what's withdrawn, and it's not calculated by -- with reference to what is returned?MR. MICHAEL: That's correct.JUSTICE BREYER: But you -- obviously, you're saying -­MR. MICHAEL: That is different from"diverted."JUSTICE BREYER: You read it with a different emphasis. Justice Scalia read it with -­ beneficial use is that use by which the water supply of a drainage basin "is depleted" when usefully employed by the activities of man.And you read it: By which the water supply30Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of a drainage basin is depleted "when usefully employed by the activities of man." So that it is a definition in respect to how you use it, not amounts.But if you emphasize the word "depleted," it could be read as referring to amounts, and not quality of use, not nature. And -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you emphasize both of them?JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, well -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm willing to emphasize both, but you can't write out the "depleted" out of the -- how does your definition of "depleted" differ from -­ from "diversion"?MR. MICHAEL: If you had a broader -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the diversion for a beneficial use the same thing as a depletion?MR. MICHAEL: May I give an example?In a -- in a river, the Tongue River, if there is a -- if there is a waterwheel, Montana allows water rights. A 1912 case, Hennessy v. Featherman, allows a water right to push a waterwheel. That waterOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼flowing down the river does diverted. And nevertheless right.This definition31not -- does not -- is notit -- it would allow a waterdifferentiates that. InAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 this definition under the compact, water that is2 diverted for agriculture, that is diverted is a3 beneficial use, but there's a small segment of -- of4 what could be a legitimate water right that is excluded5 under this definition.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but, I mean, to -- to7 do that, the definition would have read: The term8 "beneficial use" is defined to be that use by which the9 water -- that use "for which" the water supply of a10 drainage basin is diverted for useful employment by the11 activities of man, and that's not what it says. To the12 contrary, it makes a clear distinction between13 "depletion" and the previous definition of "diversion."14 I just -- I was trying to give that stark15 difference some effect in the later section V(A).16 MR. MICHAEL: Let me say this, Your Honor,17 if I might: The -- you will find in -- in the compact,18 in article V(B), the use of both "diversion" and19 "beneficial use."20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.21 MR. MICHAEL: And so we have two -- those22 terms are both used. And in V(B) the drafters made a23 distinction; they said direct diversions or storage24 would be covered by V(B), and then they said how25 diversions are counted.32￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where -­MR. MICHAEL: In (C) they talk about the -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: What part of V(B) are youtalking about?MR. MICHAEL: I'm talking about at thebottom of V(B), where you're talking about the three -­ the third-tier rights.JUSTICE SCALIA: The point of measurement shall be below the last diversion?MR. MICHAEL: No, V(B). In the first text, the first paragraph of V(B), towards the bottom, the text says: "And the remainder of the unused and unappropriated water is allocated to each State for storage and direct diversions for beneficial use on new lands."JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me -­JUSTICE SCALIA: For -- exactly. I mean, there it talks about diversions for beneficial use and not depletion for beneficial use. I mean, I think that's something different.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I -­ MR. MICHAEL: Your Honor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer -- doyou see a difference? Finish that, and then could I just clarify something from what you were just reading?33Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company10111213 for that is? 14Official - Subject to Final Review1 MR. MICHAEL: I think there's a difference2 in that the -- in practical terms, the depletion -- in3 the depletion and the beneficial use definition, a4 diversion would be the only way to deplete that. And5 that's -- that's the point. The only way to make it6 through a depletion -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so, once again, you're8 saying that depletion is a calculation of what is taken9 without reference to what returns?MR. MICHAEL: Yes, Your Honor. And -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so when -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your best authorityMR. MICHAEL: The best authority, I think,15 is what the16 that the only practical way a water supply of the17 drainage basin would -- being the quantities of water in18 the rivers themselves, would be depleted would be19 through a diversion. So there's really no reason to20 make a distinction.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up on22 Justice Kennedy's point, because I think it's important:23 So you were reading -- when it says "is depleted," you24 think all you have to show is that it's less than when25 you started, and once that is shown, it is depleted.34￼-- the Special Master's discussion of this,Alderson Reporting Company3Official - Subject to Final Review1 Then you're saying, but we can deplete as much as we2 want?MR. MICHAEL: Yes, depletion would be moving4 it from this glass of water, if that was the river -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.MR. MICHAEL: -- and it reduces the quantity the river. That would be a depletion.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you don't care567 of water in89 how much? You're saying, well, this is a beneficial use10 because it depletes some of the water, it takes some11 away, and once we have gotten over that hurdle, all bets12 are off and 1314 water right 15we can deplete as much as we want.MR. MICHAEL: Yes. And, of course, the-­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess to get point, wouldn't the normal word be "divert"? MR. MICHAEL: It may well be, Your Honor.￼16 back to the 1718 There's -- there's some problems with this definition.19 It self-defines itself using "usefully" twice, so we20 have some drafting issues with -- with this -- in some21 of these.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I go back23 to my question, which is twofold? The first is the24 Solicitor General recommends that we defer the decision25 on remedies in this case, and Montana seems to agree.35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Do you agree as well? The second question presented.2 MR. MICHAEL: That has been deferred, is my3 understanding.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It has? My problem with5 this is -- and I think I need to understand what the6 fight is about here, or what the dispute is about -- it7 really does seem to me that it is a question of8 remedies, not about whether you're taking more water9 rights through irrigation or not.10 If I understand this compact right, both of11 you are protected in your pre-1950 beneficial uses.12 Each of you appear, under the terms of article V, to be13 entitled to get enough water to fill those uses. The14 next section, the one that you read earlier, lets you15 use things in the future for post-1950 uses, but only if16 the water supply's protected pre-1950 beneficial uses17 have received all they're entitled to. Neither of you18 are entitled or -- to take anything post-1950 until19 pre-1950 is protected.20 That's how I read article V. Am I reading21 it wrong? Because it seems to me that the only time22 that we get into a dispute -- and this is the part that23 I think your adversary may be right about, ultimately -­24 is it's not a consumptive compact, but it's a use25 compact, and both of you are entitled to get a full -­36￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that's what I'm reading article V to say, to get enough water to satisfy the beneficial uses before anybody's entitled to post-1950 water.Tell me what in the language of article V suggests something different than that understanding.MR. MICHAEL: I disagree -- the language in article V that disagrees with that is the very first few words, "appropriative rights." Appropriative rights do not guarantee that any water user or any group of water users will be satisfied. 1934 was a horrendously dry year in the basin, 50 percent -- flows were 50 percent less than normal. In those kinds of years, the river -­ the river dried up that year in parts of the river,so -- well -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this is not happening today, is it? There's -­MR. MICHAEL: Oh, yes. It happened in 2004.It-­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right, but that's an isolated year.MR. MICHAEL: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In most years, are you putting water to post-1950 use -- to post-1950 uses or not? Have you been regularly putting water to post-1950 uses?37Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MICHAEL: Both States, at times. Yes, last year, all post-1950 uses got satisfied. It varies widely. But the point is that only the appropriative right, which is not a guarantee of a quantity ofwater -- so the first clause of the compact, article V(A), does not establish a quantity of water, and there are many compacts that do this. They establish a quantity of water, and they do it -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree.MR. MICHAEL: -- quite simply.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree, but asI read the article, it says, you put all the water that's available to pre-1950 appropriated uses. You then go, as I read the second part of this article, to any water supplies that each State has until you fulfill those 1950 appropriated uses. And then it apportions, between the two of you, post-1950 percentages of the excess water that you're entitled to have.Am I correct about that structure?MR. MICHAEL: Yes, and on an ongoing basis. It's not a quantity. None of this is done in quantity.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.MR. MICHAEL: It's all done in a system that's dynamic.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's why -- I do38Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 understand the remedies were deferred, but to the extent2 that we were to rule that appropriated rights included3 the right to change irrigation methods or crops -- we4 don't have to reach crops, because that's not at issue5 here -- in the end, you're only entitled to take the6 appropriated uses, including irrigation rights, that7 existed pre-1950. Are they entitled to get as much8 water as necessary to satisfy their pre-1950 rights or9 not-­10 MR. MICHAEL: No.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- before you can use12 post-1950 water?13 MR. MICHAEL: Yes. Yes, before -- on these14 -- on those particular dates. On those particular15 dates, if there are pre-1950 rights in Montana that are16 not satisfied on that river and there's post-1950 rights17 in Wyoming, the Special Master has ruled, contrary to18 Wyoming's argument -­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But how -- why aren't20 you taking more of the percentage that way of post-195021 waters? The compact says, post-1950, you can take22 whatever percentage it was. I've forgotten what23 percentage that might have been.24 MR. MICHAEL: 60 percent.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whatever it was. 6039￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425percent -­Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. MICHAEL: This might add on that.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're entitled to 40. Does that mean you can take a hundred percent, because there happens to be more water that they can satisfy the pre-1950s users with? Why aren't they entitled to their 40 percent of whatever that big basin is so they can give more water to post-1950 users, that they can exploit their full 40 percent?MR. MICHAEL: Your Honor, I'm not following, because there's a distinction between each class of water.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, I understand that.MR. MICHAEL: And in your -- in your question, I'm not following which class you arereferring to.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- I'm answeringthis only -- I'm asking this because I know we've deferred decision on the remedies -­MR. MICHAEL: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but for me that is so integral to the issue here because when they talk about being entitled to a water flow, I see that as being entitled to a pre-1950 satisfaction of water needs or beneficial uses before anybody gets post-1950 water.40￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 And so, I see the only issue before us,2 because remedies have been put aside, as to whether the3 beneficial use includes some percentage increase because4 of irrigation demands, but so what? It just means it's5 going to limit post-1950 users. It's not going to limit6 the rights of the pre-1950 users.7 Everybody's entitled to change their8 irrigation methods. Everybody's entitled to change9 their crops. They appear not to be entitled to put the10 water to a new use, whatever -- however that's defined.11 We don't need to get there today, but I'm not sure how12 you're entitled to post-1950 uses while they're still13 not satisfied in 1950 use.14 MR. MICHAEL: We -- Wyoming is not entitled15 on the same river to take post-1950 water when there is￼16 a pre-1950 use in Montana that's not satisfied.17 Special Master has held that. Pre-1950s are -­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The question is19 MR. MICHAEL: He has -- the Special20 sorry.

You briefed it.MR. MICHAEL: Well, no, my understanding was the Court had simply sent it back to the Special Master for further consideration. That's all.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, thank you. Thank you, counsel.MR. MICHAEL: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Jay, maybe you can help clarify something. The -- the second question presented, which involves what Montana has to do before they -- that's still before us, right?ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAYON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING DEFENDANTSMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you want us -- you don't want us to reach it, but it's still before us.Official - Subject to Final Review￼please thewould hold exception,MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Court:The Court entered an order stating that it oral argument only on Montana's firstand that the second exception would be42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 recommitted to the Special Master. So for that -- for2 that reason the parties have addressed only the first3 exception in this argument today.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- but your5 brief, before we entered that order, said the Special6 Master was right, that they have to satisfy their needs7 from pre -- post-1950 users. Why? Aren't they entitled8 to their 40 percent of how much excess water there may9 be after their pre-1950 users have been satisfied in10 full? Doesn't this compact say both of their pre-195011 users have to be satisfied first?12 MR. JAY: Both of their pre-1950 users have13 to be satisfied first, yes, we agree with that, so that14 no one in Wyoming is supposed to be taking post-195015 water until pre-1950 users in Montana are satisfied. We16 agree with that.17 The -- the point on which -- that the Court18 has sent back to the Special Master is what happens if19 pre-1950 users in Montana are not satisfied but they20 could be because Montana post-1950 users in Montana are21 also diverting water. But what we think the -- the22 question squarely before the Court here is whether the23 right to recapture water gained from increased24 efficiency is part of the pre-1950 appropriative right,25 and that matters when there's not enough water in the43￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425river for both States to satisfy their pre-1950 appropriative rights. Forget about post-1950s, there's not enough water for -­JUSTICE BREYER: And so, on your theory in that situation where there isn't enough for all the pre-1950 people, it's Wyoming that gets all the water? And on their theory, it's surprising -- surprise, surprise -- it's Montana that gets all the water?(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: And there's no way to read this contract -- this compact so it's share and share alike?MR. JAY: Both States have affirmatively rejected the idea of a middle ground like that, Justice Breyer, because -­JUSTICE BREYER: There's no fair way to decide this case?MR. JAY: Well -- well, Justice Breyer, we -- we submit that enforcing the compact according what -- what the States signed up for -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It is fair.MR. JAY: Precisely. And -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I alwaysthought in addition that's kind of the way appropriation law works in the west, right? I mean, the person who44Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 gets it, gets it.2 (Laughter.)3 MR. JAY: Provided that -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The person who doesn't get5 it, gets it.6 (Laughter.)7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, I8 don't mean -- I mean, isn't that the difference between9 eastern water law and western water law? In the east,10 you try to allocate everything fairly so everyone is11 treated fairly, and I thought in the west, for reasons12 of efficiency, it's first come, first served.13 MR. JAY: And here the States decided not to14 do that on an interstate basis. They said that -- that15 all pre-1950 users would be on the same footing as16 between the States. So that Montana cannot complain17 if -- as long as Wyoming's water users pre-1950 are not18 exceeding their pre-1950 right, Montana has no remedy19 and there's no breach. They concede that on page 20 of20 their surreply.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jay, I thought that22 the Special Master -- very important to him was the23 meaning of "appropriative rights," and he said that the24 Wyoming law is just as you've described, that is, the25 farmer can use all that water; and he said Montana law45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is uncertain, but Wyoming law is not out of line with2 the general approach.3 Suppose this had been a case -- suppose4 Montana law, instead of being uncertain, was5 diametrically opposite Wyoming law, then what happens6 under this compact?7 MR. JAY: Under this compact, Justice8 Ginsburg, the appropriative rights existing in each9 signatory State as of January 1st, 1950, are what are10 preserved and carried forward by article V(A). Each11 water user in -- in each State has exactly the same12 rights that he had on January 1st, 1950. Now, in13 Montana perhaps that might not include the right to14 recapture efficiencies, but we know, for example, that15 -- that a Montana water user could divert more water per16 acre because Montana had a more generous concept of17 beneficial use for irrigation per acre than Wyoming did.18 The compact simply carries forward all19 existing appropriative rights, and the drafters20 consciously rejected the idea that they should come up21 with some kind of interstate administration system22 putting the two States' rights on an equal footing.23 They carried forward each element in the bundle of24 sticks that a rights holder had on January 1st, 1950,25 subject to the single override of the definition of46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 "beneficial use." And I'd like to turn to that because2 Justice Scalia's colloquy with Mr. Michael brought that3 out.4In article II(H), there is a definition of use." What the compact's definition ofuse" does is specify that non-depletive uses5 "beneficial6 "beneficial7 don't count.

JAY: II(H), which is on page A-4 to the 14 appendix of the Special Master's report. That's the￼15 definition of "beneficial use."16 What it does not do is specify that17 depletion is the measure of beneficial use. It says18 beneficial use is not the use to the extent that the19 water supply is depleted; it's the use -- it's a use by20 which the water supply is depleted. Because irrigation21 means water goes out and doesn't come -- and some of it22 doesn't come back, irrigation is a23 recognized by the compact.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well,25 would not constitute a diversion.47depletive use. It's hydropower would -­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. JAY: But a mill race would, Justice2 Scalia.

JAY: But the -- the point, Justice18 Scalia, article V(A) doesn't use diversion, and that -­19 that's precisely the point. It doesn't use "diversion";20 it uses -- it uses "beneficial use."

You don't have to qualify￼JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it useif it means what you say?MR. JAY: Because they -- it didn't use because it wasn't quantifying them. Whereas2122 "diversion" 2324 "diversion"25 -- what -- "diversion" is used in article V(B) because48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the diversion is the -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it's quantified.3 I mean, the whole purpose is you can't take any more4 than you were taking before. It has to be quantified5 somehow.6 MR. JAY: It's not quantified in the7 sense -- as Justice Breyer pointed out, no one -- they8 didn't write down, especially in Montana, because as the9 Special Master said on page 22, Montana didn't have a10 centralized system of rights; they didn't know exactly11 how much was being diverted in Montana. They certainly12 didn't know how much was being consumed or how much was13 being returned to the river.14 At Joint Appendix 585, there's a Federal15 Power Commission report that says that it is almost16 impossible to make an accurate determination of return17 flow. So what -- what the drafters did was they -- for18 the pre-1950 rights, they said we're not going to cap -­19 quantify them at all; we're going to grandfather them20 in, freeze them in place.21 JUSTICE BREYER: So your linguistic argument22 is they didn't use the word "diversion" because they23 didn't want to throw the mill race example into the24 definition -­25 MR.

JAY: My argument, Justice Breyer, is that they didn't want mill races or hydropower to count.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they didn't want mill races in the definition, so they purposely didn't use the word "diversion"; that's why they used the word "depletion."MR. JAY: That's -- they used the word "depletion," but they didn't make the amount ofdepletion, the measurement of -­JUSTICE SCALIA: A mill race is not -­￼diversion. that.MR.

JAY: That -- that is true, Mr. Chief6 Justice, but that has always been the case under western7 water law that the appropriative right is a priority,8 that when it's your turn and there's enough water, you9 get to take the amount of water to which you have a10 right. But it was clear in Wyoming on January 1st,11 1950, that the appropriative right -- so long as you12 took the same quantity from the river, you took it from13 the same point on the river, you put it to the same use,14 irrigation, on the same acreage -- that you could then15 change crops, for example.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In II -- in II(H), do you17 think "beneficial use is hereby defined to be that use18 by which water supply is depleted" -- and we're looking19 at "depleted." Do you define "depleted" as what is20 taken without any reference to what is returned?21 MR. JAY: I -- I think that that's right. I22 think I agree, Justice Kennedy, but it has to be a23 depletive use in the sense that some water -- some water24 has to come out that doesn't come back. So it's not -­25 it's not the same -- the mill -- a mill race is not a51￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425depletion, even though some water -- some water comes out because it then -- because it then comes back. But what our -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, that's -­ that's the key to this case, I take it. Wyoming is telling us that what goes back is irrelevant so long as what is taken is for a recognized beneficial use.MR. JAY: The reason it's irrelevant, Justice Kennedy, is that -- for two reasons. Depletion is not the measure of beneficial use. It's a -- it is a criterion for beneficial use. The use has to be a depletive one; but it's not the measure of the beneficial use.And the second point, Montana seeks to equate consumption with depletion, and that's -- that's not correct, either.We urge the Court to overrule the exception.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCKON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFMR. BULLOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, members ofBriefly, that, as Justice Scalia pointed52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 out, this is a compact, and it's a compact between two2 different States, and Montana gave up things, a right of3 priority administration across State lines as a result4 of that.5 Justice Breyer, as an issue of fairness, we6 don't get all the water. We only get water supply under7 like conditions. We are now the downstream8 appropriator, so -- but one example, if half the water9 is flowing now that it was, as of 1950, Montana may not10 get anything at that point, because just by the virtue11 of -- some say it's "highology," whoever is higher on12 the river gets to take first.13 So we -- we don't get to fulfill our rights.14 All we get is to ensure that, given a like supply of15 water, that our right shall continue to be enjoyed as it16 existed as of 1950.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many years has there18 been not enough water to fill all pre-19 -- forget about19 whether there was post-1950 use. How many years are we20 talking about in which there has been not enough water21 to fill everybody's?22 MR. BULLOCK: And -- Your Honor, we've done23 no discovery at all. This is still at the motion to24 dismiss complaint. And that's what the hydraulics and25 the engineers will ultimately determine. We made calls53￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in 2004 and 2006.We said: Wait a minute, we're not gettingenough water here, and we believe it's the -- the pre-1950 uses that are depleting that. Will you give us water?Ultimately, why we're here is to sort thisout.I guess I'd also point out that there was some discussion about an appropriative right is the right to use a quantity of water. That makes sense other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no water. The Solicitor General even pointed out then in his brief at a footnote -- he said, well, what we might do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable apportionment action for the pre-1950 water.That highlights the -- I think to me, the illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking at the uses and how much each State was consuming, because at that point I'll be right back here saying we want the same water under like conditions that we had in 1950.Official -
