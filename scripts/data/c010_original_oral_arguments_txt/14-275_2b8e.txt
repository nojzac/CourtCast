Department of Agriculture.      Mr. McConnell.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELLON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      Thank you for being willing to hear thislittle case a second time.  It does involve someimportant principles and the livelihoods of Marvin andLaura Horne, and more indirectly, hundreds of smallCalifornia raisin growers will be profoundly affected.      This is an administrative enforcementproceeding that was brought by the Department ofAgriculture against my clients commanding therelinquishment of funds connected to specific pieces ofproperty, namely, reserve­tonnage raisins.  My clientsappear in their capacity as handlers, but under their ­­in the particular facts of this case, the economiccircumstances are somewhat different than are ordinarilytrue in ­­ in this industry because as handlers, theHornes actually assumed the full financialAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial41 responsibility for the raisins that were not turned over2 to the Department of Agriculture.3 The producers in this case were fully paid4 for their raisins. This is a factual finding to be5 found in the judicial officer's opinion at 66a of the6 appendix to the ­­ to the petition. The Hornes paid the7 producers for their raisins. According to the judicial8 officer, those raisins became part of the inventory of9 the Hornes. The ­­ when the Raisin Administrative10 Committee, which I'll refer to as the RAC, came after11 the raisins, it was the Hornes and the Hornes only who12 bore the economic burden of this taking.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that ­­ I14 thought the growers were paid only for the volume that15 they were permitted, that was permitted, the permitted16 volume, and that they were not paid for what is ­­ goes17 in the reserve pool.18 MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, that is19 true in the ordinary course. That was not true in this20 particular case because of the unusual business model21 of ­­ of my clients. These producers were paid the ­­22 for all of their raisins.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you objecting to the24 volume limitation, or is it just that the ­­ the reserve25 pool that you find ­­￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. McCONNELL:JUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. McCONNELL:We ­­   ­­ troublesome?Official                            We believe that a volumelimitation would be a use restriction.  It mightpossibly be challengeable under the Penn Central Test,but it is ­­ would not be a per se taking.  In thiscase, because the government, the RAC, which is an agentof the Department of Agriculture, actually takespossession, ownership of the raisins, it is that ­­ itis that aspect of the case which we're challengingagainst the taking.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what so ­­ so puzzling because if ­­ if you're not challenging the volume limit itself, you can't sell more than 60 percent of your crop.MR. McCONNELL: That's correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what happens to the rest of it? You're not going to be able to feed your family on the rest, the 40 percent.MR. McCONNELL: Again, in the ­­ in the ordinary case, the reserve percentage, which in one case was 37 percent and ­­ and it was 30 percent and in the other case 47 percent, is ­­ is handed over to the Raisin Administrative Committee.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it wasn't, if ­­Alderson Reporting Company5￼Official6￼1 if we just had a volume, you cannot sell more than X2 amount, then I take it that the grower would get3 nothing, nothing at all. At least with this reserve4 pool, there is the possibility of getting some money.5 MR. McCONNELL: Well, it ­­ it all depends.6 The way volume controls generally work is that the owner7 of the produce is permitted ­­ they have to hold back a8 certain amount in a reserve and then they're permitted9 to sell that reserve as the market conditions continue.10 In this case, of course, the RAC sold the11 raisins, in some cases even above the field price.12 There was a market for the raisins, so I would assume13 that volume controls under these economic conditions14 might have left the ­­ these particular people better15 off than under the current circumstance.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you're17 complaining about is the administrative expenses?18 I don't ­­ I still don't understand why this19 makes this a Penn Central case as opposed to a ­­ a per20 se taking. You've ­­ you've given up on this being a21 Penn Central case.22 MR. McCONNELL: We have never claimed that23 there was a Penn Central case.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so basically, you25 see a nexus between the regulation and its purpose.Alderson Reporting Company8 wild animals, they're the property of the State,and the thantrue,Official9 oystermen had no property interest in them other10 what the State chose to license them to harvest.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Gosh, is that really12 Mr. McConnell? I mean, when these fishermen took the13 oysters, the ­­ you know, including the shells from the14 bay or other waters, you know, they could then sell the15 oysters. Why weren't the oyster shells theirs at that16 point?17 MR. McCONNELL: They have whatever property18 interest the State of Maryland provided for them. And19 the State of Maryland withheld the 10 percent of the20 oyster shells for the purpose of essentially fertilizing21 the ­­ the oyster that ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, I guess I ­­ I would23 have thought that as soon as they bring the oysters out24 of the bay and they haul their catch to shore, that what25 they've hauled to shore is then theirs.Alderson Reporting Company7￼1 MR. McCONNELL: We do. But more2 fundamentally, this is an actual transfer of the raisins3 themselves to the government. This is the government ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is this different5 than Leonard?6 MR. McCONNELL: Well, Leonard involved7 oyster shells which are owned by the State.

McCONNELL: Except for the 10 percent that the State reserved, yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, so I guess whatJustice Sotomayor's question is is why wouldn'tbe true as to raisins?MR. McCONNELL: Because raisins are animals, even if they're dancing ­­(Laughter.)MR. McCONNELL: ­­ and they did not originally belong to the Federal government.the samenot wildOfficialJUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that Leonard is ­­ is ­­ is an animals case as opposed to a, you know, the State can tax your property case?MR. McCONNELL: Yes, I do.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not how it was applied by the court. They called it a tax.MR. McCONNELL: They did also call it a tax. And I'm perfectly happy to address whether this is a tax, because under this Court's standards for criteria for determining a tax, this certainly is not one. Referring to the criteria in the NFIB case, this is not in the Internal Revenue Code, it's not collected by the Internal Revenue Service. It's not author ­­ there's no tax authorized by ­­ by Congress. The proceeds of the tax do not go into the general treasury. This is not aAlderson Reporting Company8￼Official1 tax.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 but it didn't happen that way in Leonard, either. What4 the Court was basically saying is the government could5 do this because this is a good in commerce. As long as6 it could meet the Penn Central test, that there is some7 nexus between the government's goal and the ­­ and8 the ­­ and ­­ and the regulation, then it's okay.9 Now, there they used it to fertilize oyster10 ponds or to refertilize the oysters. Here they're doing11 it to maintain prices and giving you whatever left ­­12 whatever is left over on the reserve.13 MR. McCONNELL: The fact of the matter is14 that the oysters belong to the State of Maryland and15 when the State of Maryland decides to allow fishermen to16 harvest the oysters ­­17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me where18 in Leonard that was discussed?19 MR. McCONNELL: It's ­­ I'll be very happy20 to file a supplemental brief with the Maryland citations21 indicating that the oysters belonged to the State of22 Maryland.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the ­­ what24 the Constitution required for a taking was just25 compensation, not ­­ not a reasonable nexus to a ­­ aAlderson Reporting CompanyBut neither did they ­­9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425good policy.

McCONNELL: Well, they certainly say that from time to time and this Court two years ago in Koontz rejected arguments of that ­­ of that sort. But in fact, there is a fundamental difference between a volume control, which is present for a number of agricultural products, versus the taking, because in this case the government literally takes possession of the raisins. It can use the raisins as collateral to get a loan. It can give the raisins away. It can ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG:MR.

Why didn't you then ask the Department of6 Agriculture for an exemption from the reserve pool?7 Instead of ­­ see, what you're trying to do now is to8 get rid of the volume limit as well.9 MR. McCONNELL: In this particular program,10 there's no ­­ there is no separate volume control in the11 sense that there ­­ there's no regulation that tells12 either producers or handlers how to use or sell raisins.13 Instead, they're told to set aside the raisins and give14 them to the government. So here there is a taking,15 and ­­16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the part that isn't17 given to the government, suppose we just ­­ couldn't you18 have asked to excise that part of it and still leave the19 limit on the amount that could be marketed?

The government comes2 with a shovel and some burlap sacks; it takes the3 raisins. I would say, well, sounds like a taking to me.4 At the next point ­­5 MR. McCONNELL: Me, too.6 JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ the Constitution doesn't7 forbid takings. It says what you have to do is pay just8 compensation. Now, it's at that point I want to know9 what happens, because I guess the government could10 argue, look at this program, it's a big program. This11 program, what it does is it gives raisin farmers, at the12 public's expense, more money. So if, in fact, you don't13 want us to take your raisins, all right, fine. But14 there'd be no program if everybody said that. So we15 have a rule against free riders.16 Now we'll give you what it cost you to take17 your raisins. What it cost you is, in fact, the18 difference between what you receive given the program19 and what you would receive without the program. That￼20 difference works in21 doesn't take money.22 In fact, if we were23 us, the government.24 So how are you going to get by that part?25 And if you can't get by that part, how are you going toyour favor.

McCONNELL: ­­ response. Let me give the practical response first, which is that my clients are certainly not better off. By the secretary's own calculation the price of raisins was $63 per ton higher with the volume controls than it would have been in an unregulated market.      The field price that year was $810 per ton.Taking away 30 percent of their raisins does not end upwith the ­­ with my clients better off as a result ofthe program.

McCONNELL: No. No, you're ­­ by the Secretary's own calculations, $63 of that 810 is attributable to the volume controls in the program. Only $63.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except weren't we told that the demand for raisins is inelastic? So if you glut the market, you're going to have what happened before the RCA.Official1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 arguments could be ­­ I get your argument now.3 MR. McCONNELL: Now, the conceptual point is4 that this is a per se taking. And it's ­­ if ­­ if5 there were benefits, such as I don't believe that there6 were, if there were, that would at most go to whether7 there was implicit in ­­ in­kind compensation for the8 taking, which would go to the ­­ to the question of9 compensation.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly.11 MR. McCONNELL: Implicit in­kind ­­ in­kind12 compensation is a complicated matter. It has to do with13 whether there were special benefits, that there's a14 split all over this ­­ all over the country on that. I15 don't think we want to get into whether this would be a16 special benefit. In this case ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So what we should18 say, in your view, do you have any objection to my19 writing, if I were to write it, like this, taking.20 Yeah, it's a taking. Okay. But the Constitution21 forbids takings without compensation. The object of the22 program is, at least in general, to give farmers more23 compensation than they would have without it. Programs24 can work badly, sometimes they're counterproductive, but25 if this is working well, that's what happens.Alderson Reporting CompanySo one of your16￼Official17￼1 So we send it back to the court to see, did2 the program work well? Did it work to actually make3 your ­­ your client better off? What rules do we4 follow? That's how we should do this, in your opinion.5 MR. McCONNELL: I think not. Now, if ­­ but6 I'm close to there. If this were an eminent domain7 proceeding, then the lower court would determine whether8 there was implicit in­kind contribution. If it were an9 inverse compensation proceeding, possibly the same, but10 this is actually an enforcement action. It is11 specifically guided by the regulations in ­­ in the 712 C.F.R.13 And under those regulations, we know exactly14 what takes place. And implicit in­kind contribution is15 not provided for in those regulations. What is provided16 in those regulations is that the ­­ if reserve­pool17 raisins are not handed over to the RAC, the handler must18 pay ­­ multiply the number of raisins by the field19 price, and that is it. Now, that is also the measure of20 the value of the raisins.21 So that if they take that, the compensation22 is exactly that, and the two things simply are a wash,23 because the regulation ­­ and I think the broader24 principle here is that this is actually not a program25 which is designed to provide compensation. TheAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial181 government almost concedes this. This is not ­­ this is2 not like getting land for a post office where the3 government intends to pay. This is more like a program4 like ­­ like a Kaiser Aetna or some of the others, where5 if it is a taking, the government has no intention of￼6 paying compensation,7 is. And in cases ­­8 JUSTICE KAGAN:9 MR.

I'm21 sure that there are a lot of programs like that in the22 world. And there is something intuitive about your23 saying, well, the government is asking us to turn over24 stuff. And I'm wondering, it seems to me that the25 government asks people to turn over stuff all the timethat's not the kind of program itMr. ­­       May I just ­­ in cases wherea taking, and the program does notAlderson Reporting Companyis a taking point?

McCONNELL: If the ­­ if the records ­­ if what the government is asking for is information, this is not going to be a taking. If the records are themselves of historical value, as they were in Nixon v. General Services Administration ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't know if they're historical ­­MR.

They're just physical objects, in the same way the raisins are physical objects. And the government wants some records.MR. McCONNELL: The government does not take permanent possession of records. If I'm, say, in an IRS audit, and they ask me to show records to establish my tax deductions, I show them the records, they see the information, it is not a taking.JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but ­­ so you're saying that the government couldn't ask you to deliver records to them.MR. McCONNELL: I did not say that. They can ask me to do that. And it is not a taking unlessAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425they've taken a permanent possessory interest.  If theygo off and sell the records, the way they sell theraisins, then I ­­ then there's been a taking.JUSTICE KAGAN: They're just keeping the records. They're keeping the records.MR.

In ­­ in ­­ in9 Nollan, the Court held that Monsanto could not stand for10 the proposition that it is an affirmative benefit to11 someone simply to allow them to use their property in12 an ­­ in an ordinary sense.

KNEEDLERON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Petitioners isolate just one feature of acomprehensive program regulating the commercialmarketing of a fungible agricultural product, aregulatory program that was established with producerapproval and is established for their benefit.  It is acooperative program among the Secretary, producers, andhandlers.      The raisins are not put into the program forthe benefit of the government.  They are put into theprogram for the benefit of producers, and they enter thestream of ­­ of commerce.

That's how19 most of them work, and most of the them thereby are, I20 presume, analyzed under Penn Central.21 This is different.

After5 the producer has voluntarily turned them over, they're6 set aside by the handler for later sale.7 Petitioners concede in their brief at page8 23 that the government can regulate the when, the9 manner, and the channel of sales. That's exactly what10 the reserve program does. They're turned over to the11 handler. The handler sets them aside in reserve.12 The ­­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler,14 this ­­15 MR.

You can, in fact, burn raisins, the point of which was to have fewer raisins, the result of which was to raise the price of raisins from $100 a pound to ­­ or a bushel ­­ to 400. That was thought to make the farmer better off, which it did. And it made the customers worse off.Alderson Reporting Company35￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Department's Marketing Order regime.      And by the way, it better be the Departmentof Agriculture that takes these ­­ you said earlier it'sRaisin Committee ­­ or else you're going to have a lotof trouble in your government speech cases, where youalways make the point that these committees are, infact, the government.Official1 Then someone had a good idea and said it's2 sort of wasteful to burn raisins.

And12 if they're no worse off, what compensation are these13 farmers entitled to?14 Of course, free riders could become yet15 better off. They could charge at the higher price that16 the program creates, $800. But, after all, that isn't17 the issue because you have to have, as a rule, no free18 riders. And once you admit that as a rule, everyone,19 including perhaps these plaintiffs, are better off than20 none at all.21 Now, that's a very simple argument. It's22 what I understand to be the economics of the Brannan23 Plan, the FDR, the 1949, et cetera. And yet, we've had24 endless cases, complexities, opinions, and fines.25 And ­­ and so, therefore, I'm probably wrong with myNow we have schoolchildren with raisins.

That's whatKennedy.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:I get from your argument.MR. KNEEDLER: No. Our ­­ our ­­ ourargument ­­ our fundamental argument is that it is not ataking to begin with because the ­­ the growervoluntarily submits the total amount of its raisins tothe handler.  The handler then separates them into ­­into two quarters, one to be sold now and one to be soldlater.  But they both have to do with the timing andregulation of sale, which Petitioners acknowledge thegovernment can regulate the timing and manner of sales.That's exactly what happens here.There are basically two markets. One is theAlderson Reporting Company43￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this Marketing Order for 30 years before they ­­ beforethey challenged it.Official441 free market.

But I take4 it that you don't think that the Leonard case has a very5 important bearing on this case because you cite it one6 time in your brief, it's a passing reference, on the7 issue of fungible goods. Am I correct there?8 MR. KNEEDLER: We ­­ we think it's a9 critical point. But we are ­­ we are not ­­ we are not10 arguing ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't think ­­ you12 didn't propose ­­ you didn't suggest to us that this13 case is just another version of Leonard and, therefore,14 we should affirm based on Leonard.15 MR. KNEEDLER: To the extent Leonard was16 about tax, this ­­ this was not ­­ this program was not17 identified as a tax partly because the raisins don't18 come to the government.

This is not ­­ these21 are not things that are appropriated for the22 government's own use.

And why don't you?MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's analogous in the sense that ­­ that ­­ that Congress may well be able to do this in a different way. My ­­ the reason I said it was different is that the ­­ that the oysters ­­ that the raisins, excuse me, are not being used for the government's program, they do not go to school lunch programs. If the government wants raisins, it buys them. It doesn't ­­ it doesn't ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But we ­­ we don't usually allow committees of producers who are called the government to impose taxes, do we? I mean, that's usually done by Congress.Official491 saying is it ­­ there are other ­­ the government may2 well be able to impose something ­­ some exaction as a3 tax, but this is a regulatory program adopted by4 producers. Again, it's important to recognize, and this5 goes back to the New Deal.

If18 51 percent of the producers want to do it, there's 4919 that don't want to do it.20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it's a ­­ it's21 a pretty good indication that ­­ that the premises on22 which Congress enacted this statute in 1937 operated23 then and operate ­­ operate now for the benefit of24 producers.

KNEEDLER: Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if the producers, some of them, think they can do a better job of selling them? They can get a better price because they're better producers, they're better marketers, they have export contacts that others don't. I ­­MR. KNEEDLER: The ­­ this is just standard regulation. What Congress has said is you ­­ if you're going to sell, you have to sell in the manner set up under this program. And the ­­ the portion that they ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's notAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial51￼1 usually ­­ when you're talking about that type of2 regulation, I understand that, you know, the raisins3 have to be so big or you can't call them raisins, and4 they've ­­ you've got to have safety inspections and5 all. But you've been presenting this as the reason this6 is a good program is because we sell the raisins, and7 then we give some of what's left to the ­­ to the8 producers. I don't think that's a very common approach9 to market regulation.10 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, there ­­ there are ­­11 there are two pools of raisins, and ­­ and how you ­­12 how you treat, or how you implement the notion that13 there are two different pools of raisins may vary. But14 the ­­ but where you have that, the ­­ the similarities15 are much more fundamental. You have what ­­ the16 free­tonnage raisins, which are ­­ which the grower is17 immediately paid for, and the handler can immediately18 put on the market, but there was a judgment made when19 this ­­ when this ­­ marketing order was established and20 Sun­Maid and ­­ and the Raisin Association believed it21 was still true during these years, that if you ­­ if you22 have a big surplus, as there was around the turn of the23 century, it would make the prices plummet if those extra24 raisins were put on the ­­ on the open market because25 the demand for raisins is inelastic.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial52￼1 So what ­­ what this marketing order does is2 it estimates ­­ where it operates, it estimates what the3 free­tonnage requirement will be. And that is4 completely open to the market. The reserve raisins, if5 you ­­ they're ­­ they're essentially valueless because6 you don't need them to satisfy the existing market. You7 take them off the market to prop up the prices of the ­­8 of the free­tonnage raisins, and then the committee will9 sell them when they will not undermine ­­ or in a manner10 that will not undermine the free­tonnage sales.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the same sort of12 program were carried out with respect to real property.13 Would you ­­ would you provide the same answers?14 Suppose that property owners, owners of real property in15 a particular area, think that the value of their16 property would be increased if they all surrendered a17 certain amount of that property to the government for18 the purpose of producing a ­­ creating a park or for19 some other reason.20 And so they ­­ they get the municipality21 to ­­ to set up this program, and one of them objects to22 surrendering this part of that person ­­ of his or her23 land. Would ­­ would that not be a taking?24 MR.

KNEEDLER: We're ­­ we're not saying there's a categorical difference. But I think ­­ I think the Lucas decision is very instructive there, that when ­­ when the Court was talking about the ability to regulate real property, it said that there's a big difference between real property and personal property, at least personal property being used for commercial purposes, which might even be rendered valueless by virtue of governmental regulations. So we thinkLucas ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, what's the statute of limitations on a takings claim?MR.

That's not correct. The mistake there is the21 assumption that all the raisins would have been sold at22 the field price if they were all put on the market, and23 that's ­­ that's just inconsistent with the premise of24 the order, that the only reason that there is a ­­ a25 high field price for the free­tonnage raisins is thatI think 9 it's true of maybe several others, I'm not ­­ I'm notAlderson Reporting Companybeenthem.MR.

But this is not fundamentally different from the others. And again, the government is not acquiring these raisins for itself. The government doesn't actually keep them in its possession.

McCONNELL: Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice.So several things have been cleared up. Thegovernment now does concede that the government takeslegal title to the raisins.  The government does abjurean argument on tax.Official59￼1 MR. McCONNELL: Just as to the factual2 point, it is not ­­ our ­­ our calculations are not3 based upon selling all of the raisins at the field4 price. Our calculations are based upon being able to5 sell all of the raisins at the price that the Secretary6 has said would be the price in an unregulated market,7 which is $747 per ton. And that is ­­ it is certainly8 not true that these reserve raisins are valueless. They9 are an extremely valuable commodity, and in most of the10 years, the producers of the raisins receive absolutely11 nothing for them.12 The important point here, though, is that ­­13 is that it is not any less of a taking, even if there is14 a benefit. I have no doubt, for example, that in15 Loretto, that the value of the apartment went up because16 there was a cable, because it became cable ready for17 its ­­ for its tenants. That did not make it any less18 of a taking, as this is a per se taking, and any19 benefits only go to whether there might be some kind of20 implicit in­kind compensation as a result of the21 benefit.22 And if this were an eminent domain23 proceeding, I think that that might well be relevant.24 This is, in fact, only an administrative enforcement25 action in which the question is whether the DepartmentAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial60￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of Agriculture was entitled, under the Constitution, todemand either the raisins or their monetary equivalentwithout any payment of ­­ of ­­ of compensation.JUSTICE BREYER: That last ­­ what ­­ why isn't it for them to make that argument?MR.

If you look at 7 C.F.R. 989.166(c), you will see that that is the provision for what happens when the handler does not turn over reserve raisins to the Department of Agriculture. It is ­­ it has very specific provisions for what happens, and there is no provision in that for implicit in­kind compensation.JUSTICE BREYER: But ­­ can they argue that ­­ the fact that all the raisin producers are better off because of this program, including you, but no free riders, that's what's the compensation. Can they at least argue that? Or have they conceded that?MR.

I think that that would be a logicalargument if this were an eminent domain proceeding andwe were simply trying to figure out what the propervalue of the raisins is.      Reserving, of course, the point that webelieve that this program does not benefit theproducers.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.MR.
