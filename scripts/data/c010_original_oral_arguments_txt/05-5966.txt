GOLDBERG                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER               MR. GOLDBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it     please the Court:               Eric Michael Clark was denied his Fourteenth     Amendment right to a fair trial.  Arizona law defined     the cognitive elements of first-degree murder as     requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Eric     Clark intentionally and knowingly shot and killed a     police officer in the line of duty.  The State of     Arizona was permitted to offer facts to     circumstantially prove these mental and essential     requisite elements of mens rea.  Under the rule     espoused by the Arizona Supreme Court in State versus     Mott, as we have been calling it, "the Mott rule," this     evidence, as offered by the defense both in lay     testimony and expert testimony, was arbitrarily     categorically excluded as a rule of evidence that's     unsupported by any valid State purpose.               In this case --31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was excluded withrespect to mens rea, but, of course, all of theevidence came in with respect to the insanity defense.          MR. GOLDBERG:  It came in, yes, Mr. ChiefJustice, as to the insanity defense, but could only beconsidered if Eric knew right from wrong.  It cannot beconsidered because of the peculiar adoption of anamendment to 13-502, which is the Arizona insanitystatute, that eliminated consideration of the natureand quality of his acts.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the State telling us --and we'll ask the State when they argue -- but is theState telling us that it has defined "intent" in aparticular way for this, so that "intent" is justhaving the purpose to cause the result --          MR. GOLDBERG:  If they were --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and, therefore, thatthis testimony is irrelevant?  Is that the State'sargument, as you understand it?          MR. GOLDBERG:  As I understand the State'sargument, they are adopting what Justice Ginsburg wrotein Montana v. Egelhoff, that the State, by enactingthis rule, has made this a substantive choice to make41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 evidence of mental illness irrelevant. However,2 Arizona did not do that, and Arizona did not argue3 that below. Below, Arizona argued, repeatedly, that4 Eric Clark knew this was a police officer, that Eric5 Clark intentionally shot a police officer. On appeal,6 they argued the same thing. In the appellate decision7 in this case, by the Court of Appeals of the State of8 Arizona, the State -- I raised a challenge to the9 sufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue.10 And this is in the joint appendix at -- one -- if I11 could have one moment -- begins on page 330 of the12 joint appendix -- 336, and proceeds through the court's13 discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, in14 paragraph 17. The court concluded that there was15 sufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of16 fact could conclude -- and it states, "reasonable17 inference thereupon that Clark knowingly and18 intentionally shot Moritz, and knew that he was a19 police officer when he did so." There's repeated20 references that the Arizona Court of Appeals did not21 understand that Arizona had somehow, by adoption of the22 Mott rule, decided to redefine the crime of first-23 degree murder, and -- as it -- we point in our opening24 brief, they could not constitutionally do so.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, do you take that --please.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you make of thevery name that the State gave, not acquitted by reason-- not not-guilty by reason of insanity, but guilty,except insane.  Guilty of what?  Guilty of the charge.And the charge is first-degree murder.  So, even ifinsanity is found, apparently that's defined to be"guilty of the charge, except insane," therefore notsubject to criminal punishment.          MR. GOLDBERG:  That's correct, JusticeGinsburg.  However, guilty of the charge, based on theState's evidence, without any consideration of thedefendant's evidence.  In this case --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- we offered 16 lay witnessesand their testimony, in addition to the experts.  And Iwant to point this -- make this point clear.  The Statewants you to believe that this issue only involvespsychiatric expert testimony.  It does not.  And itinvolves lay fact evidence, just as in any trial.  Butthese 16 lay witnesses talked about --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the lay -- I'msorry.  That was my question.  The lay --MR. GOLDBERG: These lay witnesses -- 61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- witnesses still2 talked about his mental state, correct?3 MR. GOLDBERG: That's correct. But the trial4 judge ruled, under Mott, that he was precluded from5 considering all mental health evidence, all evidence of6 mental disease or defect, on the issue of mens rea.7 So, even though it was admitted, and there's no quarrel8 here that all of the evidence that we sought to present9 was admitted, it was not considered by the trial judge.10 He could not. Because the Mott rule itself is11 categorical. And I quote from the Mott decision, as12 follows, "Arizona does not allow evidence of a13 defendant's mental disorder, short of insanity, either14 as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea15 elements of a crime." That states "all evidence," and16 the trial judge understood it to mean that, and that's17 the way it is applied in --18 JUSTICE BREYER: No --19 MR. GOLDBERG: -- Arizona.20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- what they have here --21 the -- what the SG says -- which seemed right to me,22 and I would like you to explain why it wasn't -- is23 that as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that24 everyone in Arizona agrees that you consider whether he25 knows right from wrong in respect to this act. Thus,71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks2 he's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in3 knowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did4 here, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was5 right or wrong to shoot this person. And, therefore,6 once I read that, I thought there is not, at least in7 this case, a question of whether the insanity defense8 is complete, because it is. Everything that you wanted9 to introduce was introduced. And, indeed, it was10 considered, properly, under the insanity defense. And11 if you had convinced the jury, you would -- or the -- I12 guess, the jury -- you would have won on that. Now, am13 I -- what's wrong with what I've just said?14 MR. GOLDBERG: There is a distinction between15 nature and quality of one's acts and knowing whether an16 act is right or wrong. And the State's and the United17 States position here is not supported by the history of18 the development of M'Naghten nor the ALI version of the19 Model Penal Code.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I'm interested in21 Arizona, remember. I'm not -- what I'm interested in22 is whether if you say, "Judge, I am going to prove the23 following. My client knows right from wrong, in24 general, but he thought that the truckdriver was a wild25 animal, and that delusion meant that he is so insane,81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425he could not have formed the necessary intent."  Thejudge replies, "You can bring that in, because if hethought the driver was a mental -- was a wild animal,he did not know right from wrong in respect to thiskilling."  Now, is that what happened --          MR. GOLDBERG:  No --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in effect?  Or would --did the judge say, "You may not introduce thatevidence, because it is not relevant"?          MR. GOLDBERG:  No, Justice -- the trial judgeruled that we could offer the evidence, because we werenot before a jury, and the judge was the trier of fact. And he stated so, that he would separate out, forhimself, what he could consider and what he could not. And his verdict in this case, on the "guilty, exceptinsane," focused only on whether Eric knew right fromwrong.          JUSTICE BREYER:  In this case.          MR. GOLDBERG:  In this case --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, fine.  So, then, whatis -- would -- if he thought it was a wild animal, thenhe would not have known right from wrong in respect tokilling that individual.          MR. GOLDBERG:  But that is not the State'spoint, or -- nor the United States Government's point91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in this case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What is it?          MR. GOLDBERG:  Their point is that the formeris subsumed in the latter.  In other words, it makes nodifference.  But the Arizona Court -- the ArizonaSupreme Court, in a State Court decision, State versusChavez, indicated otherwise.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but whether it --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I guess maybe thequestion is, What is your point?  And I have the samequestion as Justice Breyer, and I'd just like to pursuethat.          If a case, a hypothetical case, is one inwhich the second prong of M'Naghten, knowing thedifference in right and wrong, gets to the question ofhis capacity to form an intent, isn't that sufficient? I think that's Justice Breyer's question.          MR. GOLDBERG:  It would, if Arizona allowedconsideration of that evidence.all. And it does not, atlet's --but whether it does or--JUSTICE KENNEDY:  ButMR. GOLDBERG:  Now --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes,JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let's assume that it can 101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425consider the evidence as to -- on the right-and-wrongprong.--MR. GOLDBERG:  The right-and-wrong prong --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the hypothetical stateMR. GOLDBERG:  In a hypothetical --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that says, "We'll letthis evidence" --          MR. GOLDBERG:  In a hypothetical --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- "in under the right-and-wrong aspect of M'Naghten, but not under the nature andquality of the act."          MR. GOLDBERG:  And your question is whether --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why that isn't sufficientto answer your contention that his intent is not -- hasnot been subject to question.          MR. GOLDBERG:  Because, first of all, it isnot offered and is not considered to specificallydetermine whether it rebuts an inference that the Statehas raised on factual point key to their case.Secondly, the nature and quality is not a considerationin Arizona.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What they said --          MR. GOLDBERG:  And even if it was -- and I111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 would -- can point this out by an example that gets to2 what Justice Breyer was saying -- if a person is3 squeezing a lemon -- and this is a common example in4 law school -- and it turns out to be his sister -- he5 knows, in the abstract, that a person -- killing a6 person is right or wrong. He knows it's wrong. But he7 does not know that squeezing a lemon is wrong.8 In this case, if Eric Clark's evidence showed9 that he believed the police officer was an alien, and10 there was substantial evidence in the record to that11 effect -- and I would specifically point you to page 3912 in the joint appendix, where the -- where the expert13 testified that Eric had a heightened fear of police --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll look at15 M'Naghten. I had thought it was whether or not the16 action was right and wrong, whether -- rather than the17 -- than the -- than the moral command was wrong.18 MR. GOLDBERG: That is correct. That is19 correct, Justice Kennedy.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Then, what do you do --21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you're saying, if22 I understand it, is that when the Arizona statute23 refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong,24 the criminal act that they are referring to, on your25 view, is the act of intentional killing, period. And121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 if that's what they mean, then it is irrelevant that he2 thought he was killing a Martian. But if the Arizona3 reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the4 act in this case -- i.e., killing somebody you believe5 is a Martian -- then the evidence could come in. So, I6 think your argument means -- your argument rests on7 the assumption that the Arizona statute's reference to8 the criminal act being wrong means the criminal act, in9 general, in the abstract -- i.e., intentional killing -10 - as distinct from the act of killing somebody you11 believe to be a Martian. Is that correct?12 MR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely. That's not --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.14 MR. GOLDBERG: -- that's not --15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's --16 MR. GOLDBERG: -- the end of it, as well.17 And the Model Penal Code makes this point when they18 talk about their formulation, which is a -- whether a19 defendant appreciates the wrongfulness of his conduct.20 And they, in their discussions, had indicated -- and21 these are on pages 166 and 169 of the ALI comments to22 the Model Penal Code -- that M'Naghten could, under any23 formulation -- a person could, in the abstract, know24 that killing is wrong, but could also, in the -- in the25 -- their subjective mental state, due to their mental131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 disease, not know that they were killing a human being.2 JUSTICE BREYER: But the Arizona Court, the3 Court of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding4 of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal5 offense. It is difficult to imagine that a defendant6 who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the7 act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive8 that the act was wrong. Now, those words, written by9 the Arizona Court, suggested to me that, in the case of10 the lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the11 individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a12 Martian, they would say he does not know right from13 wrong, here, now, in this case. That, it seemed to me,14 is what the Court of Appeals wrote.15 MR. GOLDBERG: That --16 JUSTICE BREYER: And if that's what they17 wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking;18 rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to19 come in, come in, and it is totally relevant.20 MR. GOLDBERG: They would, if it was not21 inconsistent with previous pronouncements of this very22 same court. But, although it is -- it is error to not23 instruct a jury on both prongs when Arizona had both24 prongs, it was harm -- deemed harmless error in State25 versus Chavez. But if --141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but --          MR. GOLDBERG:  But not --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- if Justice Breyer --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- but that it was error,because they are distinct.  They are distinct elements. And thatpervasiveis to suggest that a psychiatric psychosis isthroughout an entire person's living.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if Justice --MR. GOLDBERG:  But --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- Breyer's explanation isa correctan argument that your proof should have been accepted,on the first prong?          MR. GOLDBERG:  Yes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what is that argument?          MR. GOLDBERG:  The argument is that the Stateproved, circumstantially, his mental state.  The judge,as the finder of fact, never -- and stated so in hisruling on this issue -- could consider the laytestimony and the expert testimony on whether it raiseda doubt, a single reasonable doubt as to the State'sposition.  And I can point this out on four facts.First of all, the State sought to prove intent andknowledge.  They did so by first arguing that Eric'sconduct, in driving around the neighborhood with the15statement of Arizona law, do you still have1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 music playing loud, was to lure a police officer. This2 is in the record at -- on August 5th, in the opening3 statement by the State's attorney, page 15; on August4 27th, at page 50; and that's in the joint appendix, at5 314, in their closing argument.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your evidence to7 the contrary that was excluded would have showed what?8 MR. GOLDBERG: That it was equally plausible9 that he was driving around with his music playing loud10 because he was drowning out the voices in his head,11 which were --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it went to13 diminished mental capacity. And as I understand14 Arizona law, it has decided that that evidence can only15 be presented in the context of an insanity defense.1617 Mr. Chief 181920212223 capacity defense?24 MR. GOLDBERG: No, not the defense. There's25 a very subtle, but important, distinction between theMR. GOLDBERG:  And that is unconstitutional,Justice.JUSTICE SOUTER:  You mean --MR. GOLDBERG:  First of all --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- the Constitution --MR. GOLDBERG:  -- these are facts --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- requires a diminished-161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 diminished-capacity defense as an affirmative defense2 and diminished-capacity evidence. And it's a shame3 that --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you're going to let5 the evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea,6 you've done, by -- as it were, by the front door, what7 you can't do by the back door -- i.e., by a diminished-8 capacity defense -- because you're making the same9 point. The burdens of proof are different, but you're10 making the same point.11 MR. GOLDBERG: Well, the burdens of proof12 goes to whether, if we did not -- if we did not prevail13 -- or we did prevail on the second issue, the --14 whether M'Naghten allows consideration of this --15 whether it makes a difference. In that situation, the16 burden of proof is on us, by clear and convincing --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you think it is18 unconstitutional for a State to say, "We know perfectly19 well that it is much more difficult for both cognitive20 and reason -- reasons -- and reasons of character and21 training and so on, for some people to conform22 themselves to the criminal law than others. We know23 it's harder for some than others. But we don't care24 how much harder it is, unless it gets to the point that25 we define as insanity. Because unless we require171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 something as serious as insanity to excuse, everybody's2 going to have an excuse, and there isn't going3 any criminal law" -- is that unconstitutional?to be4 5 6 78 does when9 will not have a diminished-capacity defense"?MR. GOLDBERG:  No, it's not.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. GOLDBERG:  But the --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that what theit denies a diminished-capacity -- says, "We10 MR. GOLDBERG: If it is framed as11 yes, but if --Statea defense,1213141516171819 also what20 don't allow diminished-capacity evidence in on mens21 rea, which is the State's burden. Rather, we allow it22 in only on the defense of insanity, so that we can keep23 it clear, clear that unless the diminished capacity is24 so great as to amount to insanity, it's not an excuse"?25 And if that is what the State is doing, is there any -181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  Now --MR. GOLDBERG:  -- it is framed --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- isn't --MR. GOLDBERG:  -- as simply --JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but isn't --MR. GOLDBERG:  -- lay evidence --JUSTICE SOUTER:  With respect,the State is getting at when it says, "Weisn't that￼1 - anything unconstitutional about that?2 MR. GOLDBERG: The unconstitutionality of3 that -- of that procedure is that the State's evidence4 goes uncontested. The State's evidence -- the State's5 evidence -- and this has been fundamental to prove mens6 rea, along with actus, is a fundamental right of the7 defendant to present a defense to that. And we're8 talking about presenting facts, not having --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it only --10 MR. GOLDBERG: -- a psychiatrist get up there11 --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- goes uncontested --13 MR. GOLDBERG: -- and --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it only goes15 uncontested if the only way you're going to contest it16 is to show diminished capacity. You could have17 contested this evidence by showing that, you know, he18 was a in a rock band, and he wanted to play the music19 for -- to advertise the concert, not to lure the20 police. There are a lot of defenses you can present.21 What they're saying is, if it goes to diminished22 capacity, that has to be used to show insanity or not -23 - or nothing at all.24 MR. GOLDBERG: But their justifications for25 this rule, Mr. Chief Justice, are that it's not191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reliable. And it is reliable evidence. Both the lay2 testimony and expert testimony is admitted by the State3 for other purposes, as well as for the defense in other4 purposes, and has been found reliable. And this is5 cited in footnote 15 of our reply brief.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldberg, may I ask7 you to clarify one thing about your argument? You say8 that you should have permitted -- been permitted to9 introduce this evidence to show that this act was not -10 - the "act" being, kill a police officer -- was not11 done intentionally or knowingly. But you seem to12 indicate that Clark could have been convicted, under13 the Arizona code, of some degree of murder. Am I right14 about that? And, if so, what degree?15 MR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor. Our16 position -- and I stated this, in fact, in my opening17 statement to the court, as well as in our motion for a18 directed verdict after the close of the State's19 evidence -- was that if the court found that the State20 had failed to prove, considering all the evidence,21 including the evidence of his mental illness, that he22 did not know he was killing a police officer, then he23 would be found guilty of second-degree murder or24 manslaughter. And that would be our position as to why25 this is unconstitutional, in part, because the State201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425chose to define a specific crime as requiring thatcognitive element that he knew he was killing a policeofficer and then --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what would --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- sought --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- to preclude anyconsideration of evidence that indicated the contrary.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the second -- thedefinition of "second degree"?          MR. GOLDBERG:  "Second-degree murder" isdefined as intentional murder, without premeditation.That's one form of second-degree murder in Arizona.Now, I want --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what --MR. GOLDBERG:  -- to get back to --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just ask, what -- ifyou'd like to introduce is that the defendantthe proofconsidered the police officer to be an alien, why wouldhe have any intent?  Why wouldn't your argument go, aswell, to second degree?          MR. GOLDBERG:  Because if he knew he waskilling what he believed to be a alien who had takenover a human form, then he may have known that he waskilling somebody, but not that it was a police officer,211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because, in his mind, he believed that the policeofficer was an alien.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't go topremeditation.  I think that's Justice Ginsburg'spoint.  And I don't see why that isn't correct.  Itdoesn't got to premeditation.          MR. GOLDBERG:  No, Justice Scalia, but he wasnot charged with a premeditated murder.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but you're saying --you're saying he could have been charged with second-degree murder --          MR. GOLDBERG:  As intentional murder.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- because -- what?          MR. GOLDBERG:  Because the -- because thecrime of second-degree murder -- because this is aunique --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does not requirepremeditation.  And I --          MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- don't see how this goesto premeditation, anyway.          MR. GOLDBERG:  Does not go to premeditation. Goes to the question of whether he knowingly killed apolice officer.  If you take -- second-degree murder is-- includes all the elements of this particular first-221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 degree-murder statute and adds one, and that one2 element is knowledge and intent to kill a police3 officer. And that's the additional element that makes4 second degree a lesser included defense of first5 degree. And the judge was precluded from considering6 the fact evidence in this case that indicated that Eric7 was delusional, that he was schizophrenic, that he was8 actively delusional at the time of the crime, and he9 believed that its -- our town had been inhabited by10 aliens.11 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose he did,12 he believed there -- it's an alien, which is not13 immoral, to kill an alien, let's say, if he comes from14 Mars. I don't know about the morality of that, but --15 [Laughter.]16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'll go with you. I'll17 say that you're absolutely right about that. Now,18 suppose, in addition, the judge did consider that. He19 did consider it, because he thought the person wouldn't20 know right from wrong if he thought this was an alien.21 All right? A space alien. Now, suppose that's true.22 Then what is the problem, from a due-process point of23 view? After all, you were able to make your claim24 there. The judge would have heard the evidence. And25 if the judge believed that that was so, he would have231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 acquitted the individual. Does there remain a due-2 process problem?3 MR. GOLDBERG: Not if it could be considered4 as to going to the element, no. But that's not this5 case.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Actually, I was --7 MR. GOLDBERG: It does not go to the mental8 state, in this case, because Arizona law, under State9 v. Mott, precludes its consideration for that purpose -10 -11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose --12 MR. GOLDBERG: -- for any purpose other than13 --14 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I read State v. --15 MR. GOLDBERG: -- whether we made the --16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- Mott --17 MR. GOLDBERG: -- other than whether we meet18 our burden of proving he is insane, by clear and19 convincing evidence.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your argument that it21 -- under Arizona law, it goes to excuse the conduct,22 but not whether the conduct, in fact, occurred?23 MR. GOLDBERG: It does.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, is that your25 argument?241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. GOLDBERG: That's the way the Arizona --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that your argument?3 MR. GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes. Well, that's the4 way the Arizona rule is drafted. It can go to -- if we5 can convince the trier of fact that it -- that his6 delusions prevent him from knowing the nature and7 quality of his acts, if that was actually included in8 our statute. But, in our case, we were limited to9 trying to prove his delusional behavior, his delusional10 beliefs that the officer was an alien, to show that he11 did not know right from wrong. And that was it. And12 that places the burden on us, which runs counter to the13 fundamental principles of criminal law that are set14 down in Winship, that it's the State's burden to prove,15 beyond a reasonable doubt, every element, including16 this element, and not without any opportunity of the17 defense to rebut that element.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a different19 question. If, in fact, it came in via the insanity20 defense, I guess the burden is on the defendant to21 prove it. Is --22 MR. GOLDBERG: Correct.23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that true? Well, if it24 comes in via mens rea, then the burden is on the State25 to disprove it.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. GOLDBERG: No, the burden's not on the2 State to disprove it, Justice --3 JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't the State have to4 prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, if it came in via5 mens rea, 67 --89 10that the mens rea was there?MR. GOLDBERG:  Absolutely.  The burden neverJUSTICE BREYER:  And so, the State --MR. GOLDBERG:  -- shifts from the State.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- would have to show that,11 in fact, he was not so insane as to preclude intent.12 MR. GOLDBERG: In a technical sense, yes.13 But, as a practical matter, no, because the State would14 be offering all of their evidence, as they did here, to15 show that, circumstantially, he had the intent. We16 would be offering the evidence, which is regularly17 accepted and is found reliable for numerous purposes in18 our State, to show that there's a doubt as to whether19 he had that. And that's a completely different thing20 than the State attempting -- having the burden on them21 to disprove it, which this Court has so said in22 affirmative-defense cases involving self-defense, for23 example, that the State does not have to disprove that24 a person was justified or had a reasonable belief for25 their safety, but that they -- and in the same token,261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you cannot prevent the jury from considering whetherthat raises a doubt as to the State's case.  And thatis the fundamental problem, the fundamental due-processviolation here.          If there are no further questions,to reserve the rest.I'd likeMr.Goldberg.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  ThankMr. Howe, we'll hear now from  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL M.      ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. HOWE:  Mr. Chief Justice,you,you. HOWEthe Court:          The answer to both questions before thisCourt today, Do States have the -- have the discretionto define it -- to define the affirmative defense ofinsanity as the policymakers see fit?  And they alsohave the right to protect that definition by -- asJustice Souter's questions indicated -- from an -- froman attack on that definition by having evidence ofdiminished capacity of a different -- a differentdefinition of "insanity" from coming in the back door.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, to prevail, do youthink you have to show that, under prong two ofM'Naghten, the right-and-wrong prong, that the271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOmay it please￼1 defendant can prove really everything, and, in fact,2 did have the opportunity to prove everything, that he3 seeks to prove under prong one? If it's -- do you have4 to convince us of that in order to win?5 MR. HOWE: I -- no, Your Honor. There are6 two answers to that. The first answer is that the7 M'Naghten definition of "insanity," the heart of it,8 has always been the right/wrong test. And this Court,9 in Leland, and, I believe, in Powell, as well, have in10 -- have always referred to M'Naghten as the11 "right/wrong test." State courts across the country,12 they go --13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's clear,14 Counsel, though, that the first prong of M'Naghten adds15 something different, "You don't understand the nature16 and quality of your acts." In other words, it would be17 enough, if you recognized both prongs, if he thought18 this was a Martian, regardless of whether he knew it19 was wrong to kill a Martian or not.20 MR. HOWE: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.21 But as the lower courts spoke in M'Naghten, we don't22 look at the -- at the -- at the act in the abstract.23 As the -- as the Solicitor General's brief points out,24 it says in here, at page 16, that what the traditional25 M'Naghten test looks at was his very conduct. And as281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the Arizona Court of Appeals noted, it would be -- it2 would be difficult to imagine a situation where someone3 would know his conduct was wrong, but not know the4 nature of his act. And I won't pretend that perhaps in5 some theoretical hypothetical scenario that might --6 you know, that might occur. But it's very difficult,7 indeed, to imagine that. And the Arizona Legislature8 rationally could, you know -- could have, you know,9 decided that they will -- that they will reduce the10 definition to the heart of M'Naghten, which is11 right/wrong, because the -- you know, the issue of12 nature and quality will rarely, if ever, come up.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I am correct in14 assuming that it is -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- that15 it is your position, the State's position, that, under16 the right/wrong prong-two part of M'Naghten, and under17 the evidence in this case, the court was able to18 consider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary19 in order to meet this defendant's defense as to -- as20 to intent.21 MR. HOWE: Yes, Your Honor. And so --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with you. I'm23 trying to think of some theoretical case where it would24 make a difference. I can't quite come up with a25 hypothetical.291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. HOWE: And I've -- you know, I've worked2 with this case for several months, Your Honor, and I3 haven't come up with one either.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, wouldn't it make a5 difference in a case in which an individual6 understands, number one, as a general matter, that it7 is wrong to kill people intentionally? He also8 believes that there are space aliens. And he believes9 that it is wrong to kill space aliens. But he kills10 one. Under the full M'Naghten test, under prong one,11 he would have a defense. But under the M'Naghten test12 of prong two alone, since he believed it was wrong to13 kill Martians, he wouldn't have a defense. Isn't that14 right?15 MR. HOWE: No, Your Honor, for two reasons.16 The first reason is that the heart of the M'Naghten17 test is knowing right from wrong. And if a State, in18 its -- in its discretion, wants to say that those --19 that the State will not account for those rare cases20 where it might make a difference, a State could do21 that. The second answer, Your Honor, is, as M'Naghten22 says, at page 723, what we look at when we're examining23 whether the defendant knew right from wrong, is his --24 is the very conduct that he committed.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, I'm puzzled about 301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 one thing. I just -- maybe it's just my stupidity.2 But assume he thought it was a Martian, and assume he3 thought -- does he have to think it was wrong to kill4 Martians? Or supposing he thinks it is not wrong to5 kill Martians, then what do you do? Does it matter6 whether he thinks it's right or wrong to kill Martians,7 in other words?8 MR. HOWE: My point, Your Honor, is, if he is9 not actually killing a space alien, there is grave10 doubt that he would understand his conduct, and that11 would make rather meaningless, at some practical level,12 asking the question, "Did you know that your conduct13 was wrong?"14 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure I understand15 the answer. I -- that -- is it -- does he -- let me16 put it this way, and maybe you can answer yes or no.17 MR. HOWE: Sure.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does he have to think it's19 wrong to kill Martians?20 MR. HOWE: No, Your Honor. What he -- what21 he has to understand is what he is actually doing. And22 if he doesn't actually understand that he is killing a23 human being, then it's rather academic, in abstract, to24 ask, "Did you know whether that -- did you know what25 you thought you were doing was wrong?" But at -- you311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 know, but, again, I suppose, hypothetically, there may2 be -- you know, there may be a case where that would3 make a difference. But the State is clearly free to4 recognize that that's an incredibly rare circumstance5 and that, "As a matter of policy, we're not going to6 clutter up the definition of 'insanity' with that." It7 could -- you know, adding that language, a policymaker8 could very well decide that would be distracting to a9 jury or a factfinder.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: The thing that troubles me,11 just to -- and then you can comment on it -- I'm12 assuming it's possible they thought he didn't know13 whether it was a Martian or not, and that he thought he14 had a mission in life to kill Martians, that they're15 enemies, they're bad to come, and he wants to kill 'em.16 If that was the -- what the trial court found, could17 he be put 1819 Amendment 20to death for that killing?MR. HOWE:  That would raise serious Eighthconcerns, Your Honor, and --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or could he just be foundmurder, or whatever, on those facts?MR. HOWE:  If he truly believed that he was21 guilty of 2223 shooting an alien when he was actually shooting a human24 being, he would -- he would certainly have, you know, a25 very strong case for insanity. But what the factfinder321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425found here was that -- but -- was that his -- was thathis evidence that that's what he thought he was doingwas --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but there's a --          MR. HOWE:  -- insufficient.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- difference in the burdenof proof.  He has the burden of proof to get theaffirmative defense or to get the -- in that category.          MR. HOWE:  Surely.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I'm just wondering ifhe's -- just raises a doubt as -- so there's not proofbeyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person hewas killing was either a human being or an -- a kind ofindividual that it would be wrong to kill.          MR. HOWE:  Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  If there's just areasonable doubt on the issue --          MR. HOWE:  Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- would he be guilty, ornot?          MR. HOWE:  Well, Your Honor, that raises thesecond issue that we're -- that we're discussing today,that, you know, the State, as I've argued, has theright to define "insanity" as it -- as it sees fit.And if you -- if you -- if a -- if a State allows331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 evidence, that doesn't rise to the standard of2 insanity, to come in, then you -- then he's able to3 raise whatever his personal definition of "insanity" is4 through the back door. And the State has a great5 interest in preserving its definition of "insanity,"6 and its ability to define "insanity" as it sees fit by,7 as we argued --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, as you say, it's -- in9 a way, it's -- in a sense, it comes in through the back10 door, as you say, but, even coming in through the back11 door, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent12 to kill a -- make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it13 be admissible?14 MR. HOWE: It should -- it isn't -- it isn't15 admissible, Your -- a State can preclude it, Your16 Honor, because the State has the definite right to17 define the element of mens rea, and it is -- again, as18 it sees fit. And as --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that mean that it20 could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or21 the friends who talked about this person's illness?22 MR. HOWE: It --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or are we just talking24 about the expert testimony?25 MR. HOWE: Evidence of mental disease or341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 defect, whether it's expert testimony or lay testimony,2 does not come in under Mott.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Howe, would you4 explain to me how the State has proved intentional --5 not intentional killing, but of a police officer? If6 that's the charge, that he intended to kill a police7 officer, how does the State meet its burden on a police8 officer if the testimony on the other side is, "I did9 not understand that this human that I killed was a10 police officer"?11 MR. HOWE: What the -- what the State proved12 in this case, Your Honor, is that, at least, you know,13 2 weeks prior to the murder, he indicated a desire to14 do -- to do something extremely similar to what he --15 you know, to what he actually did. There was testimony16 he had -- he had an extreme dislike toward police17 officers. On the -- at the time of the killing,18 Officer Moritz was in -- was in a marked police car, he19 had a uniform, he turned on his lights and siren, and20 Clark -- you know --21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I see that on the --22 MR. HOWE: -- pulled over.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the State side, so the24 State has introduced evidence from which a trier could25 conclude he intended to kill a police officer. But he351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 wants to introduce, on the other side, "I didn't have2 that intent. In fact, I had delusions. I thought I3 killed an alien." But he's not allowed to introduce4 that evidence --5 MR. HOWE: Yes --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to counter --7 MR. HOWE: -- Your Honor.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the State's proof, as I9 understand what the Arizona law is.10 MR. HOWE: Sure. What the Arizona Supreme11 Court recognized in Mott was -- what the Arizona12 Legislature did when it enacted its criminal code and13 it defined its mens rea, it defined the mens rea in14 such a way -- you know, just as you -- you know,15 just as you explained in Egelhoff, Your Honor, that the16 -- that the condition of mental disease or defect does17 not negate the mens rea. So, what the State has --18 what the State has to prove, in general, and had to19 prove in this specific case, is, the State had to prove20 that Clark either, one, actually had the -- had the21 intent to kill a police officer, at least knowing he22 was a police officer, or killed under -- or killed23 under circumstances that would indicate that he,24 knowing -- at least knowingly killed a police officer,25 but for his mental illness. It's --361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this an alternative2 argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need3 not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two,4 or is this complementary to the argument that the5 evidence comes in under prong two?6 MR. HOWE: I -- I'm not quite sure how to7 answer that, Your Honor. What we -- what we've argued,8 the -- you know, as far as the first issue, is that a9 State is free to define "insanity" as it -- as it sees10 fit, under most, if not all, cases -- or most, if all11 real cases.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that, Counsel?13 Let's suppose that the -- one of the cases that come14 up is a language difficulty. The individual -- maybe15 he's not in uniform -- identifies himself as a police16 officer. Could the State have a rule that, "We are not17 going to allow evidence of language concerns," that the18 individual didn't speak English, and the officer said,19 "I'm a police officer," so he didn't know, when he shot20 him? What is it about mental capacity that allows you21 to exclude that type of evidence?22 MR. HOWE: Surely, Your Honor. This Court23 has always noted that evidence of mental disease or24 defect is viewed quite skeptically, because lawyers and25 psychiatrists and psychologists very often can't agree371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 on the meaning or the value or the validity of2 psychiatric evidence. The State also has an -- has an3 interest in preventing someone, who has -- you know,4 who -- there's at least a serious question of mental5 illness, from being able to forgo an insanity defense,6 but raise evidence to negate mens rea, in the hopes7 that he would walk free instead of being found "guilty,8 except insane," and sent to the State hospital.9 There's also -- you know, a third policy reason, that,10 because you -- in your -- because the -- you know,11 because the gross question of whether someone is insane12 or sane is a difficult enough question with psychiatric13 evidence, it raises -- it raises the question to a14 whole other level of complexity to ask the juries,15 "Well, if we -- if you find that he is sane, but he has16 some degree of mental illness, just find -- you know,17 just how did that mental illness affect his ability to18 intend." And the State, as a matter of policy, you19 know, may properly say, "That is -- you know, we're20 finding on the nature to determine whether someone's21 insane or not," but it's just too complex a question22 to ask the -- a jury or a judge, as in this case, to23 make fine gradations of ability and responsibility.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Howe, one of the25 things that puzzled me about your position is, you381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425said, "Under Arizona law, while this doesn't come inunder mens rea, it does affect sentencing."  I thinkyou said that the -- his mental state is properly takeninto account in the sentencing.  And, by that, did youmean just the length of the incarceration, or the placeof the incarceration?          MR. HOWE:  Your Honor, my time is up.  May --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can -- mayanswer.          MR. HOWE:  Surely.  What -- under Arizonalaw, if you have a mental illness, that does not riseto the level of insanity if the -- if the -- if thetrial court or the jury finds that circumstance existsby a preponderance of the evidence and it can be foundas a mitigating circumstance, that he -- that can, in agiven case, reduce the sentence imposed.          Thank you very much.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Howe.          General Clement, we'll hear now from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT        FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:Arizona has decided to adopt a particular 391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 form of the insanity defense, and it has also decided2 to protect that substantive decision by channeling3 evidence about a defendant's mental capacity into an4 affirmative defense with the burden squarely on the5 defendant. Neither aspect of that judgment violates6 the Federal Constitution.7 And I think, with respect to the substantive8 decision, there are two elements to it. First of all,9 Arizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten10 and focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the11 right/wrong test. But, equally important, as far back12 as 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up13 with the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not14 have a diminished-capacity defense in the State of15 Arizona.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the State say that17 it's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a18 police officer?1920 could the 21222324 is, Why didn't they -- isn't that what happened here?25 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right. I don't think they401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOGENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think the State --State do that?  Is that the question?JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think the State --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because the next question￼1 could do that. And I don't think that's what happened2 here. And I think if you look at the evidence in this3 case -- I mean, it came in, in sort of a strange way,4 in part, I think, because it was a bench trial, but I5 think what the trial court did is say that, "All of the6 evidence on insanity, all of the evidence in the second7 phase of the case, is relevant. It's all coming in.8 I'm going to take it into consideration, but I'm going9 to take it into consideration only on the insanity10 defense, not as part of the mens rea defense." And I11 think that was consistent with Arizona law. What I12 think would be a harder question -- and let me just13 say, I think the way that this was postured for the14 trial court was that the Petitioner argued that all of15 that evidence comes in for consideration of the mens16 rea.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you18 introduced the -- my concern by saying that they -- the19 State can put the burden of proof on the defendant,20 which we know is generally true in many States with21 reference to the insanity defense. But when you link22 it with mens rea, then it seems to me you have a23 problem.24 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so,25 Justice Kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that there's this tradition with insanity, which is2 quite different than the tradition with respect to3 other elements of a crime. And I think that goes back4 to the common law, and goes back to Blackstone. And if5 you look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the6 common law cases that this Court cited in its Davis7 opinion, they describe murder as having several8 elements. One of them is obviously killing a person,9 and one is malice aforethought. And then, some of the10 cases treat a sound mind as a separate element. But, I11 think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't12 a true element, because the common law put the -- it13 started with a presumption of sanity, which you14 couldn't have with respect to any other element, and15 said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on16 the defendant.17 And I think what the common law recognizes is18 the question of criminal responsibility or insanity,19 although it has some logical relationship to mens rea,20 can be separated out and can be dealt with in an21 affirmative defense. And I think if you don't22 recognize the State's ability to do that, you end up23 allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as24 Justice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of25 watered-down insanity defenses in the guise of421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 arguments trying to negate mens rea.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem as if the3 argument, that, "Oh, this all comes in under second --4 under the second prong," means that if there's a --5 there's another inference. It's a -- it's a secondhand6 argument about lack of mens rea.7 GENERAL CLEMENT:8 Justice Kennedy, though --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY:10 GENERAL CLEMENT:11 JUSTICE KENNEDY:12 GENERAL CLEMENT:13 second class. I think what Arizona recognized, in the14 Schantz case and in Mott, in making this rule in the15 context of rejecting the diminished-capacity defense,16 is that if you allow a defendant to argue, "My evidence17 shows that I lack the capacity to form the requisite18 mental state; and, therefore, that comes in on the mens19 rea case," you can make that argument in terms of any20 insanity defense you like. I can argue that, "I lack21 the capacity to form the requisite intent, because I22 responded to an irresistible impulse." Well, a State23 that's decided to have the M'Naghten insanity defense,24 rather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be25 able to make the judgment, I submit, that, "We're going431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOWell, it -- I think,Kind of, the second-class --Well ---- sort of evidence.-- I don't think it's￼1 to have the M'Naghten defense, and we're going to keep2 it as an affirmative defense, and we're not going to3 allow that defense, that we've rejected, to effectively4 come in through the front door." And, to use Justice5 Souter's --6 JUSTICE BREYER: That would present a serious7 constitutional question, wouldn't it? Or what -- I8 mean, I -- that's -- but I thought some of these9 questions might be in this case, but I now doubt -- I'm10 having doubts about that. But suppose the State so11 limits the defense that an individual defendant, who,12 by any ordinary psychiatric test, would be viewed as13 seriously insane, and, therefore, not a person who is14 capable of being held responsible in any moral sense15 for the crime, is, nonetheless, going to be convicted16 of murder? I mean -- and that might be -- come up with17 irresistible impulse, because the person is totally18 insane, not like any other human being. Anyone would19 normally say he lacked the knowledge of -- he's not20 responsible for what he does. And then, the State,21 nonetheless, convicts him of murder.22 GENERAL CLEMENT: But, Justice Breyer, they23 wouldn't convict him for murder, because he would24 qualify for an insanity defense. And somebody as25 insane as you're --441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  If he knew right from wrong,if they -- so, I mean, he -- it's not his intellectualcapacity that's wrong, it's his ability to control hisimpulse.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I mean --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's not in this case,I agree with you.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  But --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But is a variation of thatin this case -- namely, the variation -- but we'vediscussed that at length, and I take it you thinkthat's not in this case.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think it's in thiscase, but I don't want to mislead you, which is as -- Ithink you can hypothesize a situation where somebodywould be exonerated by one form of the insanitydefense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of theinsanity defense.  And I don't think it follows thatsomebody that's in that margin has a constitutionalright to make up the difference, effectively, through amens rea argument.  And, otherwise, I think you -- Imean, you --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But we don't have to reachthat question here, in your view.GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think you -- 451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Or do we?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I would think that youmight.  I mean, I think you could say -- because Ithink what happened here is, all of this evidence camein on the back door through the insanity defense.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But if we have to reach it,this -- they're arguing we do, because they're sayingthe person is so insane he doesn't know whether this isa human being or a sack of lemons.  Now --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  But then he --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- he said that they didn'tconsider that in the insanity defense.  And he's notattacking the burden of proof, at least not in thisCourt.  And so, I -- do you think we do have to -- thatwe have to --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- assume that he's right onthat?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think you have toreach that question here.  But you do have to reach arelated question, I think, which is, I think the trialcourt here very clearly, in applying Mott, preventedthe Petitioner from making a diminished-capacityargument.  And then --JUSTICE BREYER: What is "diminished 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425capacity," if it is -- what is that?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  It's an argument that isbasically a variation on the insanity defense.  It'spartial responsibility.  It was basically the governinglaw in California until it was --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But partial responsibilitydoes not -- insanity -- they use the words "insanity"and "diminished responsibility."  I took the word"insanity" to mean the kind of mental state that would,in fact, show a lack of intent.  I took the word"diminished responsibility" to mean there is intent,but it's excusable.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think you can draw that --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, am I --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- distinction, but I dowant to make clear that there are arguments here thatyou could make in a different State that you can't makein Arizona because of the substantive decision that,"We don't want to have a diminished-capacity defense,and we don't want to have that policy judgmentfrustrated by having the evidence come in through thefront door."  And to use Justice --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- Souter's example --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- this question?471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Supposing the evidence is equally divided on the2 question of whether he thought it was a Martian who he3 had a right to kill. Could he be convicted of murder,4 constitutionally?56 Stevens. 789 --GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think he could, JusticeAs I understand --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because then --GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- the hypothetical, we're10 11 1213 reasonable doubt that he knew he was killing a human14 being, and it was wrong to do so.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- there would be --GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- basically --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- not proof beyond a15 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think it would --16 it might depend on exactly what the statutory17 definition of "murder" in the State was.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't -- I don't --19 I'm just wondering, as a constitutional matter,20 forgetting all the -- as a constitutional matter, can a21 man be convicted of murder if the evidence is equally22 balanced on the question of whether he knew it -- he23 did anything wrong and -- or knew that he was killing a24 human being?25 GENERAL CLEMENT: Maybe not, Justice Stevens. 481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425It just depends on the way that the statute deals withit.  Because, in my view of the statute, if somebodyreally thought -- if they had to kill a human being,and they thought, "I wasn't doing it.  I was killing analien," maybe that could come in, on mens rea, but if --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have we ever held that aninsanity defense is required, that a State cannotsimply abolish insanity defenses?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  No, Justice Scalia, youhave not held --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't we had.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- that.  And I think --but, equally, I don't think a State would -- isrequired to have a diminished-capacity defense.  And --          JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is a State required toadopt any particular mens rea for murder?  Is there aconstitutional requirement as to the minimum mens reathat can be -- can be set for the offense of murder?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think so.  I mean,I think it's very difficult to find, in the Due ProcessClause, the tools necessary to superintend those kind --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here, there --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- of decisions.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- was a charge, "intendedto kill a police officer." It could have been just 491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 "intended to kill." And I think Mr. Goldberg conceded2 that "intended to kill" would have been a proper3 conviction, but not "intended to kill a police officer"4 --5 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- unless he's allowed to7 counter that add-on.8 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice9 Ginsburg, I think that starts to confuse the10 hypotheticals with the real case, because I don't think11 Petitioner's argument was that they had no idea that12 this person was a police officer, and he thought he was13 killing an alien. I think their argument was much more14 one for insanity, and that maybe there were other15 explanations for the conduct. But the psychological16 testimony here suggests that maybe he sometimes thought17 that his mother was also an alien, but he kind of knew18 it was his mother, as well. And so, I don't really19 think that maps up with the argument they've made.20 The one point I want to leave you with,21 though, is, as Justice Souter said, everybody agrees22 that there's no due-process requirement that Arizona23 have a diminished-capacity defense. Well, it doesn't24 make any sense to say that they have to have that25 implicitly with the burden on the State at the same501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425time. Thank you. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General. Mr. Goldberg, you have 4 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. GOLDBERG:  There is a due-processguarantee that the defendant can present evidence inhis own defense.  No matter how the Chambers line ofcases is viewed by the court, this Court made clear,in Montana v. Egelhoff, that in the absence of anyvalid State justification -- and I'm quoting now, fromthe plurality decision -- "exclusion of exculpatoryevidence deprives the defendant -- it's very basic tohave the prosecutor's case encounter and survive thecrucible of meaningful adversarial testing."  And that--          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that certainlydoesn't include the right to present any evidence youwant.          MR. GOLDBERG:  It's the difference between --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You couldn't havepresented evidence that this person was, in fact, aMartian.MR. GOLDBERG: That's correct, Mr. Chief 511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Justice. And it's not that we're asking to -- this2 Court to affirmatively rule that all of this evidence3 comes in, just that all of it cannot be excluded, per4 se, and that the trial judge is, just as in any other5 type of evidence, any other fact or opinion evidence,6 serves as the gatekeeper under the rules of evidence to7 decide whether it's more prejudicial or it's more8 probative. But Arizona has decided, only for this9 purpose, that this evidence is inherently unreliable.10 And then they've taken it to the point where they have11 proven somebody guilty of murder in the first degree of12 killing a police officer without allowing him to raise13 a reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was killing14 a police officer. And that specific argument was made,15 contrary to what the Solicitor just stated, in my16 motion for directed verdict that I made in this case.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Was it a reasonable question18 whether he knew it was a police officer or whether he19 knew it was a human being?20 MR. GOLDBERG: Whether it was a police21 officer. I moved the court for a directed verdict at22 the close of the State's evidence, and argued to the23 court that if he found -- the judge, as the factfinder24 -- that, in his delusional mind -- and again re-urged25 this at the close of our evidence -- that he believed521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425he was killing a police officer, then the court couldfind him guilty of second-degree murder ormanslaughter.  And I asked the court to do that, andthe court refused to do that.          So, the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  In the --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- court precluded anyconsideration of this evidence.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I -- the best I canfind in that Court of Appeals opinion, at the moment,is that they do reject the idea of diminishedresponsibility, on Mott -- on the ground of Mott.That's true.  They say, "Don't even consider it."  ButI didn't think diminished responsibility went to thequestion of whether he had the requisite intent.  Ithought insanity went to that, as they use those words.What is "diminished responsibility," if it isn't, "Weadmit the intent -- we admit that he intended to killthe individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't asresponsible as an ordinary person would be"?  What is --          MR. GOLDBERG:  It's not --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it, if it isn't that?          MR. GOLDBERG:  It's a fact that -- a factthat he did not know he was killing a police officer. 531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  He thought he was killinganother individual.          MR. GOLDBERG:  Correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Does that --          MR. GOLDBERG:  Or an alien.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Does the State have to --does the Constitution have to let you off if that's thesituation?          MR. GOLDBERG:  It's not "let you off," withall due respect.  It's "judge somebody based on" --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, you --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- "their personal" --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, but --          MR. GOLDBERG:  -- "culpability."          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but does the State haveto say, "We are going to convict you of a lesseroffense," in the Constitution?          MR. GOLDBERG:  The State -- the State has toallow the defendant to present his evidence and have itconsidered, if it's relevant, nonprivileged, andreliable, for a proper purpose.  And here, it wasoffered for a proper purpose, just as in Chambers andin Rock, and in all the cases that have been beforethis Court, where this Court has held so.I wanted to add -- answer one question that 541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 was raised earlier about whether a State could define2 "murder" without a requisite mens rea, essentially,3 which is -- or a specific intent, as the State seems to4 suggest that Arizona has done, inferentially, under the5 Mott decision. This Court held, in 1895, in Davis6 versus United States, that, "No one" -- and I'm quoting7 here -- "No one, we assume, would wish either the8 courts or juries, when trying a case of murder, to9 disregard the main principle existing at common law and10 recognized in all cases tending to support the charge11 below to make a complete crime cognizable by human12 laws, which includes mens rea and an actus rea."13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.14 The case is submitted.15 [Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the16 above-entitled matter was submitted.]17 18192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40055Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
