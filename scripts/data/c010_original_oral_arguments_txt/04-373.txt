GRAEFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:             In Edwards versus Arizona, this Court held that asuspect has a choice, after invocation of the right to counsel,to change his mind and initiate further contact with thepolice.  The question in this case is whether that choiceshould be taken away, and a suspect's decision to speakpresumed involuntary, when a police officer first makes animproper comment.             The answer should be no when the impropriety iscured.  When, under all of the circumstances, a reasonableperson in the suspect's position would understand that it wasthe suspect's choice whether to speak or remain silent and thatthe police would honor that choice and stop questioning, adecision to speak should be deemed initiation, under Edwards.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, what has to be considered, by way of evidence, in evaluating whether the suspect has initiated the additional conversation? Is it appropriate, in3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this case, to consider the age of the person?MS. GRAEFF: Yes. I think you would look at areasonable person in --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And --MS. GRAEFF: -- the suspect's --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- and the fact that, on the charges which he saw, it said he was subject to the death penalty, but that was not correct?MS. GRAEFF: That would go to whether the statement was voluntary, it would not go to --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would not MS. GRAEFF: -- the degree -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you wouldconnection with the initiation -- MS. GRAEFF: No, the --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- question?MS. GRAEFF: No, the purpose of prevent police badgering. To prevent police--not consider it inEdwards was to                                             conduct that,conveys, directly or indirectly, that the police are going tocontinue questioning until they get a statement, despite theinvocation of the right to counsel.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I suppose that if theyknowingly put death on in order to get him off his balance, 4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that would be badgering, wouldn't it?             MS. GRAEFF:  The -- the purpose of Edwards was toprevent police questioning.  So, when a curative measureconveys that, the police are not going to question any longer.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but --MS. GRAEFF: The --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the initial question JusticeO'Connor asked is, Do we consider these other factors?  Andthen -- but you're talking now about curing.             MS. GRAEFF:  And my answer is no, that we do notconsider what -- the death sentence.  There's two.  In Bradshaw--             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then why consider age?  I mean, the-- both of them go to the same point, and that is, What would areasonable person suppose the suspect's understanding was atthat point?  And would it be fair to conclude that the suspectwas, in fact, initiating conversation, rather than respondingto the police or doing something irrational?  And I don't seewhy the -- in effect, the false statement about the deathpenalty -- or true statement about the death penalty, for thatmatter -- doesn't go to the same point, just as the suspect'sage goes to it.             MS. GRAEFF:  Because the critical inquiry is whetherthe suspect understood that it was his choice and that thepolice would stop questioning.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, the --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but the trial judge made4 certain findings. He heard these witnesses. He heard the5 police officers. And he suggested that the -- Police Officer6 Reese was playing a good-cop/bad-cop game with Detective Johns.7 And so, that this -- the statement made by Reese, "You'll want8 to talk to us now, huh?" was designed to elicit an answer. And9 the trial court also said there is an additional factor, and10 that is this charge, that was intimidating even if it didn't11 have death on it, wasn't presented to Blake immediately. It12 could have been presented when he was put in the cell,13 initially. So, there were those factors. Those are relevant,14 are they not, to the character of what Blake said?15 MS. GRAEFF: I think what -- you look at -- the16 relevant factors are the factors that go to whether a17 reasonable person would understand that questioning was going18 to stop. This Court has said that there were two --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the factors that I20 mentioned? Would they be relevant to a factfinder's21 determining what a reasonable person in that situation -- with22 the two police officers appearing, with the charges not being23 presented immediately, not being presented at the time the24 Miranda warnings were given, but only after -- would those be25 -- would those be relevant factors to decide if this was a6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 voluntary initiated request to talk to the police?2 MS. GRAEFF: No, because I think what you're looking3 at is not voluntariness. You're looking at knowing. Did this4 suspect know 5678that the questioning was going to stop?JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it --JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you're --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it has to be --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're making --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- voluntary at some -- if you910 held the man's hand to a burning iron, we would -- we'd say11 that's not voluntary.12 MS. GRAEFF: It's involuntary.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it has to be voluntary,14 certainly, in the lay sense of the term. Then the law has15 certain accretive force when we talk about, you know,16 involuntary as a matter of law. But what we're -- what we're17 talking about, it seems to me, is, rather, a commonsense18 inquiry as to whether or not it was voluntary, as to which I19 don't think you necessarily lose your case, but it seems to me20 that at least these have to be considered in determining21 whether or not it's voluntary.22 MS. GRAEFF: Well, I think that's the second step of23 the analysis. The first step of the analysis, which is what24 this case is -- before the Court is, on initiation. Now,25 voluntariness --7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I -- you can't initiatesomething involuntarily and have that count, can you?  You say--MS. GRAEFF: Our --             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- let's say involuntarily, in thelay sense of the word, in the common sense of the word, whereit was actually physically coerced.  That wouldn't count.MS. GRAEFF: It would be an involuntary statement under the second --JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.MS. GRAEFF: -- step of the analysis.JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what about --JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, it's the --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the first step?JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- first part of the analysis. MS. GRAEFF: In the first part of the --JUSTICE KENNEDY: How --MS. GRAEFF: -- analysis, our --JUSTICE KENNEDY: The first part of the analysis iswhether or not he initiates.             MS. GRAEFF:  Yes.             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you're trying to tell us thatthe initiation can be involuntarily?  I just don't -- I justdon't agree with that.MS. GRAEFF: Well, what we're trying to say is that 8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the purpose of Edwards was to prevent badgering, where the police convey --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. But suppose the police are twisting his arm behind his back until he initiates a further discussion. You would say that's fine?JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you have to concede --MS. GRAEFF: Well, if they're twisting their back, you're not thinking they're going to stop questioning. I mean, what you're looking --JUSTICE SOUTER: No, you're --MS. GRAEFF: -- at is, Did --JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you -- aren't you confusingMiranda, which is a question of comprehension followed byvoluntary waiver, with the question of initiation?  They areseparate questions.  And what our -- what we are trying to getat is:  If there is going to be an initiation on the suspect'spart, doesn't it have to be a voluntary initiation?  Youranswer consistently is, Did he know that questioning wouldstop?  And those are two different issues.  One isunderstanding Miranda warnings.  One is voluntarily initiatinga further conversation with the police.  So, I don't see it --let's assume he perfectly understood the Miranda warnings.  Butif the initiation was not a voluntary initiation, or aninitiation at all, it seems to me you lose.MS. GRAEFF: Well, Maryland's position is that if 9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 you look at the analysis in Elstad and Seibert, where what this2 Court said is, you don't look at whether something caused3 something else, you look at whether there was a cure in the4 sense that the suspect understood his rights --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Graeff, is there any case which6 says that an initiation is not voluntary, as opposed to a7 confession being not voluntary, because the suspect has been8 charged with a crime greater than what the police believe they9 can prove, or if the police advise him that he's been charged10 with a greater crime than what he's really been charged with?11 Is there any case which says that the effect of that is to12 cause his initiation of discussion to be involuntary?13 MS. GRAEFF: Not that I'm aware of.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you take --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I –-16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the position that initiation is17 a purely formal inquiry, a matter of magic words? If he says18 the equivalent of, "I guess I'll talk to you," that's all you19 look at?20 MS. GRAEFF: What you look at as, in Seibert, is,21 Was he --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but ask --23 MS. GRAEFF: -- given a genuine choice?24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- answer my question. Is that all25 you look at?10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. GRAEFF: You look at whether he understood that the questioning was going to cease, and it was up to him --JUSTICE SOUTER: No, you're --MS. GRAEFF: -- whether to speak.JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're avoiding my question. MS. GRAEFF: I'm sorry.JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is, Is the act of purely formal act on your view, so that so long asinitiation athe suspect says the magic words, it doesn't matter what is inhis mind or what he understands?  Is it formal or not formal?             MS. GRAEFF:  No.             JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's not formal.             MS. GRAEFF:  What you need to look at is whether anobjective person in the suspect's position would understand that questioning was going to cease, and there was -- would be no more questioning. Edwards --JUSTICE STEVENS: But, can I interrupt with -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we can --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with one --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think that's a given. Thequestion is whether or not he agrees -- he indicatesaffirmatively that he wants to begin talking.to --MS. GRAEFF:  And here, there's no question he wantedJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's -- 11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425             MS. GRAEFF:  -- begin talking.             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the issue, it seems to me.             MS. GRAEFF:  And there's no question here that hewanted to begin talking.             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, now suppose -- I don'tunderstand all these legal terms here.  Imagine.             [Laughter.]             JUSTICE BREYER:  It may be close to the truth.  Now,we have a case, a hypothetical.  The defendant is sittingthere, the police say, "Question?"  And he says, "I want to seemy lawyer."  And the policeman says the following, "That'sfine, go ahead, we'll get him.  By the way, if you see him,we'll execute you.  Are you sure you don't want to talk to us?"That's plainly unlawful, isn't it?MS. GRAEFF: Involuntary. Under --JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.MS. GRAEFF: -- the second step --JUSTICE BREYER: Now --MS. GRAEFF: -- of the --JUSTICE BREYER: Now --MS. GRAEFF: -- analysis --JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the same thing happens, but is, "You'd better talk to us, or you'll bewhat he saysexecuted.  Think about it."  Equally unlawful, right?MS. GRAEFF: It would be involuntary -- 12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.MS. GRAEFF: -- under the second --JUSTICE BREYER: Now, a minute --MS. GRAEFF: -- test.JUSTICE BREYER: -- passes while he's thinking aboutit.  Okay?  Is it -- is it unlawful now, because a minute haspassed before he says yes?MS. GRAEFF: It would make it unlawful -- unvoluntary. But, again --JUSTICE BREYER: I just --MS. GRAEFF: -- with -- There's a two-step process. JUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't want legalism.I just want the conclusion.  A minute has passed before he saysyes.  Has that changed everything, and it becomes lawful?             MS. GRAEFF:  No.             JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Now it's 15 minutes.  Now it's30 minutes.  Okay?  Now, a court says 30 minutes is the same asone minute, "We don't think the passage of 29 extra minutesmade a difference."  And what's your reply?  Not in legalism.You're going to say, "Oh, no, the passage of 30 minutes, ratherthan 1 minute, makes all the difference."  And I would like toknow why.MS. GRAEFF: Actually, our position is more Detective Johns' actions rather than -- the passage of time was a factor, but the more significant --13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: I --MS. GRAEFF: -- thing here --JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's fine. I'm not -- I'm -- I want you to say that kind of thing.  You're saying it's notjust 30 minutes, it's "also some other things happened."  What?MS. GRAEFF: Significantly, Detective Johns' conduct and his words, when -- when Office Reese made the improper statement, Detective Johns immediately and firmly --JUSTICE SCALIA: The --MS. GRAEFF: -- reprimanded --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- improper statement was, "I betyou want to talk now, huh?"             MS. GRAEFF:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? And --MS. GRAEFF: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- immediately, the otherdetective, Johns -- immediately?MS. GRAEFF: Yes. Immediately --             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Said what?MS. GRAEFF: -- immediately said, "No, he doesn't want to talk to us. He already asked for a lawyer. We cannot talk to him now" --JUSTICE BREYER: So, that's --MS. GRAEFF: -- and pushed him.JUSTICE BREYER: -- possible. That definitely cuts14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in your favor, unless, of course, it sounds like a good- cop/bad-cop routine. And --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was --JUSTICE BREYER: -- people --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there was no finding thatthis was a good-cop/bad-cop -- MS. GRAEFF: No.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- routine, was -- MS. GRAEFF: In fact --             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In fact, there was a finding thatJohns' testimony was credible.             MS. GRAEFF:  Yes, that Johns' testimony wascredible, and that Johns did not intend this to happen.JUSTICE BREYER: But that's --MS. GRAEFF: This was --JUSTICE BREYER: -- subjectively true. And so, I'dsimply wonder if the fact that it's subjectively true, andthere is a finding that the defendant -- here, we have 30minutes, and we have the fact that the other detective said,"He said he can't talk to us.  We can't do anything about it." We have that.  Is there anything else?             MS. GRAEFF:  We have that Detective Johns thenpushed him out of the cell -- JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MS. GRAEFF: -- and they left. So the police 15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425initiation was terminated. And -- JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.             MS. GRAEFF:  -- then when Detective Johns came back,28 minutes, he didn't say anything.             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.             MS. GRAEFF:  He didn't ask any questions.  And itwas Blake who initiated and said, clearly, he wanted to talk tothe police.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Right. So -- JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --JUSTICE BREYER: -- we have a passage -- JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you two ratherelementary questions?             MS. GRAEFF:  Yes.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  One of the issues is whether  --when he spoke and said, "Can I talk now?" -- was that voluntaryor not?  Who has the burden on whether it was, or not,voluntary, the State or the defendant, in your view?             MS. GRAEFF:  The state has the burden to show thathe initiated.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so, the State did have theburden.  And what is your view on the fact that the trial --the judge who heard the evidence said they had not met theburden?  What kind of deference is owing to that finding?MS. GRAEFF: We think none, because the trial court 16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 did not focus on the proper analysis. The trial court focused2 on a causal connection analysis that this Court has --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --4 MS. GRAEFF: -- rejected in Seibert --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- before we get to that, I6 read the trial court's opinion, and it didn't seem to me that7 it was playing, as Justice Breyer said, this game of legal8 words and labels. It was saying, "There are things to suspect9 here. Yes, I credited Detective Johns. But he was asked, 'Why10 did you bring along Reese? You didn't need him?'" And there11 was no answer to that.12 And there was also no explanation, after they left13 Blake in his cell, Reese just having said, "I bet you want to14 talk to us now, huh?" -- there was nothing said to assure Blake15 that that was not a "You'd better talk to us, or you're going16 to be in trouble" kind of thing. There was just the statement17 by Blake and another Miranda warning. All of those things, the18 judge said, weighed on his mind, and he reached the conclusion19 that the Government hadn't sustained its burden on the basis of20 those factors.21 So, is that clearly erroneous? I mean, don't we22 defer to the judge's findings?23 MS. GRAEFF: If the inquiry is a -- clearly24 erroneous, yes. But our position is that whether or not there25 was initiation is a mixed question of fact and law, whether a17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reasonable person would understand the questioning was going tostop.  And so, when you look at this reasonable-personanalysis, you don't give deference to the findings of the lowercourt.             And if I could reserve the rest of my time, if thereare no more questions.the Court:  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. Graeff.  Mr. Feldman.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A.

FELDMAN: -- I think you could say that all of10 those voluntariness factors should be looked at, in terms of11 initiation, although I just think the analysis would be exactly12 the same as if you were asking whether he made a voluntary13 waiver, that14 Now, in the1516 voluntary waiver is measured against a Miranda warning. And,17 by definition here, you don't have a Miranda warning, because18 we're asking about "whether initiation." So, it seems to me19 there's a threshold inquiry of voluntariness to determineit's the same voluntary -- voluntariness analysis. --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure, because a20 whether or not there was a voluntary initiation, and that that21 -- it does not comprehend or require a Miranda warning.22 Otherwise, you're double counting.23 MR. FELDMAN: But you never -- there's never --24 first of all, he had gotten a Miranda warning, initially; and25 that was when he said he wanted to see a lawyer. That was --19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that had happened. Secondly, whenever there's an initiation case, you've never had another Miranda warning before the initiation. And what the police did here --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with that. But I want -- what I think the Court is trying to find is some explanation of the threshold test for determining whether or not there was a voluntary initiation. Now, I think we agree -- or at least I agree -- that there shouldn't be any Miranda warnings required.That doesn't go into the mix. MR. FELDMAN: But --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Any new Miranda warning.MR. FELDMAN: Right, but I -- still, the -- there has been, already, an -- a Miranda warning.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.MR. FELDMAN: But, still, the question should be broken down into two parts. The -- as the Court said, in Oregon against Bradshaw, you have to -- it's useful, at least, to separate the question of initiation, which is a more limited question, from the broader question of voluntariness of a waiver --JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. --MR. FELDMAN: -- or voluntariness.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Feldman, do you agree that theState had the burden of proving voluntariness at the secondstage?20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425             MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.JUSTICE STEVENS: And why -- and why should we not credit the finding of fact by the -- by the trial judge --Maryland hasviolation.MR. FELDMAN: Well, if the --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- who found it was not voluntary? MR. FELDMAN: -- the middle-level -- what ----JUSTICE STEVENS: The middle level --MR. FELDMAN: -- -- at the middle-level --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- said there was no EdwardsMR. FELDMAN:  Right.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, that doesn't contributeanything to the dialogue.MR. FELDMAN: But the State has argued that actually, given the procedures in this case, the defendant waived his voluntariness claim. But, in any event, the State - - the Maryland Court of Appeals --JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you just told me you agree that the burden was on the --MR. FELDMAN: Right. But --             JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- State to prove voluntariness.But I still haven't heard your answer to why we should notcredit the finding of fact by the trial judge.MR. FELDMAN: Well, I'd say -- well, two things. 21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 One is, the Maryland Court of Appeals itself explicitly --2 specifically 3456 7 8 9said that it did not --JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't care --MR. FELDMAN: -- voluntariness.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what the Maryland Court of -- MR. FELDMAN: Not the midlevel --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Appeals said.MR. FELDMAN: -- court, but the --JUSTICE STEVENS: The highest court in Maryland also finding.MR. FELDMAN: No, the -- I don't think so. The10 credited the 1112 highest court in Maryland said, "We are not going to decide13 anything about voluntariness, we're only going to decide14 something about initiation."15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in any event, we have a --16 MR. FELDMAN: And --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a finding of fact by the trial18 court before us, and I don't -- I still don't understand. From19 your point of view, why shouldn't we credit that?20 MR. FELDMAN: And I don't think -- oh, because I21 don't -- the -- that court was relying on a -- on the -- on the22 -- on the question of initiation. What -- what that court was23 doing was saying, "We're going to do a kind of voluntariness-24 lite here and take all the facts that might suggest it's not25 voluntary, and count them, and say -- well, give -- those, plus22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 whatever" -- 234JUSTICE STEVENS: You disagree with the --MR.

FELDMAN:  Yes, but -- well, I think that the10 under the correct standard of what it was supposed to -- of11 what initiation consists of.12 CHIEF JUSTICE13 question of law and fact --14 MR. FELDMAN:15 CHIEF JUSTICE16 --17 MR. FELDMAN:18 CHIEF JUSTICE19 MR. FELDMAN:20 JUSTICE BREYER: If you're going to the standard,21 which is, I think, the -- actually, the difficult question22 here, what's wrong -- should you say -- what's wrong with23 saying -- which is what I was pursuing -- that, where there is24 a question that's improper, as there was here, by the police,25 the only real question is, Is a later initiation "the fruit"?23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005ROBERTS:  Because it's a mixedRight.ROBERTS:  -- and not a purely factualRight.ROBERTS:  -- determination.That's correct.￼1 MR. FELDMAN: I --2 JUSTICE BREYER: And you say the State has to show3 it wasn't the fruit. That would have the virtue of making the4 law quite consistent here, as it is with Fourth Amendment/Fifth5 Amendment cases. That's a well known concept.6 MR. FELDMAN: The Court has consistently found, in7 the Miranda context, that that kind of broad "fruits analysis"8 doesn't apply in Elstad and --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?10 MR. FELDMAN: -- other cases.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- I understand that --12 MR. FELDMAN: Because --13 JUSTICE BREYER: -- there's a lot of language --14 MR. FELDMAN: Because the -- the point of the fruits15 analysis is -- has to do with the deterrence function of the16 Fourth Amendment, which is nonexistent, or much, much reduced,17 in the Fifth Amendment context, and --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the standard fruit analysis19 is when you get something like a statement, and that statement20 then leads to further evidence. We're not -- I mean, Justice21 Breyer wasn't using the fruits analysis in that sense. He was22 -- he was getting at the -- at the same question we're all23 trying to get at: Was the later so-called initiation the24 product of the improper police comment in the first place, or25 was it voluntary?24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425             MR. FELDMAN:  And I think the Edwards rule is animportant, but limited, rule.  And the point of the Edwardsrule is to address the particular problem that's caused by aquestion.  It's not intended to address all of the otherproblems that can arise in connection with voluntary --             JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I realize that.  But youconcede -- I think you concede that the -- that the so-calledinitiation has got to be a voluntary initiation.  You don'ttake the position that it's merely magic words.  Isn't thatcorrect?             MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.             JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  If that is correct, whydo we not give some deference to the conclusion of the trialcourt that this was not voluntary?MR. FELDMAN: And --             JUSTICE SOUTER:  You say there was a legal error.What exactly was the legal error?             MR. FELDMAN:  The problem was that the trial courtwas not looking at all the factors that you would normally lookat to decidevoluntariness. It thought that, in looking at -- JUSTICE SOUTER: What did it --MR. FELDMAN: -- initiation --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- overlook? What did it overlook? MR. FELDMAN: It overlooked the fact that he hadbeen given the Miranda warnings, that, as far as anybody -- 25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's always true in every Edwards2 case.3 MR. FELDMAN: Right. Well, it's --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. So --5 MR. FELDMAN: -- so that's the case.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's a wash.7 MR. FELDMAN: It overlooked --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: What else did --9 MR. FELDMAN: -- the fact that --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- it miss?11 MR. FELDMAN: -- he knew that he had the right to12 remain silent, and that the particular problem that had been13 caused by the question --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Mr. Feldman --15 MR. FELDMAN: -- which was --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I have to interrupt. They did17 not overlook that he had been given the Miranda warning. She18 expressly commented on the fact that an hour and 17 minutes had19 lapsed since that time.20 MR. FELDMAN: Right. She didn't overlook the fact.21 She knew what the facts were. But she overlooked the22 significance of that in the analysis. But, more importantly,23 she overlooked the significance of the fact that the defendant,24 at the time that he decided, a half hour later, that he wanted25 to talk to the police, the police had terminated the earlier26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 questioning and had made it clear to him that they were going2 to honor his decision whether or not to talk to them without3 counsel present. And --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how --5 MR. FELDMAN: -- those are --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- was it that she --7 MR. FELDMAN: -- extremely ---8 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- overlooked that? I just don't9 get it.10 MR. FELDMAN: We --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: They --12 MR. FELDMAN: We -- well --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: You know, the evidence is14 undisputed that one officer made the statement, another officer15 said no, they left, 30 minutes went by. What exactly did she16 overlook?17 MR. FELDMAN: It -- she did -- what -- she did not18 give the proper weight to those facts, which, in a proper19 involuntariness analysis, are ones that are important.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that those facts21 could not reasonably be found to be -- to produce a situation22 in which the defendant believed he would be hounded to talk, so23 he said, "What the heck, I'll talk."24 MR. FELDMAN: Right.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what Edwards is directing.27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FELDMAN: Right. And that Edwards was designedto support --JUSTICE SCALIA: That no factfinder -- and this is mixed fact and law -- could reasonably come to that conclusion.MR. FELDMAN: That --JUSTICE SCALIA: When it -- when one of the -- the last he had heard from the officers was, "No, he doesn't want to talk. He already asked for a lawyer. We cannot talk to him now."MR. FELDMAN: Coupled --JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying no reasonable judge could find that that defendant thought he would be hounded.MR. FELDMAN: Right. And the concern of Edwards -- as the court has repeatedly explained, the concern of Edwardsis that the court -- that the police will wear down or badger the defendant. But once there's -- if there's been a --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't count --MR. FELDMAN: -- single comment, as can happen -- JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feldman, it doesn't count asbadgering, or the equivalent, that the police -- the -- walkin, and they present not only the charges, but they present theapplication for the charges, which shows that the co-perpetrator had talked to the police, talked his head off, andput all the blame, at every step on the way, on this defendant?That did weigh heavily in the trial judge's mind. 28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FELDMAN: But --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is -- was that improper to take into account? How would a reasonable person in this situation feel?" Would he feel that he was impelled to speak, because the co-perpetrator had --             MR. FELDMAN:  That -- I mean, there's two points I'dlike to make about that.  One is, as far as I know underMaryland practice, what they did is consistent with Marylandpractice as part of what's normally attendant on takingsomebody into custody.  And it's -- and it doesn't count asquestioning, under Miranda.  And it's a -- it's a differentproblem.  And, secondly, that issue of handing him thatcharging document -- which I think is probably a soundpractice, because it lets the defendant know what he's chargedwith -- that practice is one that can happen and can have itsinfluence on a defendant's decision whether or to talk, in anycase, and should be considered in a general involuntarinessanalysis.  But it's not a decisive factor in this case, and itdoesn't have to do with the particular concerns of Edwards.             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has nothing to do with whetherthe defendant thinks he is going to be MR. FELDMAN: That's --JUSTICE SCALIA: It has -- MR. FELDMAN: -- correct. JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to do29hounded.with --Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼12345 badgered and 678 at. 9MR. FELDMAN: That's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- with whether --MR. FELDMAN: That's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the defendant thinks he will be badgered until he finally talks.MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. They're all -- JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what Edwards is directedMR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.  They're already under10 -- 1112 avoiding badgering, but the issue before us is initiation.13 That's not a question of badgering, it's a question of14 initiation. And don't the points that Justice Ginsburg raised15 go to whether the initiation is likely to have been a voluntary16 initiation?17 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think they do, because, under18 the Court's decision in Bradshaw, there's initiation, and then19 there's always a separate voluntariness inquiry to take care of20 those problems.21 Thank you.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.23 Mr. Ravenell.24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. RAVENELL25 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, Edwards is directed at￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. RAVENELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please theCourt:             It is our position that to allow so-called curativemeasures would lead to police abuses.  If curative measures areallowed, intentional coercive violations should never beallowed to be cured.ROBERTS: What if it -- In fact --                           ROBERTS:  What if, instead of the halfhour or so, 24 hours had passed and they got a call from thedefendant, said, "I want to talk now"?  Still, is that -- isthat initiation on his part?             MR. RAVENELL:  I think that if there had been 24hours that had passed, then you would -- it would be a factorthat you would consider in deciding whether the defendant hasinitiated the conversation.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that factor --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you can --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- can work the other way. Youwould be up here, saying, "Oh, he had 24 hours.  He thought hewas going to get the death penalty.  He knew the other man wasturning on him to implicate him in the murder.  His agony wasincreasing."  I mean, I -- it seems to me the question iswhether or not the curative measures were adequate.31CHIEF JUSTICEMR. RAVENELL:CHIEF JUSTICEAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. RAVENELL: And --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, you know, we can play3 the game -- 5 minutes, 20 minutes --4 MR. RAVENELL: Right.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- 30 minutes. We know that.6 But, it seems to me, when 30 minutes passed here, there were7 curative measures. Now, you say, at the outset, there can8 never be a -- curative measures. That -- I don't think you9 have anything to -- any support for that in the case law.10 MR. RAVENELL: I certainly believe that the support11 is, in Edwards versus Arizona, that there should not be a cure12 unless the defendant himself initiates the contact.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: A cure --14 MR. RAVENELL: So, I think there is.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: A cure of --16 MR. RAVENELL: And if there is --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sorry, go on.19 MR. RAVENELL: Sure.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have21 would have said, then, 24 hours doesn't make a difference. If22 there can never be a cure, if there's a violation because23 question from Reese constitutes interrogation, and you're24 telling us there's no cure, it doesn't matter how long it25 MR. RAVENELL: Yes, I think what I'm -- with32theis.all dueAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005thought --thought you￼1 respect, I think what I'm telling the Court is that the2 practice should be, as it has been the last 25 years, that you3 do not allow cures of Edwards versus Arizona by the police4 intentionally violating one's rights and then attempting to5 cure it. But, if this Court finds that there can be a cure, we6 want to participate in what would be a proper cure.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: A cure of what? That's what --8 MR. RAVENELL: Of a violation.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me, a lot of this10 discussion has come down to. What are you curing? Are you11 curing involuntariness of the confession, or are you curing the12 police badgering? I thought that we were just trying to cure13 the badgering and then let the voluntariness of the confession14 be decided as voluntariness is normally decided, for which15 purpose you would take into account that he's been --16 erroneously said he was charged with murder, or whatever.17 MR. RAVENELL: I disagree with Your Honor on -- for18 two reasons. First, I think that, as several members have --19 certainly have said so far, that we should focus on whether20 there was a voluntary initiation. That has to be considered.21 Secondly, I've heard mentioned several times that Edwards only22 deals with badgering. I commit -- commend this Court to23 Illinois -- Smith versus Illinois -- and Minnick versus24 Mississippi, where this Court has said that Edwards is not only25 about badgering, but the Court said it's about overreaching by33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the police, whether it's explicit or subtle. So, it's not2 badgering, only. And when the Petitioner says that Edwards is3 only about badgering, this Court has said that it's about more4 than badgering. It is whether there is overreaching by the5 police officers that is subtle, that is intentional, that is in6 deliberate -- that is deliberate, any overreaching --7 8 9CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.MR. RAVENELL: -- that causes --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, assuming --MR. RAVENELL: -- the person --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there was --MR. RAVENELL: -- to give up his rights.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- assuming there was on the part of Officer Reese, my question is, Is10 11 12 1314 overreaching15 there any circumstance in which that overreaching can be cured?16 And I thought your answer is that, yes, that with the17 sufficient passage of time, it can be cured.18 MR. RAVENELL: No, with all due respect, Your Honor,19 that was not my answer. My answer is that -- and I will tell20 Your Honor that I will not change that position -- it should21 never be allowed to be cured.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, once Officer --23 MR. RAVENELL: But --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- once Officer Reese made25 his comment, there was no circumstance, even a week, a month --34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 relatives come in and say, "We think you ought to talk," no2 intervening circumstance -- once there is that one sentence of3 overreaching, he can never initiate contact -- discussion with4 --5 MR. RAVENELL: The better --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the police.7 MR. RAVENELL: In my opinion, the better policy, the8 better practice, is that there should not be. Now --9 10 11 12 13JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not helping -- MR. RAVENELL: -- if the --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- defendants, you know. MR. RAVENELL: -- if I --JUSTICE SCALIA:  In some cases, you are not helping14 defendants. 151617 talks to his18 better cooperate with the police and get a lesser sentence."19 But you're saying that can't happen. Once --MR. RAVENELL: Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes, a defendant, after he relatives, might conclude, "Boy, you know, I'd20 MR. RAVENELL: In my --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- once the police make a22 misstatement, he can never come forward and say, "I want to23 confess."24 MR. RAVENELL: In my 20 years of trial practice, I25 have never found it to be at the defendant's best interest to35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 communicate with the police without counsel. I have --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ravenell --3 MR. RAVENELL: -- never found it to be --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you are defending a judgment5 that no court in Maryland, as far as I know, ever made. All of6 the courts thought that the law was, yes, the taint of an7 improper question by the police can be removed.8 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, let's take the case as it10 comes to us.11 MR. RAVENELL: Sure.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The taint can be removed. That13 is the law.14 MR. RAVENELL: Correct.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Accepting that to be the law,16 what, in your judgment, would it take to remove the taint? --17 the taint here being the statement that Office Reese made.18 MR. RAVENELL: I'll be happy to participate in that19 conversation. And this is how we believe that taint can be20 cured, if at all. Number one, you put the suspect back in the21 position that he was in before the violation occurred. How do22 you do that? This is a violation of a right to counsel. Not a23 right to remain silent; a right to counsel. The suspect asked24 for counsel. The best way to cure it is, give him counsel.25 How else do you cure it? You tell him that he no longer -- "We36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 were wrong when we told you, you face the death penalty."2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose --3 MR. RAVENELL: "You do not face the death penalty."4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- suppose, again, we do not5 accept that position. You need another fallback position in6 our -- in order to argue the case before us.7 MR. RAVENELL: I don't agree that I need another8 fallback position, because I believe that if the Court finds9 that right to counsel -- giving him counsel is not enough,10 other things I'm about to tell the Court, I think, will also be11 a factor.12 For example, telling the defendant that he, in fact,13 does not face the death penalty. Very interestingly, this14 Court -- and the Seibert case, in fact, Justice Kennedy's15 opinion, said that one of the things you consider is, when16 there is a violation of the right to Miranda rights, you tell17 the suspect, "That was an improper violation of your right.18 That statement may not be admissible" --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Johns --20 MR. RAVENELL: --- "against you."21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Johns, in effect, did that22 here.23 MR. RAVENELL: We disagree.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Certainly, one of the best25 curative devices is immediate correction from a superior. And37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that is exactly what happened here.2 MR. RAVENELL: Interestingly, what Your Honor said3 in the Seibert case is that when -- and, in fact, the plurality4 opinion -- when you give an alleged cure in the midst of the5 violation, the defendant misses it. So, giving this alleged6 cure in the midst of the violation creates the problem. What7 you need to do is --8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you think you'd have a9 stronger case if Johns hadn't corrected Reese?10111213141516171819 if Johns did20 understand the Court says, "Maybe we won't go that far." But,21 if you're not going to give him counsel, what else can you do?22 You can certainly tell him that the comment by Officer Reese23 was improper, "We will honor your right to an attorney. What24 Officer Reese said was wrong." As we point out in our brief,25 there was never a time when Detective Johns spoke to Blake38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. RAVENELL: I think that -- I think -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --MR. RAVENELL: -- what we wouldJUSTICE KENNEDY: But --MR. RAVENELL: -- is a strongerJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's a --MR. RAVENELL: -- case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- far stretch. It's --MR. RAVENELL: No. I think the case would be proper certain things. One is, give him counsel. Now, Ihave ----￼1 directly and made any efforts to clarify, or even resolve, the2 alleged -- the violation. In fact, Detective --3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --4 MR. RAVENELL: -- Johns --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't want the --6 MR. RAVENELL: -- says --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't want the8 officer talking to Blake directly. I thought that would be9 another violation.10 MR. RAVENELL: No. No. Now that there is a11 violation, you have to cure it. You have to cure it. And the12 only way to cure it is for someone to speak to him.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it seems --14 MR. RAVENELL: One of the things --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to me that it's a bit16 much to say that the problem is that the -- he didn't talk to17 Blake directly, because that gets into another extended18 dialogue with the defendant that the defendant has not19 initiated. It seems it's much better, in the defendant's20 presence, to do what Johns did here, which is to rebuke Reese21 for the interrogation.22 MR. RAVENELL: With all due respect, I couldn't23 disagree more, because I think what has to be is that there has24 to be a direct comment to the suspect so that the suspect25 understands that this violation occurred, "It was a violation39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of your right, and we, the police, will not countenance what2 Reese did. And here is what we will do. We will get you3 counsel, if you wish to have counsel. You are not facing the4 death penalty, young 17-year-old sitting in a cell in your5 underwear. That is not correct. Here is what we can do for6 you. We will" -- in fact, as this Court suggests in the7 plurality opinion and Seibert, you change location. You change8 the interrogator. You give him time. As this Court said -- in9 fact, Justice Scalia's -- maybe dicta in McNeil said -- you10 look at a lapse of time. You consider that there is a break in11 time. All of those factors may be -- if all of those things12 were done, then you could become -- begin to move closer to13 putting Blake back in the position --14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well --15 MR. RAVENELL: -- that he was in before.16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- what about just simple thing17 like this, that there is an implication in what Reese said,18 that he listens to in his cell, "I guess you'd -- he'll want to19 talk to us now, huh?" The implication is that he faces death,20 and he'll be better off by talking to them without a lawyer.21 MR. RAVENELL: And --22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, suppose Johns had said to the23 defendant, "Mr. Blake, I want to tell you something. My24 colleague here has implied that you will be better off, because25 of the death possibility, in talking to us without a lawyer.40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 We want to tell you, that isn't true. There is no way that2 you'll be better off talking to us without a lawyer. You will3 be at least equally, from your point of view, as well off if4 you talk to a lawyer." Now, that might have cured it, I guess.5 MR. RAVENELL: I think that if that was done, then6 we are moving in the right direction. But --789 say, "Please[Laughter.]JUSTICE KENNEDY: The right direction would be to don't talk to us."MR. RAVENELL: The right direction would be -- [Laughter.]MR. RAVENELL: I would -- I would -- as Mr. Blake's10 11 1213 attorney, I would have appreciated that.14 [Laughter.]15 MR. RAVENELL: Now, I will tell the Court that I16 believe that when you add those factors, you really do get17 closer to curing what we think should not be cured. Several18 things this Court said earlier -- and I think is correct, from19 some of the members of the Court -- is that we have to give20 deference to the trial court's finding. The Government would21 have you pay no attention to the trial court's finding when the22 trial court heard Officer Reese -- in fact, heard Officer Reese23 sit on the witness stand and lie under oath -- the court found24 that Officer Reese was not worthy of belief. Not only did he25 violate Mr. Blake's right, he then sat on the witness stand and41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 lied about it. Now, do we want to encourage that kind of2 police abuse, where the police will abuse the rights of3 someone, then sit on the witness stand and lie, and then we say4 -- well, the trial judge, who had a chance to observe the5 demeanor, to watch the witnesses, trial judge, Judge North, who6 is actually present here, and who had a chance to observe each7 witness testify --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, there's no dispute9 about the historical facts found by the judge. Everybody10 agrees this is the dialogue that took place, this is the time11 that it took 121314 It's a very15 that is under the Edwards initiation rule. So, it's not an16 issue of deference to the trial-court judge. We know what the17 facts are. We're deferring to those findings of fact. It's a18 question of what the legal significance is.place.MR. RAVENELL:  Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Those are factual questions.different question of what the significance of19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what the Chief Justice says20 was true in Bradshaw and in Edwards and in Elstad.21 MR. RAVENELL: I will ask --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All questions, which were mixed23 questions of law and fact, where this Court took the words,24 took the facts, and made a rule. And that's this case.25 MR. RAVENELL: I will direct the Court to two cases, 42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Salve Regina College versus Russell, 499 U.S. 225, where this2 Court said the following, "Deferential review of mixed facts --3 mixed questions of law and fact is warranted where it appears4 that the District Court is better positioned than the appellate5 court to decide the issue in question, or that probing6 appellate scrutiny is -- will not contribute to the clarity of7 legal doctrine." The Court further said, in Miller versus --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to -- stop there.9 Why is the trial court better suited to apply the Edwards rule10 to a set of facts that we would -- we accept based on deference11 to the factfinder?12 MR. RAVENELL: I find that interesting, Your Honor,13 because the Court did the same thing Elstad. This Court, in14 fact, gave every deference to the trial court's finding in15 Elstad. So, there's absolutely no reason why this Court would16 not give the same deferential treatment to Judge North's17 decision, when Judge North, just as the trial judge in Elstad,18 got a chance to observe the witnesses who testified, and found19 that that violation of Elstad's right was not intentional, that20 it was, kind of, a good-faith violation. That had an impact.21 And, in fact, in Seibert, the Court again made reference to22 that, and, in Justice O'Connor's dissent, made reference to23 that. So, it is clear that this Court has given deference --24 clear deference, on every the -- one of the cases I've25 mentioned in the past, to a trial court's finding.43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, are you --2 MR. RAVENELL: There is no reason --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- arguing that --4 MR. RAVENELL: -- to be different here.5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- are you arguing that trial6 court, even though there's agreement -- understanding on most7 of the historical facts, is still in a better position to make8 the judgment call as to whether it was voluntary or not?9 MR. RAVENELL: Yes, I am. And I will point the10 Court to Miller versus Fenton, 478 U.S. 104, where this Court11 said, "Equally clear, an issue does not lose its factual12 character merely because its resolution is dispositive of the13 ultimate constitutional question."14 This Court has made clear that you give deference to15 the trial judge's findings, even if it may have an impact on16 the ultimate resolution, even where it is a mixed question of17 fact and law. And that's all we ask for in this case.18 I believe, Your Honor, that when we consider that --19 in this particular matter, the evidence is clear that Mr. Blake20 was responding to the comments by Office Reese. And the trial21 court made that finding. The trial court made a finding that22 Office Reese's comment was intended to elicit a response. Same23 thing this Court has said in Innis.24 When you get to the next step, the question is, What25 that interrogation? The trial court made a factual finding it44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 was interrogation. In fact, Petitioner concedes it was2 interrogation.3 Next step was, Was it a response, or was it new4 initiation of a new conversation, by Blake? The trial court5 found that it was a response by Mr. Blake to the comments by6 Officer Reese.78 fact, was no9 the Court ofThe trial court also made a finding that there, incure.  That factual finding was given deference byAppeals.  The Court of Appeals considered several10 things. It said you should consider the attenuation. This11 Court said you should consider change in interrogation,12 location of interrogation --change in the interrogator --13 excuse me -- change in the location. And I believe that we add14 the fact that there would have been no further advice to the --15 to the suspect that he did not face the death penalty.16 Parties agree here. In fact, in the SG's, Solicitor17 General's, brief, on page 25, they say, "If there has been any18 intentional coercive violation, there should be not be a cure."19 The trial court found that the act of Office Johns was20 intentional. I don't think anyone -- anyone, even under -- in21 -- under any standard of review -- could find that Officer John22 -- Officer Reese's -- excuse me -- comment was not intentional.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the quote from the SG's24 brief? I didn't --25 MR.

"Police officers who engage in12 interrogation after a suspect has invoked his right to counsel13 also run the risk of a judicial finding that any statement18 finding that 19202114 given was coerced," as we have here.

RAVENELL: Right.             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- coerced statement, in thatevent, it would be unusable for any purpose.             MR. RAVENELL:  All right.  I understand.             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the -- and the Court ofAppeals of Maryland said, "We're going to look at this in thelegal sense, not the dictionary sense."             MR. RAVENELL:  Correct.             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's what we're reviewing47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 here.2 MR. RAVENELL: And I think that when we review that3 in a mixed question of fact or law, giving all deference to the4 trial court's finding, as this Court has in the past in the5 cases I've cited, that, in fact, there is -- was a violation,6 the violation was not cured, and that, even if this Court7 establishes curative measures, those measures must be designed8 to put the suspect back in the position that he was in prior to9 the police violation of his rights. We think that it is a10 dangerous path to go down to allow the police to abuse a11 suspect's rights, and then cure it.12 One of the things I believe we learned from what13 occurred in Elstad and then in Seibert is that -- and, in fact,14 in the plurality opinion in Seibert, this Court pointed out15 that after Elstad, some 20-something years, the police created16 policies and strategies designed to violate what -- the first17 question first. And, in fact, the plurality opinion pointed18 out that not only did the police create that strategy, what the19 police, in fact, started doing was omitting Miranda altogether.20 And this Court made reference to that in U.S. versus Harris,21 that what the police will do, if you give them the opportunity,22 they will abuse the rights and attempt to cure --23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if you're looking -- if24 you're taking your standard seriously --25 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: The reason that my -- I was able to give my hypothetical before --             MR.

RAVENELL:  Correct.JUSTICE BREYER:  But if it had been some otherquestions, some questions, for example, about the crime, allyou would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425implication came out of those questions, which might have beennothing.MR. RAVENELL: Correct.JUSTICE BREYER: So timely --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is no finding to supportthe suggestion that it was just the death penalty that concerned him. He was also concerned, I thought, about the fact that his accomplice, Tolbert, had implicated him, and --MR. RAVENELL: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- presumably implicated him -- MR. RAVENELL: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- too far. So is --MR. RAVENELL: And the trial --JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's just no finding that itwas simply the death penalty that --MR. RAVENELL: I agree. And the trial court madeclear that she was considering everything. But what's important is that the trial court got a chance to hear Mr. Blake testify. The trial court --JUSTICE KENNEDY: And --MR. RAVENELL: -- understood --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- his concern with Tolbert was awholly legitimate reason for him to want to talk to the police and --50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. RAVENELL: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- get things straightened awayright away.MR. RAVENELL: We do not dispute that at all. But what is important is that the trial judge got a chance to assess all of those factors, and the trial judge, even after assessing those factors, concluded that what impacted -- that there was still a great impact on him. And it is the Government's burden --JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so --MR. RAVENELL: -- it was their burden -- JUSTICE BREYER: -- maybe you should modify thestandard.  Maybe the standard ought to be that where you havean improper line of questioning, after the warning, that thepolice either have to negative the implication of thosequestions, the relevant implication, or the State has to showthat some other series of independent events, such as JusticeKennedy mentioned, made the difference.  That is, caused thelater request to talk without a lawyer.  And if they can't showthe one or the other, then they lose.MR. RAVENELL: Correct. And that is what the trial judge did in this case. The trial judge considered those factors. And that is what -- we leave it to the judges --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt -- MR. RAVENELL: -- to do.51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you with a -- with a question? MR. RAVENELL: Yes.JUSTICE STEVENS: You seem to have taken theposition that the State cannot cure an Edwards violation, whichseems to me quite different from the trial court's ruling,because the trial court made a number of factual statementsthat seem to me to be saying, "Had these things been done, theviolation might have been a -- cured."  She referred to thefact he was still undressed, still in a cold cell, that hisparent -- there was no parent present.  He was scared, and --he was scared and thought he was facing death.  Now, it seemsto me the logical inference from the trial judge's statementis, "Had each of those things been different, I might havefound a cure."MR. RAVENELL: Correct.JUSTICE STEVENS: And, otherwise, why should -- why would she go through these ventures?MR. RAVENELL: I agree, Your Honor, that the trial court considered that there can be a cure. And, in fact, the Court of Appeals of Maryland said there --JUSTICE STEVENS: So, that --MR. RAVENELL: -- can be a cure.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- it doesn't seem to me -- foryou to prevail,there can neveryou have to take the extreme position thatbe a cure.52Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. RAVENELL: No. And that's why I think I -- I hope I've made --JUSTICE STEVENS: And when the trial judge --MR.

RAVENELL: I agree that I do not need this Court to find that Edwards versus Arizona remains untouched for me to win. We do not need that, because, when you consider what the trial court's finding was, and the deference that was given toby the Court of Appeals, we win, as well. What I am trying to say is that I think the better practice is that we do not allow the police to go down this line of starting to abuse rights,and then curing them. But I'd just --             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it seems to --             MR. RAVENELL:  We don't -- I don't need that to win.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- it really seems to me you'readopting quite an extreme position, because it does seem to me perfectly obvious if, for example, they got a lawyer or brought his parents in, and they talked it over for 20 minutes and said, "We think he ought to do it." --             MR. RAVENELL:  Yes.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- you could -- you could surely53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cure it in some fairness.MR. RAVENELL: I certainly believe that, from theteachings of Seibert and from other cases, that this Court clearly seemed to be leaning towards cure, that there can be cures. I know that the position on Edwards versus Arizona remaining intact is probably, in many ways, not where this Court is leaning. I understand that. But I certainly also understand we don't need to get to that extreme position to win, because the facts in this case are so clearly in our favor from the trial court's finding that giving it the -- any deference --JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Ravenell --MR.

I do not see how the fact that he's -- he's there in the cell in his underwear, the fact that he's 17, the fact that he thinks, and has been led to believe, erroneously, that there's a death penalty in the offing, has anything to do with the question that Edwards asks, which is whether the police, or this individual, initiated the conversation.MR. RAVENELL: I think that the problem is -- 54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conversationJUSTICE SCALIA: That is the issue in these cases -- MR.

RAVENELL:  And I think that all those things arethe Court can consider in deciding whether Blakefactors thatvoluntarily initiated the contact.             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I don't think so.  I think theygo to whether the confession he gave was voluntary, but I don'tsee how they have anything to do with whether he initiated theconversation.             MR. RAVENELL:  Your Honor, with all due respect,this Court, in Elstad and in Seibert, said that psychologicalpressures, which are very similar to the fruits analysis, canbe considered on whether there's a Fifth Amendment violation.JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --MR. RAVENELL: In fact --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I think -- tell me if I'mwrong about this particular record.  I thought that the trialjudge put it rather simply.  He said, "There was aninterrogation by a police officer named Reese."             MR. RAVENELL:  Correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's conceded, as I understand it from Maryland --MR.

And that's why I said when we look at what Innis says -- and I made Innis earlier -- that it's any comment, any19 earlier that20 reference to21 statement, designed to elicit a response. The trial court that22 found that what Officer Reese did was designed to elicit a23 response. This Petitioner agrees that it24 therefore, designed to elicit a response.25 The next question is, Was it56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOwas interrogation;-- did Blake respond?Washington, DC 20005￼1 The trial court found, after hearing Blake testify, hearing2 other witnesses, that Blake was merely -- and I'd say merely,3 but very importantly -- responding to what Officer Reese said,4 not initiating a new conversation, that it was a continuous5 matter of only 28 minutes.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, your position, I guess, is -- I7 think it is, in your last answer -- that we really shouldn't be8 phrasing the inquiry in terms of the voluntariness of the9 suspect's statement, at this point. We, rather, should be10 focusing it on whether the statement was, in fact, a11 spontaneous initiation on his part or a response to the12 preceding police statement.13 MR. RAVENELL: Which is what the --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the way you would phrase the15 --16 MR. RAVENELL: Yes.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- issue for us.18 MR. RAVENELL: And which is what the trial judge did19 below. And when the trial judge made that finding, that what20 Blake was doing was responding -- because the trial court is in21 that unique position that this Court or any other public court22 can never be in, which is listening to the witnesses, we give23 the trial judges the duty to hear those witnesses and to make24 judgment calls based on what they hear from those individuals.25 We --57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --MR. RAVENELL: -- trust them with it.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- absent of good-cop/bad-copfinding, and I -- and I repeat that they've credited Johns'testimony here -- this seems to me a very odd sort ofinterrogation, to say, "No, no, you -- we can't talk to himnow."  That's an interrogation?  That's a stretch.MR. RAVENELL: Well, I would say this. The trial court certainly said it struck her as a good-cop/bad-cop routine. I will say the following. If you do exactly what Detective Johns and Officer Reese did in this case, and if the person does decide to speak to you -- now, whether you phrase it the same way Detective Johns did or not -- the police are in no worse-off case -- position than they would be if the person had continued to sit in that cell alone and not spoken. Therefore, however you do it -- and the police will always come up with a creative way to do it, we know that from prior experience and past experience -- they will always find a unique way to do it. It may not --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is my --MR. RAVENELL: -- be the same way.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is my understanding ofthe Maryland law in effect when this happened correct that ifyou prevail on suppression, your client cannot face charges, nomatter what the other evidence is?58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425             MR. RAVENELL:  Not if we prevail on suppression, no. If we prevail on suppression, the State still had the right toprosecute Mr. Blake. When the State chose to take an interlocutory appeal, the law was -- no longer the law --             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.MR. RAVENELL: -- but the law at the time was that if the State was not successful on appeal, it would be barred from prosecuting Mr. Blake. But they were not barred from going forward with their case --case at thisCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that --MR. RAVENELL:  -- at the time of suppression.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that law applies to thistime, correct?MR. RAVENELL:  Correct.  And I think that thatshould have nothing to do with how the Court rules on thisparticular matter, what the final result will be, whether we goto trial or not.             I'll be happy to answer any other questions.  Well,I see my time's up.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Ravenell.             MR. RAVENELL:  Thank you.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Graeff, you have 5minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN GRILL GRAEFFON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 59Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. GRAEFF: Thank you.             With respect to the standard of review, this Courtsaid, in Thompson versus Keohane, that custody is a mixedquestion of fact and law, and voluntariness -- in Miller versusFenton -- that voluntariness is a mixed question of fact andlaw.  And so, the historical facts are entitled to deference.But there is de novo review of the ultimate question of custodyand voluntariness.  And, given the questions here about whatconstitutes a cure, shows that that same standard should apply.It should be a legal standard, not a factual finding. JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the trial judge'sdetermination? There was a question. Everybody agrees Reese - - what Reese did was interrogate.MS. GRAEFF: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the trial judge then finds there was an answer to that question. Is that a matter of fact? It didn't seem that the trial judge was treating that as a matter of law.MS. GRAEFF: Well, whether there was a cure, and whether he initiated, it's the State's position to be a mixed of question of fact and law. What was said is a historical fact. Whether what -- Detective Johns cured it and allowed Blake to initiate should be reviewed de novo.             And with respect to initiation, it's important tonote that, in Bradshaw, the Court said that there's a two-part60Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 inquiry. You look at, one, did the defendant initiate? And,2 two, if he did, that's when you get to the voluntariness3 analysis.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it fact, or is it not fact, law,5 in respect to the following? He's sitting there. And there is6 a question of what motivated him. Did it motivate him totally7 that his -- this thing about his codefendant, or was he moved,8 in significant part -- moved, motivated -- by the earlier, 30-9 minute earlier, improper questioning? That sounds like a fact.10 Or do you think it's not a fact?11 MS. GRAEFF: I think that is a fact, but, under12 Seibert and Elstad, is not the proper analysis. You don't look13 at -- in Seibert and Elstad, the court did not look at whether14 the prior unwarned statement caused the second statement. The15 court looked at whether the cure effectively advised the16 suspect that he did not have to speak. And we're suggesting17 that the same analysis applies in the Edwards context. You18 don't look at whether the improper comment caused the19 initiation. You look at whether the cure effectively conveyed20 that there would be no more questioning, that the choice was up21 to the suspect and the police were going to honor that choice.22 And once that cure happens and the suspect indicates he wants23 to speak, there's initiation. And then the court can go on to24 the voluntariness analysis.25 The Edwards presumption of involuntariness imposes a61Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425high cost to the truthseeking function of a trial, to society'sinterest in having relevant evidence admitted at trial.  Andwhen the purpose of Edwards is not served, when a suspectunderstands that questioning will cease, that high cost is notjustified.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask one question before yousit down, if you're through?  Is it your understanding that thetrial judge held that an Edward violation may not be cured, orthat she held that, on the facts here, it was not cured?             MS. GRAEFF:  My reading is, she found, on the factshere, it was not cured.             JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that, your -- the answer toyour -- the question presented in your cert petition really isanswered.  We all agree, it can be cured.MS. GRAEFF: Well, it depends what can --             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because the question you asked iswhether it can be cured.MS. GRAEFF: Well, this Court has never addressed -- and, in fact, there is disagreement here as to whether it canbe cured. So, here, the trial court did look -- the trialcourt really didn't look at the analysis in how you look at whether --JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree --MS. GRAEFF: -- it's cured --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the trial judge did assume62Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 it could be cured.2 MS. GRAEFF: Well, she looked at -- she looked at --3 I guess it's difficult to understand exactly. She was looking4 -- she looked at Edwards, she looked at voluntariness, she5 talked about attenuation. So, she did acknowledge that if it6 was six months later, he could give a statement.78 cure. 9101112 defendant be 1314 aware of whether he can be prosecuted federally. He cannot be15 prosecuted in State court, though. Under Maryland law at the16 time, if we do not prevail in this appeal, he cannot be17 prosecuted by --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --19 MS. GRAEFF: -- the State court.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the prosecutors were well21 aware of that when they determined to appeal.22 MS. GRAEFF: Yes.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But perhaps they were worried24 that they didn't have a case without the defendant's25 statements.63Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so, there could have been aMS.

But, at this time,the prosecution did have to decide whether to appeal thestatement, and that law has been changed.  But with respect toBlake, he will not be able to be prosecuted if the State doesnot prevail in this Court.             Detective Johns cured the impropriety here.  He madeit clear to Blake that there would be no more questioning.  Andit was Blake's choice whether to speak or remain silent.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.             The case is submitted.             [Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40064Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
