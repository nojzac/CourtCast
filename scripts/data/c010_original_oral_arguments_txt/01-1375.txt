KNEEDLER      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. KNEEDLER:  Justice Stevens, and may it7 8 9in the case of the United States against the Navajo Nationplease the Court:          In 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the1011121314   leases between the parties.  With respect to the lease15   principally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the16   amendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody17   from 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent18   of the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in19   the amount of the royalty.  That new royalty level was the20   same as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and21   it was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that22   the Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal23   company could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per24   ton.25             The package of lease amendments also contained3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005request of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company,approved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding￼ 1   numerous other provisions that were of benefit to the 2   tribe, including amendments to the other lease, that 3   more -- that approximately doubled the amount of the 4   royalty and a substantial increase in payments for water 5   use at the mines. 6             The Secretary's approval of the lease package in 7   1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the 8   regulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern 9   her approval of lease agreements under that act.10             Because there was no violation of any act of11   Congress or regulation of an executive department, much12   less one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the13   payment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of14   action in this case under the Tucker Act.15             The Court --16             QUESTION:  Is there some other possible cause of17   action?  Certainly it was unfortunate, to say the least,18   that the Secretary of the Interior at the time apparently19   had private conversations that -- with representatives of20   Peabody Coal to try to discourage the approval of the21   20-dollar rate.￼               MR. KNEEDLER:  It was unfortunate, Justice24             QUESTION:  And is there any other remedy for the25 tribe potentially for this action? 4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200052223   O'Connor. 1             MR. KNEEDLER:  I think there -- it -- first of2 all, I -- 3             QUESTION:  Is there a lawsuit now pending -- 4             MR. KNEEDLER:  Not -- not on that basis. 5             QUESTION:  -- to cover something else? 6             MR. KNEEDLER:  There's a -- there's a suit by 7   the tribe against Peabody, but -- but the -- as a remedy 8   against the United States, the only suit would be 9   conceivably an APA action.10             I -- I should point out that there was no11   regulation or statute that barred that communication at12 the time.13             QUESTION:  It's the APA action.  I mean, is14   this -- is this a proceeding -- was the proceeding15   supposed to be a proceeding required by statute to be16   decided on a record?17             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No, it was not.18             QUESTION:  Well, then that's an informal19   adjudication.20             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  I'm -- I'm not --21             QUESTION:  Ex parte communications take place22   all the time in those situations.  So what's unfortunate23   about it?  Maybe it was unfortunate politically, but I24   mean, legally --25             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1234567   in the Secretary's regulations at the time.  I did not8   mean to imply --          QUESTION:  -- is there any -- is there any rule,regulation, or anything in the APA that forbids anex parte communication --MR. KNEEDLER:  There was not and there was --QUESTION:  -- in this circumstance?MR. KNEEDLER:  There was not and there was not 9             QUESTION:  Would there be now?10             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.11             QUESTION:  I mean, I don't know any agency --12             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  There's --13             QUESTION:  -- that ever forbids of something14   like that, but I might be wrong.  I want to find out about15   it.16             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No, there's -- there's not.17   And -- and I didn't mean to imply that an APA suit would18   be successful.  All I meant to say is that that would be￼the avenue in which to test that because an argument thatthat was a -- that that was a violation would beessentially --19202122232425   that a court would impose.  Again, we don't think that aQUESTION:  Violation of what?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Of -- of some -- some standard ofprocedure of fairness -- procedural fairness I suppose6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   court could do that.  I -- I simply wanted to say that2   if --3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  There are some D.C. Circuit casesthat suggest when there's a contest between a valuableprivilege, that ex parte communications are not -- not tobe permitted.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But that is -- that is notsomething, first of all, that -- that appears in a statuteor regulation, and under Vermont Yankee, which I thinkcame after those D.C. Circuit decisions, it wouldn't beproper for a court to impose that on a -- onto an agency.101112131415161718   we --19In any event, there was no restriction here.(Laughter.)QUESTION:  -- before Vermont Yankee.MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- that's correct.  And(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  The D.C. Circuit used to create itsown APA before -- before --￼               MR. KNEEDLER:  We don't think there's any legal21   standard, but even if there were, that sort of thing is22   not something that would mandate the payment of -- of23   damages for a violation.24             QUESTION:  The APA suit that you're -- you're25   envisioning as a potential -- that doesn't have any7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000520 1   dollars attached to it.  That would be for declaratory 2   injunction? 3             MR. KNEEDLER:  To -- or to set aside the -- the 4   Secretary's subsequent approval of the lease or -- or 5   something of that nature. 6             QUESTION:  Well, the lease is now expired, I7 take it. 8             MR. KNEEDLER:  The lease -- 9             QUESTION:  We're not still operating under that10   same lease, or are we?11             MR. KNEEDLER:  We -- we are.  The -- the tribe12   and the -- and the Peabody are still operating under that13   same lease.  It was amended in 1987.  This was 3 years14   after the -- the communication that -- that you're15   referring to.16             QUESTION:  And there's been no application to17   set aside the lease.18             MR. KNEEDLER:  There has not.  And -- and as19   I -- as I pointed out, there are numerous aspects of the20   lease package that was approved in -- in 1987 that are21   advantageous to the -- to the tribe.22             QUESTION:  And since the events, has the tribe23   obtained the authority to impose taxes that was not24   previously --25             MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- well, the -- this Court in8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   1985 in the Kerr-McGee case upheld the right of the Navajo2   tribe to impose taxes, but that's without the Secretary's3   approval.  And these lease agreement -- the lease4   amendments in 1987 were negotiated and arrived at in -- in5   the context of that decision.6             Now, the -- the tribe has waived its right to7   collect taxes with respect to coal that goes to the -- a8   generating station in -- in Arizona.  The rest of the9   coal, though, is subject to the -- to the tax.  There's anoverall cap on that.          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, just -- could I just go10111213   communications with the -- the coal company?  Is it your14   position that did not breach any fiduciary obligation15   whatsoever?back for a second to the Secretary's private￼25 sense --MR. KNEEDLER:  No --1617181920   legal fiduciary obligation.  There is a -- there is a21   sense in which everything that the Secretary of the22   Interior does or, for that matter, everything the United23   States Government does with respect to Indians is -- is of24   a fiduciary nature in a moral sense.  In a political          QUESTION:  They did not have a fiduciaryobligation to the tribes?MR. KNEEDLER:  It did not -- it did not breach a9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5   occurred.  The -- what -- what the -- what the Secretary 6   was being asked to do or -- or what -- what the Interior 7   Department was being asked to do was to make an adjustment 8   under an existing -- a term of the existing lease that 9   said that the royalty amount that was then prescribed,10   which was 37-and-a-half percent, was subject to a11   reasonable adjustment by the Secretary after the 20-year12   anniversary of the lease.13             QUESTION:  Well, isn't it -- isn't it -- maybe I14   misunderstand the facts.  But wasn't it fairly clear that15   had this conversation not taken place, that the adjustment16   would have been put into effect that the tribe wanted?17             MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think that's clear at all18   because the -- Peabody Coal Company -- aside from this19   communication, Peabody Coal Company sent the letter to the20   Secretary of the Interior in early July of 1985 in -- in21   which the representative of Peabody said, it appears that22   the tribe believes that there's an imminent decision in23   its favor on appeal from the local BIA area directors24   setting the 20 percent rate.25             QUESTION:  Which was true, wasn't it?10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  So at least in that respect, it'sdifferent from the Vermont Yankee situation.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but -- but it's importantto look at the context in which this communication￼ 1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, yes.  That was -- that was 2   true.  But that's a subordinate official in the Interior 3   Department.  The Secretary of the Interior -- as a matter 4   of constitutional law, and as a matter of the regulations 5   in effect at the time, the Secretary of the Interior had 6   the authority to take control of any matter that was then 7   pending in the Department. 8             But my important -- the important point is that 9   in that letter, Peabody Coal Company requested the10   Secretary to assume jurisdiction over the matter, and to11   either rule in its favor or, failing that, to -- to send12   the parties -- request the parties to negotiate further,13   which is exactly what happened.14             QUESTION:  And that letter --15             MR. KNEEDLER:  That letter -- that letter was --16   a copy of that letter was sent to the Navajo Nation.  And17   it -- it subsequently is clear that -- deposition18   testimony of Mr. Nelson, which is in the joint appendix in19   this case, makes it clear that he understood.  He was --20   he was a special assistant to the chairman of the Navajo21   Nation at the time.  It makes it clear that -- that the22   Navajo Nation had understood that the Secretary preferred23   for them to go back to negotiate, which was a -- a24   perfectly reasonable response by the Secretary of the25   Interior in that situation.11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             The -- the increase of the royalty rate from -- 2   from approximately 1 percent or a little over 1 percent to 3   20 percent was unilateral by the area director.  It -- 4   there was not a -- input by -- by Peabody at that time, 5   even though the area director communicated with -- 6             QUESTION:  Did both the tribe and Peabody 7   understand what was being considered, the increase that 8   had been recommended by the junior people in the 9   Department?10             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  That -- that -- the -- the11   area director's increase of -- to 20 percent, an12   adjustment of 20 percent, was appealed by -- was appealed13   by Peabody and the utilities that -- that are served by14   Peabody.  And that appeal was briefed to the Assistant15   Secretary, and it was pending.  And then in -- in July16   that was -- that area director's decision was in 1984.17   The briefing was, I think, about 6 months later, and then18   in July of 1985, the -- is -- is when the Secretary19   requested the Assistant Secretary to put off deciding this20   and have the parties negotiate.  And they reached a21   tentative agreement within -- within a month.  It was --￼22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  If -- if Fritz, the AssistantSecretary, had signed off on the 20 percent, would therehave been a further -- further recourse by --          MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the Secretary could have12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   overruled that.  The -- the Secretary under the -- under 2   the governing regulations that we quote in our brief the 3   Secretary retained the authority to overrule any decision 4   by -- by the Assistant Secretary. 5             QUESTION:  Mr. -- I'm sorry. 6             QUESTION:  There was -- you mentioned in your 7   brief another route, appellate route, that could have been 8   taken in this case which would have rendered a final 9   decision, one not subject to the Secretary's --10             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I believe that could have11   still been subject to the Secretary's determination.12   What -- what the Navajo Nation could have done, if it did13   not want to continue with negotiations, was to request14   that the matter be transferred from this informal appeals15   process to the Assistant Secretary to a formal appeals16   process which goes to the Interior Board of Indian               QUESTION:  Well, I think --￼17   Appeals.181920          MR. KNEEDLER:  At that point the Secretary couldhave assumed jurisdiction of the matter from the IBIA21   under the same regulation I referred to.  The Secretary22   always had it within his power to -- to take -- take23   cognizance of a case and not leave it with the -- with the24 board.25 QUESTION: Even if the court -- 13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91213141516171819202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  There was a prohibition againstex parte contacts in that formal adjudication, butotherwise the Secretary retained the authority to -- totake the case.          QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, did the -- wasthe Secretary's approval required on the contract thatincluded, or the -- the revision that included the12-and-a-half percent royalty rate?               MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, there were two leases, and10   the Secretary's approval was required.  But the reason was11   different for the two.  In the -- under the leaseprincipally at issue here, 8580 --          QUESTION:  Let's just take that one.          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- the -- the lease itself had aclause that said that the royalty was subject to areasonable adjustment          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- by the Secretary.          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. KNEEDLER:  As to that, we believe that therecould be no claim under the Tucker Act for the -- for thefundamental reason that that is not a -- a duty that isprescribed by an act of Congress, or a regulation underthe Tucker Act.          QUESTION:  No, no.  I -- I understand.  Wasn't14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   that also subject to the general statutory requirement2   that these leases be approved by the Secretary?  They --7 8 9here was --          QUESTION:  Well --you know, it would be negotiated by the tribes, butultimately didn't it require the Secretary's approval?3456   was not -- that was not addressed.  The basis of the claimMR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it may well have and that          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- that the Secretary had -- hada duty under the lease.1011121314   a -- a matter of statute.  Would that approval15   responsibility -- in your judgment -- carry any duty16   toward the tribe, anything comparable to a fiduciary duty17   toward the tribe not to approve an amendment if that18   amendment was not as good as the -- in the Secretary's19   judgment, the tribe could have gotten?20             MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  There's -- in -- in our view21   there is no duty under this statute to maximize returns to22 the tribe.23             QUESTION:  What -- Tell -- let me ask you --24   maybe it would be easier if I asked you kind of the25   converse question.  What responsibility does the approval15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  -- let -- let me just assume and --and maybe I shouldn't do this, but you just briefly atleast assume that the Secretary's approval was required as￼1   responsibility include?  In other words, is it merely2   ministerial, or does it imply any duty at all toward the3   tribe?4             MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't know that I would call it5   ministerial, but -- but the statute is -- is rather bare6   in its terms.  It just says that the -- that the tribe,7   through its council -- and this is -- this is a statute of8   general application -- may -- with the approval of the9   Secretary -- lease its land for coal purposes.  What10111213141516171819202122232425the -- what the preconditions for the Secretary to givehis approval are then and now is a matter for theSecretary to flesh out by regulations.          QUESTION:  So --          QUESTION:  Well, is -- does the United States,though, have some general duty of trust to the tribe?          MR. KNEEDLER:  I think it would be fair to saythat -- that there is -- that there is a -- as I said, ageneral moral and political duty.          QUESTION:  Sure.  And so when the Secretary hasto approve a lease, should that general duty be kept inmind as part of that process?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Surely.  Surely, and again we'renot -- we're -- we quite agree that as -- that as a matterof what -- what judgment should -- should inform theSecretary in her approval of the lease.16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1234 assume.5             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --6             QUESTION:  But that -- but that doesn't --7             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but I meant --          QUESTION:  No.  But suppose the Government has ageneral moral and political duty to the entire citizenrynot to lease Government land at -- at bandit rates I 8             QUESTION:  That doesn't give rise to a cause of 9   action.10             MR. KNEEDLER:  That -- that's true.  Here there11   is --12             QUESTION:  Nor -- nor is there any specific13   statute, is there?  I mean, I -- I think the -- the point14   that Justice O'Connor is -- is raising is -- is my point.15   Once you get a specific statutory obligation, assuming16   that approval carries some obligation of care, inquiry,17   whatever, doesn't that carry with it some of the duty that18   we normally have in mind when we talk about the trust19   duty, and doesn't that take it out of the sphere of the20   merely moral and the merely political into the legal?21             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that -- let me answer it22   this way.  The Secretary -- as I said, I believe it's up23   to the Secretary to decide how to flesh out the regime for24   her approval of leases and she has done this in the25   regulations including, importantly, now and at the time17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   this lease was -- lease amendments were approved, a2   minimum royalty amount.  At the time, it was just 10 cents3   per ton.  Now, it's 12-and-a-half percent, which is the4   standard rate of --              QUESTION:  But a minimum -- a minimum is a              MR. KNEEDLER:  No.56   minimum.789          QUESTION:  So there's still something to argueabout there, I would --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no.  And it's important tounderstand why -- why I -- I think that's not correct theway the Secretary's regulations are written.101112131415161718   decision.  So the -- the point is that it is up to the19   tribe to enter into agreements subject to approval by the20   Secretary.21             QUESTION:  Well, then I -- I think the22   implication of your argument is that the approval is23   purely ministerial.  In other words, if the tribe is the24   responsible party, then the Government is not.25             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the -- it's actually18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          This act has a number of goals, one of which isrevenue for the tribe, but another is tribal self-determination, and this is clear from the legislativehistory of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act as described in1938 and described by this Court in its Cotton Petroleum￼ 1   something of a hybrid I -- I believe.  And what the 2   Secretary has chosen to impose on herself, which is not 3   the same thing as to whether it's -- it's legally 4   enforceable, is a set of regulations that would govern the 5   way in which she approves a lease.  And with respect to -- 6   again, with respect to royalty, there is a specific 7   regulation that says 12-and-a-half percent. 8             What -- the way the Secretary has -- has 9   accommodated these competing goals is that there is a -- a10   minimum set of standards to which any agreement between a11   tribe and a lessee enter into, any -- a set of standards12   that must be satisfied.  Beyond that -- beyond those --13   satisfaction of those standards, it is up to the tribe and14   the -- and the lessee --15             QUESTION:  Well, all right.  That's, I take it,16   their argument -- as I understand their argument, or part17   of it anyway, is that if you put -- we hold property in18   trust for the tribe.  That by itself doesn't do much for19   them.  That's Mitchell I.￼202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.          QUESTION:  But when you get a whole lot of verydetailed rules and regulations about how the Governmentneeds to behave, well, then, you find that there is aspecific duty for the Government even if it isn't quite inthose rules and regulations to behave like a trustee of a19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   trust, i.e., use prudent care, reasonable care, whatever2   the standards are.3             So they're saying whatever the details of the4   regs are here, there certainly was a highly detailed set5   of something that governed how the Government would behave6   in this particular lease complexity, a very complicated7   situation.  And therefore, regardless of what they said,8 910111213141516171819202122there was also, because of that complexity, an obligationfor the Government to use reasonable, prudent care nomatter what the regs said.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --          QUESTION:  And that's what they didn't do here.You see, it's just like Mitchell II.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But it's -- it's not just likeMitchell II.          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what's your responseto that?          MR. KNEEDLER:  And I -- and I think theimportant difference is in Mitchell II the Court recited anumber of specific statutory duties -- statutory andregulatory duties that were directed at assuring aparticular amount of income for the tribe under the￼23   circumstances.  Fair market value for a right-of-way.24   Sustained yield management of -- of timber harvest.25   Specific statutory directives to take into account the20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051234   where you're going with that.  But that reads Mitchell II5   very narrowly.  And it is as if in that forest filled with6   Government foresters that the tribe members had to stayfinancial needs of the beneficiaries whose allotments weregoing to be logged off.111213141516171819202122232425   termites.QUESTION:  I see where you're going.  I see 7   out of, one day a forester working for the Government 8   introduces some termites into the trees, and lo and 9   behold, there doesn't happen to be a particular anti-10   termite regulation.  I think you'd read Mitchell II aseven though there's no anti-termite regulation, stillthere was a duty of care there for the Government not tobehave that way.          MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I -- I don't think so.  Imean, again, there may be -- there may be a tort action.The -- the Tucker Act does not cover the entireuniverse --￼  QUESTION:  So if I think --  QUESTION:  Termites are good for trees.  (Laughter.)  QUESTION:  You know, they're -- they're not good  QUESTION:  No.  These are bad anti-tree21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005for houses, but they're good for trees.          (Laughter.)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          (Laughter.)          MR. KNEEDLER:  But the --          QUESTION:  If -- if I read Mitchell II somewhatmore broadly and thought that there was an obligationthere to behave like a trustee even if I couldn't pin itto a particular reg, this particular action, would I thenhave to decide against you here?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no, because we -- we thinkthat there was -- that the Secretary's approval of the --of the lease amendments in 1987 satisfied a duty of1011   reasonable prudence.  The standard that was articulated in12   the documents presented to the Secretary for approval13   was -- was whether the lease package could be regarded as14   a reasonable exercise of -- of business judgment.  This15   was set forward --16             QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that argument sort17   of takes the lease terms simply in the context of the --18   the 12-and-a-half percent minimum that the Secretary had19   taken.  But it seems to me that they have a stronger20   argument and it is closer to the termite argument.  And21   the stronger argument is whatever your obligations as a22   trustee may be under the approval responsibility, you at23   least have an obligation not to skew the bargaining24   process in a way that hurts us when you know that is what25 it will do.￼22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051             And as I understand the argument about the2   ex parte communication, it's not that the ex parte3   communication was per se unlawful.  It -- it clearly4   wasn't.  The argument is that the ex parte communication5   resulted in action by the Secretary that, in effect,6   induced the tribe to take a different negotiating posture7   from the one it would have taken.  And therefore, their8   argument is like the termite argument:  You're not 9101112131415supposed to introduce bad termites into the forest, andyou're not supposed to take action as a minimum that hurtsus as negotiators.          What is your response to that?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, several things.  The -- thetermite example is different, first of all, in that it hasan immediate physical impact on the -- on the trees -- the￼16   substance of the trust.  What you're describing is a17   procedural -- is -- is at bottom a procedural --18             QUESTION:  It makes trees less valuable.  This19   makes coal less valuable under the contract.  They get20   hurt.21             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the -- secondly,22   the -- there is no indication that the substance of the23   communications was any different from the -- from what the24   tribe knew anyway, which was that Peabody had requested25   the Secretary not to act and to allow the parties to23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   return to negotiations.  But beyond that, when they -- 2   then the -- this -- this -- these are all things that 3   happened in 1984 and 1985.  That was superseded by the 4   parties' lease agreement in 1987. 5             In 1987, as part of the lease agreement that was 6   submitted to the Secretary and that the Navajo Nation 7   requested that the Secretary approve, the area director's 8   decision that initially established a 20 percent rate 9   unilaterally was vacated and Peabody's appeal was10   dismissed.  That wiped the slate clean for everything that11   happened up until then.12             The question then is what is -- was the 198713   lease amendment package proper?  And under Mitchell, as we14   see it, unless there is a violation of a specific15   statutory or regulatory provision in the approval of the16   lease, there cannot be a claim for money damages under the17   Tucker Act.  And --￼1819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, you had started toexplain that the -- the responsibility, or the authoritycame out of the lease itself with respect to -- to themain lease --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.          QUESTION:  -- that we're talking about.  Butthen you said that there was also Secretary approvalinvolved in the one where it wasn't a term of the lease.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   I think you started to say that. 2             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  In -- in 1987, what the 3   parties presented to the Secretary was not a proposal to 4   adjust the royalty under the -- Article VI of the existing 5   lease.  It was a set of new amendments that, among other 6   things, superseded that clause of the lease and put in 7   place another dispute resolution mechanism for adjusting 8   the royalties in the future.  As part of that, the -- the 9   controversy with respect to the 1985 -- 1984 to 198510   adjustment was -- was eliminated.11             But that 1987 package provided well in excess of12   the minimum royalty rate both for the 8580 lease and also13   the other lease with -- for the Navajo with respect to14   coal it owned jointly with the Hopi Tribe.  And that15   satisfied the specific regulatory standard that the16   Secretary had prescribed for deciding when she would17   approve lease agreements.18             QUESTION:  What I can't quite understand with19   reference to your position as to the correct reading of20   Mitchell II is this:  It seems to me you say that even if21   there's a breach of a fiduciary duty, there still has to22   be some specific statute or regulation which we violate,23   and that specific statute or regulation must imply that24   there is a cause of action for damages.  That makes the25   fiduciary component quite irrelevant.  Either there's a25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   specific statute, or there isn't. 2             MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I don't think it does because 3   it -- the fiduciary -- the important discussion in 4   Mitchell II of the fiduciary responsibility had to do with 5   whether the specific statutory or regulatory duty -- which 6   is prong one -- could in turn be fairly interpreted to 7   requirement -- require the payment of compensation. 8   That's where the fiduciary obligation comes in. 9             But this case fails at the first step because10   there is no specific statutory or regulatory provision11   that was violated. There's no need to get to the second12   step in the analysis on that theory.13             And this specificity requirement was reflected14   in Testan and Sheehan, both of which were decided prior15   to -- to Mitchell.  Both say that there has to be a right16   granted with specificity.17             It's also confirmed by things that have happened18   since then.  That's the way the Federal Circuit in the19   Brown and Pawnee decisions that we -- that were cited in20   the decision below looked at Mitchell -- Mitchell II.21   There had to be a specific provision that was violated.22             And that's also entirely consistent with last23   year's decision in the Gonzaga case under -- under the24   very parallel situation of 1983 where the Court said there25   has to be a -- a right granted with specificity -- an26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   entitlement granted with specificity -- where the question2   is whether a -- a -- another Federal statute gives rise to3   a cause of action under a general cause of action creating4   a statute, in that case 1983.  But we think the analysis5 6 7 8 9is directly parallel.          If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of mytime for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Mr. Frye.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. FRYE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT1011121314151617   that control necessarily implicates trust duties.  And18   violations of trust duties, when the Government is19   exercising responsibilities, within the contours of those20   statutes and regulations, gives rise to a claim for money21   damages in the Court of Federal Claims.  That's what's22   missing.          MR. FRYE:  In listening -- Mr. -- JusticeStevens, and may it please the Court:          In listening to the Government, it's clear thatthe Government has not come to terms yet with the basicprinciple established in Mitchell II, that where Congressgives the Federal Government control of Indian property,￼23 24 25          QUESTION:  Mr. Frye, the Government has stressedthat this is not a control situation like Mitchell II.Rather, like Mitchell I, one of the objectives of this27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   legislation of IMLA was to give the tribe the management 2   and control authority, and the Government had just a 3   secondary role of approving at the end of the road.  But 4   unlike the -- the United States was running the timber 5   operation.  Here, it's the tribe that's negotiating the 6   lease.  It seems to me that's quite different. 7             MR. FRYE:  That's a two-part question.  One, 8   after the Navajo tribe signed the coal lease in 1964, it 9   had absolutely no control over anything.  I'd like to read10   you one -- just one regulation, one operating regulation,11   that the Secretary has.  It empowers -- and this is at12   page 44 of our lodging.  This is BLM's responsibility, not13   even BIA who has the principal responsibility.  BLM has14   the responsibility to, quote, oversee exploration,15   development, production, resource recovery and protection,16   diligent development, continued operation, preparation,17   handling, product verification, and abandonment18   operations.19             QUESTION:  Oversee.  What does oversee mean?20   Did it do that or oversee it?  I mean --21             MR. FRYE:  Oh, the Secretary doesn't mine coal22   anymore than the BIA cuts timber, but BIA sells timber to23   private timber companies to do the timber-cutting.  The24   BIA oversees that timber production in the same way it25   oversees the coal operation.28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             QUESTION:  I'm not sure that that's anything 2   more specific than the general trust responsibility that 3   the United States has.  It has to oversee the disposition 4   of all the lands that it holds in trust, but I'm not sure 5   that that's the kind of control that -- that we were 6   talking about in Mitchell II. 7             MR. FRYE:  Well, Mitchell II control is 8   absolutely parallel.  The same -- 9             QUESTION:  What -- what about --10             MR. FRYE:  Yes, the second part of your11 question.          QUESTION:  The purpose of IMLA was to help theIndians exercise their own sovereignty.12131415   several times.  In the first case, in the Poafpybitty case16   in 1968, the Government looked at IMLA and said thisMR. FRYE:  IMLA has come before this Court￼17   statute imposes trust responsibilities and trust duties on18   the Government.  It said that three times in that19   decision.20             QUESTION:  Does it waive sovereign immunity in21   the statute for purposes of monetary damages against the22   Government?  It doesn't do so expressly.23             MR. FRYE:  It doesn't do so expressly just as24   the -- the timber statutes didn't do so expressly in25   Mitchell II.  But it has that same overlay of29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   comprehensive Federal control and regulation. 2             QUESTION:  That's true, but -- but the 3   Government had a good response to my question, which was 4   that if, in fact, I was agreeing with you for the purposes 5   of interpreting Mitchell II hypothetically, they said, you 6   know, this is a procedure, and it's a procedure that 7   you're complaining was violated.  And that's significant 8   for two reasons.  First, it would read this trust 9   responsibility as creating procedures in identical10   circumstances where a party is an Indian tribe that do not11   exist in respect to anyone else, and secondly, it would be12   finding a -- money damages, $600 million in fact, for a13   violation of this -- one of these procedural regulations.14             And I cannot even think -- though there may be15   some, I cannot think of an instance where a private person16   who really has been badly hurt can recover money damages17   from the Government where what the Government did was not18   follow the right procedure.  So it's new procedures, plus19   the money damages, and you'd have to overcome all those20   hurdles.21             MR. FRYE:  Okay.  We are not complaining,22   Justice Breyer, about any procedural problem.  What we are23   complaining is -- is about the Secretary colluding with24   Peabody Coal Company to swindle the Navajo Nation.  That's25   what this case is all about.30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             QUESTION:  That's -- that's -- tell me a little 2   bit less pejoratively and -- 3             MR. FRYE:  I will tell you. 4             QUESTION:  -- more specifically.  Yes. 5             MR. FRYE:  Yes.  The -- the memorandum that 6   Secretary Hodel hand-delivered to Fritz, every word of 7   that was penned by Peabody's lawyers in -- in the 8   administrative appeal, and that's shown in the joint9 appendix --10             QUESTION:  Again, that's -- you know, in a11   particular context, that might be terrible, but when12   you're talking about administration, it's a very common13   thing for parties to submit proposed findings, et cetera.14   So I don't know about this circumstance, but that -- that15   in and of itself is -- is not obviously it.16             MR. FRYE:  That wasn't my entire answer.17             Following that, the Secretary of the Interior18   basically instructed his subordinate to lie to the Navajo19   Nation so it would not know what went on.  The -- and that20   subordinate was the last person that the Navajo Nation21   would have expected to deceive it.  That person had worked￼with Navajo Chairman Peterson Zah on the reservation andhad named his son Peterson Zah Vollmann.22232425   Justice Souter mentioned.  The Navajo Nation thought,After that, the negotiations were skewed, as31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   because of these odd communications coming from 2   Washington, that its trustee thought that the 20 percent 3   figure was vulnerable on the merits.  We're talking about 4   a breach of trust.  And the -- the question is whether 5   the -- 6             QUESTION:  Maybe he did think it was vulnerable 7   on the merits.  I mean, couldn't the Secretary think that? 8             MR. FRYE:  The record -- the record shows 9   absolutely no consideration by the Secretary.  The10   standard that was at play here --11             QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't that -- isn't12   that was -- isn't that the representation that Peabody13   made to the Secretary, that that was just an enormous14   increase in the -- in the fee?15             MR. FRYE:  Peabody actually -- the letter that16   Peabody wrote to Secretary Hodel that was mentioned by my17   brother Kneedler actually didn't get to Hodel's office.18   The record shows that that -- that that letter was routed19   directly to Fritz, code 200 on the document, and that20   Fritz gave it to his solicitors who were working on his21   opinion, and those --22             QUESTION:  No.  I understand that.  But -- but23   don't you think in the ex parte -- the -- the oral24   ex parte contact, the same point was made?  What --25             MR. FRYE:  We have no idea what was made.32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             QUESTION:  Well, what do you guess they made? 2   I mean, why wouldn't they have made the same point that 3   was in their letter?  My goodness, all of a sudden, 4   you're -- you're upping our -- our cost 20 times?  I mean, 5   you know, that's incredible. 6             MR. FRYE:  That's -- that's not the context of 7   this discussion.  The -- the royalty rate was upped to 8   20 percent a year before.  We had had extensive briefing, 9   studies done by the Department of the Interior, all of10   which said that 20 percent was the right number.  The11   Secretary of the Interior had no basis for saying it was12   the wrong number.13             QUESTION:  What is the number today?14             MR. FRYE:  The number today --15             QUESTION:  Today.16             MR. FRYE:  -- is less than the Federal minimum17   of 12-and-a-half percent.  And we proved that, and that's￼1819202122232425in our proposed finding of fact number 315 that it was --          QUESTION:  What -- has the tribe asked to setaside this lease?          MR. FRYE:  We have not.  We didn't learn aboutthis until discovery in this case.          QUESTION:  Well, you know about it now.  I mean,does the tribe want out from under this lease?          MR. FRYE:  We have sued Peabody, and there are33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   aspects of that that deal with reformation of the lease. 2   But we don't have any ability to get past damages from the 3   Government for breach of trust for the time period for 4   which this activity was concealed. 5             QUESTION:  I don't -- I don't understand what 6   the breach of trust consists of.  Number one, it -- you -- 7   you acknowledge it doesn't consist in the -- in the ex 8   parte contract.  I -- contact.  I assume that any trustee 9   does -- does not have an obligation to call in the -- the10   cestui que trust whenever -- whenever a lessee wants to11   talk about something.  I'm sure many trustees deal ex12   parte.13             MR. FRYE:  No -- no trustee has the ability to14   be disloyal, actively disloyal to the -- to the15   beneficiary.               QUESTION:  I'm not -- I'm not talking about     actively -- I'm just talking about the ex parte --     receiving ex parte presentations --￼161718192021   wants a lease altered.  Can -- can an ordinary trustee do22   that?23 24 25          MR. FRYE:  The -- the Secretary and any ordinarytrustee can receive all the communications he wants.          QUESTION:  Absolutely.34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. FRYE:  The Secretary --QUESTION:  -- from somebody who wants -- who1234   you're down to what the Secretary did in response.  That5   depends on what the Secretary's obligation is, I -- I              MR. FRYE:  Yes.          MR. FRYE:  If the question is what the Secretarydid in response to that --6   presume.789QUESTION:  All right, and so -- so then you --          QUESTION:  And as I read the statute andregulations, the Secretary's only obligation was to assure10   that a very low minimum was -- was complied with.  And11   after that, the negotiation was up to the tribe.  Is that12   a fair representation of -- of what the statute and regs13   require?14151617181920212223242535Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. FRYE:  The statutes and regulations didrequire minimum royalty rates, and as this Court held --￼QUESTION:  Which are very low.          MR. FRYE:  Very low.  Absurdly low.  I mean,the -- the Government would say to this Court if we hadapproved -- if we had misled the Navajo Nation so badlythat it would have taken 11 cents a ton, we could approvethe 11 cents a ton because the minimum royalty rate was10 cents a ton even though we knew it was worth $4 a tonin royalty.          QUESTION:  Yes, but -- I'm actually havingexactly the same problem.123456   supposed to be the breach of the fiduciary duty?  It's7   not, you're saying now, the procedure of ex parte8   communication.  It is -- and then you said there was a9   misrepresentation.  What was that?  I mean, are there10111213141516171819202122232425other things too?          MR. FRYE:  Yes.  There are a variety of thingsthat led the tribe to accept Peabody's proposed packageof -- of lease concessions from our standpoint, and the --the breach --          QUESTION:  Well, would you --          MR. FRYE:  -- the culminating events of thebreach --          QUESTION:  Can I interrupt you, sir?  Could --could you specify what the variety is because I want toknow the same thing Justice Breyer wants to know.          MR. FRYE:  Yes.  The culminating event was theapproval of a lease for a less than 12-and-a-half percentroyalty rate where the tribe gives up -- has a negativebonus of $89 million in back --          QUESTION:  All right.  But that's -- that's a36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. FRYE:  Okay.          QUESTION:  What precisely is it that breachedthe trust, without any characterization?MR. FRYE:  Yes.QUESTION:  Who said -- what is the act that's￼1   lease that the -- that the tribe at that point had agreed2   to.  Would you specify what the Government did or said,3   number one, that led the tribe to act differently from the4   way it would have acted otherwise?5             MR. FRYE:  But for the Secretary's intervention,6   20 percent would have been slipped in as the new royalty7 rate. 8              MR. FRYE:  The -- the memo that Peabody's    lawyers wrote that Secretary Hodel signed telling the    deciding official to stop action.              QUESTION:  Well, now wait a minute.  When --    when the Secretary exercises his authority to approve    leases, is it your -- is it your contention that the only    obligation -- not to approve leases, but to -- but to --    to give effect to that provision of the lease which allows    him to increase the lease rates -- that's what we're 91011121314151617QUESTION:  What intervention?  Precisely what?￼18   talking about here.  When he -- when he approaches that19202122232425obligation, is it your contention that his only duty is tothe tribe?          MR. FRYE:  Yes.  That -- that is the --          QUESTION:  He should raise it -- he should raiseit 5,000 percent if he can get away with it?          MR. FRYE:  The --          QUESTION:  Surely --37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5   into a lease like that.  One would expect that the -- that 6   the Secretary would act fairly.  Sure, take into account 7   what's fair for the tribe, but also what's fair for the 8   coal company that entered into a lease at a much lower 9   rate earlier at arm's length.  You think he -- you think10   the Secretary couldn't take into account what's fair for11   the coal company at all.12             MR. FRYE:  What the Secretary had to take into13   account is provided by the language of Article VI of the14   lease.  The adjustment had to be reasonable.  And to --               QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. FRYE:  The key modifier is if he can getaway with it.          QUESTION:  -- I just don't read it that way.  Itseems to me that no -- anybody would be crazy to enter1516171819   will give the tribe the most money.  It also certainly20   includes what -- what's fair for the -- for the person21   who -- on the other side of the lease who -- who is22   suddenly getting socked with a 20-fold increase.  I don't￼23 24 25think that's unreasonable at all for the Secretary to takethat into account.          MR. FRYE:  The Secretary can't doff his trust38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. FRYE:  And to find that out, theSecretary's --QUESTION:  And reasonable doesn't mean whatever1   responsibilities by donning the mantel of an2   administrator.  If it's reasonable, that means I think3   necessarily that the Secretary can't set it so high as to4   bankrupt the operation and stop the coal mining.5             QUESTION:  But that may be, but there must be a6   statute -- there must be a statute that turned over to the7   Secretary or his office the job of interpreting that word8   reasonable in the lease.  What -- what's that statute?          MR. FRYE:  That would be the Indian MineralLeasing Act.          QUESTION:  And it gives the Secretary -- andyou're saying that that statute, when it gives theSecretary the power to decide what is or is not reasonableunder the lease, means that the Secretary must really justtake the Indians' point of view into account?          MR. FRYE:  Absolutely not.  He needs to exerciseindependent judgment to make sure that whatever theroyalty rate that he is going to substitute for theoriginal one is reasonable. 9101112131415161718192022             MR. FRYE:  I think fair is not a bad23   characterization.  Fair and reasonable.24             QUESTION:  Okay.  Then -- well, but then what's25   the -- the breach here?  He was doing apparently what he39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼               QUESTION:  Is fair, in other words, to21   everybody.1   thought was fair, I guess.  I mean, maybe it was -- maybe2   he was wrong, but --3             MR. FRYE:  The Secretary was not doing what he4   thought was fair.  The -- Peabody sent his best friend in5   there with his pocket full of Peabody's money and -- and6   it was -- and that's in the records.  It's $13,000 for a7   couple of hours of work.  And he says, my clients have8   learned that there is a decision coming down that's going9   to hurt them.  Put a stop to it.  And the Secretary did.There was no independent judgment.          QUESTION:  That $13,000 didn't go to the101112131415   lobbyist.16Secretary, did it?          MR. FRYE:  Oh, there's no -- absolutely --          QUESTION:  That was -- that was for the￼               MR. FRYE:  It was for the lobbyist.  And17   frankly, he was underpaid for this -- this bit of18   skullduggery.(Laughter.)QUESTION:  I agree with you.(Laughter.)MR. FRYE:  I'd like to get back to Justice192021222324   statute.  Here, the Department of the Interior thwarted25   both purposes of the statute.  It thwarted our independentGinsburg's question about the second purpose of the40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   ability to have a -- to exercise our self-determination in 2   an informed way.  It disinformed us so that we couldn't 3   exercise informed self-determination.  And -- and that's 4   what the judge in the Court of Federal Claims said.  He 5   said, a negotiator's weapon is knowledge.  And unaware of 6   these things, the Navajo Nation was without critical 7   knowledge, and in fact, the record shows that the 8   Secretary was giving this knowledge and more to the people 9   who were negotiating against us.  So we didn't have that10 ability --11             QUESTION:  May I just interrupt?  Mr. Kneedler12   said that this really was all contained in the letter that13   was sent to the Secretary with copies to the tribe14   earlier.15             MR. FRYE:  The -- the request was -- was16   included in that letter, and -- and the tribe did get a17   copy of that letter.  But we didn't know that the18   Secretary had acted on Peabody's request.  In fact, the￼19202122232425Secretary told us the opposite.          QUESTION:  But didn't you know that at least --didn't you know at least it was a possibility as long asthe letter was on the table?          MR. FRYE:  I guess that -- it certainly would bea possibility.          But there -- there was sort of a law of the case41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   that developed in this administrative procedure.  Peabody 2   made the same request of Secretary Clark, and 3   Secretary Clark said to his Assistant Secretary Fritz, 4   what should I do with this?  So Fritz asked everybody, do 5   you want me to stay this so you can negotiate?  The Navajo 6   Nation said no. 7             Fritz then wrote everybody saying, we've gotten 8   your letter.  You wanted us to set aside this procedure so 9   you can negotiate.  Not everyone wants to negotiate.  So10   we're going to continue.  That was kind of the law of the11 case here.12             Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, the13   culminating event was the approval of a lease at14   sub-12-and-a-half percent rates when every Federal study15   said the royalty rate ought to be 20 percent.  There was16   no other Federal study.  And that was a breach of the duty17 of care.18             This Court has said in the Kerr-McGee case that19   the basic purpose of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act --20             QUESTION:  Excuse me.21             MR. FRYE:  -- was to maximize revenues.22             QUESTION:  It wasn't -- it -- more precisely it23   wasn't the approval of a lease.  It was the approval of --24   of the -- the raise of the figure that was contained in a25   lease that had already been concluded.42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. FRYE:  That is incorrect, sir.2             QUESTION:  That is incorrect?3             MR. FRYE:  Yes.4             QUESTION:  Why?5             MR. FRYE:  Volume II of the joint appendix in6   this Court includes both the original lease and these coal7   lease amendments, and they're virtually totally different8   documents.  There's new tax waivers.  There's a new9   dedication of 90 million tons of coal.  There's a -- forthe north lease and for the other lease another180 million tons of coal, all without a competitive bid.          So we not only didn't get the Federal minimum,10111213   we certainly didn't get 20 percent.  We didn't get the14   Federal minimum of 12-and-a-half percent, and we had to15   pay a bonus to the companies of $89 million to get what we16 got.￼          QUESTION:  But you got a severance tax as partof the package, and one of the things that the Governmentsuggested is if -- if you take the 12 percent and you addthe 8 percent, then you get up to the 20 percent, whichwas your figure.17181920212223   before all of this happened.  And as -- as my brother24   Kneedler mentioned to the Court, we can't tax 60 percent25   of the coal because it goes to the Navajo generatingMR. FRYE:  Justice Ginsburg, we had the tax43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   station which has a tax waiver in the plant site lease.2   So we're capped at the 12-and-a-half percent royalty level3   for 60 percent of the coal.  And before we entered into4 5 6 7 8 9these lease amendments, we were not restricted in theamount of taxes that the Navajo Nation could impose.          QUESTION:  And as I understand it now, it's --what you're saying, it's just as if the trees in Mitchellwhere the money from the tree was supposed to go to theIndians, if the Government had cut it down and sold it fora half a cent a tree.1011121314   wrong.  But what was going wrong is it's like selling the15   trees at too low a price, if they were supposed to go to16   the -- the tribe, if the proceeds had been.  That's --MR. FRYE:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right.  And all this other stuffwith the procedures is just evidentiary of what was going￼171819202122232425that's the -- basically the argument.          MR. FRYE:  I think that's right.  The damage-causing activity finally was the approval of thesedamaging lease amendments.          QUESTION:  Was the price above the minimum thatthe Secretary's regulations provided for?          MR. FRYE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me the problem thenwas with the Secretary's regulation, not with what went on44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   here.  That regulation was invalid as arbitrary, 2 3 4 5 6 7   the tribe.  And what you're saying is that minimum is so 8   low that it -- it produces, you know, highway robbery.  It 9   seems to me that the problem is -- is with the regulation10   and maybe you can get at it when the regulation is applied11   this way.  I don't know.12             MR. FRYE:  The -- in Mitchell II, for example,13   there was a claim -- the Mitchell II claims did not track,14   by the way, specific statutory and regulatory provisions.15   There was a claim, for example, that was upheld for the16   failure of the Department of the Interior to -- to develop17   a system of roads and easements conducive to timber18   harvesting.  There was no statute that required that.19   There was no regulation that required that.  That was part20   of the trust duty.21             And there was one other claim that was upheld in22   Mitchell II, and a statute said, you -- if you're going to23   deposit these monies into the Federal Treasury, the24   Federal Government has to get at least 4 percent.  It was25   a minimum 4 percent rate.  And the allottees and tribe in45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005capricious --          MR. FRYE:  No.  The regulation only set aminimum royalty, and as this Court --          QUESTION:  But that's -- but that's the point,I mean, in order to leave full negotiating authority to￼1   the Mitchell case said, just by turning around you could2   have gotten 8 percent, and the court below said, yes, you3   can't be satisfied as trustee with the minimum rate.  You4   have to at least strive for the ceiling.  And that was5   upheld.  That claim was upheld here.6 7 8 9          So there were several claims in Mitchell II thatwere not tracking any specific --          QUESTION:  There was not in Mitchell II astatute that -- that sought to place the negotiating powerin the hands of the Indians rather than in the hands of1011   the Government.  I mean, that's what distinguishes this12   case.  You have here a scheme that is meant to -- meant to13   place the tribe in -- in charge of its own fate, and --14   and it effectively tells the Secretary, we don't want you15   to negotiate these leases.  That's quite a bit different.￼          MR. FRYE:  Actually that's incorrect.  Thestatutory scheme in Mitchell II, section 406(a), said thatthe -- the Indians could -- or could sell their timber16171819   with the consent of the Secretary.  It's the exact same20   structure as we have here.  What we have here is the21   Indians can lease their coal with the approval of the22   Secretary of the Interior.  The approval has a real23   history.24             QUESTION:  It's certainly not how -- how the25   Court described it in Mitchell II because the Court spoke46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   about exclusive control, that the United States did all 2   the negotiating, that -- and it made all the arrangements. 3   Now, whatever you -- you say, you have to deal with what 4   is in that opinion, and it does stress the exclusive 5   control of the United States and distinguishes the prior 6   case on the ground that the other case was designed to 7   give the Indians autonomy to deal for themselves. 8             MR. FRYE:  The -- the Secretary certainly had 9   exclusive control over whether to approve this10   transaction, whether to allow the trust asset to be sold11   or not.  He had exclusive control over that, and that iswithin the contours of the statutes and regulations.          And I --12131415161718   statute or regulation.  Isn't that true?          QUESTION:  I thought that the -- the authoritycame from the lease from the term that the -- that thetribe agreed to, that the -- the authority to adjust theroyalty in this case comes from the lease, not from any￼          MR. FRYE:  That's correct.  Of course, thatlease itself was approved by the Secretary of the Interioras trustee of these --1920212223   these were new leases.  I mean, that's what confuses me.24   When I was making that point earlier, you said no, some of25   them were new leases.  Now, the authority to adjust theQUESTION:  Wait.  I thought you said some of47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   rate for the new leases certainly didn't exist in the old2   lease, did it?3             MR. FRYE:  That's not even at issue.  There4   is -- there is no secretarial authority to adjust the rate5   in the new lease.6             QUESTION:  Well, that -- that's right.  So some7   of your complaint does not rest upon the provision in the8   original lease that gives the Secretary the power to9   adjust the rate.10             MR. FRYE:  Yes.  I -- I think in response to11   Justice Breyer, the -- the event that caused the damages12   here was the improvident approval, without observation13   of --1415161718   Secretary, give an approval or not.  What there is is the19   tribe negotiates something.  Then they have the20   director -- the area director, say, okay, that's all right21   because the tribe asked him to say.  And then somebody22   approve -- appeals to the Department of the Interior under23   a regulation of the Interior Department allowing any24   aggrieved party to go appeal.  And then the Secretary25   intervenes in that, and then they don't tell the tribe.48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Of the new leases.MR. FRYE:  Of the new leases.  That is correct.QUESTION:  So that -- and that -- that's --￼there isn't a -- sort of like a statute that says, 1   And because they don't tell the tribe, the tribe enters 2   into a different lease.  That's really what happened. 3             MR. FRYE:  Yes. 4             QUESTION:  And it's hard to fit that into the 5   model of the Secretary charging a penny for a tree.  The 6   Secretary, in a sense, didn't charge anything for9 10 11 127 anything. 8          MR. FRYE:  The Secretary allowed this trustasset to be conveyed for what he knew to be about half ofits value.          Now, the approval requirement has a history,going back to the first administration of George13   Washington.  In the Trade and Intercourse Acts, Congress14   first erected what this Court has called the strong shield15   of Federal law, to prevent Indians from being despoiled in16   their property.  And Congress, when it legislates,17   legislates against this rich history, this background in18   the context of the approval requirement.19             In the Anicker case in 1987, in a leasing20   context, the -- the Court said that the -- this strong21   shield of Federal -- of Federal law was designed to22   protect the Indians from the designs of those who would23   take their property for less than fair compensation.24   That's the -- that's the meat of the approval --25             QUESTION:  Okay.  So you're saying the approval49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   was wrong for two reasons, I guess.  Number one, the rate 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  I see.  Okay. I --          MR. FRYE:  This is 12,500 btu coal.          QUESTION:  I stand corrected.          So it was the -- the approval was wrong simplybecause the -- the particular value of this coal meantthat it was being conveyed away for -- for half what itwas worth.          MR. FRYE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  That's the substance.          And then you're also making the argument that itwas wrong -- and I think I used the word, the -- thebargaining process was skewed, but you're -- you're makingthat argument too?          MR. FRYE:  Yes.  The Secretary should have knownthat the end result was going to be unfair because he hadskewed the bargaining.          QUESTION:  Okay.  May -- may I ask you this50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005approved was less than half fair value.          MR. FRYE:  Correct.          QUESTION:  So that, in effect, every -- everylease that was approved at the 12-and-a-half percent waswrongly approved.2345678   coal.  This is unusual coal.MR. FRYE:  No.  This is extraordinarily valuable￼ 1   question as to whether he really did skew it?  As I 2   understand what the skewing might be, it would be simply 3   the refusal of the Secretary to allow the administrative 4   process to go forward, as a result of which the tribe 5   ended up negotiating when it might not otherwise have 6   negotiated.  It might have held out. 7             My question is this.  Didn't someone -- and I 8   forget who it was now -- on behalf of the Secretary come 9   right out and say to the tribe, the Secretary or the10   Department or the Bureau thinks it would be better if you11   resolved this by negotiating?  And isn't it fair to say12   that that is practically saying, look, we're not going to13   decide this thing?  You go out and decide it by14   negotiating.  And if that is true, didn't they, in effect,15   tell them in substance what they were doing?16             MR. FRYE:  Well, the beneficiary of a trust17   shouldn't have to guess what his trustee is really telling18   him.  If that's what the trustee wanted to say, the19   trustee should have said, I've met with Peabody.  I like20   their lobbyist.  I'm not going to do something that21   Peabody doesn't like, and -- and we're going to sit on22   this thing, as his subordinate said, until hell freezes23   over until you agree that -- with something that Peabody24   likes and you can live with.  If we had been given that25   information, we would have taken a much different51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   approach.  I guarantee you.              Now, I think Justice O'Connor made the point    that if all we have -- if -- if the trust duty only    applies to specific statutory and regulatory violations,2345   then it's meaningless.  The trust duty has to be something6   greater than that.  And this Court in the Varity7 8 9Corporation case about 6 years ago said precisely that.The trust duty has to be something greater than the sum ofthese distinct parts.          QUESTION:  So -- so the mere designation of atrustee in these cases is a waiver of sovereign immunity?1011121314151617   and remedies.  It gives people -- Indian tribes and Indian18   people the same access to the court, and it uses a19   different word.  It uses the word laws in the -- in the20   jurisdictional statute in the Indian Tucker Act.  And we21   know from Illinois versus City of Milwaukee and other22   cases that laws means Federal common law and the -- and if23   there's anything that's grounded in the Federal common law24   tradition, it's the trust duty owed to Indian tribes.  And25   that's what we sue under, the Indian Tucker Act.52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. FRYE:  I would say not, Your Honor.  Therehas to be this overlay of comprehensive Federal controland supervision.And I would note too in the Indian Tucker Act,￼it doesn't restrict Indian plaintiffs to the same rights 1             One month ago yesterday, President George Bush 2   once again issued a presidential proclamation, following 3   those of President Reagan and President Clinton, honoring 4   the Navajos and recognizing their special service to the 5   United States in times of war.  And as this Court 6   indicated in the Shoshone case, the Navajo tribe was 7   entitled to a fidelity at least as constant. 8             We respectfully urge affirmance. 9             QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Frye.10             Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.11             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER13             MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.14             First, with several factual points.  The tribe15   did know the substance of -- of what had happened with16   respect to Secretary Hodel.  As I pointed out earlier,17   Mr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint18   appendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said,19   from Washington that -- that it was requested there that20   they go back to negotiations.21             And also I would call the Court's attention to22   page 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the23   negotiating session -- first negotiating session that24   occurred after that on August 30th, 1985.  It's a note in25   which Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   Secretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try 2   to reach an agreement.  So it's clear that the parties 3   entered into these negotiations with a full understanding 4   of -- of what the Secretary's preferred course was. 5             Secondly, I think it's -- it's completely not 6   true that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to 7   the Navajo Nation.  The -- on page 117 of the joint 8   appendix, there's a copy of the directive that -- or 9   the -- the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the10   Assistant Secretary about this.  And he makes four very11   significant points entirely reasonable under the12   circumstances.          He -- he referred to the fact that affirming thedecision outright unilaterally might lead to prolongedlitigation, during which the -- Peabody might well putthe -- the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn'tget them.13141516171819   relationship between the parties.  Peabody has a huge20   presence on the reservation, and it was obviously￼It would impair the future ongoing contractual21   beneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and22   not just this isolated royalty increase under this one23   lease, but a whole host of issues that were -- that were24   facing the two parties:  taxation, payment for water,25   other -- other leases in which there was a significant54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   increase. 2             And those other leases, by the way, did not have 3   an adjustment clause.  So the tribe here got the benefit 4   not only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on 5   a lease that did not have an adjustment clause. 6             And Secretary Hodel then said it would be 7   preferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then 8   importantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final 9   decision on the merits of the appeal.  I just think it10   would be better if the parties went back and negotiated.11   And since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease12   provision that was -- protected both parties, what is13   reasonable for both parties, it was certainly an14   appropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say --15   in the normal situation where you have a -- a16   disagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send17   the parties back and seek to have them negotiate.18             Also, I would point out on page 125 of the joint19   appendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he20   points out that the Secretary is aware of each party's21   concerns about the settlement, again making it clear22   that -- that the Department in Washington was aware of the23   state of affairs out there.24             So the only -- the only -- aside from all of25   that, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   1987 lease amendments are essentially procedural or tort2   claims, or claims about improper regulation of -- of a3   negotiating process.  They aren't the sort of money-4   mandating statutory or -- first of all, there's no5   claim -- no -- no identification of a statutory or6   regulatory provision that -- that specifically regulates7   this and was violated.  But in any event, just like the8 910111213141516171819202122232425Due Process Clause that this Court held in Testan is notmoney-mandating, the same is true here as well.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
