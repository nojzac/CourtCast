Yousuf.            Mr. Dvoretzky.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:Official￼1011121314151617   argument.  You might want to address it later.  And it’s            The FSIA applies to suits against foreignofficials for acts taken on the state's behalf, becausesuch suits are the equivalent of a suit against thestate directly.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Counsel, I -- I want to justsay that I have one problem with the case at the outset.And I don't mean to interrupt the organization of your18192021   Let's assume -- I know this is not your position.  Let's22   assume the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act grantsa question that goes to the other counsel, too.            I'm having difficulty seeing how the issuesas presented in the brief really resolve very much.23   immunity to the state for this conduct and for a24   then-serving official who is its agent and for a former25   agent.  Let's assume there is -- there is immunity.  Why3Alderson Reporting Company5 6 7 8 9at the outset, and I really didn't mean to interrupt your-- your good introduction.isn't it just repealed, overridden, by the laterenactment of the Torture Victims Protection Act?1011121314151617181920   thing.  Also, the government previously argued that the21   TVPA has to be interpreted consistent with preexisting22   immunity principles.  When Congress wants to waiveOfficial1234   way in the briefs, and I'm puzzled by it.  But I say thatI just don't see the issue structured that            MR. DVORETZKY:  The Torture VictimProtection Act creates a cause of action but is silentabout immunity, and, therefore, has to be interpretedconsistently with background immunity principles andconsistently with a preexisting statute codifyingimmunity, rather than --￼            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what authority doyou have for that?repeat --MR. DVORETZKY:  I'm sorry.  Could you            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What case authority do youhave for that proposition?MR. DVORETZKY:  Dellmuth v. Muth, for one23   immunity, it knows how to do that.  For example, it24   amended the FSIA to specifically waive immunity for25   actions against state sponsors of terrorism.4Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's like a -- it's like aclear statement rule?            MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes.  If Congress wishes towaive immunity, it has to do so expressly.1011121314   the state, then, yes, immunity would apply.  Those15   defenses were not asserted in those cases, though.16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there -- is there any17   Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that wouldOfficial            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you are right aboutthat -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien TortStatute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if therehad been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartigawas a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic,none of those could have gone forward?￼            MR. DVORETZKY:  If, in those cases, animmunity defense had been asserted and it had beenestablished that the official was acting on behalf of18   have survived, under your view, because your view is19   it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities20   Act, end of case?21               MR. DVORETZKY:  Absolutely, there are22   Torture Victim Protection Act and ATS claims that could23   be brought.  They could be brought whenever an FSIA24   exception applies.  So, for example, if an action were25   brought against an official of a state sponsor of5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   terrorism, the FSIA exception for that would apply.  If2345678   happened.  For example, the Philippines effectively9   waived immunity when claims were brought against Marcos.a foreign state waived immunity, either explicitly orimplicitly --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but that doesn't --that's not going to happen.(Laughter.) MR. DVORETZKY:  There are cases where it has￼10   So it certainly could happen.11               Congress envisioned that the statute would12   be interpreted consistently with immunity principles.13   The legislative history supports that inference.  There14   are reports in the legislative history and a15   floor statement by Senator Specter saying that the FSIA16   could provide an immunity defense to a claim against an17   official where the official can establish an agency18   relationship with the state.19               Here, there is no question that Mr. Samantar20   was acting in an official capacity, because he is being21   sued for his actions as a prime minister and as a22   defense minister, in the midst of what was effectively23   quelling a secessionist insurgency.  That's an24   inherent --256JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, that -- again,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   the Torture Victim Protection Act says “an individual 2   who, under actual or apparent authority, or under color 3   of law of any foreign nation, subjects an individual to4 torture.” 5               Why isn't that a clear statement?  And then 6   I’ll get off this hobby horse, and you can get back to 7   talking about the FSIA. 8               MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, it's not a clear 9   statement because it's only a clear statement creating a10   cause of action.  It's not a clear statement that speaks11   to immunity.  And, again, where Congress has wanted to￼121314151617181920212223   to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state.  That24   doesn't sound the way you would just establish a cause25 of action.7waive immunity, it has done that expressly, as where itwaived the immunity of a foreign state for claims broughtagainst state sponsors of terrorism.            And Dellmuth v. Muth, I think, is on pointbecause there the Court held that even though a cause ofaction was created that would principally apply only tostate agencies, that in and of itself was not sufficientto waive the sovereign immunity of the states.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I’ll jump onthe hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off.            I mean, the -- the exception in the TVPA isAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6   sponsors of terrorism.  That's in the red brief at 17a. 7   It's 28 U.S.C. section 1605A(c).  And so in that 8   situation, what Congress did was it both created a cause 9   of action against state sponsors of terrorism and their10   officials and waived immunity.11               In the TVPA, all that Congress did was to12   create a cause of action.  And so that cause of action13   has to be read consistently with background principles14   of immunity.15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, when you -- going16   back to where you started -- you started saying the17   officer must go together with the state, because in18   reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the19 state.20               But this is a case seeking money out of the21   pocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of22   Somalia, so why is the suit against the officer here23   equivalent to a suit against the state?24               MR. DVORETZKY:  Because the touchstone of25   foreign sovereign immunity law, which the FSIA codified,8            MR. DVORETZKY:  You’re talking about theexception in the TVPA for state sponsors of terrorism?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.            MR. DVORETZKY:  But the TVPA -- the FSIA, inaddition, also has a cause of action applicable to state￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   is that one nation's courts cannot sit in judgment of2   another nation's acts.  And the basis for liability that’s 3 4 5 6   issue is whose acts are in question.  Now, in the 7   domestic context, of course, the distinction between 8   personal liability and liability from the state may 9   matter, but that's only because --10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that sounds like11   you're -- you're talking about an “act of state” doctrine,12   not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a13   suit against the other.14               MR. DVORETZKY:  The “act of state” doctrine15   is distinct from immunity doctrines, although they have16   certain shared underpinnings and shared comity17   considerations.  And just as the under -- act of state18   doctrine is concerned with not judging the acts of19   foreign states, so too is foreign sovereign immunity20   law.  That's the fundamental premise of foreign -- of21   foreign sovereignty immunity law.22               In the domestic context, courts do sometimes23   say that an official can be sued for personal liability24   because he wasn't acting for the state if he violated25   the state's controlling law.  U.S. courts are able to9asserted in this case is Samantar's acts on behalf ofthe state of Somalia.The issue is not who pays the judgment; the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   make that determination because our courts are the 2   ultimate arbiters of domestic law.  U.S. courts are not 3   the ultimate arbiters of foreign law.  In fact, a 4   determination that an official was not acting for a 5   foreign state because he must have violated the foreign 6   state's law or international law is precisely what 7   foreign sovereign immunity prohibits. 8               So in the foreign sovereign immunity 9   context, as long as the underlying acts are those of the10   state, foreign sovereign immunity prohibits the case11   from proceeding.  And that --12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm not sure that I13   followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se,14   because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within15   that Act and to have the government cover it, the16   officer has to be acting within the scope of her17   employment, however careless or reckless she may be.18               MR. DVORETZKY:  That -- and that goes to19   when the government would be liable for the employee's20   acts.  In our case, what we’re talking about here is21   when the official can be personally liable for acts of22   the state.  And in the domestic context, we say the23   official can be liable when he must not have been acting24   for the state because he violated the state's25   controlling law.10￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            Foreign sovereign immunity prohibits thatdetermination with respect to the law of foreign states,and it prohibits U.S. courts from imposing their view ofinternational law on other courts to conclude that anofficial must not have been acting for his state.            JUSTICE ALITO:  How will a court determinewhether an official was acting within the official scopeof the official's responsibilities?            MR. DVORETZKY:  Ordinarily, the foreignstate would tell you, and that would be dispositive ofthe matter.            If the foreign state doesn't tell you, youwould look at the nature of the allegations in thecomplaint and see if they fall within a category ofconduct that is inherently viewed in -- as sovereign.Atop that list --101112131415161718   by looking at the complaint?  Is there going to be19202122232425direct communication between the court and the foreigngovernment on this issue?            MR. DVORETZKY:  A foreign governmentordinarily is going to -- is going to get involved inthe case and indicate whether it wishes to assertimmunity on behalf of the official or not.            For example, there have been several cases11Official￼JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the court can't tellAlderson Reporting Company 1   involving suits against Israeli officials, and the 2   Israeli embassy communicated to the courts and to the 3   State Department that these were acts of Israel and the 4   official policy of the state. 5               Again, if you don't have that, though, it's 6   not going to be a difficult inquiry, typically, to look 7   and see whether inherently sovereign acts are what's at 8   issue.  For example, if you have military or police 9   conduct, as this Court said in Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,10   that’s inherently sovereign conduct.  Legislative --11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how is the inquiry12   any different than the one that would go under the13   common law head of state inquiry?  What would be14   different in the two?15               MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think the inquiry as16   to whether it's an official act would be the same, but17   head of state immunity is a different sort of immunity18   than sovereign immunity.  It's much broader, insofar asOfficial￼19202122232425it covers even personal acts by a head of state while he’sin office, whereas for foreign sovereign immunity,what you’re looking to distinguish is whether theofficial was engaged in personal activity or whether hewas engaged in acts on behalf of the state.           JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is head of state immunity12Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9implicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act aswell?            MR. DVORETZKY:  No.  Head of state immunityis a different body of common law immunity that theFSIA --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why can't this be a -- adifferent body of common law?            MR. DVORETZKY:  Do you mean, whycan't this --16   immunity is not a form of sovereign immunity.  And what17   Congress did in this Act was it codified the law of18   foreign sovereign immunity.  At common law, the19202122   why -- that doesn't make any sense to me.  Why would we23   have had the creation of all of these common lawOfficial￼10111213   Immunities Act.  Why -- why should I believe that they14   did not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity?15               MR. DVORETZKY:  Because head of state            JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I mean, you’re sayingthey -- they left head of state immunity to the commonlaw, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereignsovereign immunity of the state was always understood toextend to officials for their official acts.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  Why --24   immunities attached to foreign individuals like consular25   and diplomatic and heads of state if state sovereign13Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6   individual might be entitled to.  There is the immunity 7   that flows from the state itself for official acts, and 8   there is immunity that flows from the individual's 9   office, like diplomatic and consular immunity.10               Diplomatic and consular immunity are meant11   to ensure that states can conduct their business without12   tying up their officials while they are in office in13   litigation in foreign courts over any matters, personal14   or official.15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm trying to go before16   the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it17   was passed, because that was Congress's first statement,18   and we have to figure out what they intended to replace19   or not replace.20               Before the Act came in, what activities of a21   consular office would not have been covered under the22   foreign sovereign immunity of a state?  What activity23   could a diplomat have engaged in or a consular officer24   have engaged in that state immunity, as it was25   understood at the time, would not have given him or her?14immunity was going to cover them naturally?            MR. DVORETZKY:  Because consular anddiplomatic immunity are very different in scope and inpurpose than state sovereign immunity.There are two sources of immunity that an￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               MR. DVORETZKY:  He could get into a car 2   accident.  Diplomatic and consular immunity would 3   prevent the diplomat or the consul from being sued for 4   tort damages for a car accident in a foreign state. 5               Official immunity would not, because driving 6   is not considered an official policy of the state in the 7   way that, as I was saying to Justice Alito, police or 8   military conduct would be. 9               So that's the distinction between official10   conduct and conduct that may well be within the scope of11   employment but is not entitled to the state's immunity.12   And where Congress --13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can -- can you get to the14   text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you --15   that you assert embraces this personal immunity?16               MR. DVORETZKY:  Section 1603(a) -- excuse17   me -- section 1604 says that “a foreign state shall be18   immune from the jurisdiction” of the United States and of19   the States.  When a suit is brought against an official20   for his official act, that is effectively subjecting the21   foreign state itself to U.S. jurisdiction.22               JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose that the -- the23   Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers24   at a time when the department is a separate agency of25   Government X in 1940.  In 1950, this department is15￼Alderson Reporting Company5 6 7 8 9for what happened years ago when they were part of thestate.            Is it sovereign immunity, this statute thatblocks the suit, or some other principle?Officialbought by the Dior clothing company.            Now, it's a private entity, and someone would1234   bill.  It is now a private entity.  They are suing themlike to sue the department because they didn't pay the￼            MR. DVORETZKY:  I think this statute wouldblock the suit --101112   suit.  There’s precedent with -- you know, famous13   precedent with King Farouk, which says the opposite.  It14   says:  You were king, you are not king now; therefore,23 24 25possibly be interfering in the workings of the state --            MR. DVORETZKY:  If the state --            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you still can't sue16JUSTICE BREYER:  The statute would block the1516171819202122   you couldn't possibly be interfering.  You couldn'tthere may be a different principle, but we can sue younow.            MR. DVORETZKY:  Because the source ofimmunity in that case was head of state immunity, whichis different from the state sovereign immunity --            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And you’resaying if a state disappears, it no longer exists, soAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425anybody --MR. DVORETZKY:  It was --Official           JUSTICE BREYER:  -- who was part of the officialoperation --            MR. DVORETZKY:  If the --            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- even though there is nopresent interference?            MR. DVORETZKY:  If the state does not exist,then I think you probably could sue the official --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why?           MR. DVORETZKY:  Because --           JUSTICE BREYER:  Because if the statedoesn't exist, why is there any stronger reasonthan in the incident where the entity is no longerpart of the state?            MR. DVORETZKY:  Because ultimately, whatforeign sovereign immunity and this statute areconcerned with is protecting a foreign state's act frombeing judged in court.            In your example of the Department of theArmy which subsequently is bought by another company,and the foreign state exists, the foreign state's actsare still being judged regardless of the status of thatdepartment --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, no, you may have act of17￼Alderson Reporting Company3 4 5 6 7 8 9of the act of state doctrine for the very reason you’vesaid.            MR. DVORETZKY:  You may very well have theact of state doctrine, but --1011121314   It serves different purposes.  Immunity prevents the15   suit from proceeding at the outset.  It's an immunityOfficial1   state doctrine.  At that point, the State Department2   comes in and says:  You can't maintain this suit because            JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's my question:  Doyou need the act of state doctrine or does this statutecover it which removes the discretion from the ExecutiveBranch to decide on a case-by-case basis?￼            MR. DVORETZKY:  The act of state doctrinemight very well cover your hypothetical, but it’s adifferent doctrine that is not duplicative of immunity.16171819   doctrine, first of all.  It's not automatic in the way20   that immunity is; and, second of all, it applies only on21   the merits; and, third, it serves different purposes22   because it can be used even offensively and even in23   cases where the state itself is not a party, simply to24   establish the legality of a state's conduct within its25   own territory.  So the act of state doctrine is a18not only from liability, but an immunity from thelitigation process itself.The act of state doctrine is a discretionaryAlderson Reporting Company7 8 9the hypothetical where a state does not exist at all,then 1604 would not come into play because there is noforeign state to be held immune.101112   can I come back to the text?  I --  just for a moment13141516171819202122232425there we were on the text of this Act --            (Laughter.)            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that the suit is about.And you said where -- where the immunity exists is at604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but1603 defines a foreign state, which -- which says thatit includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreignstate.            And then it defines agency orinstrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does notinclude private individuals, but rather just artificiallegal persons.            MR. DVORETZKY:  Section 1603(a) does not19Official1   judge-made prudential doctrine that serves different2   purposes than immunity.3               In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer,4   immunity would apply to the acts of the -- of the5   Department of the Army because, regardless of when suit6   is brought, those acts are still those of the state.  In￼That's not this case, though.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I come back --Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   define a foreign state exhaustively.

We know that because, if3456   “a foreign state” means, it could have said:  “A foreign7   state” means its political subdivisions, agencies, oryou look at 1603(b), the very next subsection, Congresssaid what “an agency or instrumentality” means.So had it meant to define exhaustively what 8   instrumentalities.  The fact that Congress said that a 9   foreign state includes a political subdivision and its10   agencies or instrumentalities suggests that it includes11   more than just the enumerated entities.12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I -- I would find it13   extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say14   that it includes the Department of Defense but would15   leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of16   Defense.  I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more17   likely that you would understand a foreign state to18   include the departments of -- of that state than that19   you would assume a foreign state to include individuals20   who happen to be officials of the state.21               MR. DVORETZKY:  And the reason that I think22   that Congress had to go out of its way to define what23   constitutes an agency or instrumentality is that, at the24   time that the FSIA was passed, there was uncertainty25   about whether certain governmental or corporate entities20￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   were included, maybe not the Department of Defense, but 2   whether certain commercial entities owned by the state 3   were entitled to the state's immunity.  There was -- 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there was no 5   uncertainty about -- about individuals? 6               MR. DVORETZKY:  Precisely.  There was no 7   uncertainty about whether individuals were included. 8   And so when Congress was simply continuing the common 9   law against which it passed this statute, it didn't need10   to expressly say --11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can you maintain that12   position when the Department of State takes the position13   that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a14   state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't15   apply to officers?  If it was all that certain that they16   didn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State17   Department is being recalcitrant?18               MR. DVORETZKY:  The State Department asked,19   before the FSIA was passed, to have Executive discretion20   take -- taken away with respect to immunity21   determinations.  Congress agreed with that judgment and22   passed the FSIA, and now the Executive Branch has to be23   held to that judgment that was made.  As far --24               JUSTICE ALITO:  It's something of a --25   it's something of a mystery that the FSIA doesn't say21￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   anything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't 2   codify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the 3   preexisting law.  Do you have an explanation for that? 4               MR. DVORETZKY:  I don't, other than the 5   explanation that I gave Justice Scalia, which is:  This 6   immunity was not in question at the time that the FSIA 7   was passed, and when Congress passes a statute in an 8   area where there had been preexisting common law, this 9   Court presumes that Congress meant to incorporate and10   continue that common law and not abrogate it unless11   Congress has spoken directly to the contrary.12               JUSTICE ALITO:  But was this Act originally13   drafted by the Executive?  Do you know?14               MR. DVORETZKY:  I'm not sure whether it was15   drafted by the Executive or whether it was drafted by16   Congress, but it was passed at the request of the17   Executive Branch because there was -- the State18   Department was put in a position of being under19   diplomatic pressure to grant immunity on -- on favored20   status to certain nations who asked for it when they21   wouldn't otherwise be entitled to it.  This --22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any case by us23   in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize24   that an individual was immunized in the way that the25   state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?22Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1234   had to do with other doctrines.  The one possible5   exception to that is Underhill, in which the Second6   Circuit's decision decided the issue on foreign 7   sovereign immunity grounds, and this Court affirmed. 8               It's unclear entirely whether this Court's 9   affirmance was on act of state or immunity grounds, but10   also at the time that that decision was -- came down,11   act of state and immunity doctrines were very much12   intertwined.13               There is no question, however, as the14   government argues, that the common law before the FSIA15   recognized that officials were entitled to immunity --16   to the state's immunity for their official acts.  The17   Second Restatement, which was -- which was promulgated18   in 1965 just before the FSIA, says that.  The Second19   Circuit's decision from 1971, just before the FSIA was20   passed, in Heaney, says that.  And it --OfficialOr were all of our cases having to do with other commonlaw doctrines?MR. DVORETZKY:  This Court's cases generally￼21 22 23 24 25            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, entitled to it, or --or able to obtain a letter from the State Departmentthat would confer it upon them?            MR. DVORETZKY:  No, Your Honor --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean -- well, I mean,23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the 2   State Department, didn't you?  Even the state, 3   for that matter? 4               MR. DVORETZKY:  No.  The -- the -- prior to 5   the FSIA, this was a common law doctrine that courts 6   would often apply without any input from the State 7   Department. 8               In the Heaney case, for example, the State 9   Department was asked to provide input and provided none,10   and the Second Circuit nonetheless held that, using the11   generally applicable common law principles, that the12   official was entitled to immunity for the state's acts.13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what -- what if the14   State Department came in and said no, no sovereign15   immunity here, what would the court do?  Would the court16   be bound by that?17               MR. DVORETZKY:  Ordinarily, the court would18   at least defer to that.  Whether it would be19   definitively bound by -- by that or not, it would at20   least be entitled to deference.21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they didn't have to say22   yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much23   carried the day?24               MR. DVORETZKY:  That's probably right.25   And -- but the real issue that prompted the FSIA --24￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you -- you don'tassert that to be -- to be the law now, do you?  Has --has that been carried forward --            MR. DVORETZKY:  No --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- under the FSIA?            MR. DVORETZKY:  No, because the wholepurpose of the FSIA -- again, at the Executive Branch'srequest -- was to take the Executive out of that processand to --1011121314151617181920   still have immunity.  Or am I wrong about that?21 22 23 24 25            MR. DVORETZKY:  Well --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I had thought when I readthe House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talkedabout the statute, that they took your position, thisfirst position, that the Act just won't work unless25Official￼            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, and then I -- I hadthought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that,ultimately, in this case, whether or not within theissues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments.One is that it's just implicit, inherent, necessary forthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that agents becovered; otherwise it won't work.            The other -- I take it you have a backupposition that even if that's wrong, that under generallyaccepted principles of international law, that agentsAlderson Reporting Company8 910111213141516171819202122232425disagree with us on that, we would certainly wish toassert common law defenses on remand, but we believethat the statute resolves the question.            If the Court has no further questions, I’dlike to reserve my time.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Ms. Millett.          ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS            MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            Justice Kennedy, the hobby horse that youwere talking about actually goes right -- right to theheart of this case, and that is of the Torture VictimProtection Act, in which Congress did create a cause ofaction, was -- that cause of action was created for -- toimpose a liability, personal liability, for acts thatwere done with "actual or apparent" -- but included with26Official1   there’s an agent -- immunity for the agent.  But I take2   it that even if we reject that position, you still have3   a fallback position in the -- in the -- in further4   proceedings on remand?5               MR. DVORETZKY:  Our position is that the6   FSIA incorporates the common law and that Mr. Samantar7   is entitled to immunity under the statute.  If you￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9“actual” -- authority of the foreign state.            Now, if Congress believed that the FSIAimmunized everyone who undertook acts under color oflaw, or at a minimum with actual authority of theforeign state, that was a very empty statute.            Now, part of the -- part of the --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Millett, I think it's apretty empty statute as well to interpret the ForeignSovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of17181920   well.  We’re talking about insulating state acts.  The21   only way a state can act is through people.  And you’re22   saying:  Well, the state is insulated, but the people23   who do the acts for the state are not.  I don't see how24   that can -- can work.25               MS. MILLETT:  The only question here is27Official￼10   Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense.  I mean, that11   seems very strange.12               MS. MILLETT:  It doesn't seem strange, for13   precisely the reason that we have still with us today a14   former minister of defense when we have no Ministry of15   Defense and no Government of Somalia whatsoever.  The16   reason is that individuals come and go.  Individualsengage in acts that are not acts of the state --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the state --there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial asAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is the 2   source of that insulation.  And the very 3   difficulty with -- 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, well, then -- 5   but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was 6   there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, 7   they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not 8   the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is 9   through individuals.10               MS. MILLETT:  Well, first of all, states do11   corporate acts that are greater than the -- the whole is12   much greater than the parts here.  And the issue in this￼13141516   act.  They may act without authority; they may act17   contrary to authority.  And the problem with the FSIA,18   which is the issue here, is there is no mechanism in it19   for addressing, for example, whether this wascase is whether the part can claim the immunity of thewhole, and that is a very different thing.The -- the individual -- individuals may20   authorized.2122   Defense is not the whole, either.  I mean, you -- you23   acknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a24   foreign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow25   not -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign28JUSTICE SCALIA:  The -- the Ministry ofAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   entity.  That seems to me very strange.  I mean, I guess -- 2   I guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why 3   anybody would want to write it that way. 4               MS. MILLETT:  Well, Justice Scalia, if 5   you're going to write a statute that addresses 6   individual immunities -- in particular, what this case 7   is about, personal immunity for personal liability, 8   then those statutes look very different. 9               What’s the first thing you are going to10   want?  You are going to want some way to decide what is11   official capacity or what is on behalf of a state, and12   you are going to want a mechanism for the foreign state,13   or at least the State Department, to have input on that.14   There’s nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act15   that addresses that.  You're going to --￼1617181920   bothering me, is:  Don't think of this case.  Think of21   the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is22   suing an active state.  He’s suing France or he’sJUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is your --MS. MILLETT:  -- want to identify --JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  The question Ithink, as I understand it, which is certainly why it’s23   suing England or -- he’s suing an active state for an24   official act.  And the judge says:  I have read the25   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed.  Judge,29Alderson Reporting Company1   let me amend this.  And all he does is he fills in2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the names of the individuals, because there were someindividuals who did the act.            Now, does he suddenly fall outside theForeign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listedthe names of the people who did it, and everything elsewas the same?            MS. MILLETT:  Yes, he does, because --21 22 23 24 25I did was fill their names in, in the complaint.            And I cannot imagine any complaint thatisn't open to that, because a -- a state can only actthrough an individual.            MS. MILLETT:  Justice Breyer, there -- the30Official￼            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then, this Act doesnothing whatsoever.101112   That's not true, Justice Breyer.  This Act is designedMS. MILLETT:  No, that's -- that's not true.131415161718   same, everything was the same.  I happened to go to the19   Internet to find out who were the human beings working for20   the state who did the thing I'm complaining did.  And allto protect the state from being sued.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it doesn't protect --MS. MILLETT:  You can’t --           JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the state, because all Idid there is I made my complaint the same, relief was theAlderson Reporting Company7 8 9of jurisdiction would have the effect of enforcing arule of law against the state, then you get immunized.            JUSTICE BREYER:  So wait --           MS. MILLETT:  That --           JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you’re saying this ActOfficial1234   would have.  If they thought, in the Restatement’s5   words -- which are not just if you are doing an official6   act.  If you are doing an official act, and the exercisequestion is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would havethought that is a suit against the state.Now, there may be many reasons that they￼101112   is only good as against a bad lawyer?  Because any1314151617   lawyer.  Is that what you’re saying?18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Millett --19               MS. MILLETT:  This Act is good against --20               JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought your point21   is, if the relief is against the state, it doesn't22   matter who you name as the plaintiff.23               MS. MILLETT:  That --24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whether it's injunctive25   relief or money relief, if the relief is against the31good lawyer would simply fill in the right names.            MS. MILLETT:  I think --            JUSTICE BREYER:  There is never a case wherethis Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a goodAlderson Reporting Company12345678   to say.  The second half of the Restatement says youstate, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming theofficer instead.Official            MS. MILLETT:  That's precisely right.  Thatis the second half of the Restatement --JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh.  Oh, that's a differentanswer --     have to be enforcing a rule -- the effect --                JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  If you’re going to give     that answer --                MS. MILLETT:  -- if you’re enforcing a rule     of law against --                JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which I thought was what     you would give --                 MS. MILLETT:  That's what I was trying togive.(Laughter.)                 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- then I have added my20   question:  Sometimes the individual, in the first set of21   cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the22   state.  Sometimes the individual does not count as the23   state.  And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to24   work out the principle of when that individual would25   fall within the FSIA -- as you now, via32MS. MILLETT:  Well, that's what I was trying￼ 910111213141516171819Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   Justice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does --2   and when it doesn't.3               And I've tried to work with the idea of4   relief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or5   maybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time6   afterwards.  I'm not an expert.  You’re more of an7   expert than I.  What are the principles that determine89 10 11 12when?levels here.MS. MILLETT:  Well, there's -- there's twoFirst of all, we’d look -- and this is --￼Congress, presumably, was drawing on a well-established13   domestic law analogies here.  And they may not be14   100 percent controlling here, but we have15   well-established ways of understanding whether a -- an16   action is against an official in -- in their official17   capacity.  We look at the form of relief, the nature of18   the claim.  I do think we need to be careful here --19               JUSTICE ALITO:  What is there to suggest that20   Congress was looking to domestic analogies?  This has21   nothing -- immunity of officials under domestic law22   doesn't bear very much resemblance to the immunities23   that are available to foreign officials, does it?24               MS. MILLETT:  Well, this is a domestic25   statute, and for Congress -- for purposes of Congress33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   deciding whether a lawsuit is a suit against a sovereign 2   or not against a sovereign, then that is obviously a 3   relevant framework. 4               And we know from two things -- the Torture 5   Victim Protection Act, that they looked at that framework, 6   but also embedded in the FSIA itself, in the Foreign 7   Sovereign Immunities Act itself, is that same 8   distinction between holding people personally liable and 9   holding the state liable.10               In 1605A, the terrorist state exception, on11   15a to 17a of the addendum to our brief, they create a12   cause of action, one against the state and one against13   the individual officials.  Now, the one against the14   individual officials is a recognition that individual15   officials can have personal capacity liability for16   damages, consistent with the Foreign Sovereign17   Immunities Act.  Otherwise, if -- if, under18   Petitioner's theory, every lawsuit against an19   individual -- and the language there, is “acting under20   color of office or employment” -- if every suit against21   someone under color of office or employment morphs into22   a suit against the state, there is no cause of action23   to create against the individual.24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Millett, I25 thought --34￼Alderson Reporting Company123456   every time a state was sued.  The government requested7   it for that purpose.  Now they are just back into it            MS. MILLETT:  They understood it wasindividual liability.Official            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought thewhole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branchout of the business of sending letters to the court89 1012   should proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and,13   basically, we’ll send you a letter and let you know.14   So it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is15   undermined by the position you’re taking today.16               MS. MILLETT:  No, I think it's because the17   inquiries are very different, as this case illustrates.18   And that is -- first of all, the point of the FSIA, as19   section 1602 says, is to codify -- as this Court's cases20   have said, was to -- largely to codify the restrictive21   theory of sovereign immunity, which did not apply to22   individual immunity.  It did not apply to the head of23   state.  The head of state was still immune for24   commercial acts while a sitting head of state.25               So, if that was codified, that was a dramatic35again if you say, well, you can just sue theindividuals.￼                 And the government's position in this case11   confirms that.  They're -- they tell us the way youAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   change done silently in the FSIA.  The reason Congress2   would want to retain Executive Branch role here is3   because the inquires are different, and the first one is4   the most elemental one in Petitioner's case and that is5   the assertion that:  I was acting in my official6   capacity.  Who decides?  How do we decide?  Which7   agents?  For which actions?  For how long?  What level89 10of immunity?            If the FSIA eliminated the head of state's￼     normal absolute immunity while sitting from all actions,11   commercial or not, that's a dramatic revolution.  We can12   now sue sitting prime ministers and presidents and13   distract them from their duties.14               If the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act made15   any official’s official act an act of the state -- and16   remember, they are now every level of the foreign17   government down to the mayor's office, and corporate18   officials, too, so we've now eliminated the long-standing19   principle in corporate law -- corporations also only act20   through individuals -- that corporate liability and21   individual liability go hand-in-hand.22               The -- the FSIA did not uproot all that, and23   it provides no mechanisms.  That's why we need to return24   to the common law immunity.  Now, what happens when you25   have a case that, in effect, is seeking relief against36Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the state --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  The -- themechanism it provides is judicial determination of thesequestions that -- that you say have to be determined --whether he was acting within the scope of authority andall that stuff.           MS. MILLETT:  As you --           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that what it did?It took it away from the Executive, gave it --Official￼10111213   the court.  "Official capacity" appears nowhere in the14   FSIA.  Deciding which agents will be agents of the state15   is nowhere in the FSIA.            MS. MILLETT:  When you’re interpreting thelanguage in the FSIA, like "under color of law" --"under color of office," that is undoubtedly a job for16               One court has applied this agency -- agent17   principle to say that when we hire an independent18   contractor, in the -- the United States independent19   contractor, that gets the immunity of the foreign20   sovereign state.21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Courts -- courts22   decide this sort of question all the time, whether23   you’re talking about principles of domestic immunity24   or even corporate liability:  Is the employee on a25   frolic or is it a detour?  Determining when an individual37Alderson Reporting Company1234   decisions have foreign relations implications.  This5   Court has done the opposite.  And it has -- it hasOfficialis acting for another entity as opposed to on -- on hisown business, that's a very common inquiry.MS. MILLETT:  Not in this area, where those6   waited for the political branches to lead, and it has7   followed.  Because the decision whether we’re89 1012   have an individual and with what's being charged here13   is he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense,14   and this action is an action he took in his official15   capacity, that's it.  Forget it.  This Act covers it.displacing head of state immunity and now we’re goingto have commercial immunity --￼                 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then that -- I mean, I'm11   sort of there.  You may agree with this, that if you16171819202122232425   at that action goes:  This is really an action against38            But where you’re claiming it's not and he'snot now a member, the reason for the Act disappears,and you go back to the act of state doctrine.            MS. MILLETT:  Justice Breyer, the -- I don'tthink -- I think -- and this may seem a little formless,but I simply think it's right, because you’re dealingwith statutory text here.            It's not so much that the defense ministerhimself becomes the state; it's that the court lookingAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   the state.  The state is a necessary party under 2   Pimentel and must be here.  You, individual, actually 3   have a common law immunity, an absolute immunity, when 4   you are, under the Restatement, sued for official acts. 5   And the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to 6   enforce a rule of law against the state. 7               When you have those two things together, 8   both of them, you are entitled to immunity because this 9   is an action against the state.  The state's a necessary10   party.  Under Republic of Philippines v. -- excuse me --11   Pimentel, they must be joined, and that will -- then we'll12   look at the FSIA and decide whether they can be joined13   or not.  That's the way it works.14               It's not that individuals -- and this is a15   problem -- that are sort of popping in and out all16   throughout the FSIA.  If it were, we need mechanisms17   that we don't have here to deal with the very sensitive18   decisions of which individuals.  Well, how will we say19   you’re the agent?  It’s -- the individual can show up and20   say I was working for the state; I was doing torture;21   we loved torture; that was our policy -- you can imagine22   many a government, if notified, if there was a mechanism23   for them to come in, would say:  Hang on, that was not our24   policy.  But there’s no mechanism under his theory.25               What else happens?  I don't even understand,39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   under this theory, what happens.  Normally, what happens 2   in these official capacity suits that we’re familiar 3   with is if it really is an official capacity, then we -- 4   we substitute the state, relief will run against the5 state. 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your friend -- 7   you friend -- 8              MS. MILLETT:  But there’s no mechanism here 9   for -- I’m sorry.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your friend said it11   happens all the time.  He cited the example of the￼12131415   in court here until we got to this Court.  There was no16   Somali government to show up to say whether this wasIsraeli embassy is always sending letters or showing upin court when their agents are -- are sued.MS. MILLETT:  That may be.  Nobody showed up17   official or not, and the State Department didn't show up18   for 2 years.  What is a court supposed to do?19202122   Somalia, because it didn't know what else to do.  That23   can't be right.  And, again, we need to keep in mind the --24   there is no mechanism in the text of the FSIA.  This            Well, it was not supposed to do what it didhere and declare that it’s essentially recognizing thetransitional federal government as the government of25   Court will be engaged in an expedition of constructing40Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and reconstructing the FSIA if you are going to turn it into either a Westfall substitution act with no language here, or you have to turn it into a personal immunity for personal liability act.That’s not the text. Sovereign immunity has never been a personal liability from personal -- personal immunity from personal liability statute.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you agree with the Solicitor General's position about the preservation of the immunities that existed before?MS. MILLETT: Yes, as to -- as individualized, the specialized immunities --JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.MS. MILLETT: I do -- we do agree. Now,whether we -- we don't agree, I think -- we may not agree100 percent on what the scope or content of that immunity is. We certainly agree that head of state immunity was preserved, so we can't sue the head of state at all while sitting.JUSTICE ALITO: No, but whatever immunity existed previously for an official or former official was not abrogated by the FSIA. The FSIA just doesn't address that subject at all.MS. MILLETT: Our position is that the FSIA does not address that. Our view of what the common law did beforehand was it packed most of this into the act41Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   of state doctrine.  That’s exactly what happened in2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Underhill v. Hernandez, that when you start getting tolower level officials who are not heads of state, whoare not diplomatically protected, consular protected,mission on -- have mission immunity, that that -- a lotof that worked through act of state doctrine, and --            JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no -- there wasno immunity for someone who is the equivalent of a -- ofa cabinet officer, previously?19202122232425individual foreign officials are not personally liablefor actions is just wrong, and that is because --           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Millett, do you agreewith the --           MS. MILLETT:  -- or cannot be.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with thegovernment that it's the government's advice --42Official￼1011121314   debated on remand.  That issue is clearly not before15   this Court.  As we look at the cases and the authorities,16   in fact what you have are different things coming together,17   and it can be -- a lot of times, it was act of state18   doctrines that were going on there.  But the notion thatMS. MILLETT:  There -- there --            JUSTICE ALITO:  The minister of this or thatin another government -- they have no official immunity?MS. MILLETT:  Well, look -- and much is to beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   the government said, in the old days, the Tate letters2   went out in all these cases.  Now, they no longer go out3   when we’re dealing with a state itself or a state4   agency, but we still -- the Executive -- basically, as I5   read the government's position, the government is6   saying:  The Executive Branch decides.  We tell the7   court.  And if we don't tell the court that this person8 910111213141516171820   depends on whether they’re speaking with particularized21   specialty.  If they come in and say Mr. Samantar was22   the head of state, we’re done.  I don't think23   there's -- I’d like to think of something; I can't24   think of anything that would save us from that.  If they25   say who a head of state is, then that, I think, has43can be sued, then the person can't be sued.            Are you in sync with the government in thatwe are now back to the Executive -- essentially, theExecutive decides, not the court?            MS. MILLETT:  I don't think that’s theexclusive one, and I think, as this Court explained evenin Altmann that deference given -- respectful deferenceis always going to be given when the Executive Branchweighs in, because these are foreign -- cases that haveforeign policy implications.￼                 I don't think it's a rubber stamp on the19   part of the courts.  As this Court said in Altmann, itAlderson Reporting Company1112131415   asserts the right to say:  Yes, he was actingOfficial 1   largely been treated as binding on the courts. 2               If they say someone -- they've determined 3   that someone was acting in an official capacity, that’s 4   going to receive --- either whether communicated from the 5   foreign state or based on principles that they have -- 6   that’s going to carry weight, but it's not going to 7   necessarily mean you automatically dismiss when you 8   have -- you could have times where the Executive 9   Branch said anyone acting under color of law should be10   immunized.  Then --￼JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I gather the --           MS. MILLETT:  -- you're going to have theExecutive Branch and the TVPA at war.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the State Department1617181920212223   let them speak for their own position.  I think24   certainly -- certainly there are a variety of doctrines,25   a variety of hurdles any case has to get through.  And44in a -- in an official capacity, but sock it to him.            MS. MILLETT:  Yes.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, the -- the StateDepartment wants to be able to decide whetherindividuals will be held liable, whether they wereacting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it?MS. MILLETT:  Well, they -- that -- I’llAlderson Reporting Company 1   it's not just the Executive’s views on a case.  There’s 2   things like exhaustion.  There's necessary party 3   inquiries.  There's the act of state doctrine.  There’s 4   substantive limits on what one can sue for. 5               You know, the Torture Victim Protection Act 6   is Congress's judgment that individuals who do this, 7   consistent with international law, whatever else -- 8   individuals who engage in torture and extrajudicial 9   killing are held personally liable in Congress's views10   and in the views of international law.  And the Foreign1112131415161718192021   shall be -- shall be punished or not.  I -- I somehowSovereign Immunities Act doesn't stop that.            And what’s critical, again, is the --Official￼JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say --MS. MILLETT:  -- language that’s missing --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that I find it muchmore acceptable to have the State Department saythat a particular foreign country should be let off thehook, which is what they used to do with the Tateletters, than I do to leave it up to the StateDepartment whether -- whether an individual human being22232425   gone off.  I could just add -- make an addition to thatfind that less within the realm of the -- of the foreignaffairs power of the State Department.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And your red light has45Alderson Reporting Company4 5 6 7 8 9office at the time, what the policies were.            But it's just not clear to me what body ofprinciples the State Department looks to, to make thisdetermination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith isimmune and Jones isn't.10111213141516   trying to wrap themselves in.  So the FSIA is not the17   source.Official1   same question.  I would agree that the State Department2   might have some expertise in telling us what the facts3   were:  Who was the government, who was -- who was in￼MS. MILLETT:  I think --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please.MS. MILLETT:  May I, sir?  The -- first of all,whether one thinks it's the right rule or not, the FSIAdoesn't tell us any way of answering who was in officialcapacity and getting input, at a minimum, from theforeign government whose mantle this individual is1819   view, is not the sole source.  And there are -- there20   are a number of other doctrines, whether it's act of21   state doctrine, whether it is exhaustion principles,22   whether it's a necessary party inquiries, whether it's23   substantive limits on, you know, law of nations24   requirements for the Alien Tort Statute or the Torture25   Victim Protection Act.  There’s forum non conveniens.46The Executive viewpoint is not -- in ourAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   There are a battery of doctrines that come together to 2   very narrowly limit these actions. 3               And what the State Department looks for 4   is -- what it has said is that it has -- it has a 5   pattern of decisionmaking, factors it lays out in its 6   brief, that I think it finds -- it says it finds -- 7   influential in the process.  But in -- forgive me for -- 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your9 sentence.10               MS. MILLETT:  But in any given case, the11   role of the Executive Branch is going to have more or12   less deference based on whether it is speaking something13   within its traditional expertise:  Are you a head of14   state?  Were you a diplomat?15               But when it comes to war -- and I -- I'm not16   saying it would, but if it were to come to war with the17   very elements of the Torture Victim Protection Act and18   say that torture by an individual can be immunized just19   because it was done under color of law, then I think the20   Court has a very difficult concern that was flagged in21   Altmann to resolve, and I think we might draw a22   different -- we would definitely come to a different23   answer than the Executive Branch in that situation.24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You made that a long25 sentence.47￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)MS.

KNEEDLERFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTSMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The text, the context, the purposes, andlegislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act demonstrate that it was not intended to apply to the preexisting common law --Official￼but ratherJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you --MR.

KNEEDLER: I’m --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I’m sure one of my colleagues -- MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- will get you back.Could you address the practical implications of48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   your position?  And by that I mean, it took 2 years 2   for the State -- for the government to respond to the 3   district court in this case.  Tell us why your reading 4   of the statute would not grind the courts to a halt. 5               What happens when Justice Breyer's situation 6   arises?  Someone takes a complaint against the state and 7   just substitutes the names of the persons.  What -- why 8   wouldn't the courts come to a grinding halt? 9               MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, let me answer that in10 two ways.11               First, there’s -- there is a very practical12   distinction between suing the state and suing the13   individual.  The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not14   just about immunity; it's about the subject matter of15   the courts.  If a foreign sovereign is found to be16   immune, the court has no jurisdiction over the case.  So17   to say that the individual is -- is governed by the FSIA18   means that it would be a threshold subject matter19   jurisdictional inquiry in every case.  So in terms of20   judicial administration, that is a problem.21               It is also a problem, as a practical matter,22   to apply the FSIA's very reticulated standards that were23   carefully negotiated between the Executive Branch and24   Congress when they knew what they were dealing with.25   They were dealing with the immunity of states and49￼Alderson Reporting Company8 910111213141516that’s --Official1   the -- and the principals of states.  And this is2   reflected, as Ms. Millett said, in section 1602.  That's3   the business that Congress wanted to get -- Congress and4   the Executive -- wanted the Executive to be out of,5   which was the immunity of foreign states --6               JUSTICE BREYER:  But all you have to do is7   write a different word in.  Now, that's the question￼MR. KNEEDLER:  Okay.  And -- right and --            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and then Ms. Millettsort of backed off that.           MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.           JUSTICE BREYER:  And that -- and if -- what I'mseeing here is two extreme positions.            You’re saying:  Never, no matter what, canyou simply write the name "Joe Smith" under the word17   "Niger."  Okay?  Can't do it.  Even though every act --18   no matter what, you write that human name in, and you --19   this statute doesn't apply.  To me, that means it never20   applies.  All right?21               The opposite would be that never, under any22   circumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for23   a -- for an official act.  That seems the opposite.  I24   should think sometimes you certainly could.  Maybe after25   he has left the government.  But I'm looking for the50Alderson Reporting Company7 8 9            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, do you want to stick tothat position, that all the plaintiff --           MR. KNEEDLER:  Because this --Official1234   extreme position?  Never, just write the thing in --5               MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't -- I don't regard the6   position as extreme at all.  It's exactly --principle, if I'm right, that would divide the two.            MR. KNEEDLER:  And --JUSTICE BREYER:  You want to stick to your￼10111213141516   individual officials.  This -- and in addition,17   it -- it affected the relationship of the18   political branches.  It had been a power of the19   Executive Branch for foreign sovereigns.  The Foreign20   Sovereign Immunities Act took that away with the21   agreement of the political branches.22               There’s none of -- there’s no indication23   whatsoever that Congress addressed common law24   immunities, and there’s a good reason.  And that is25   that there -- there are a lot of diplomatic51           JUSTICE BREYER:  -- has to do isrewrite the name?            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- this is a statute thatinvaded the common law in the -- the background wasthe common law in which the Executive made thedeterminations for both foreign sovereigns andAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9sensitivities about whether immunity should berecognized in a particular case or not.            And with respect to foreign sovereigns, thepolitical branches addressed those in very precise ways.There’s nothing in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Actto take into account the different sensitivities thatmight well arise with respect to foreign sovereigns --Official            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's an excellent reason.Can you give me one single example ever of a complaintthat would ever be dismissed under this statute --￼10111213141516   one example in which it would work:  If the relief was17   going to run against the state, if there was anMR. KNEEDLER:  It would -- it --            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- if -- if my lawyer isclever enough to look up who the individuals were andsubstitute their names?MR. KNEEDLER:  And -- and it would -- here's18   injunction to take money out of the state treasury or to19   convey land, for example, that would, in substance, be20   an action against the state, just like under Ex parte21   Young.  If you tried to bring an injunction against a22232425   the state.  It's that the state is a necessary party tostate officer to make him pay money out of the statetreasury, you couldn't do that.It's not because the officer being sued is52Alderson Reporting Company1   that lawsuit.  The state not being joined, the suit2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9against the individual would have to be dismissed.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think as a practicalmatter --           MR. KNEEDLER:  That's Pimentel.Official           JUSTICE ALITO:  -- there’s a -- I'm sorry.Do you think, as practical matter, there’s a differencebetween a $10 million judgment against a state forsomething that is official state policy in relation todefense, and a $10 million judgment against the currentforeign -- defense minister of that state for exactly thesame policy?￼1011121314   difference in the operation of the suit.  We’re not15   saying that such an official should not be immune.  What16   we are saying is that the immunity derives from the17   common law immunity.  There’s a presumption against a18   statute invading the common law, and particularly a19   common law that was primarily shaped by the Executive.20               There should be a strong presumption against21   taking that flexibility away in the absence of a clear22   statement in the statute.  And as -- and -- if the -- if23   a -- if a suit should go to judgment like that, perhaps24   the state would indemnify the person.  But we are not25   saying that that person is not immune.  A question that53MR. KNEEDLER:  There -- there -- there is aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   sensitivities of -- of foreign official immunity.  This10   is -- this is a claim of foreign official immunity by a11   former official of a collapsed state in a -- in Somalia,12   as some of the briefs point out.  There has not been a13   functioning central government since 1991.  There are a14   number of factions.  On the ground in Somalia, thewas asked --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could we go back to thepractical --            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  To the -- and -- and I --I understand the practical problem that the districtcourt faced, and the district court was very patient.            I think it's important to appreciate,though, the -- the -- this case really illustrates the￼15   absence of a central government has led to foreign16   governments coming in and exercising influence, to17   domestic terrorist groups, and to piracy off the -- off18   the coast of Somalia.19               The request to the United States, to the20   State Department for its views, arose in that context.21   This very case at this moment arises in a context where22   things are fluid, and -- and there are circumstances in23   which the Executive Branch or sometimes even the24 court --2554JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's very nice.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   A few years ago, a Spanish magistrate allowed a lawsuit 2   to proceed, as I recall, against our Secretary of Defense. 3   And what you say is that that's perfectly okay.  It's up 4   to the Spanish government to assert that that suit 5   should not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly6 okay? 7               MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- such a suit would not 8   be perfectly okay in -- because, I mean, it would depend on 9   the circumstances.  But as was pointed out with respect10   to the suits against the two Israeli defense ministers,11   in that circumstance, the Israeli Government said,12   listen, these two officers were acting on behalf of --13   of the government when they carried -- that's the Dichter14   case and the -- and the case this Court had from the15   Second Circuit last term.16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I wonder -- I wonder17   if the example you give or the point you make, that18   there’s no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut19   the other way.20               Let's assume you have somebody who was21   acting in an official capacity, doing what his job22   required, whether you like it or not, and then there’s23   a change in the Somali government; and the United States24   likes the new Somali government.  That guy is kind of25   put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say55￼Alderson Reporting Companywhat he maintains is true, which was I was actingpursuant to official policy of the government.MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --Official 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the state, not for the individual.  The state can waive10   that immunity, and the state can determine whether, as11   happened in the Philippines case, that the -- that the12   actions being complained of were not -- were not within13   the official activity.14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I take it your answer15   to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment16   against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not17   covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  And if18   a state interprets international law to allow the suit,19   then it goes forward.20               MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  If -- if -- if one of21   our officials was sued in a foreign court, then we would22   expect the dynamic to play out as -- as I have23   described, where the United States would take the24   position, presumably that what was being done was within25   the scope of official conduct after investigation and56            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the UnitedStates is not going to give him the letter he needsbecause they like the new Somali government.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, under international lawthe -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of￼Alderson Reporting Company1   assert immunity, and expect that to be respected.  My2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9only point is that --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that just goes back tothe Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mailfrom the State Department to tell us what to do.            MR. KNEEDLER:  And the -- this --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought that was thewhole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign SovereignImmunities Act.22 23 24 25           Can you tell the Court, is this defendantamenable to suit or is there an immunity that wouldcover him?            MR. KNEEDLER:  We are not addressing that57Official￼101112131415161718192021   has said in effect:  We decide.            MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it was the purpose withrespect to foreign sovereigns, but there were goodreasons why the court did that, precisely becauseimmunity questions -- as I've said, this caseillustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or notto recognize would -- might favor one faction or anotherin the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler --MR. KNEEDLER:  And so the -- what --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is -- it's nowmany years, and we still don't -- the State DepartmentAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   here.  The court of appeals remanded for consideration 2   of common law head of state and other immunities. 3   Suggestions of immunity traditionally have been tendered 4   to the district court.  And the legislative history of 5   the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shows -- clearly 6   says that the official type immunities -- using the 7   word “official” immunity, head of state immunity, 8   diplomatic immunity, consular immunity -- those things 9   are not addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities10 Act.11               Section -- section 1602 shows that Congress12   wanted to take the Executive away because the government13   was being pressured by foreign governments with respect14   to the restrictive theory with respect to commercial15   activities.  And that's where the pressure was being16   applied, and the Executive Branch wanted to get out of17   that business, and agreed to.  If you read 1602, it18   specifically refers to commercial activities.19               There was no such conscious abrogation of20   the Executive's critical role to make immunity21   determinations on behalf of officials in the legislative22   history.  And this Court should not strain to read the23   rigid provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities24   Act, which were just not tailored to the immunities25   that the Underhill decision of this Court specifically said58￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9officials have immunity for their official actsexercising governmental authority.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Kneedler.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  There were a lot of longsentences in there --(Laughter.)            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Dvoretzky,because of that, we’ll give you 5 minutes.23 24 25-- whether it's under the FSIA or under a common lawtheory -- the identical question?            MR. DVORETZKY:  It is the same inquiry that59Official￼1011121314151617   challenged are those of the state.  That's a18   determination that courts can readily make and are19   accustomed to making.  By contrast --20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't that be the21   same question that you would ask invoking a common law22   protection like head of state or act of state?  Isn't itREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. DVORETZKY:  I’ll try to keep it short.            I’d like to make three points:  First ofall, when a suit is brought against a -- an official orformer official, the only question that a court willneed to answer under the FSIA is whether the actsAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   you would have asked under the common law in inquiring 2   whether the state's immunity extends to its officials. 3   What the FSIA did was it codified that rule, and it took 4   away Executive Branch discretion to deviate from it.  If 5   you look at the Solicitor -- 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that the very 7   point?  If the inquiry is the same under the FSIA and 8   under the common law, and we’re unsure what Congress 9   intended in the FSIA, because it certainly doesn't10   explicitly say it covers individual acts, shouldn't we11   defer to the Executive's decisionmaking in what is --12   has been, for centuries now, within its jurisdiction?13   Why should we take that power away when the inquiry14   would be the same under either doctrine?15               MR. DVORETZKY:  First of all, as we argue in16   our brief, this has not historically been a long-standing17   power of the Executive in the way that the immunity18   itself has been recognized under the common law.  And19   what Congress did in 1976 was it codified the substance20   of the common law but took away that procedure.  And21   this case demonstrates exactly why it's necessary to22   extend the FSIA to foreign officials in order to -- in23   order to make the FSIA mean anything at all, and in24   order to ensure the uniformity and predictability that25   Congress intended through the statute.60￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               If you look at the factors that the 2   Solicitor General proposes to take into account in this 3   case -- I’m looking at page 7 of the Solicitor 4   General's brief -- “Petitioner's residence in the United 5   States rather than Somalia, the nature of the acts 6   alleged,” the “invocation of a particular statutory right,” 7   the -- the state of the government in Somalia -- these 8   are factors that have no basis in the common law that 9   the FSIA codified.  No case has ever held that a foreign10   official or former official loses immunity for official11   acts on the basis of these sorts of factors.12   Moreover --13               JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't you say that if14   the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of15   the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that16   you’re complaining about, is subject to the orders of17   the foreign state, and the relief would affect the18   foreign state, you are suing the foreign state?19               But where he was a member of the foreign20   state, and you want money from him, even though what he21   did in the past was an act of a foreign state, this22   lawsuit is not affecting him in his capacity -- is not23   affecting the foreign state.  Indeed, there isn't even24   one.  So in the first set, he falls in the FSIA.  In the25   second set, he doesn't.  And you happen to have the61￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   second set, and, therefore, he may still be immune for 2   what he did in the past, but that would be a different3 docket. 4               MR. DVORETZKY:  All right. 5               JUSTICE BREYER:  That -- that's where this 6   is all leading me. 7               MR. DVORETZKY:  Because the Restatement -- 8   what the Restatement, which summarized the common laws as 9   of the time of the FSIA's enactment, says that an10   official is immune for his acts on behalf of a state if11   exercising jurisdiction would enforce a rule of law12   against the foreign state.  You enforce a rule of law￼1314151617181920   The Act is aimed at torturers.  The remedy comes out of21   the private pocket.  How does this establish -- if the22   thing plays out and the plaintiffs prevail, there23   will a remedy against an individual actor; there will be24   no relief awarded against any government.  How would it25   set a rule for the foreign government?62against a foreign state just as much by threatening tobankrupt an official as soon as he leaves office --           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does this case --MR. DVORETZKY:  -- as you do by issuing --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does this very caseestablish a rule of law for the foreign state?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               MR. DVORETZKY:  Because enforcing a judgment 2   against a foreign official, threatening to bankrupt the 3   person as soon as he or she leaves office, has just as 4   much effect on the state itself as -- as enforcing a 5   judgment directly against the state.  It will force 6   officials to conform their conduct on behalf of -- 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Never mind that this 8   person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia. 9   It will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on10   the government of Somalia?11               MR. DVORETZKY:  But the -- the rule that the12   government proposes, and the courts would presumably be13   left to apply on their own in the many cases like this14   one and the 9/11 litigation against the Saudis where the15   government doesn't weigh in, that rule does not draw16   those neat lines.17               Why, for example, would we know that a prime18   minister who comes to visit the United States has not19   spent enough time here in order to have his official20   immunity abrogated?21               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask just ask one22   quick question?  Am I correct in understanding that you￼23 24 25do not contend that your client was covered by1603(b)(1)?            MR. DVORETZKY:  1603(b)(1) is the agency --63Alderson Reporting Company23 24 25            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's kind of hard --I mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it-- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an64Official1234   alternative.  We think our principal argument is that --5               JUSTICE STEVENS:  The principal argument is6   not based on the text.  You do make that argument in the7   alternative then?8               MR. DVORETZKY:  We make that argument in the9   alternative.  Our principal argument is based --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  It defines an agency orinstrumentality of the --MR. DVORETZKY:  We do argue that in the￼1011121314151617181920   instrumentalities.  And an official, like an agency or21   instrumentality, is the means through which the state22   acts.  And, so, if the foreign state include --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  It’s interesting that nobodyhas talked about that section during the entire argument.            MR. DVORETZKY:  Our principal argument isbased on the text of 1604, which is that in -- thatsubjecting official acts --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  If they don't qualifyunder 1603(b)(1), it's kind of hard to get the statuteto apply to them at all.            MR. DVORETZKY:  I respectfully disagree,Your Honor, because 16 (b)(1) defines agencies orAlderson Reporting Company1   entity.  I mean, we usually don't think of individuals2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as being entities.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  And 1602 applies only toforeign states.            MR. DVORETZKY:  1602 applies to states, andour argument is that exercising jurisdiction over theofficial in the circumstances like these would beexercising jurisdiction over the state.            An entity, Your Honor, is not -- is notautomatically read to include a person, but it doesn'tpreclude persons, either, as the Ninth Circuit held inChuidian.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Counsel.           MR. DVORETZKY:  Thank you.           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)Official￼65Alderson
