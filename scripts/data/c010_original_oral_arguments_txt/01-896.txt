John B. McCauley.Mr. Waxman. The Court would appreciate hearing argument on, I'm sure, not just on the question presented in the petition for certiorari, but on the question posed in the supplemental briefing about whether there is appellate jurisdiction where a nominally prevailing party in the district court can -- can appeal, and also about whether the question of -- under 1447(d), if this was an order of remand, whether the -- the thing was appealable to the Ninth Circuit at all.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Perhaps with that observation, I would -- it would behoove me to address the quest -- the appellate jurisdiction of this Court first, as much as I would like to rush into why there clearly is subject matter jurisdiction in this case, regardless of whether the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are viewed as separate and distinct or common and then divide it.3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 So let me first address why I think the Ninth2 Circuit and this Court had appellate jurisdiction, and it3 is straightforward. That is, there is an appeal in this4 case from the dismissal with prejudice of a consolidated5 complaint which was filed voluntarily by the plaintiffs in6 this case seeking -- as against plaintiffs that are7 different than any -- than the constituent State court8 actions, including different plaintiffs seeking different9 causes of action and seeking a different form of relief,10 that is, specific performance of the Ford rebate program.11 And it is very clear, both from the cont -- the12 --the four corners of the consolidated complaint and from13 an express representation that my friend, Mr. Berman, made14 at the oral argument in the class certification stage,15 that the consolidated complaint was filed for the purpose16 of obtaining, in front of Judge Dwyer in the Northern Dis17 -- the Western District of Washington, a judgment on the18 merits in the case. That is, it was different than the19 treatment, the maximum treatment, that he would have been20 permitted to provide under the multi-district litigation21 panel's reference. That is --22 QUESTION: What's sort of unusual, though, is23 that you didn't suffer the dismissal. I mean, yes, a24 dismissal is -- is usually a final -- a final action, and25 it's usually the person whose suit was dismissed who4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 appeals --2 MR. WAXMAN: That is --3 QUESTION: -- not -- not the person who4 benefitted by the dismissal and that --56 is the --7 question,8 to in its9MR. WAXMAN: Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia, is the question I believe, the specificthat the Court directed the parties' attention request for supplemental briefs.Now, it is clear that a prevailing party10 normally cannot appeal, but the operative word that this11 Court has recognized, at least since the Electrical12 Fittings case, is normally. And this Court and the lower13 courts have applied a rather particular test to determine14 when normally doesn't apply, and that is, is the nominally15 prevailing party sufficiently aggrieved by a decision in16 its favor that it retains a, quote, stake in the appeal?17 And that's -- that test was articulated by this Court in18 Guaranty Trust v. Roper --19 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman.20 MR. WAXMAN: -- and in Forney v. Apfel.21 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, a defendant who removes a22 case and then is remanded is surely aggrieved but,23 nonetheless, cannot appeal. And the problem I have with24 an answer that you went by too fast for me is this case is25 in -- was in the Washington district court for pretrial5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 purposes only under 1407. The transfer from the several2 district courts to which these cases were initially3 removed -- that transfer under the statute was for4 pretrial purposes only, not for trial. And after the5 pretrial, under the statute, the cases, unless all the6 parties consent, would go back to the district courts from7 whence they came.8 So I don't understand how the Western District9 which is dealing with a complaint for pretrial purposes10 only -- I mean, the -- the request that a complaint --11 consolidated complaint be filed was for pretrial12 processing. How do you get from that an action that13 displaces all of the other actions that had been removed14 from the State court?15 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the appealability16 of the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated17 complaint does not depend on whether the consolidated18 complaint, quote, did away with the other actions. The19 reason -- we would, of course, readily concede that under20 1447(d), if all that had happened was a removal of the six21 State court actions, a transfer for pretrial purposes to a22 multi-district litigation court and a determination by23 that court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over24 the complaints, there would be no appeal because the25 remand of removed State court actions for lack of subject6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 matter jurisdiction, Congress has decided, is not a2 determination that may be reviewed by Federal appellate3 courts.4 But here -- and this, I think, is the salient5 point. Here, the judge did not require the plaintiffs'6 lawyers in the six cases to file some sort of concordance7 or a consolidating document that often is ordered so as to8 facilitate pretrial proceedings. What the judge said is9 if anybody wants to file a consolidated complaint, they10 may.11 The consolidated complaint that was filed in12 this case avowedly invoked this Court's 13 -- the Federal13 court's 1332 jurisdiction and sought not just pretrial14 consolidated proceedings on discovery and motions, they15 wanted a full trial or a full resolution on the merits.16 In other words, it's -- it's as if the judge,17 having had the six cases transferred, said expressly,18 look, I'm going to deal with all of the pretrial matters19 that are the subject of this transfer order, but if you20 all like me --21 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, may I stop you at that22 point? Because the pretrial consolidated -- the order --23 this is -- I'm looking at the appendix, page 35. It says,24 by order of the multi-district panel, the cases have been25 consolidated for pretrial purposes only.7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Now, you're saying that there is something --2 something that I don't see in the written orders that says3 they -- no, it's going to be now for trial purposes.4 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. I'm -- I'm not5 explaining myself correctly. The -- the order doesn't say6 these six removed cases are here for trial purposes, and7 if it did, it would exceed the court's authority under8 1407 and this Court's specific holding in Lexecon.9 On page 41 of the joint appendix, the court10 under a heading say -- entitled consolidated complaint11 says, should plaintiffs in all or some of the consolidated12 actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, you have13 to do so within a certain period of time.14 Now, that raises the question, since they did it15 voluntarily, whether what they were filing was something16 that, in essence, sort to -- as I said, to be a17 concordance, to consolidate in one document all of the18 various parties and all the various claims and all various19 theories so that a court can meaningful and --20 meaningfully and efficiency -- efficiently manage the21 pretrial proceedings.22 QUESTION: But ordinarily you wouldn't go -- go23 about it that way. You'd have a memorandum, not a24 consolidated complaint.25 MR. WAXMAN: That -- that's true, Mr. Chief8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Justice, although there are instances where the court --2 where the3 something45 salient differences. One is this complaint has different6 parties. It has different causes of action. It seeks a7 different type of relief. And at the motion -- and -- and8 it seeks quite clearly, based on the conduct of thetransferee court has ordered the filing of called a consolidated complaint.But here, there are two salient -- at least two9 parties and the representations, this is, in essence,10 saying thank you very much for having -- having us here11 for consolidated proceedings on our underlying state court12 actions, but we have decided we like you, Judge Dwyer, and13 we want you to try a case, and we're going to file a brand14 new Federal action that is docketed in the Western15 District.16 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, things like that,17 juris -- basic jurisdictional thing, agreeing -- this18 would be a consent to have a court that has no authority19 to adjudicate a case to adjudicate it. Usually such a20 major step is done not by inference, not by implication.21 This is saying, court, even though you have no authority22 under the Federal statutes to proceed without our consent,23 we are consenting, so go ahead. We're waiving any24 questions of venue or anything else.25 The fact that this is labeled consolidated9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 complaint is simply what the multi-district statute says.2 It says that the actions may be transferred for3 consolidated pretrial proceedings. So why couldn't this4 consolidated complaint be simply for pretrial proceedings,5 the only thing that the multi-district panel transferred6 the case to Western District of Washington for?7 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, it certainly8 could have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that9 is the most that it could have been.10 But in this case, that's not what it was. There11 are parties, claims, and requests for relief, and12 particularly the -- what is really the object of the13 litigation, the request for specific performance of the14 Ford rebate program --15 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you with16 a question? It seems to me you're, in effect, arguing17 that the Federal consolidated complaint was kind of a18 brand new lawsuit, and we forget about everything else19 that happened before.20 Now, if that were the case and you just had that21 complaint filed against you and you filed a motion to22 dismiss and you prevailed and they dismissed the23 complaint, it clearly would not be appealable. In order24 for you to find reasons to appeal, you got to go back and25 say, well, now we're going to have to face a lot of other10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 lawsuits.2 MR. WAXMAN: That -- I think your premise -- the3 premise of your question, Justice Stevens, with respect,4 is incorrect, which is if we had asked for a dismissal on5 subject matter jurisdiction grounds and prevailed -- that6 is, we would have --7 QUESTION: No. They asked for dismissal on8 subject matter jurisdiction. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.9 You're right. You're right.10 MR. WAXMAN: If we had asked for it, then we11 would have gotten all that we could possibly have12 expected. What we asked for -- what happened in this case13 was they voluntarily filed it. They asked for trial and14 judgment on the merits. The court sua sponte said, I15 don't think I have subject matter jurisdiction, and we16 have the right to appeal that because we are sufficiently17 aggrieved that we have a stake in the case. And the --18 QUESTION: Why did the district court say it had19 no subject matter? Because of the amount in controversy?20 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, because of the amount in21 controversy. It refused to apply -- it followed prior22 Ninth Circuit precedent and refused to apply the23 defendants' viewpoint in a class action seeking24 injunctive --25 QUESTION: Or you have a brand new --11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: You would not have been aggrieved --2 if -- if that was the only case pending and so -- and if3 it was dismissed, how would you have been aggrieved?4 MR. WAXMAN: We would have been aggrieved in the5 same way -- because what we sought was -- what we wanted6 was litigation in a single forum, in a forum which had7 already conducted substantial pretrial proceedings and a8 Federal forum. We sought judgment in our favor on the9 merits. What we -- which would have produced a dismissal10 or a judgment with prejudice. What we received, but did11 not ask for, was a result that permits the -- either these12 plaintiffs or anybody else in the country to continue this13 litigation in State court. And -- and their -- the lower14 courts in the cases that we've cited are --15 QUESTION: Do you -- do you argue that in just16 an ordinary case if a -- you file -- a defendant files a17 motion to dismiss both on the grounds of no cause of18 action and so forth and so on and also no jurisdiction,19 you win on no jurisdiction, you can appeal that?20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think, this Court's21 decision in Forney v. Apfel stands for that proposition.22 But it would -- this is an easier case because we did not23 seek to dismiss this for subject matter jurisdiction24 grounds. We wanted to be in Federal court. We were the25 ones who removed the underlying State court actions here.12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 As it turns out, they decided they wanted to be in Federal2 court too.3 But there are a long line of cases, and really4 an uninterrupted line of cases, in the lower courts that5 have interpreted this Court's jurisprudence in Forney and6 Guaranty Trust and Electrical Fittings to mean that where7 there is a dismissal on -- of State law claims, not on the8 merits, but for lack of jurisdiction, defendants are9 aggrieved 10in a practical sense. And we've discussed QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, I think the problem State court actions that haven't vanished.a -- is11 those six12 Nobody ever dismissed them. And as aggrieved as you13 -- and I agree that you're aggrieved -- you could not14 appeal from the remand. It seems to me these two, the15 dismissal of the consolidated complaint, the return of the16 actions from which this consolidation originated, that17 those two are inextricably tied together. And you would18 like to cut them off and say, Court, just look at the19 consolidated complaint. Forgot about those separate20 actions. Somehow they vanished.21 MR. WAXMAN: Not -- with respect, Justice22 Ginsburg, maybe I -- perhaps I'm not understanding you. I23 -- there's an interesting epistemological question in this24 case whether the underlying State court actions continue25 to exist or whether they had been, in fact, superseded but13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005are￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the--QUESTION: Let -- let me ask you about one solution to the epistemological question. Let's assume -- let's assume that on the remand the State courts think they are still alive. Are you going to the State courts, let's try them now? Hear us immediately. We want a trial.MR. WAXMAN: You mean --QUESTION: You're not going to do that. What you're going to say is, defer any action here, if you win on this -- on your point here. You're going to say, defer any action so we can try the Federal case.MR. WAXMAN: Well --QUESTION: And -- and that it seems to me, unless I am missing the point of what you are necessarily going to do, it follows that -- that the -- that the Federal case is, in fact, simply the alter ego of the State cases, and if you win here, you are functionally doing nothing but eliminating subsection (d).MR. WAXMAN: I -- with respect, Justice Souter, if -- there are plaintiffs in two of the State cases who are not even named plaintiffs in the Federal case. There are defendants. There is a defendant.QUESTION: Are they within the class?MR. WAXMAN: Well, the -- all of the cases seek14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a nationwide class.QUESTION: Sure, and don't you think those non-named plaintiffs would be happy to let somebody else carry the ball for them in -- in the Federal action?MR. WAXMAN: Well --QUESTION: They're -- they're not going to fightyou when you say to the State courts, just let them here until we get the Federal case taken care of.sitMR. WAXMAN: There are -- I'll go to doortwo. There are claims. There are causes of action underlying State cases that are not included in the consolidated complaint and vice versa. In short, the -- the -- from a case management perspective, whether both a Federal case and a State case that are both in existence can go forward simultaneously or whether one should follow the other is something that happens all the time, and it has never been understood to divest one court or the other of jurisdiction. And our submission here is that we have something that is distinctly new. It was --QUESTION: The consolidated complaint?MR. WAXMAN: Yes.QUESTION: No, but I mean, you -- but our pointis if functionally you are going to treat this as the alt -- the equivalent, the alternative to all of these State actions -- and you have told me nothing to suggest that15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005number in the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you're not going to do that -- then it seems to me that the -- the -- the argument has got to prevail that functionally this in -- in fact is nothing but an end run around the non-appealability of the remand.MR. WAXMAN: Well, in point of fact, Justice Souter, if this Court reverses the Ninth Circuit for the -- for -- for one of the two errors of law that it committed, and on remand, the conclusion is made thatthere is subject matter jurisdiction and the case proceed, we will be in precisely the same posture were in at the time that the plaintiffs filed the consolidated complaint.QUESTION: No, because at that time the the -- the State cases had been remanded.can that we--MR. WAXMAN: And -- well, the State cases have not yet been remanded, but if the State --QUESTION: I -- I mean -- I'm sorry. They had been -- they had been removed. I misspoke.MR. WAXMAN: They had been removed. QUESTION: They had been removed.MR. WAXMAN: And they will remain removed ifthis -- if a Federal court concludes that there is subject matter jurisdiction.QUESTION: I thought that the order of the Western District of Washington was that the State cases16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are remanded.QUESTION: That's what I thought.QUESTION: And that the Ninth Circuit did not touch that, that the Ninth Circuit dealt only with the consolidated complaint.MR. WAXMAN: There is a single order in the case that says there is no jurisdiction. And it's in the -- in the joint appendix. There is no subject matter jurisdiction over the consolidated complaint or over the six removed actions. And therefore, the consolidated complaint is dismissed, and the clerk is directed to remand the underlying State actions back to the States. Now, that order was stayed by the Ninth Circuit at our request pending the outcome of this case. That is, if --QUESTION: Well, but stayed by the Ninth Circuit prior to argument there?MR. WAXMAN: No. After -- yes, it was stayed prior to argument there and --QUESTION: Well, didn't that stay expire with the decision of the court of appeals?MR. WAXMAN: It would have except that we moved for a stay of the mandate. The mandate issued before the court ruled on it, and the court then recalled the mandate and directed that the remand of the underlying State actions not proceed until this Court -- at least until17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 this Court -- has resolved the question. But2 ultimately --3 QUESTION: But I still think -- I still think4 you're in trouble because even if we accept your -- your5 reading of what the -- the court ordered and what it's6 likely to do if you prevail here, it simply changes the7 characterization of what's going on. You're -- you're8 saying that the -- that if the -- if the consolidated case9 stays in the Federal court, it does not die, and in fact,10 because of that, there is no remand. Then it simply11 follows that the consolidated course is a trump to the12 remand and you're excluding the operation of subsection13 (d) in a slightly different way.14 MR. WAXMAN: Not true, Justice Souter, for two15 reasons. I'll give the broader one first.16 If we had filed as all parties in the case and17 the Solicitor General as well agree is the complete18 functional equivalent of the consolidated complaint -- if19 Ford and Citi had filed a declaratory judgment action in20 Federal court, even after the State cases had been filed,21 before or after they had been removed, and we asked for a22 declaration that we can terminate the Ford rebate program,23 there would be no question that --24 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, give me an example of any25 case in which a defendant in a product liability suit, in18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 a credit suit like this one, a defendant has said I want2 to preempt the class action and so I am going to bring3 this declaratory suit against all the credit card holders4 of this plan all over America in the forum that I choose,5 and that's going to be where the class action is going to6 proceed. Can you give me any precedent for a defendant7 being able to take over what would have ordinarily been8 the plaintiff's product liability claim, credit card9 claim? I -- I don't know of any such case where a10 defendant has been allowed to make such a case its show11 rather than the plaintiff's show.12 MR. WAXMAN: I -- as I'm standing here, Justice13 Ginsburg, I -- I can't bring any cases to mind. I'll --14 I'll -- I'll -- I'll try and bring one to mind prior to my15 rebuttal.16 But I don't understand what the objection would17 be if, before terminating the program, we said, we're18 going to terminate this program --￼192021 that -- 2223 potential24 a lawsuit25 choice ofQUESTION: Because you have --MR. WAXMAN: -- and we want a declarationQUESTION: Because, Mr. Waxman, you have plaintiffs from all over the country. Normally is begun by a plaintiff and the plaintiff's forum is respected. Here you are saying a19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 defendant, not dealing with one plaintiff, but dealing2 with hundreds, maybe thousands -- I don't know how many3 credit card holders there are -- across the country can4 start the lawsuit and a Federal court would listen to5 that, would, at the defendant's urging, somehow certify6 the plaintiff class. I don't know of any such action. I7 don't know of any district judge who has done that at the8 urging of a defendant.9 MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we were10 to have filed such a case -- and my submission is it would11 be the functional equivalent of a consolidated complaint12 -- it would not disempower plaintiffs or plaintiffs'13 representatives from filing their own class actions in14 State or Federal court. And if that were the case, there15 would then -- there would be -- thereafter be a16 determination made by the courts involved --17 QUESTION: Well, in any case you said it --18 MR. WAXMAN: -- as to whether it makes sense --19 QUESTION: It doesn't occur to you that there is20 such a case, but --21 MR. WAXMAN: I am -- I am sure that there are22 many such cases. I can't cite you one as I'm standing23 here.24 QUESTION: Where defendant starts the action as25 a declaratory action and a class gets certified on the20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 plaintiff's side.to mindof forward10 the Alabama case where there's no Alabama plaintiff here,11 they have not only not sought specific performance, they12 have disavowed any specific performance and brought13 separate claims on different theories. Since they haven't14 sought specific performance, there is no subject matter15 jurisdiction over the claim because we are -- and this16 Court basing subject matter jurisdiction on the cost of17 providing that performance -- the Alabama case can and18 presumably will go forward.19 QUESTION: Will it go forward without your20 objection? Are you representing that -- that you will21 walk into the Alabama court and say, sure, we're ready to22 go ahead?23 MR. WAXMAN: Under this -- yes. Under this24 Court's -- under the Court's current jurisprudence, yes,25 we would. The only -- it would only be if this Court were21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. I -- I know that and the red brief and the Solicitor's General23 our brief4 brief all5 the cases.6 But just to get back to Justice Souter's7 question again, let me give you the ex -- in terms8 whether, if we proceed here, a State case could go9 and -- and would go forward, If you take, for example,address this scenario, but I can't bring￼1 to resolve the question it left open in Free v. Abbott2 Labs that we would then have some argument, or that the3 Court determined that punitive damages could be4 accumulated. But since they aren't asking for a specific5 performance -- and neither, by the way, are I think four6 other of the six cases. Since they're not asking for a7 specific performance, we don't have an argument under this8 Court's existing case law for keeping the cases there.9 And they could --10 QUESTION: How many -- how many -- I'm sorry,11 but how many other cases like the Alabama case are there?12 In other words, you -- you say, okay, we'll litigate in13 Alabama. Any others?14 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't know that I have the15 -- all of the details of the underlying cases in mind.16 But if they are simply a claim for damages and punitive17 damages in which the amount in controversy is not $75,000,18 and they aren't asking for specific performance, I don't19 think, consistent with the law of this case, we would have20 any basis for objecting to them going forward.21 QUESTION: They all ask for compensation. There22 are none of them that ask just for specific performance,23 and -- and even in this consolidated complaint, the first24 thing that they ask for is compensatory damages.25 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's -- it is clear, Justice22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Ginsburg -- and if it isn't clear from the complaint, it2 is utterly clear from the -- from the plaintiffs' red3 brief in this case at page 45 that what they -- the object4 of this litigation is reinstatement of the national Ford5 credit rebate program under which they can earn credits6 toward the purchase of a Ford vehicle.7 They -- they're -- they don't -- none of these8 plaintiffs have a liquidated claim for damages because9 they're not asking that they be paid rebates that they10 earned and weren't paid. Those were credited to them.11 They are all asking for reinstatement of a program, which12 doesn't exist, that will allow them to earn credits, based13 on purchases, toward the purchase of a vehicle.14 And on the -- on the question of subject matter15 jurisdiction, the court below made two errors of law.16 First, it held incorrectly that class actions joining17 separate and distinct claims for injunctive relief cannot18 be viewed from the defendants' -- cannot be valued from19 the defendants' viewpoint. And secondly, it erred in20 concluding that the plaintiffs' interest in specific21 performance cannot be viewed as common and undivided.22 And if the Court has no questions at this time,23 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time and perhaps24 address the merits on rebuttal.25 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman.23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Mr. Berman, we'll hear from you.2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE W. BERMAN3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS4 MR. BERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it5 please the Court:6 I will turn to the question that's taken the7 balance of the argument so far and that is whether this8 Court has jurisdiction. And I do so with the same9 reluctance that Mr. Waxman did because the underlying10 question is an important question that has troubled courts11 dealing with class actions for some time now.12 But despite the fact that I'd like the Court to13 answer that question, I don't think there was jurisdiction14 on appeal or -- or before this Court because it's quite15 clear that no matter how you artfully look at this, this16 is a simple situation that's subject to 1407(c) and (d)17 which this Court has said commands -- and that's in the18 Grauded case -- unmistakably commands that where there is19 a remand, based on the lack of subject matter20 jurisdiction, that that's not reviewable.￼2122 who filed23 District,24 25QUESTION: I -- it was your clients, Mr. Berman, the consolidated complaint in the WesternI take it.MR. BERMAN: That's correct, Your Honor. QUESTION: And who was it that moved to dismiss24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 that complaint?2 MR. BERMAN: No one moved to dismiss that3 complaint. The court, after consideration of class4 certification, wrestling with -- I think with the laws of5 the various different States that were invoked by that6 motion, said to us, I'm issuing an order to show cause why7 I shouldn't, on my own motion, dismiss this case for lack8 of jurisdiction.9 QUESTION: And did he -- on the subject matter10 ground that there's not -- not $75,000 in controversy?MR. BERMAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. QUESTION: Thank you.MR. BERMAN: And then we briefed that issue and dismissed the case in response to the briefing11 12 1314 the judge15 on the order to show cause.16 QUESTION: And that was before there was any17 certification. You didn't get up to any certification of18 any class, did you?￼MR. BERMAN: Justice Ginsburg, that was -- the yes. It was before. We were in the midst of certification hearings. We had two or three1920 answer is21 the class22 hearings.23 said earlier, that in the process of wrestling with the24 various State laws, the district court scratched his head25 and said, why is this case before me?No class had been certified, and I think, as I25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: Now, as I understand Mr. Waxman's2 position, it is that the consolidated complaint is a new3 Federal action. To be sure, the effect of the district4 court's order being appealed here and being reversed may5 affect -- may control the remand of the cases that were6 being held. But this action must be looked at on its own7 as a Federal action. True, one of the proximate causes of8 our retaining the action by saying that there is9 jurisdiction may defer the remand of those other cases.10 True, that looks like something of an end around the no11 appealability for remand, which is the express command of12 the Congress. But we have here a separate case and we13 have to look just at that separate case.14 Number one, am I understanding his argument15 correctly? And number two, what is your response?16 MR. BERMAN: I think you are understanding his17 argument correctly, but I submit that he's incorrect.18 It's not a new case. As one of the Justices pointed out,19 there's no authority under the MDL rules for us to just20 say this is a whole new case.21 QUESTION: Well, who filed the -- the22 consolidated complaint? Your -- presumably you did.￼2324 Judge -- 25MR. BERMAN: I did, Your Honor, and if you read QUESTION: And it had different parties and26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 different complaints than -- than the separate State2 actions.3 MR. BERMAN: That's correct.4 QUESTION: Why did you file that consolidated5 complaint in that fashion? It was before the district6 court as part of a pretrial situation in a multi-court7 jurisdiction problem.8 MR. BERMAN:It is not uncommon in MDL practice to try to organize the pleadings for a consolidated complaint. In fact, any MDL case I handle --9 for pretrial purposes10 the district judge in11 I -- I can't think of12 QUESTION: But didn't it do more than just13 organize the pleadings? Didn't it change parties and14 causes of action and look like a whole new ball of wax?15 MR. BERMAN: Well, there were some16 representative changes because after all the lawyers17 across the country got together for the first time,18 because we were thrown together, some of those lawyers19 said, if you're going to move for class certification of a20 nationwide class in one of these State court cases, maybe21 my representative doesn't need to be there because there's22 five other representatives. So for consolidation purposes23 and for organizational purposes, we streamline and we try24 to be as organized as we can. That doesn't mean we've25 abandoned the cases underlying below. We -- we did not.27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: It's not a question of abandonment.2 It's a question of which one takes precedence. There's3 now a Federal case which Mr. Waxman's argument is takes4 precedent. We just hold everything else until this one is5 done.6 MR. BERMAN: Well, there's a Federal case for7 pretrial purposes, and the judge, Judge Dwyer of the lower8 court, found he had no jurisdiction anymore over that case9 which is proceeding in Federal court. But it's a10 diversity case asserting State law claims. So it's not,11 quote, a Federal case. It's been removed, and once a12 court determines that there's no jurisdiction, it's no13 longer a Federal case.14 QUESTION: Mr. Berman, Mr. Waxman points out15 that you have submitted an entire complaint. It doesn't16 look like a pretrial-only complaint. It's a -- it's a17 complete complaint that has a prayer for relief. So it18 looks like a different action. And he said by filing such19 a complaint, you in effect waived any objection to the --20 to the multi-district forum going on to dispose of the21 whole case, not just pretrial.22 MR. BERMAN: Well, to answer that, Justice23 Ginsburg, the pretrial order that Mr. Waxman cited to and24 I think that you cited to as well said that the25 consolidated complaint was to be filed for pretrial28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425purposes only. There was no waiver in the record that we filed. The judge didn't order that we submit such a waiver. And I don't know that I have the authority as a lawyer to alter the MDL rules. The MDL rules don't provide that I can decide on my own that the case will proceed for all purposes forever in front of Judge Dwyer.And -- and yes, the complaint --QUESTION: Where does it say that? For pretrial purposes only.MR. BERMAN: It's in the --QUESTION: I mean, the judge says on page 41, should plaintiffs in all or some actions decide to file a consolidated complaint, that complaint shall be filed within 15 days. And then the complaint itself doesn't say it's for pretrial purposes only.MR. BERMAN: No, it does not, Your Honor, and the judge didn't mandate that we do it. He said, should you.QUESTION: But in Lexecon, we said that the judge who -- to whom it was referred for pretrial -- couldn't try the case unless both parties consented, didn't we?MR. BERMAN: Yes, you did. And there's -- there's nothing in this record other than the complaint. If you read from the complaint consent, that's the only29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 thing in the record that you could draw that we consented2 to Judge Dwyer trying this case for all purposes.3 QUESTION: Could -- could you come back to my4 question? Where -- you -- you say that the complaint was5 only filed for pretrial purposes. On -- on what do you6 base that?7 MR. BERMAN: I base that on my understanding of8 MDL practice. I mean, we didn't say we're filing this for9 trial purposes. We didn't say we're filing it for10 pretrial purposes.11 QUESTION: You filed a complaint. I mean, you12 file a complaint --13 MR. BERMAN: In MDL practice, I submit, Justice14 Scalia, that you do file a complaint of some form that15 brings all these plaintiffs from all over the country16 together. I can't think of an -- an MDL case, whether it17 Brand Name Prescription Drugs or the various cases that18 are pending involving the pharmaceutical industry, for19 example, where a consolidated complaint of -- of removed20 State court cases is not put together in some fashion.21 QUESTION: That's true, but does it normally --22 is it normally just look like an ord -- your complaint23 looks like an ordinary complaint. It names four people.24 It says we're bringing a case. It's diversity25 jurisdiction. It's quite clear, I think, there's venue.30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And -- and that's it. It looks like a normal complaint. So is it ordinary MDL practice that what happenswhen you transfer things for pretrial proceedings, the lawyers get together and file what to the naked eye looks exactly like a normal complaint, as if they marched into Federal court on day one and filed a complaint? Is that normal MDL practice?MR. BERMAN: I think it is very typical -- QUESTION: How do I verify that?MR. BERMAN: I could submit my supplementalrecord --QUESTION: No, no. Not your -- I mean, is theresome--IguessIcouldlookitupinabookonMDL practice.Now, on MDL practice, when you finish, as the rules, it says the transferee judge can reach a judgment. But if he doesn't get to a judgment that finishes the case, he's supposed to send it back to transferor districts, not the State court, but backI readthe￼severalboth by stayed.to transferor districts. Is that what happened here?MR. BERMAN: It never got there because -- QUESTION: Why?MR. BERMAN: -- that -- the order of remand,the district judge and the Ninth Circuit, was31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

BERMAN: Actually I think the language of is that the cases are remanded back to the StateQUESTION: To the State courts.MR. BERMAN: Yes.QUESTION: That must be wrong, mustn't it? MR. BERMAN: That's correct.QUESTION: It should go to the transferordistricts.MR. BERMAN: That's correct.QUESTION: And there also -- it says specifically and that is pursuant to the MDL order, which we can review, can we not?MR. BERMAN: Yes, you can.QUESTION: Okay. So we would have the power in this case to review what should have been the Ninth Circuit's order remanding the case to the transferor districts, even though they said it wrong.￼MR. BERMAN: If under that scenario --QUESTION: Yes. MR. BERMAN: --you -- if you took jurisdictionin all due respect, you would be32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

BERMAN: -- of 1407.QUESTION: Not at all. Not at all. If, after all, an order of the MDL panel were to have an underlying theory that there wasn't jurisdiction in some court or other under 1447, I don't see why we couldn't by writ, as provided, review it. And our reason for doing it would be to solve an important and serious problem of jurisdiction that is plaguing the lower courts. In other words --QUESTION: Mr. Berman, you don't want us to review an order that never existed, do you?MR. BERMAN: I'm not sure --QUESTION: You wouldn't want us to -- to review an order that should have issued but didn't issue. How could we review an order that never issued?QUESTION: No, it did issue.MR. BERMAN: There was -- there was an erroneous order of the district court. And -- and I submit that --QUESTION: I think we can review -- the -- the erroneous order is nonreviewable.MR. BERMAN: That's correct.QUESTION: No. There is an order dismissing.

BERMAN: That is -- that is not what hemeant.QUESTION: All right. That is a problem. I see that as a problem, but I don't know if it's an insuperable problem --(Laughter.)MR. BERMAN: And the problem I have, Justice Breyer, is that I would like to agree with your argument because, as you pointed out, this is something that's plaguing the courts.QUESTION: All right. The way it would have worked if they had gotten -- hadn't said remand to State courts, is they would have sent it back to transferor districts. Some transferor districts would have agreed with this judge, some would have come to other conclusions, and we plainly could have reviewed the ones that came to other conclusions so we could have decided the issue. So is that what you think should happen? What should happen?MR. BERMAN: Well, I would like the Court to review the underlying merits, but to do so, I think you have to do some gamesmanship and do injustice to 1407.QUESTION: Isn't, Mr. Berman, what --34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Justice Breyer told you that -- said2 that it would have to go back to the State courts. But3 the question is what is the it. You have to first dispose4 of the action that was instituted by the consolidated5 complaint.6 MR. BERMAN: That was disposed of.7 QUESTION: But that's the only thing we're8 arguing about here, and the arg -- and the contention is9 it was improperly disposed of and that it was disposed of10 on a basis that injures the defendants and that they can11 appeal that because they're aggrieved under the cases that12 Mr. Waxman cites. And that's all we're talking about.13 MR. BERMAN: And I understand that, Justice14 Kennedy, but the case that Mr. Waxman cites and the cases15 he cites for the proposition that an aggrieved party can16 appeal, I don't quarrel with that.17 The problem with that authority in this case is18 that none of those cases that he cites are cases where19 there's been a dismissal, which there was in this case, of20 the consolidated complaint on the grounds of a lack of21 subject matter jurisdiction. And --22 QUESTION: Mr. Berman, I think something needs23 clarification here. When a district judge in a multi-24 district case like this makes a pretrial order,25 determination, decision, and on the basis of that, those35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 cases go back to the district courts from whence they2 came, that ruling is not up for grabs in the individual3 district courts. That is the law of the case that they4 all must follow. And as I understand the Western District5 of Washington decision, that there was no subject matter6 jurisdiction, that would not be open for contest in the7 district courts.8 MR. BERMAN: I -- I agree with that. It would9 go to the district courts pursuant to proper MDL practice.10 We would move for enforcement of the judge's order11 remanding the case, but we couldn't fight that issue of12 subject matter jurisdiction because it would have been13 decided --14 QUESTION: Okay. So -- so that if that had15 happened -- going back to an answer you gave earlier, if16 that had happened, and -- and the -- the missing step had17 been included and it said, back to the transferor court,18 the only thing that could have happened with the19 transferor court, the jurisdictional issue having been20 decided in the Western District of Washington, would be to21 remand.22 23 24 2536Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼MR. BERMAN: That's correct.QUESTION: Yeah, okay.MR. BERMAN: And -- and because of that -- QUESTION: May -- may I ask? Mr. Waxman pointed1 out to us that this order was actually stayed by the2 district court and by the Ninth Circuit, and I don't find3 the stay order in the appendix. I'm sure it's in the4 record, as he points out. But in connection with getting5 that stay and the -- the both -- in both the district6 court and the court of appeals, did anyone point out to7 either of those courts that the order was defective for --8 for failing to -- to include the transferor court rather9 than going direct to the State court?10 MR. BERMAN: No.11 QUESTION: So that just surfaced today.12 MR. BERMAN: It just surfaced today. And -- and13 the jurisdictional issue just surfaced in response to your14 question. No one raised the 1407 issue in any of the15 courts below.I had originally had come to talk about the issue.(Laughter.)MR. BERMAN: And I -- I don't know that Mr. -- QUESTION: Us too.1617 important 181920212223 address that issue. I don't know if the Court wants me to24 go into that. I have some time remaining.25 QUESTION: I think the Court would like to.￼(Laughter.)MR. BERMAN: Mr. Waxman hasn't had time to37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000512 since the3 construed4 the Federal caseload. That's the teaching of Snyder v.5 Harris. The proposition that's asserted here today by the6 petitioners that you can use administrative costs in7 satisfying the amount in controversy would vastly expand8 the Federal caseload in two ways.9 QUESTION: Is your objection just to the concept10 of administrative costs, Mr. Berman, or to the idea that11 it can be compute -- the amount in controversy can be12 computed at all from the defendants' point of view?13 MR. BERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to14 that is I think that the Court could adopt a rule allowing15 the amount in controversy to be determined from either16 viewpoint, both from the plaintiffs' viewpoint or from the17 defendants' viewpoint. But that doesn't answer the18 question.19 The -- the question really presented then is how20 do we value that amount. And this Court's teachings I21 think have answered that question, and that is in the Hunt22 case, the Court has ruled and has consistently followed23 this proposition, that it is well established that the24 amount in controversy is measured by the value of the25 object of the litigation. And so, another way the Court38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. BERMAN: Very briefly then. This Court has, Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, consistently diversity jurisdiction so as to avoid expanding￼1 has put it is what right does the plaintiff seek to have2 enforced here. The --3 QUESTION: In a -- in a couple of those quotes,4 you know, taken out of context, they seem to support your5 position. They certainly don't controvert your position.6 But the Court wasn't really faced with the issue here.7 MR. BERMAN: I -- I think the Court has never8 squarely been faced with the issue of should the9 plaintiff's rule be adopted or not. There is suggestions10 that it should be, but I think what the Court has been11 consistent on is looking at the value of the object of12 litigation from the point of view, what is it that the13 plaintiff wants, not what are the incidental costs to the14 defendant. In fact, there is a case -- and I -- I know15 it's an old case, but the Ross case and the Elliott case16 squarely hold that jurisdiction does not depend upon any17 contingent injuries or damage to a defendant in a case.18 And if the rule is otherwise -- and by the way,19 I think there's a big difference, for the purposes of this20 Court's review, of an administrative cost versus21 injunctive relief. So let me first focus on22 administrative cost.23 The mischief, I think, of allowing24 administrative cost to be considered is illustrated by an25 earlier Ninth Circuit decision in Snow v. Ford. And there39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the plaintiff sought an injunction because Ford had sold a2 trailer package without an $11 wiring kit. And Ford3 argued then, as it does now, that because it would have to4 incur substantial costs in supplying this $11 kit, that5 there was Federal jurisdiction.6 Well, the value of the object of litigation from7 the plaintiffs' point of view, if you can't aggregate,8 which under Snyder v. Harris you can't, is $11. If the9 Court is going to allow administrative cost to be10 considered, then this Court is going to have hundreds --11 Federal courts are going to have hundreds of $11 cases in12 front of them.13 And I think Judge Posner hit the nail right on14 the head in the Brand Name Prescription Drug case,15 which he said that if the costs of compliance were16 considered, then every case, virtually every case,17 however trivial would cross the threshold.inquote,￼in fact 19 it really does cost the defendant the $75,000, however you18 QUESTION: Why shouldn't they have it if20 categorize it? Why shouldn't the Federal courts hear21 those cases?22 MR. BERMAN: Because consistently this Court has23 looked at the value of the right to be protected and24 excluded such incidental costs. The value of the right25 there --40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: There might be a legal argument there, but I thought you were making a policy argument that it was a bad thing.MR. BERMAN: Well, I do -- I do --QUESTION: And I don't see why that's so if in fact in most cases I think that if it's going to cost $75,000 for an $11 claim, if it's really just one claim, the defendant will settle it. And, of course, if it's not really just one claim, but really involves class actions involving many hundreds of claims, that's just what's supposed to be in the Federal court.MR. BERMAN: Well, then you'd have to overrule Snyder and the non-aggregation --QUESTION: There's a legal -- you're making a purely legal argument then.MR. BERMAN: Yes, which -- which they're not advocating. But from a policy argument, my argument is that you would suddenly thrust the Federal courts in determination of what basically are State -- routine State law matters.QUESTION: But that's what -- that's what this Class Action Fairness Act, which has considerable support, that's pending in Congress -- it's still pending, isn't it?MR. BERMAN: That's correct.41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: That's what it would do. It would2 allow -- if -- if the price tag of all these small claims3 for the defendant was more than the amount in controversy4 -- well, I think it puts a much higher price tag than5 $75,000. But anyway, that -- that's the idea of the class6 action bill that's pending in Congress, to put all these7 cases, to aggregate them if the total dollar amount for8 the defendant is very high.9 MR. BERMAN: That's correct. That -- it's $210 million, the new proposed limit, and it would allow11 aggregation, which this Court so far has not allowed. So12 Congress realizes under existing precedent that what the13 -- Ford wants to do here is not permitted.14 QUESTION: Well, is -- is -- is there a -- is15 there a distinction to be made along these lines? And I16 -- I may not be able to -- to state what I'm trying to17 work out in my mind, but here -- here's -- here's the18 distinction I'm trying to -- to get at.19 Let's assume that the -- that the only issue is20 -- is an issue in one case. They didn't give the $1121 taillight or whatever it was. And because of the22 bureaucracy of a big company, in order to provide the one23 $11 tail light, it's going to cost $100,000 to galvanize24 everybody into action and get the tail light. I see your25 argument in that case.42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 There's a difference, though, in this case2 because what they're saying in this case is they promised3 that they would have a kind of administrative system in4 place that would take account of all these various credit5 charge card -- credit card charges and -- and would --6 would ultimately result in -- in this -- this credit of up7 to $3,500 for our benefit. The various people who are8 aggrieved by their failure to do it aren't all claiming9 $3,500. You know, they may be claiming everything from $510 to $3,500. The only way to satisfy our -- our -- the11 claims of all these people who are in the class is to put12 the system in place.13 If that's the essence of their claim, they're14 not saying we want you to incur a lot of administrative15 costs in order to get to a particular result, which is16 jurisdictionally insufficient. They're saying, we want17 you to put the system in the place -- in place that you18 agreed you would do. The system is not an administrative19 cost. It's what you promised in the first place. The20 system is the tail light.21 Is that a fair distinction, and does -- does22 that count against you?23 MR. BERMAN: That's their argument, and I don't24 think it counts against my position for two reasons. In25 order to make that argument, what they're really doing is43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425aggregating what it would cost to reinstitute the system as if they were going to pay all 6 million class --QUESTION: But the system is not an aggregated system. There's either a system or there isn't a system. If there is a system, it produces different results depending on the kind of business that individuals do. But the system is not a separate system for all of the members of the class which is being aggregated. It's a system to fulfill one promise which was made in common form to the entire class. And isn't that a distinction which removes it from this notion simply of administrative cost?MR. BERMAN: No, because right now there are just six plaintiffs. This is not a class. And those six plaintiffs may have a total of $20,000 at stake. All Ford has to do to satisfy their claim in this case is to give those six people the rebates.￼QUESTION: Okay.MR. BERMAN: And is to aggregate this case,the danger --QUESTION: Therethe only way to get around that which they can't do. And sois -- there is no claim forspecific performance?MR. BERMAN: There is as to each plaintiff. QUESTION: But not as to a class.44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 MR. BERMAN: That's right, because what we have2 here and the --3 QUESTION: So they -- so they could multiply4 3,500 by 6 and that would be the end of the case.5 MR. BERMAN: That's right, because prior to this6 litigation -- this gets to the common and undivided7 interest. Prior to this litigation, these plaintiffs,8 these 6 million people, were completely unrelated. They9 had no common interest in this issue, and therefore, you10 can't follow -- you can't aggregate. They have to be11 treated --12 QUESTION: Let me ask you a philosophical13 question. Mr. Waxman got into epistemology a minute ago.14 Let me ask you a contrary-to-fact question.15 If in fact the Federal action were a class16 action and it included everybody who had been included in17 the State class actions and specific performance had been18 requested in the form that I suggested, would that not19 take it out of the aggregation problem and -- and --20 and -- and satisfy the jurisdictional amount, even on your21 own theory?22 MR. BERMAN: No, because under the analysis of23 -- of this Court and the Gilman court in the Second24 Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, again because each person25 had a separate right, as they've admitted. They've45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425admitted that for damage purposes each person had a separate and distinct claim.QUESTION: Yeah, but that's not the same as for specific performance purposes.MR.BERMAN: Itis. If--ifI--ifoneofmy plaintiffs decides he no longer wants to be in this litigation, they have don't have to up the specific performance to someone else. Each person only has the right to the rebates they were entitled to. So they're separate and distinct no matter what the relief is.QUESTION: Were these class actions -- were these actions certified as class actions in the State court before they were removed?MR. BERMAN: No. They -- they were removed before anything happened.QUESTION: So we have -- you need the aggregation of the class action.MR. BERMAN: That's correct. You have an -- you have an uncertified class here.The other danger I'll touch on in my last minute of allowing the injunctive -- amount it would cost the defendant, either by way of injunction or administrative cost, is that plaintiffs could use this new theory to invoke Federal court jurisdiction. The amicus seem to suggest that plaintiffs never want to be in Federal court.46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 That's not correct. If you adopt the petitioners' rule,2 anytime I have a case where I want to be in Federal court,3 where I normally could not be in Federal court -- and I4 have many such cases right now -- I would just simply have5 to say in my prayer for relief that the -- the injunction6 would cost the defendant more than $75,000. And bingo, I7 have a whole new rule and there's a whole new group of8 Federal cases that suddenly would arise.9 So in closing, unless there's any questions, the10 problem with the defendants' -- the petitioners' position11 in this case is that it would open up the flood gates of12 litigation to the Federal court system. We cited a RAND13 Institute study that about 65 percent of the country's14 class actions are in State courts, and to adopt their rule15 would mean that many of those, probably thousands of16 cases, that are now residing in State courts would17 suddenly find their way into Federal courts. That I think18 is not consistent with this Court's policy of strictly19 construing the diversity statute and giving deference to20 State courts and State governments with respect to laws21 that they have the power to enact and to have those cases22 heard in State courts.23 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.24 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Berman.25 Mr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS3 MR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. I'll use 14 minute on appellate jurisdiction and I hope 2 minutes on5 subject matter jurisdiction.6 On appellate jurisdiction, there is no doubt7 whatsoever that what was intended here was a new complaint8 about new things to proceed to judgment at trial. At page9 11 of the transcript of oral argument before the district10 judge on the class certification issue, the court says,11 "if a nationwide class were to be certified" -- he's12 talking about the consolidated complaint -- "would there13 be any need for further MDL proceedings, or would the14 whole litigation just be there in this one case for trial15 or other disposition?16 "Mr. Berman: That is my understanding. There17 would be no further -- everyone has consented. All the18 plaintiffs' counsel and defendants have consented to have19 this case here."20 Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question21 about cases in which a declaratory judgment action was22 filed where it -- the case could have been litigated by a23 plaintiff class in a consumer case, that was the case in24 the Greenwood Trust case filed by a bank in the First25 Circuit that ultimately produced this Court's decision in48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Smiley which was a consumer class action that came up out2 of California.3 Now, with respect to specific performance,4 specific performance is the object of this complaint. It5 is what they want. It is the thing they need in order for6 any of them to be able to realize the benefits. And as7 this Court said in Mississippi & Missouri River Bridge v.8 Ward -- in that case, it involved removing a bridge9 obstruction -- the removal of the obstruction is the10 matter of the controversy and the value of the object must11 govern.12 The complaint itself says they want specific13 performance of the national rebate program, and if there14 were any clarification needed, you look at page 45 of the15 red brief16 want. If1718 for their19 complaint? Wouldn't that be conferring jurisdiction by --20 by making an assertion that goes way beyond what anybody21 would consider reasonable?and they explain that that's just what they there were any --QUESTION: They don't -- they don't need that relief. And wouldn't that be a frivolous￼22 MR. WAXMAN: It's -- it would not if -- the23 Court may or may not grant specific performance of the24 national program in response to a particular plaintiff,25 but it would certainly not be a frivolous claim. Cases49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425like that are brought all the time.QUESTION: Why -- Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, if you --if the test is one plaintiff -- if it's Judge Posner's test, you assume there's one plaintiff, what will it cost the defendant. Injunctive relief for one plaintiff would only involve tracking that particular plaintiff's purchases, and that wouldn't add up to $75,000.MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, first, the cost is -- the test is the cost of supplying the relief requested in the complaint to any one plaintiff, and that is class-wide relief. It would also cost a sufficient amount even if it were only one plaintiff.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted. (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
