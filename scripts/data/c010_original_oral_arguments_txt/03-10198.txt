Michigan.          Mr. Moran.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. MORAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          The issue in this case is whether, 42 yearsafter this Court decided in Douglas v. California thatindigent defendants have the right to the assistance ofcounsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, now, Douglas didn'tinvolve a guilty plea, I guess.          MR. MORAN:  It did not, Your Honor.  It was atrial case.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And did the Court sayanything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea?I guess it didn't.          MR. MORAN:  It did not.  None of this Court'scases in the Douglas line have turned on whether theconviction was by trial or by plea.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Does that make a differenceor could it?31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. MORAN: I don't believe it does, Your Honor,2 because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of3 difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea.4 Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are5 waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other6 issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates,7 especially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well8 knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines --9 very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now10 Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps11 more complicated than the Federal system that's been in12 effect since the 1980's.13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did -- did your client waive14 any right to appeal here15 proceedings of the plea?16 MR. MORAN: He17 application for leave to18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What did he waive?19 MR. MORAN: He waived the right to have a -- to20 have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in21 other words, the right to automatically have full briefing22 and oral argument. So what he agreed to by pleading was23 to go through the application for leave to appeal24 procedure which involves a preliminary determination of25 merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOin connection with thedid not waive a right to file anappeal.  Because of the --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why didn't he waive the rightto have counsel for that -- for that purpose since thatwas the law in Michigan?          MR. MORAN:  Well, he did not -- first of all, asa matter of fact, he did not.  He was never told at anypoint during the plea proceedings that he would be givingup his right to counsel.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he was told what -- whatright to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.          MR. MORAN:  He was told that under certaincircumstances the judge would appoint counsel.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          MR. MORAN:  But the judge never said, under anyother circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Well, isn't that aperfectly natural inference if you're told you get A andB, that C and D might have been -- that C and D will notbe given?          MR. MORAN:  It might be a natural inference forsomebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbertis a special education student, functionally illiterate.And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given hisright to counsel.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, did we take this case onthe ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 take the case on the ground that even if he were advised,2 he'd still have his right?3 MR. MORAN: I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy,4 because this is a case in which the State is making a5 waiver argument. And, of course, the waiver argument is6 not part of -- is not the intent of the statute. What the7 statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant8 should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't9 be getting counsel.1011 challenge12 advised?131415 waive? 1617 a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor.18 That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money19 because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible20 for appointed counsel on appeal. So that waiver has no21 effect whatsoever on --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, wouldn't -- I'm -- I'm23 sorry.24 MR. MORAN: It would have no effect whatsoever25 on money defendants I'm saying.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I take it you wouldthe validity of the waiver even if he wereMR. MORAN:  Absolutely.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And even if he said, I herebyMR. MORAN:  Absolutely, we would because that is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Wouldn't your position bedifferent if he had been advised that he had exactly theright that you claim he has, and the court said, however,in Michigan you may not enter the -- the plea unless youwaive that right?  If -- if you don't want to waive thatright, which I've just explained to you, we'll -- we'llhave a trial.  Would -- would your answer still be that --that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?          MR. MORAN:  The waiver would be unconstitutionalunder those conditions because it is a discriminatorywaiver.  To show how breathtaking the State's argument --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How -- why is that prejudicialto him?  He says, okay, I can't plead guilty.  I reallydid it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.          MR. MORAN:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why doesn't he just have atrial?  He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.          MR. MORAN:  Well, as this Court has longrecognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit.  Imean, excuse me.  A guilty plea provides very substantialbenefits.  And so the effect of the Michigan statute thenwould be only the money defendant can receive the benefitsof a guilty plea and then have sentencing errorscorrected.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, is that what you were going 71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 to say to2 that it's34 State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the5 State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free6 transcripts. You can't have the waiver of the filing7 fees. In8 you can't9fact, the State could extract a waiver sayinghave counsel at sentencing.JUSTICE SCALIA:  These are all disparate impactJustice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's --far-reaching.MR. MORAN:  Yes.  Well, not only that, if the10 arguments. There's -- there's -- you're not making any11 argument that the State intentionally discriminates12 against the poor. You're just saying the effect of this13 is harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I14 thought our -- our equal protection cases have -- have15 said that disparate impact doesn't -- doesn't hack it as16 far as equal protection is concerned.17 MR. MORAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I actually18 have two responses to that. First, this is intentionally19 aimed at the poor. Looking at 770.3a, the statute under20 -- in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent.21 It refers to the indigent. So this is a statute that on22 its face is -- is taking away the right of the indigent23 and only the indigent to have -- have an attorney. So I24 don't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact25 case.81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But in the context of appellate counsel for afirst-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have -- havenot applied the same line of analysis that this Court hasapplied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clearmost recently in the MLB case --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In any event, you pointed outthat on the face there is the distinction on the face ofit --          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- it is not a disparateimpact case at all --          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- because it affects onlyindigents.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.  There is no question that thisstatute was enacted for and specifically applies only tothe indigent.  It has -- it has no impact whatsoever onthe wealthy, and it's aimed at the -- at the indigentonly.  So I do -- I do not agree that this --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whenever a State has -- hasinitially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever itcuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it isdenying equal protection to the poor?  That -- that seemsto be an extraordinary proposition.  The State isn'tpicking on the poor.  It's just saying that -- that the --91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the pastwe're no longer going to provide in this -- in this oneinstance of guilty pleas.  And -- and you say that -- thatis intentional discrimination against the poor?          MR. MORAN:  It's not a -- a disparate impactclaim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at thepoor.  The statute was designed to take away counsel fromthe poor and only from the poor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So any cutback on benefits thatis given -- on benefits that are given to the poor isintentional discrimination against the poor.          MR. MORAN:  I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just this one because that'syour case.          MR. MORAN:  This case certainly is.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're saying this is caselike Douglas which was equal protection, like a freetranscript, like a filing fee for an appeal.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're bracketing --          MR. MORAN:  This case -- in many ways therestrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability toappeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worsethan those that were struck down in Douglas because atleast in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues.2 We don't even have that here.3 All we have here is the indigent forced to shift4 for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are5 any issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the6 Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to7 obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts,8 his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents9 necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily10 be done by counsel. And so --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just understand one12 point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In13 your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent14 for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was15 there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?16 MR. MORAN: Oh, it's my -- it's certainly my17 contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to18 afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-19 tier direct felony appeal on the merits.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that ultimately your case21 rests not on equal protection but due process.22 MR. MORAN: It's a merger of both principles, as23 this Court said --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's one as much as the25 other, isn't it?111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MORAN: Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, you're -- we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.MR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Souter.JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as -- as directed against the poor.MR. MORAN: It is directed --JUSTICE SCALIA: Or not?MR. MORAN: It is directed against the poor,which is why there is an equal protection component tothis argument, but this Court's cases --JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.MR. MORAN: I believe that's right. It's -- it's difficult -- I have to confess, Your Honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line, and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a certain merger. Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the2 lines in these cases. But --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're saying that4 the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of5 merely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's6 what due process does for you. Because they have to7 provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have8 a very clear equal protection case which you would not9 otherwise have. Isn't -- isn't that the way the two work10 together?11 MR. MORAN: I think that's right, Justice12 Souter. I think I agree with that.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- in your view, can the14 State require a waiver of the right to appeal for15 everyone?16 MR. MORAN: That's a question this Court hasn't17 decided, and I don't have a position on that. But that's18 far different from this case because that would not be19 discriminatory.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure. It21 certainly goes to the importance or the significance of22 the underlying right. My understanding is -- correct me23 if I'm wrong -- that in the Federal system, we require24 waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of25 the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is calculated, as I understand it.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And do you question thelawfulness of that?          MR. MORAN:  I don't.  And that -- that case hasnot come before this Court yet, and so I don't know howthis Court would decide that case if it comes.  I knowsome of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellatewaivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea.          One thing the Michigan statute is -- does is ittakes away the right to appeal effectively for indigentswithout negotiation.  It's -- it's the baseline.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're-- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a dueprocess claim and if it is not a violation of due processto require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waiveentirely the right to appeal.  Surely you can waive theright to counsel on appeal.  If that's not a violation ofdue process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.          MR. MORAN:  But, Your Honor, the problem is --is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes aforced waiver on only the poor.claim.JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's an equal protectionMR. MORAN: That's an equal protection claim. 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you've -- you've said yourequal protection claim hinges on the due process claim.If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver,then apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as towhether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur,there's no due process claim, and then there's no equalprotection claim.          MR. MORAN:  I'm really not sure that you canseparate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendmentagain, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I knowthis Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that thereis -- there is a component of both.  And it's preciselybecause of these sorts of questions that I think you haveto view them as an integrated whole for purposes of theGriffin/Douglas line.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In any case --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Where -- where do we find thewaiver here?  Is it in the joint appendix?          MR. MORAN:  Well, it's my position there was nowaiver, but the --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But you referred to somethingthat was waived.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Where would we find that?          MR. MORAN:  Well, the plea proceeding.  It's the151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plea proceeding.  And it's --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, don't take your time tolook it up.  Maybe counsel for respondent can find it forus.          MR. MORAN:  It's -- it's in the jointappendix --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  All right.          MR. MORAN:  -- beginning on page 19.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's their argument anyway.Let them --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm missing something onwaiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a -- aright to have a counsel on appeal.  He can waive a trial.He can waive a jury trial.  But before he has to -- beforehe decides, he has to know that he has the constitutionalright to a jury trial.          MR. MORAN:  That's right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And why wouldn't he also haveto have the -- to know that he has the constitutionalright to a lawyer to represent him?          MR. MORAN:  Well, that's my position Justice          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That has nothing todo with equal protection.  It has to do simply with a verycommon sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial,et cetera.  So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a right to a lawyer.          Now, if he wants to go back and waive thatright, fine.          MR. MORAN:  That's right.it.JUSTICE BREYER:  That's all.  That's the end ofMR. MORAN:  That's right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's all this complicatedthing about?          MR. MORAN:  If an indigent, after beingsentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer togo on appeal by myself, which is actually a -- a rightthis Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right torepresent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigentis allowed to -- would be allowed to represent himself orherself on appeal if they chose to do so.  The problemhere is that the statute purports to take away the right,and it's our position that this is a --          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  You'd have to say thestatute is wrong in taking away the right.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But he can waive it if he wantsto, knowing that he has the right.          MR. MORAN:  That's right.  We have no problemwith a voluntary waiver.  We certainly have a problem with171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea whichproduces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhereelse, unless -- unless you agree to waiver --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, but -- but that happens allthe time.  I mean, the waiver -- waiver of appeal in -- inguilty -- in guilty pleas.  That's -- that's notpermissible either?          MR. MORAN:  I take no position on that.  It mayor may not permissible.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you have to if you'regoing to make the argument you just made.          MR. MORAN:  But it's far different becausethat's something that can be obtained in negotiation.  Butwhat we would have --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, Mr. Moran, here on page22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to thedefendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea,you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as ofright.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And you think that was noteffective?          MR. MORAN:  No.  That was effective.  That --that's referring to the automatic appeal that he wouldhave if he went to trial where he would have full briefing181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and oral argument.

This was a -- thiswas a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of -- ofrespects, but it --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, he does --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  I'm --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- he does go on to say that-- that he can appoint a lawyer for -- in certaininstances.  He doesn't complete the explanation by sayingthere are other instances and when I will not appoint one.That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.          MR. MORAN:  Yes, he was.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He had a counsel at the plea hearing.          MR. MORAN:  He did.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm mixed up again.  What isthe answer to this?  I -- I would have thought that evenif those words that Justice O'Connor read referreddirectly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us-- in other words, the one that's at issue -- that stillhe'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on thatappeal before he could waive it.          MR. MORAN:  Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And does anybody dispute that?191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MORAN:  I believe --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that at issue here?          MR. MORAN:  I -- I believe the State mightdispute that.  I'm not sure.          What the Michigan constitution does, JusticeO'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it saysthat for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere,they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, andthey have -- they then have to proceed by the applicationfor leave to appeal.  And so the Michigan constitutionexplicitly still provides a right to appeal, but itchanges the method.  And so Michigan's appeal, after aguilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several otherStates, Virginia, West Virginia, and -- and several otherStates have guilty plea appeals.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a strange terminology.It doesn't provide a right to appeal.  It -- it provides aright to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for anappeal.  A right to ask for an appeal is not a right toget an appeal.          MR. MORAN:  It's framed in terms of a -- of aright.  Page 2 of the brief --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you have an absolute rightto ask for an          MR.appeal.MORAN:  Yes.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not a right toappeal.  It's a right to request an appeal, which can begranted or denied.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.          MR. MORAN:  But it's a -- it's -- what Michiganhas done is it has changed the method of the appeal.  Andso Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals bypetition.  West Virginia has a first-tier by petitionand --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's done more thanchange the method.  It's changed the entitlement.  Thecourt can simply say we're not interested in your appeal.It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.          MR. MORAN:  Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's nothow the -- the Michigan Court of Appeals works.  TheMichigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court.And so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court ofAppeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to --to identify his issues, with an order saying that therewas a lack of merit in the grounds presented.  That is apreclusive decision on the merits of his case.  That --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's just -- but that'sjust boiler plate, isn't it?  That's what they say in allthese cases.211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425               MR. MORAN:  Yes.               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I think Michigan cites a     Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the     merits.               MR. MORAN:  That --               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's People v. Berry?               MR. MORAN:  Yes.  That was a decision of the     Michigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying     applications for leave to appeal which are not on the     merits.  The Michigan Supreme Court denies the     applications for saying -- by saying, we are not persuaded     that we should hear the questions presented.               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why wouldn't it be the     same if the -- if it's a discretionary appeal at the     intermediate appellate level?               MR. MORAN:  Because the Michigan Court of     Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-     correcting court.  And so it issues orders saying denied     for lack of merit.  And the Michigan Court of Appeals     dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said,     without exception, that is a decision on the merits that     precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't -- didn't the supreme     court in the Bulger case -- was that the name of it?               MR. MORAN:  Yes.221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't it say that the -- that2 the intermediate court's denial of -- of appeals was a3 discretionary judgment?4 MR. MORAN: It called it a discretionary appeal,5 Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the --6 the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of7 Appeals is an error-correcting court. And in fact, the8 very author of the --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was a dissent, though.10 MR. MORAN: That's right, but the very author of11 the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year12 later or 2 years later describes the effect of -- of an13 order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of14 Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and15 rejected the merits.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, in effect, it's17 discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to18 whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom19 line, whether they give it full dress or -- or merely20 discretionary denial is -- is an implication on the21 merits.22 MR. MORAN: Yes, exactly as in Virginia. In23 Jackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the -- the24 Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a25 petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that each petition is considered on the merits, and a2 denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits3 that precludes relitigation under the law of the case4 doctrine. And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now5 is exactly like the one in Virginia.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that something the7 intermediate appellate court has said? Have they said8 that, that -- we have a -- a discretionary appeal, but9 every -- in every case it's a merits decision? We don't10 have any decisions that say we are exercising our11 discretion not to review.12 MR. MORAN: If a -- if a appeal or an13 application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is14 the wrong form or is untimely or has some other15 then the court will occasionally issue an order16 the application for that reason. But for any properly17 filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding18 practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is19 denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: This means, I would presume,21 that -- that we would -- we would have to give -- our22 Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to23 all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all24 on the merits.25 MR. MORAN: And they do. 241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOfiled indefect,denying￼1 2 34 and legal5 person applying for a discretionary appeal?6 MR. MORAN: Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the7 Sixth Circuit. And there is a -- a whole host of Federal8 district court decisions in the Eastern and WesternJUSTICE SCALIA:  Federal courts do?MR. MORAN:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  They assume that all factualarguments have been decided against the -- the9 District of Michigan all saying that when an order is10 denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the11 AEDPA standard of review applies.12 And so the State obtains tremendous benefits13 from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas14 corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent15 were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from16 beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so17 the State very happily argues for all of those purposes18 that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come19 before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a20 decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite21 what it says because they are hoping that this Court will22 conclude that it is a discretionary appeal.23 In fact, the State --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Moran.25 MR. MORAN: -- has made an even more radical251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 argument in its brief. The State maintains that the2 appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier3 appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the4 actual function of that court because there is a provision5 that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case,6 after sentencing, that there are issues that she should7 have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State8 now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and9 then the application that follows after that to the10 Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal.11 I'll just point out that even the State's amicus12 doesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light13 of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to14 reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Moran, before your --16 your time is up, I did want to know what is your position17 on -- let's say that there is -- you prevail and there is18 a right to counsel for these applications to appeal. And19 if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is20 no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the21 equivalent of an Anders brief?22 MR. MORAN: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in23 fact, I have done that personally. Before I became an24 academic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office25 in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 plea appeals. And in a significant percentage of the2 cases -- I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my3 head -- after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel4 then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no5 grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got6 whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining,7 at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be8 filed or -- or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of9 an Anders brief. And so that is done in a number of10 cases.11 It is our position that that procedure actually12 helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because13 without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr.14 Halbert, a special education student with mental15 disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall16 -- and filing, in -- in his case, with the help of a17 fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself18 -- the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is19 completely incoherent, misses several issues that are20 right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that21 his sentencing guidelines were misscored but -- but22 without explaining why, without even identifying which23 sentencing guidelines were misscored.24 And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that25 was approximately three times too high under the271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 sentencing guidelines. The State concedes that one of the2 sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor3 erroneously. We concede one of the -- one of the4 sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor5 erroneously. But then there were two others, and the most6 important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13. That was7 scored for 25 points in both cases. And so Mr. -- Mr.8 Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too9 high.10 Michigan requires -- Michigan is one of the few11 States that requires that ineffective assistance of12 counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost.13 And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way14 to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing,15 which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial16 counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still17 available to be called, all from prison, and there was no18 possible way he could do that. So it's not very19 surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate,20 that his application for leave to appeal was completely21 incoherent.22 The fellow inmate actually did write the -- the23 trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing24 on ineffective assistance of counsel. But under the25 statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Under the statute, only if there was already an upwarddeparture from the sentencing guidelines, only then wouldthe judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course,the guidelines, as misscored without objection fromdefense counsel -- there was no upward departure at thatpoint.          If the Court has no further questions, I'd liketo reserve the balance of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr. Moran.          Mr. Restuccia.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD E. RESTUCCIA                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Mr. Chief Justice, andplease the Court:may it          I want to start with the factual claimthe waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 fromthe joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert,in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellatecounsel.  I think Justice Scalia is right in noting thathe was told specifically it's under these conditionsyou'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, youmight be appointed counsel.  From context it's unambiguousthat he would otherwise not receive counsel.          And what's important is at the joint appendix onpage 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOregarding￼1 on this point. So in order for this Court to conclude2 that Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate3 counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have4 -- you would have to conclude that the trial court was5 clearly erroneous in its factual finding.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, wouldn't we have7 to conclude that if we're going to apply the same8 standards here that we usually do in -- in the plea waiver9 situation? I mean, we -- the -- the classic point of it10 all is the knowing -- the -- the intelligent, voluntary11 waiver of a known right. And leaving aside the equal12 protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I13 don't see that there would be -- have been an adequate14 waiver here because he was never told that he had the15 right that he now claims as a matter of due process. You16 indeed, dispute it.17 MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: But unless he were told that,19 the -- the waiver that -- that depends upon parsing the20 difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of21 explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate22 for a waiver of a known right.23 MR. RESTUCCIA: I -- I think that the colloquy24 makes clear that he does not -- he's not going to have an25 appeal as of right, and then when told that --301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- the appeal of his2 right -- the appeal as of right point, as I understand it,3 is a different point. What they're getting at there is it4 will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether5 your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you6 ask for it. We're here dealing with the right to counsel,7 and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the8 right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it,9 that there wouldn't be a -- an -- an adequate waiver under10 Boykin.11 MR. RESTUCCIA: I think in -- in context when12 told that only under these circumstances you're going to13 receive counsel in bringing discretionary application,14 that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go15 forward with the -- his plea --16 JUSTICE BREYER: Look, the -- imagine -- I'm17 just repeating what Justice Souter said. There must be --18 it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but19 I haven't heard the answer.20 He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does. The21 Michigan lawyer looks at the statute. It says a defendant22 who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel23 appointed for review with some exceptions, which they24 claim are inadequate. So he thinks the law is shall not.25 I have no right. So he doesn't not only -- not only is he311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to2 waive. He has no such right.3 Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to4 waive, how could he waive anything? And obviously, a5 person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal6 no matter7 appeal, I89 the two questions that are asked, he explains -- the courtwhat and then he says, okay, I waive my right tomean, really.MR. RESTUCCIA:  I think that the -- the -- for10 explained11 then said1213 Right? 1415 the -- 1617 until he pleaded guilty.18 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's where -- that's what20 the waiver consists of. To say he didn't have an appeal21 of right, no. That's -- he had an appeal of right up22 until the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what --23 and that's what the judge is asking.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Precisely.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to -- do you want321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto him he didn't have appeal as of right but--JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, that's the end of it.MR. RESTUCCIA:  But then -- and then the --JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he had an appeal of right￼1 to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll2 get -- you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.3 JUSTICE BREYER: Precisely.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The court didn't say only --5 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what we're deciding6 is --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the problem.8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly the issue in9 front of us. Is it constitutional or not constitutional?10 And waiver has nothing to do with it.11 MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that -- I also want to12 make the point, of course, that there was a factual13 finding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to14 find the trial court was clearly erroneous.15 The --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Restuccia, the -- we are17 dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is18 learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court19 did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to20 counsel in seeking leave to appeal. It said only when --21 if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but22 did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to23 counsel in seeking leave to appeal.24 And I was curious as a matter of what is going25 on in Michigan trial courts now. Do judges routinely tell331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 defendants who plead guilty -- tell them not only when the2 court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you3 relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to4 appeal? Because that --5 MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that was never imparted in7 this case.8 MR. RESTUCCIA: The advice concerning right to9 appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was10 a form from 2000. The -- the 2004 form is available from11 the Michigan Supreme Court web site, and it has been12 modified now that -- because the trial court -- it seems13 apparent that he was reading from the advice concerning14 right of -- to appeal. The way it reads now is it will15 say you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at16 public expense to assist you in filing an application for17 leave to appeal. So this -- this -- the colloquy now18 would happen differently, but I think that --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, your case is a20 little stronger than -- than the court just asked -- just21 saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I22 must appoint counsel in another circumstance. That might23 have left open the implication that you could appoint24 counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and25 to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 might appoint counsel in the other circumstance. So if2 there's any implication from it, the implication is not3 just that I have -- I have listed all the areas in which I4 must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I5 either must or even may, if there's an implication.6 MR. RESTUCCIA: I think -- I think that's right.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, apparently the people8 who -- who redid the model instructions thought that this9 would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get10 counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.11 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. And they -- they12 did -- they did modify the form.13 So on the question of the underlying14 constitutionality, I want to -- I want to make a few15 points, that the -- the threshold question really is16 whether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a17 plea-based conviction. Michigan law is clear that there18 is no appeal by right. It's an application process and19 it's a discretionary review. The Michigan Court of20 Appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these21 cases, has no obligation to review the merits.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with your23 opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the24 intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?25 MR. RESTUCCIA: No. The law in the Sixth351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Circuit is in fact in conflict with a case -- an earliercase, McKenzie v. Smith -- had determined that the -- adecision with that language, that virtually identicallanguage, is not -- is not entitled to deference.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your opponent hasmisrepresented Michigan law.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  No.  I didn't say -- I wasn'tsuggesting that.  Abela is one case stating one position.McKenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But he says there are dozensof cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA inthe way he described.  Is that wrong?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, he didn't cite thosecases.  I --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, he didn't, but do youthink he's wrong?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  I -- I know that our officehandles all the habeas -- habeas corpus --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think he's wrong?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  I think he is wrong.  The --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Are you going on -- on record          that Michigan does not and will not, in theas sayingUnited Statesresult of oneMR.courts, claim any AEDPA deference as aof these determinations?RESTUCCIA:  The Solicitor General made that36Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 position clear before the argument -- before this Court in2 Tesmer v. Kowalski. So we have not been advancing that3 claim. In fact, we've been advancing a claim --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you have not been -- and --5 and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in6 the district courts?7 MR. RESTUCCIA: The -- all the habeas petitions8 are run through the office of the Attorney General, so9 that the -- when the Solicitor General from the State of10 Michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim,11 that means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there12 will be -- that argument will not be advanced.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, so far as you can tell,14 that's the way it's been.15 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. That's right.16 And because there is no appeal as of right under17 Michigan law, this -- the Douglas case doesn't govern the18 disposition. Ultimately the -- the controlling is Ross.19 And the issue then is whether Michigan provides a20 meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to21 bring an application for leave. That's really the -- I22 think the heart of the constitutional issue.23 There are three distinct characteristics of the24 Michigan system. The -- the nature of the review is25 discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 review in Ross that was described by this Court for the2 North Carolina Supreme Court.3 Mr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court4 of Appeals is an error-correcting court. With regard to5 applications for leave where there is no right to have the6 merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court. In7 fact, one of the reasons for the legislation in Michigan,8 the reason the Michigan constitution was changed was9 because of the heavy volume that the Michigan Court of10 Appeals was facing. There are 28 judges in the Michigan11 Court of Appeals, and they produce --12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Do they all sit13 together?14 MR. RESTUCCIA: No. They're panels of three.15 They issue about 4,000 opinions each year. So each judge16 is responsible for authoring --17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it's just one18 court.19 MR. RESTUCCIA: One court. That's right. So20 each judge is responsible for authoring between 130-14021 opinions, having to join in another 280. So resource22 allocation is one of the pressing concerns in the Michigan23 Court of Appeals.24 The situations in which the court of appeals25 will grant leave on application are rare. It's -- it's381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reluctant to grant leave in these cases in part because of2 the --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why -- if it's just4 denying -- or not granting appeal, why does it use the5 boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?6 MR. RESTUCCIA: It's used that standard order7 for the last 20 years or longer. The only Michigan Court8 of Appeals case in -- only published case in an9 application for leave setting is the Bobenal case cited by10 the people in our -- the State of Michigan in its brief,11 in which the Michigan Court of Appeals said there is no --12 this is not a determination on the merits.13 The only published case for Michigan in which14 there was an application for leave from a plea-based15 conviction is People v. Berry in which the Michigan Court16 of Appeals, after initially having denied leave, then in a17 collateral attack granted leave on the very same issue and18 said that its original --19 JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- sorry. Finish. I just20 had a -- I wanted to go back to something you said, but I21 want you to be finished.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask about grounds23 presented before we get off this? Is it conceivable that24 the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of25 merit in the -- in the grounds of application? Is -- is391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the applicant required to state why this particular appeal2 is worthy of being entertained?3 MR. RESTUCCIA: They're supposed to raise those4 arguments. I think that's exactly right, that merits can5 have different meanings, and it can -- it can relate to6 whether it would justify the resources of the court to7 examine the underlying merits of the claim. I think8 that's right.9 That's one understanding of the -- of the order10 that's consistent with the way it's been treated by the11 court of appeals and also, most importantly, by the12 Michigan constitution, when the people of the State of13 Michigan said trial-based convictions, there's an appeal14 as of right. For all other convictions, for plea-based15 convictions, it would be by leave. The Michigan's Supreme16 Court, in examining this very question about the nature of17 review, said that it was discretionary.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What of Mr. -- Mr. Moran's19 point that this -- whatever the merits are, it counts as20 law of the case and it's -- it conclusively determines the21 issues presented?22 MR. RESTUCCIA: That's not what happened in --23 in People -- in the Bobenal case, which was a court of24 appeals published decision where the order read virtually25 identical -- identically to this one, and the court of401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425appeals said it could -- would not be bound by itsoriginal denial of leave for the lack of merits on thegrounds presented and reached the merits of the claim.          The same thing happened in -- in the Berry casein which --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, that was the same court,though, wasn't it?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But what -- what aboutpreclusion on other courts?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  The --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In litigation in other courts.They -- did -- did they ever say there is no claim orissue preclusion in other courts as a result of -- of ourdenials?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  The court of appeals was onlyexamining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining onsubsequent courts.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And any -- any court, I mean,in -- in theory, can -- can revise its own -- its ownopinions.  But the -- I mean, we look to preclusion reallyon -- on the effect of the judgment in another court, andI take it they have not ruled on that.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, but both -- both opinions,in Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on the merits.  In other words, if a subsequent court thensaid it was a merits determination, it would beinconsistent with the holding from Bobenal and it would beinconsistent with Berry with saying the merits have notbeen reached.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they have said the same,you tell us, as to Federal courts.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  The Federal courtshave --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, that's another court,and -- and they are not asserting that they've decided onthe merits in Federal court.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  The Federal courts have beenambiguous.  In other words, the Abela case -- they said --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not talking about what theFederal courts have said.  I'm talking about what -- whatMichigan has said and -- and what the court of -- has thecourt of appeals spoken on that subject?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes.  The court of appeals inthe Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually theidentical language of the issue raised here, that this wasnot a decision on the merits and that it was not itselfbound as law of the case because the merits had not beenresolved.I think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount 421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 case because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring2 the proper legal understanding of the applications for3 leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is4 discretionary. I think that fits with common sense5 understanding because there is no right to have the6 reviewed. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say7 application were discretionary if a defendant would8 claim to have any error corrected. Otherwise, he would9 have a claim on the court of appeals. The court of10 appeals has full authority to make the determination that11 even if everything alleged is true, it's not going to12 correct the error.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Look, this is what I'm -- I'm14 interested in. It seems like Michigan is unique here.15 Why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other16 States have done? You just say, okay, of course, you have17 a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer.18 We'll give it to you if you're poor. But, by the way, if19 you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that20 deal unless you waive it.21 MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think that, in a way,22 Michigan provides a -- a greater protection by enabling23 itself. What the court of appeals is essentially doing24 with its review is for the -- for a case where there's a25 -- an -- an egregious set of facts, it can reach in and431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOmeritsthehave a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425grant an application and review it on the merits.  It's a-- it's -- it's a kind of a determination about resourceallocation, making kind of the hard choices about policydecisions that States have to make.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is this a case where it wouldmeet the standard for granting leave to appeal?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  No.  This -- for -- for Mr.Halbert --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Because of the error inscoring?          MR. RESTUCCIA:  In fact, anyone who's veryfamiliar with the Michigan guideline system wouldrecognize that Mr. Halbert, if anything, received a breakin the scoring of the guidelines.  That -- that ultimatelythe Offense Variable 13 is a very easy answer to why itwas properly scored.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  You take the position that infact there was no error in scoring.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  No.  The -- there was no errorin scoring.  The Offense Variable 13 claim relates tothree -- whether the defendant had committed three --three offenses against a person within the -- within 5years.  Michigan allows a determination based onpreponderance          Mr.even if there was no conviction entered.Halbert was a serial child molester who44Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425admitted to having sexually assaulted his 14-year-oldstepdaughter, a 10-year-old girl, a 6-year-old girl.  Allthat information was in the presentence investigationreport.  There was no objection to the scoring of OffenseVariable 13 because he admitted to the sexual assaults.There was -- it was never raised --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I thought at page 36 of yourbrief that you agreed that he made a correct -- that therewas an error in -- of application.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Right.  The Offense Variable 9was -- there was an error with respect to that, but itwouldn't affect the ultimate position he would be placedin the -- in the brackets.  In fact, the only error thatdid occur that would have affected the scoring was one inhis favor, which would have put him -- put him in a higherbracket.  So he in fact --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So there were at least twoerrors.  How they balance out I guess is your view theydidn't hurt him at all.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Well, in fact, if anything,helped him.  But on a more basic level --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that correct?  There weretwo errors in the --          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- at least.451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And he contends there were twomore, and that hasn't been resolved.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  That's -- that's right, but I --I think those claims are --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So at -- at least we have toassume that it was not an error-free sentencingproceeding.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Yes.          Well, more importantly, the kinds of issues atplay for the sentencing cases are all like this.  They --they relate to the minimum sentencing.  Michigan systemsthen determine from a maximum -- from a minimum to amaximum which will get a -- a range of time.  All the --these sentencing guideline cases relate to the minimumsentence.          For Mr. Halbert as a sex offender, this isreally a question about when he will be eligible forrelease from the Department of Corrections.  He's going tobe facing 30 years because all the sentences in Michiganare set by the statute.  So these oral arguments relatinglesser liberty --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask another question?Am I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 errors there, the fact that they were not raised until2 after December 11th would have precluded review at the3 trial court level?4 MR. RESTUCCIA: No. His -- the point of the5 trial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to6 withdraw his plea, should have raised that before the7 sentencing itself because the court has discretion before8 sentencing to let him out of his plea. After sentencing,9 he has to show that the plea was invalid. So his time --10 he was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was11 concerned about consecutive as against concurrent12 sentences.13 In -- in summary, the -- the Michigan system --14 the -- with the limited date to the review and the kinds15 of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue16 are not -- are lesser liberty interest questions because17 they have to do with amount of punishment. The Michigan18 system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the19 defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions20 regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to21 have a factual record from which to advance his claims.22 He's not left to shift for himself, that there is a23 counsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if the counsel happens to25 be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. RESTUCCIA: And that's always the2 circumstance for a defendant who's bringing a3 discretionary application where his prior counsel was4 ineffective, that he can be left to identify the5 meritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of6 ineffective assistance of counsel.7 That's true in Ross as well where your first --8 where your first appeal as of right, your -- your9 appellate counsel is incompetent. You're going to be left10 to identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of11 ineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid12 procedural bars that you'll be facing.13 Every system is going to have to draw that line14 and to say that at some point you're not going to get15 appointed another attorney. Just because there's access16 to the system doesn't mean there always has to be another17 attorney appointed. Otherwise, the point is that you18 would have to have two attorneys make a review on your19 case, whereas there is no right to an appeal here that20 this Court has recognized that ultimately where there --21 since there is no right to appeal, that he had an22 opportunity to have a trial counsel --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, if he had had24 paid counsel,25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400he would not have had these handicaps.RESTUCCIA:  That's right, that the -- there48Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is some advantage, but that's not the ultimate answer.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Competent paid counsel.          MR. RESTUCCIA:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Restuccia.          Mr. Schaerr, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR              ON BEHALF OF LOUISIANA, ET AL.,        AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT          MR. SCHAERR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Like the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of thisMichigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attemptto invalidate that statute here runs counter to thisCourt's longstanding tradition of deference to the peopleof the individual States and to their legislatures in thedesign and implementation of their criminal justicesystems.  As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a caselike this is a case about federalism because it involvesthe respect that Federal courts must pay to States and theStates' procedural rules.          Respect for the State's choices is especiallyimportant here because, as the Court put it in Medina v.California, preventing and dealing with crime is much morethe business of the States than it is of the Federal491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Government. And therefore, the Court said we should not2 lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon3 the administration of justice by the individual States.4 And -- and as to the question of -- of when to5 provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded6 us in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be7 one of legislative choice, especially since it involves8 difficult policy considerations and the allocation of9 scarce legal resources.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I take it that the basic11 rule that we've followed -- and this is what people are12 arguing about -- could be a criminal trial or proceeding,13 plea, something in a trial court.14 MR. SCHAERR: Right.15 JUSTICE BREYER: It emerges with a judgment, and16 then there is going to be the first review. Call it a17 leave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you18 want, but it is the first review. And in those two19 instances, State, if the defendant is poor, give him a20 lawyer. That's simple. That's clear. Everybody could21 understand it. They may not even have a lot of legal22 arguments.23 Now, what significant -- what does that prevent24 a State from doing that it's reasonably important for a25 State to want to do?501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. SCHAERR: Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's2 a question of allocating scarce legal resources. If you3 -- and this case is a perfect example of that. This case4 is not -- does not involve an appeal as of right. It5 involves a discretionary appeal, and -- and that's the6 vast bulk of -- of appeals that are addressed by the -- by7 the Michigan Court of Appeals. So if you impose here on8 the State of Michigan an obligation to provide counsel in9 all of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the10 people of Michigan to reallocate their legal resources11 away from other cases or you're requiring the legislature12 to increase taxes to pay for that -- to pay for that --13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other State that's14 done it the way Michigan has?15 MR. SCHAERR: I don't believe there's another16 State that's done it exactly the same way. But I -- but I17 would point out -- and I think this is important, Justice18 Breyer -- that -- that at least according to the Michigan19 Supreme Court in the Bulger case, the majority of States20 don't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based21 conviction. 21 of them rule it out entirely and22 expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals23 from plea-based convictions by -- by allowing prosecutors24 to impose that -- impose a waiver as a condition of25 entering into a plea. So -- so the relevant universe for511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 comparison is quite small here. It's really 12 States at2 most, and -- and Michigan sort of fits within the middle3 of those States in terms of the amount of resources that4 it provides and opportunities that it provides.5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying -- I just want6 to be clear -- that even if this defendant had had paid7 counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the8 intermediate court?9 MR. SCHAERR: That's correct. It -- it's10 discretionary, and that's clear not just -- not just from11 analysis of the -- of the Michigan courts' opinions, but12 from the provision of the -- of -- but from the13 constitutional provision that -- that created this entire14 controversy, which was added in 1994. It's article I,15 section 20. And that constitutional provision itself16 draws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and17 appeals by leave of court. So even if the Michigan courts18 wanted to have a system of -- of mandatory appeals,19 they're now precluded by the Michigan constitution from20 doing that.21 And so -- and so clearly, if this Court adheres22 to the sharp distinction and -- which I think is equally23 sharp and clear, that this Court has made between --24 between appeals of right and discretionary appeals --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not that -- it's not521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that sharp because it was -- in Ross, it was the secondappeal.  So here we have one factor that is like Douglas,Griffin, and one factor that's like Ross.  You can't saythat it falls in one camp more than the other.  This isthe first-tier appeal.          MR. SCHAERR:  I -- I understand, JusticeGinsburg, but -- but that's not the distinction that Iunderstand this Court's decisions draw.  Several timessince Douglas and Ross, this Court has said that the rightto paid counsel addressed in Douglas extends only to thefirst appeal of right and no further.  And that's --that's Coleman and -- and Finley, among others.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, the question iswhether the words, of right, were essential to thatstatement.          MR. SCHAERR:  I -- I'm assuming that the Courtwas being careful in its -- in its choice of words, and Ibelieve it was because that -- that --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because then it wouldn't haveneeded to include the word first.          MR. SCHAERR:  I'm sorry?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But then the word first wasredundant, not the words, of right.          MR. SCHAERR:  No, I don't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can have two appeals of531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 right -- 234MR. SCHAERR:  That's right.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I suppose if you wanted to.MR. SCHAERR:  That's right.Now, so -- so the real question here, withthe right to paid counsel, is does it make sensewhat the Court did in Douglas to this new56 regard to7 to extend8 situation. We think it does not. This Court's decisions,9 Ross and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in -- in Murray, as10 I recall, draw -- draw a distinction between the removal11 of barriers that the State imposes to the exercise of12 litigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand,13 subsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights14 And -- and I think this Court's care in15 distinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary16 appeals reflects a desire to cabin Douglas and -- and to17 avoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies.18 And we think that's a -- we think that's -- we think19 that's good as a matter of policy for the Court to do20 that, for one thing --21 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you one thing22 lest we forget it? Is -- is your argument premised on the23 assumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is -- is not24 regarded as a determination on the merits and thus25 preclusive?541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SCHAERR:  No, I don't think so.  I -- Ithink that helps the argument.  But in fact, there arelots of discretionary appeals or discretionary appellateproceedings that -- that do result in decisions on themerits.  This Court, for example, sometimes summarilyaffirms or reverses on cert, and the fact that the Courtdoes that doesn't create --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we accept cert before wedo that.  I thought the question was that the denial of anapplication for appeal does not have any meritsconsequence.  Wasn't that the question?          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does the denial of anapplication for appeal have any merits consequence?          MR. SCHAERR:  Well, as -- if -- if that's thequestion, I -- I would defer to -- to Michigan counsel --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  But I'm asking whetherthat's a premise of your argument because the consequencesof your argument are going to be very different dependingon whether that is the premise or whether it isn't,whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.          MR. SCHAERR:  I -- I think the distinction is --is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the meritsor not.  I think the distinction is between appeals ofright and -- and appeals that are discretionary.551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it's always on the merits,it's an -- it's an appeal of right, it seems to me.  Howcan you have a -- a discretionary appeal which alwaysdecides the merits of the case?          MR. SCHAERR:  Well, I -- in -- in fact, I don'tthink that's what happens in Michigan, and -- and I thinkthe --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So your -- the assumption ofyour argument is that it is not on the merits.  I.e., itis not a merits determination if there's a denial andhence there is no preclusion.          MR. SCHAERR:  I -- I think that's true.  Whetherit's an assumption of the argument, I'm not -- I'm not sosure.          JUSTICE BREYER:  You're talking about a piece ofpaper, that first piece of paper saying to the appealscourt, appeals court, please hear my appeal.          MR. SCHAERR:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And then it lists a whole lotof reasons like a cert petition.          MR. SCHAERR:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And those are likely to do withthe merits of the case.  I mean, they'll tell all thehorrible things that went on.  And the question is, is hegoing to have a lawyer to help him with that piece of561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 paper or not?2 34 sounds to5 an appeal6 harder. You've got to convince them to take it.7 MR. SCHAERR: It -- it is more difficult, but --8 but the disparity between --9MR. SCHAERR:  That's right.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now -- now, itme just the kind of thing you'd write if you hadon the merits too.  No.  It's even harder.  EvenJUSTICE BREYER:  So why draw that distinction?of paper is the same, even harder to write,lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the10 The piece11 needs the12 trial court. Why draw that distinction?13 MR. SCHAERR: Well, again, because -- because if14 you -- if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as15 -- as in Douglas, you're going to require States to -- to16 reallocate resources to that priority and away from other17 priorities.18 Also, if you -- if you subsidize litigation in19 the name of providing adequate access to courts or20 meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a21 lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about22 exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that23 standard.24 And also, if -- and this is particularly25 important here I think. If you require States to571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not2 required to provide in the first place, like the right to3 seek review of a -- of a plea-based conviction, then you4 give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or5 eliminate that right altogether. And -- and, you know,6 who knows? But perhaps that's what's going on in the --7 in the trend in the States away from providing this right.8 Thank you.9 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.10 Schaerr.11 Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.12 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN13 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER14 MR. MORAN: Thank you.15 I have to begin by correcting several16 misstatements of fact and of Michigan law. First of all,17 Mr. Schaerr just said that only a dozen States, I believe,18 allow for appeals from guilty pleas. That's not correct.19 Every State in the United States currently allows for20 appeals from guilty plea -- pleas.21 The Bulger case did say that. They cited a --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Appeals as of right?23 MR. MORAN: Not necessarily. As I cited in my24 brief, a number of States allow for applications or25 petitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first-581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 tier direct appeal from guilty pleas. The Bulger -- the2 Michigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a -- an article3 from an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply4 incorrect on that.5 Secondly, on the issue of what is the effect of6 a order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the7 grounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie8 v. Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v.9 Berry, and Bobenal v. Saginaw Investment. None of those10 cases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds11 presented. That phrase does not appear in any of those12 three cases.13 The Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are14 Michigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981. Beginning in15 1981, in a series of three cases, People v. Douglas,16 People v. Hayden, and People v. Wiley, the Michigan Court17 of Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying18 applications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of19 merit on the grounds presented, was law of the case.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the effect of the21 constitutional provision then?22 MR. MORAN: I'm sorry? I -- I don't --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so, what is the24 effect of the constitutional provision that Mr. Schaerr25 read?591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. MORAN: The Michigan constitutional2 provision? It changes the way in which guilty plea3 appeals proceed. Before 1994, there were other types of4 appeals that had to proceed by application for leave to5 appeal, primarily late appeals. If the appeal was filed6 too late, it had to proceed by application for leave to7 appeal.8 In 1994, as a result of the constitutional9 amendment, guilt plea appeals now have to proceed by10 application for leave to appeal. That's constitutional.11 We have no problem with that, and that is the method by12 which the13 They have1415 wrong one. I meant the one that said that applications to16 the court of appeals are -- are -- require leave tocaseload management problems have been solved.been solved.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I -- you -- you have the17 appeal. What's the effect of that?18 MR. MORAN: The -- I assume you're still19 referring to article I, section 20 of the Michigan20 constitution.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It says that for the22 court of appeals, you need leave to appeal. I thought23 they were doing something there. What were they doing?24 MR. MORAN: They were saying that first-tier25 felony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 of the court, require an application for leave to appeal,2 like late appeals from trial cases do. But all of those3 appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive4 effect for law of the case purposes. And the Sixth5 Circuit specifically dealt with that in -- in the Abela6 case. McKenzie v. Smith never -- never mentions anything7 about the lack of merit in the grounds presented.8 The resource allocations point is simply that9 not all of these guilty plea appeals are -- lead to full10 argument and full briefing, and that's fine. Michigan can11 do that. But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of12 Ellis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of13 the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is14 there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for15 himself. And so in -- in Smith v. Robbins, this Court,16 specifically referring back to the Ellis case, said that17 the problem that the Court identified in Ellis and that18 became part of the constitutional minimum in Douglas, was19 that the old California procedure did not require -- I see20 my time is up.21 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.22 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moran.23 The case is submitted.24 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)611111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO
