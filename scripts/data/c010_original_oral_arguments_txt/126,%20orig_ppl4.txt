Nebraska and Colorado.      Mr. McAllister.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTERON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFMR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      Kansas seeks to ensure that Nebraska haseffective incentives to comply with its compactobligations every year, including the years when wateris scarce.  To achieve that goal, Kansas asked thisCourt to take two measures:  First, award a significantamount of disgorgement for Nebraska's massive gain fromits compact violation; and second, decline to rewritethe detailed and complicated settlement agreement thatthe parties reached in 2002, an agreement that is fullof compromises and concessions on all sides.      Ultimately, Kansas wants to receive thewater to which it is entitled year in and year out,including especially when water is scarce.  The best wayto achieve that is to impose significant disgorgementfor Nebraska's massive gain and leave any changes to the3Official￼Alderson Reporting Company23 Still no authority to revise24 MR. McALLISTER:25 if the argument is there's a4the formula?Well, Your Honor, I thinkmistake, then we have toOfficial￼1 accounting procedures to the parties and to the process2 that has been created under the compact, the RRCA. I'd3 like to start with ­­ with the accounting procedures4 argument.5 Nebraska and the master suggest that6 the Court should rewrite the way we calculate Nebraska's7 consumption of imported water supply, but Kansas8 disagrees that that's appropriate here for several9 reasons.10 First of all, that agreement itself was a11 complex set of concessions and compromises. The model12 is, at best, an estimation of what's going on in the13 basin. No one actually knows, perhaps can know, how14 much imported water comes over from the Platte or how15 much actually gets consumed. The parties were aware of16 the very phenomenon that the master17 on.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:19 roughly what the amount of extra ­­20 the word ­­ liability on Nebraska is.

That's what justifies the2 extraordinary remedy of reformation.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought it was ­­4 it was agreed that the compact itself doesn't govern5 imported water, which this procedure covers. So if it's6 not within the compact itself, then how can it stand?7 MR. McALLISTER: Well, Your Honor, it's ­­8 it's not as black or white as the master said. By9 implication, the compact does not cover imported water.10 It never actually uses the words "imported water." It11 talks about the virgin water supply. And it's certainly12 the parties' goal to try to exclude the imported water13 from the calculation, but we did that very deliberately14 with the imported water supply15 substantial and which Nebraska16 JUSTICE GINSBURG:17 that the parties were not aware of the error that proved18 beneficial to Kansas. So you say that there were many19 compromises, tradeoffs, but in this particular result,20 the parties were not aware that the accounting21 procedures would include this imported water.22 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I disagree with that23 statement, Your Honor. They were aware that it could.24 There may not have been awareness of the magnitude25 potentially of the situation and whether, in fact, it5Alderson Reporting Companycredit, which is verygets.But I thought that ­­Official￼1 would arise. But the parties ­­ there's evidence ­­ for2 example, Colorado's expert was asked when did you first3 realize this could happen under the model and he said:4 About 15 minutes after I looked at it. The Kansas5 expert also recognized it was possible.6 All of this is an estimation. And ­­ and7 what happens, in our view, is Nebraska is saying, well,8 now we think we've come up with a better way to more9 accurately measure this based on new information, new10 modeling techniques that may be available. But there's11 a mechanism for making those changes and it's through12 the RRCA process. It wasn't a mistake. They just think13 they've got a better way to do it now.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is ­­ what is that15 mechanism? What ­­ what does that process entail?16 MR. McALLISTER: That process entails the17 chief water officers of each State and they meet18 regularly and they can and have considered changes to19 both the accounting procedures and the model. Both have20 been changed over time by agreement of the RRCA.21 It's ­­ it's kind of like what was at issue22 in the Texas v. New Mexico except there it was just two23 States and they each had to agree; now it's three24 States. And each has a vote. And if all three States25 agree on a change, then a change is made.6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 that we send it to that group and the group tries to3 work it out and if they fail to work it out, the master4 imposes a solution?5 MR. McALLISTER: Well, that's where we6 disagree that there ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. I don't8 understand, because I thought as it turns out when this9 river is dry, as it sometimes is, and there's no water10 in there, that Nebraska ­­ that they ­­ they don't ­­11 they use only imported water, which they should have12 every right to take all of it if they wanted to. But13 nonetheless, due to a mistake in the model, it counts it14 as if they were taking all the Republican River water.15 And nobody wanted that. That would be totally unfair.16 And that's what the master says and so they made a17 mistake about how the model worked. So what do you18 suggest we do about the mistake? Nothing?19 MR. McALLISTER: I suggest you do nothing20 about the mistake and send it back ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: In which case, if we do22 nothing, it's like as if I were to enter into an23 agreement and I bought 17 cows from the barn and it24 turned out the barn didn't have any cows. It just had25 horses. Okay. So we're under a mutual mistake. Now,7Alderson Reporting CompanyWill you accept that then,what do we do?      MR. McALLISTER:Official￼12345 the ­­6 MR. McALLISTER: The master certainly7 characterizes it that way, but ­­8 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. All right. Now, if I9 accept the master's characterization, what is it I'm10 supposed to do in your opinion? I ­­ I don't think if11 you have the cow or horse or something, and everybody12 agrees it's a mistake, or if they don't the judge finds13 it's a mistake, then what is a court supposed to do?14 MR. McALLISTER: Well, again, two things.15 Reformation requires clear and convincing proof of an16 actual mistake. Kansas doesn't believe that's present.17 But then the purpose of reformation is to ­­ to put18 together what the parties actually intended. And19 there's no real agreement that what the parties intended20 was the particular 5­run solution that the master21 suggests.22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now ­­ now,23 fine. Sois it all right with you if we were to write24 these words: You agree, Kansas agrees, the object is to25 get what the parties really intended; therefore, send it8                             Well, except I disagreewith the premise that it's a mutual mistake, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: But there's a finding thatAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to this group and if the group agrees, fine.  And ifthey don't agree, special master, you impose what theparties really intended.  And, of course, if they don'tMR. McALLISTER:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR.

McALLISTER:3 position, because I would like to emphasize the4 tradeoffs that went into this. We did give Nebraska a5 substantial imported water supply credit. There are in6 fact questions about whether some of that water is7 actually Republican River water being counted as8 imported water. That's ­­9 JUSTICE ALITO: You want us to apply10 ordinary contract principles on this issue of11 reformation; is that right?12 MR. McALLISTER: Well, yes. I mean, the13 high level of ­­ it's an extraordinary remedy and14 difficult to achieve and it's only to be used to put in15 place what the parties actually intended when somehow20 view 2122 ordinary contract principles?23 MR. McALLISTER: You can for disgorgement,24 although there are other theories that also support and25 justify disgorgement, which the master recognized here.10Alderson Reporting Company­­ fundamentally the KansasOfficial￼1 So the fact that the compact also has status as a ­­ as2 a statute is one. The fact that what's really being3 affected is downstream water rights, real property.4 That's another theory. We argue there's an analogy to5 fiduciary duty, we're not saying there is a fiduciary6 duty. But my point is disgorgement can be justified by7 more than contract principles here. That is one basis8 for justifying it.9 But what I wanted to say to Justice Scalia's10 point, we gave Nebraska several things in that agreement11 and we knew this model wasn't perfect. Everybody ­­ it12 can't be, it never will be. It's too complicated;13 there's too many unknowns. We gave Nebraska a high14 credit for groundwater recharge at a percentage much15 higher than Colorado and Kansas get and Nebraska crowed16 about that as a concession they got from Kansas that was17 worth 15 to $20 million annually, that's Exhibit K, 133,18 in the record. We also gave up all claims for any19 potential compact violations prior to the agreement.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the21 special master specifically found that this was not part22 of the bargaining and tradeoff.23 MR. McALLISTER: The special master was24 focused on the bottom line notion that somehow we were25 supposed to reach a bottom line accounting. And ­­ and11Alderson Reporting Company24 MR. McALLISTER:25 reach the ­­Well, I think you couldOfficial￼1 with all due respect to the special master, he's simply2 wrong that the parties did not purposely negotiate for3 calculating all of these factors, the imported water4 supply credit, the consumption of each State, the way we5 did. Kansas specifically wanted the mound turned on6 as they calculated ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: How ­­ how do we decide ­­8 is ­­ is this a question on which we have to defer to9 the master's factfinding? Is it a question of fact what10 the parties intended? Or are we to look at the11 agreement and decide it from the agreement?12 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I think you can13 certainly decide it from the agreement, Justice Scalia.14 I think the Court's cases have said things like you give15 respect to the master's findings, but it is actually a16 de novo proceeding, so there's no ­­ no deference that17 has to be given to the master's findings. And here, the18 agreement itself would ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm going to give20 more deference, I suppose, if ­­ if I think it is21 entirely relevant what the prior negotiations were, and22 that it was appropriate for him to look into that. And23 to reach the conclusion he did.12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 think it's ­­ it's the text of the agreement that3 governs, I don't care what he found about the4 negotiations.5 MR. McALLISTER: And I think you could6 certainly ignore the negotiations. What I'm saying is7 you can look in that agreement and find many tradeoffs,8 some of which benefited Nebraska significantly. Some of9 which may benefit Kansas and Colorado.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As you understand it, does11 the ­­ do both parties agree that we treat this as an12 application of reformation principles in an ordinary13 contract or is there some argument that because this14 negotiation was pursuant to provisions where a special15 master had been involved, that there is some more16 latitude for reforming the contract, so that the earlier17 special master's participation somehow gives this18 contract an equitable character and makes it easier to19 reform. Does anybody argue the latter?20 MR. McALLISTER: Certainly, Kansas doesn't.21 I ­­ I can't speak for Nebraska.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. Well, I want23 you to know ­­ as I understand Nebraska's position, they24 argue that ordinary contract principles apply. I may be25 wrong.13Alderson Reporting CompanyIf on the other hand, IOfficial￼1 MR. McALLISTER:2 my reading. So I don't think anyone is suggesting a3 lesser standard. And in fact, taking it back to Special4 Master McKusick, when he approved this, at the urging of5 people, including my colleague, Mr. Cookson, who said,6 Special Master, this is close enough, you know, it's not7 perfect, but everything comes out in the wash, it's more8 or less a good deal for everyone. And Special Master9 McKusick said, no party represents this is perfect, and10 that there might not be other ways to do this. But this11 is a reasonable way to resolve the dispute in ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, can I try to better13 understand what you think would have been different in14 the contract. Suppose that Nebraska had come in with15 the 5­run proposal at ­­ when you were negotiating this,16 and said this is really a much better way of doing what17 we all agree we ought to do, which is separate out the18 virgin water from the imported water.19 What would have been different in the20 contract? What would you have done ­­ what provisions21 would you not have had if? If that 5­run proposal had22 been there and you had accepted it.23 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I ­­ I can mention24 three or four things that might be different.25 Obviously, it's hypothetical, but one thing that the14Alderson Reporting CompanyThat's ­­ I agree.  That'sOfficial￼1 5­run solution does is it does take care of the imported2 water issue, but it actually increases the problem with3 the unaccounted­for depletions from groundwater pumping,4 which is what the whole prior round of litigation was5 about, was that those count under the compact, too. And6 so the master's solution may solve, if you will, one7 problem, the problem that Nebraska sees, it exacerbates8 another problem. So we'd certainly want to talk about9 that. That was what the 16­run solution did a better10 job of, but Colorado objected to that because their ox11 was being gored. That's why they came around when they12 made a deal with Nebraska to the 5­run.13 But the other things that could be14 negotiated here, certainly, their groundwater recharge15 amount is very generous to them. Again, they said 15 to16 20 million annually. That's worth ­­ we could revisit17 that. We could revisit an issue of they get credit for18 water that's coming back on irrigated lands to the19 groundwater, but some of that is probably precipitation20 that's infiltrating. That's not fully accounted for.21 Even the imported water supply credit is22 probably unduly generous, because it likely includes23 some Republican Basin water in it. So what ­­ what I'm24 suggesting, I think there are a number of things we25 could negotiate about, but it's not fair to pick out15Alderson Reporting Company6 all should be in play here.7 it goes to the RRCA process.8 could negotiate this out.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:But our preference is that That's where the StatesOfficial￼1 this one thing that the master got focused on and saw as2 a black or white issue, when it's really not, and say3 I'm going to fix this one thing, and too bad, Kansas and4 even perhaps Colorado, everything else we're not going5 to touch. It all should go to the RRCA process or itMr. McAllister, I10 thought that the special master, if I read his report11 right, had invited you to come in and tell him a better12 solution to the problem. And you guys didn't put forth13 one.14 MR. McALLISTER: Well, my understanding is15 Kansas had worked on one, sometimes referred to as the16 integrated solution, I think, and it was to approximate17 closer what we call the virgin water supply metric, but18 had not had time, did not get it developed. These19 things are not just spur of the moment, you can come up20 with an answer quickly.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's assume, as we22 have, that we're going to credit ­­ I know you don't23 want us to ­­ but let's assume that we're going to24 credit the special master's finding that this was a25 mutual mistake. Generally, as I understand it under16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 ordinary contract principles, the remedy is not contract2 formation. It's rescission. And I don't think you want3 that.4 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I don't know that any5 of us would want that at the end of the day.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So if you7 don't want rescission, what you're left with is contract8 formation. And you're absolutely right, the parties9 never discussed this 5­run solution during their10 negotiations.11 So it's not as you're ­­ as if you're12 reforming the calculus. You're reforming ­­ you're13 trying to fix the mistake. So what's left? Equitable14 and just solution. And if you didn't put forth an15 alternative, why shouldn't we accept the special16 master's judgment on the 5­mile run?17 MR. McALLISTER: Well, one reason we didn't18 put forth the alternative is this notion of mutual19 mistake actually came up extremely late in the process.20 It wasn't until the very end. In fact, Nebraska all21 along didn't call it that. They ­­ they talked about22 changing the accounting procedures. And it was the23 master who finally labeled it as a mutual mistake. And24 so ­­2517JUSTICE SCALIA:It seems to me, it's ratherAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 like asking a man who believes he's been wrongfully2 convicted whether he would like to die by the firing3 squad or the electric chair.

McALLISTER: Exactly.JUSTICE SCALIA: And for the master to ask oh, you tell me what remedy I should impose, you9 MR. McALLISTER:10 leave it to the process.11 JUSTICE SCALIA:12 telling him.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:14 this problem should go to the RCRA process. Each State15 has a representative. Your ­­ your representative has16 an absolute veto in the RCRA process.17 MR. McALLISTER: And so does each of their18 States.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so you're20 feeling pretty good about your chances if you send it21 back to the RCRA.22 MR. McALLISTER: No, Your Honor. I would ­­23 I would tell you a quick story and then make a point24 about that.

He shouldI don't blame you for not       You say ­­ you sayOfficial￼1 we all resolve that we will comply with the compact.2 Kansas voted yes, Colorado voted yes, and Nebraska voted3 no.4 So this goes back a long ways. But ­­ but I5 think if ­­ if the notion is ­­ that's why I think it's6 unfair to pick out the 5­run solution. The things I7 just mentioned to Justice Kagan, if we talked about8 infiltration by precipitation, if we talked about the9 groundwater recharge amounts, if we put other things on10 the table, then I think we have things to talk about,11 including the 5­run solution.12 But Nebraska just wants to pull out this one13 thing and have it mandated in their favor. No14 negotiation. I mean, the fact that negotiation can work15 is demonstrated by Colorado here initially being ­­16 sided with Kansas, both opposing the 16­run solution.17 And then Nebraska came along and said, well, let's try a18 different way, and Colorado said, well, actually, that19 way works to our ­­ our advantage, we like that, we'll20 go along with that. That shows that the negotiation and21 the horse trading can work in this setting if given a22 chance. But I do think we have to have more than one23 thing to negotiate over. The other point I'd make ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you ­­ did you ­­25 suggest that there were other issues like this that19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 favored Nebraska, so that if the accounting procedure2 was going to be opened up on this point, that there were3 other things the special master should have considered?4 MR. McALLISTER: I believe the litigation in5 front of the special master, Justice Ginsburg, was6 mostly just saying, you shouldn't change anything, you7 should leave this to the process. I'm not sure in front8 of the master we got deeply into other things that might9 be changed with regard to the model.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen ­­ I11 think Justice Breyer asked you ­­ if it goes to the12 commission and they are unable to agree? What's the13 next step?14 MR. McALLISTER: Well, there is the option15 of nonbinding arbitration, which we all love and almost16 always works out our disputes. And then from there,17 we'd go, presumably, to try ­­ you know, if any of the18 States feel strongly enough about it, would probably19 come back with a request for a special master.20 But again, I don't think we'll get there21 because the parties can and have negotiated22 successfully. When we can't do it is when you pick out23 one discreet thing and put the court or the master's24 thumb on the side of the State. Well, then there's25 nothing left to negotiate about.20Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. McALLISTER:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR.

And here it has gotten their attention and it has also gotten Colorado's attention, as you see in the briefs.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.     Ms. O'Connell.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL ON BEHALFOF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAEMS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:     There are two primary points that the UnitedStates would like to make. First, it is important that disgorgement be an available remedy for breach of an interstate water compact. Unlike a regular contract between private parties, interstate water compacts are laws of the United States that apportion a scarce resource among sovereigns. It is important that water flows down the river, not just money, and the availability of a disgorgement remedy will help to stabilize compacts and ensure that States are working vigorously to meet their compact obligations.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the same about contracts. I mean, no ­­ nobody is saying that disgorgement is not a remedy for contracts, right?24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 be the conditions under which disgorgement is imposed.3 Does it require an intentional violation or not?4 That's ­­ that's all the debate is about here.5 MS. O'CONNELL: Right. And it typically6 does for ­­ for disgorgement of profits or some amount7 of profits. And although Section 39 of the Restatement8 of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment ­­ that's the9 provision on opportunistic breach ­­ says that it10 requires a deliberate breach, and the master did find11 here that this was not deliberate, we ­­ we're drawn to12 that provision because the Court has said repeatedly a13 compact is like a contract.14 But there are lots of principles that are15 equally applicable here, including Section 40 of the16 Restatement, which talks about interference with17 property rights. And if you interfere with another18 party's property rights and gain a profit from that,19 then the remedy for a conscious wrongdoer ­­ and I think20 the master's finding or conclusion about Nebraska's21 intent here is that of a conscious wrongdoer, that they22 knowingly exposed Kansas to a risk of a breach.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the Restatement24 base that on? Did they just make that up?

O'CONNELL:JUSTICE SCALIA:Restatement says it, we ­­ we've got to believe it? How many cases are there that impose disgorgement wherethere is no intentional violation, but property rights are involved. Do you have a lot of cases?MS. O'CONNELL: Well, there's no deliberate violation, but I think if you're finding that somebody is a conscious wrongdoer and that they ­­ they recklessly violated the compact, which I think is about what the conscious wrongdoer standard is akin to, then yes.

O'CONNELL: Well ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there cases that ­­5 that have established that rule?6 MS. O'CONNELL: In Texas v. New Mexico,7 the Court, when it was talking about why awarding money8 damages is not ­­ shouldn't be a concern that States9 will just continue to violate compacts as long as they10 can send money down the river, the Court said, we don't11 really need to worry about that because there's always12 the possibility of ordering specific performance plus13 whatever additional penalty might be warranted for a14 deliberate breach.15 And even ­­ I mean, the Court wasn't saying16 in that case it has to be deliberate or setting forth a17 legal standard, but I think this Court has ­­ has18 indicated that disgorgement may be appropriate when you19 have an intentional breach or something.20 JUSTICE ALITO: If disgorgement is21 appropriate, and I have a question about that, where did22 this $1.8 million figure come from? Out of thin air.23 Is this an approximation of attorneys' fees or expert24 costs? Where did it come from?27Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 part of the special master's opinion that is ­­ is2 pretty much unexplained. And we're not here to defend3 1.8. I think we said this in footnote 1 of our brief.4 It's not our intention to say that we think 1.8 is the5 exact right amount. What we are saying is that the6 master, because he weighed all of the different things7 that you would want to look at when you're determining8 whether you want to look at disgorgement ­­ whether9 Nebraska profited, whether Nebraska had intent or was a10 conscious wrongdoer, whether there was any need for11 deterrence ­­ the master looked at all of the things12 that you should be looking at.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how would you set the14 amount in a circumstance like this? What would you15 think an explanation would look like?16 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, we haven't taken a17 position of what exactly the amount should be. What ­­18 what we have tried to say in the brief is if the Court19 wanted to go with what the special master said and award20 $5.5 million, which is a21 Nebraska's gain, then it22 not an arbitrary amount.23 amount you choose if you're balancing equities would be24 arbitrary.

If ­­ if the master thinks that11 disgorgement is necessary, you look to the unjust12 enrichment, that's the number you choose, there's no13 other discretion. Or is there some other discretion,14 and if so, what would you look to and how would you base15 the award?16 MS. O'CONNELL: I think there ­­ there is17 discretion and there is certainly support for that in18 the Restatement where if you are, you know, if you are a19 conscious wrongdoer, you can typically get your profits20 taken away. If you're an innocent party, you might just21 have the property taken away from you, but you can keep22 the profits. If you're somewhere in the middle, if23 you're negligent or it's just an ordinary breach of24 contract, Restatement section 52 says that you can25 choose or adjust the level of disgorgement based on the29Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425­­ the wrongful conduct of the party.JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. O'Connell, we've ­­we've had a lot of compact ­­ water compact cases before this Court.

Unjust enrichment is not the only6 purpose of disgorgement, but also a need to deter is7 something else that you look at. And what the master8 concluded here was that Nebraska had all the tools in9 its toolkit now to comply with the compact going forward10 and that perhaps the 1.8 million was just the push it11 needed to make sure that it was conscientiously using12 those tools that it had.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we're dealing14 here with an agreement between States. And it seems to15 me particularly important that they have some idea about16 what they're agreeing to based on our ­­ our precedent.17 And particularly since the special master, according to18 your position, has such broad discretion. It can be19 zero, it can be 40 ­­ 20 million, whatever the maximum20 is here. I'm not sure that the States bargain for that21 exposure.22 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, when the States agreed23 to an equitable apportionment of the compact, I mean,24 the ­­ this Court does have all of the tools of equity25 available to it to ensure that there's a fair solution31Alderson Reporting Company6 if you wanted to go7 to what the special8 an arbitrary amount9 JUSTICE KAGAN:with and ­­ and give some preferencemaster did, that 5.5 million is notbased on the weighing that he did.Can I understand your 10 position, Ms. O'Connell, on whether this is just aOfficial￼1 imposed. And it's not just the special master's2 decision. I mean, this Court could certainly award a3 different amount of damages. It is de novo review.4 It's up to you to determine what you think is fair.5 I think what ­­ what we've put forth is that11 contract or whether it's something else entirely? I12 mean, should we be looking solely to contract rules or13 is your position that because public rights and public14 interests are affected here, we have a different kind of15 obligation?16 MS. O'CONNELL: I think it's not17 specifically just contract rules when the Court is18 exercising its original jurisdiction. The Court has19 said many times, in Ohio v. Kentucky, that its ­­ its20 jurisdiction in original cases is equitable. It's an21 equitable division of the water that underlies the22 compact and so the Court is just deciding what it thinks23 is fair as the remedy ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. A lot of25 contracts ­­ my goodness. Equity courts adjudicate32Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425contract rights sometimes.MS. O'CONNELL: Right.JUSTICE SCALIA: So, I mean, the ­­ theissue is whether normal contract principles apply, whether they are the principles dealing with law or the principles dealing with equity. And disgorgement is an example.MS. O'CONNELL: Right.JUSTICE SCALIA: And normal contract principles say an equity court will not give disgorgement unless there's an intentional violation. So I don't think your appeal to equity carries the day at all.MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Scalia, though, I do want to point out the ­­ the deliberate breach that you're talking about is one particular, like breach of contract type of ­­ of a violation of a ­­ of a party's rights.As I mentioned before, there's a lot ofdifferent analogies to what's happened here and one of them is interference with somebody's property.

O'CONNELL: We just ­­ I want to point out, and the parties can correct me if I'm wrong, but this issue has already been to the Republican River Compact Administration and Kansas wouldn't agree to it, and there was an arbitration about Nebraska's crediting dispute. We described that in pages 8 and 9 of our brief, and we support the master's recommendation to reform the compact.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.     Mr. Cookson.     ORAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID D. COOKSONON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTSMR. COOKSON: Mr. Chief Justice, may itplease the Court:     This Court should affirm the specialmaster's report except for his award of exemplarydamages that is not justified in this case. If I could, I would turn to the Court's questions regarding what is the deal and why should this Court reform the Technical Appendix C, which is the accounting procedures.     The deal between the parties is found in the34Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Final Settlement Stipulation that this Court approved in 2003. Section IV F expressly provides that this compact accounting will not count imported Platte River water supply as part of the Republican River Basin, in part because that's ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: And the ­­ it went on to say how ­­ how you will determine whether there is such water supply.     MR. COOKSON:     JUSTICE SCALIA:     MR. COOKSON:     JUSTICE SCALIA:     MR. COOKSON:     JUSTICE SCALIA:formula, right?     MR. COOKSON:    That is ­­       It went on to determine    That is correct, Your Honor.       Through a formula.    That is correct, Your Honor.       And they agreed to that    Right.  But the deal we boughtThe deal we bought was we're notthat.Official￼was not the formula.going to count imported water that is inconsistent withthe terms of the compact.JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume two parties ­­ I come into an antique store and I see this ­­ this item of furniture that I like, and I talk it over with the ­­ with the owner, and I say, you know, let ­­ let's cometo a fair price on this.He says, yes, that's what I35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 want to do, too. Let's have a fair price. And we write2 it down. It's going to be a fair price. And the fair3 price is $200. Okay?4 It turns out this thing is worth more than5 $200. Okay? But both the antique dealer and I know6 that this is a game of rolling the dice, that ­­ that7 the risks you take when you buy and you sell antiques is8 thatit's worth more.And that's the same risk here. The parties that this formula would not be entirely accurate910 knew11 and they agreed to a fair price, that is, none of this12 water should be counted. But they said the way to13 figure out whether this water is coming in or not is14 this 1516 That 17formula.Why shouldn't they be held to that formula?­­ that was the deal.MR. COOKSON: Because in Section I F of the18 Final Settlement Stipulations, the parties made it clear19 that the RRCA could modify the accounting procedures at20 any time through its process, which, as the SG's office21 correctly noted, we did. We went through the RRCA.22 Kansas objected. We went through nonbinding23 arbitration. The master agreed the mistake occurred,24 sent it back to the RRCA to develop a solution. This25 was all presented to Kansas in 2007.36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 But under ­­ to your point, Your Honor, the2 deal we made was not to count imported water. Kansas'3 own expert testified that the purposes of the accounting4 procedure and the groundwater model are to effectuate5 the terms of the Final Settlement Stipulation. The6 master agreed. And it's undisputed between all of the7 parties that the accounting procedures are acting in8 direct conflict to both Section IV F of the Final9 Settlement Stipulation, and to Article III of the10 Compact, which allocates water originating ­­11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that ordinary12 principles of contract law should guide our decision on13 the reformation issue, or is this something that's not14 an ordinary contract? If this were a stipulation in15 ongoing litigation, I could understand that we want to16 give the court substantial power to alter the17 stipulation. But this stipulation was reached as part18 of a final a judgment that was made and that case is19 closed. So isn't it just like a contract or is it20 subject to revision more easily than a contract because21 it was a stipulation? It's a stipulation that's closed;22 it's just like a contract, isn't it?23 MR. COOKSON: In this instance, Your Honor,24 the Technical Appendix is more like the ongoing matter25 because the parties specifically bargained in37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Section I F of the Final Settlement Stipulation that we2 would be able to modify the accounting procedures ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that ­­ well, that's4 just like saying the parties can amend this contract,5 right? I mean, those procedures take the consent of6 each one of the parties. So that amounts to saying7 nothing except what is obvious and would be the law even8 if it were not said, that the parties, by mutual9 agreement, can amend the contract. Does it mean10 anything different from that?11 MR. COOKSON: It does, Your Honor, because12 there's ­­ in the Final Settlement Stipulation, the13 parties agree we're not going to change it. That ­­14 there is a non­severability clause. That is the bargain15 that 1617 this18 contract, to me, is more like the antique dealer and the19 customer promised to buy all of the Ming vases, andoccurred between the parties.JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work? I mean, can't be the first time this came up. The20 they'll determine if it's a Ming vase according to a21 technical method in the appendix, and the appendix22 happens to throw in not only the Ming vases but all the23 Tang vases and nobody thinks they should get the Tang24 vases. Okay.25 So that's the deal.38Alderson Reporting CompanySo we go to the judge.Official￼1 And one way is reformation, but they say no, no, it's a2 contracts deal, it's all closed, you can't ­­ another3 way is rescission. Okay. Rescission, apparently nobody4 wants that. Because there was a mutual mistake, they5 rescind. Okay. You must have read ­­ there must be6 thousands of cases with algorithms. I mean, we live in7 a world where there are algorithms, there are computers,8 there is the Internet, there is this formula, that9 formula.10 It can't be the first time that somebody in11 a contract has made a technical mistake about the12 algorithm to be used for determining the object. So13 what do the contract courts do?14 MR. COOKSON: Well, specifically the special15 master referred to two cases that ­­ before this Court.16 In Texas v. New Mexico the parties determined that the17 1947 version of an algorithm, the inflow/outflow steady18 plan to the Pecos River Compact, was completely19 unreliable. And this Court approved special master20 Brightenstein's reformulation of the inflow/outflow and21 that was an appendix to the compact. Here we're only22 talking about an appendix to a settlement stipulation23 that this Court approved.24 Likewise, in Wisconsin v. Michigan this25 Court entered a consent decree dealing with islands in39Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. COOKSON:JUSTICE SCALIA:No, Your Honor, it was not.   That was just addedOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Lake Michigan between Wisconsin and Michigan, butneglected to address an issue regarding where is theboundary in Green Bay.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any authority that a settlement agreement is more subject to reformation than a regular contract? Is there any authority for that proposition?MR. COOKSON: Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, don't you, that you couldn't ­­ the special master couldn't have revised the formula if it had been part of the compact itself?MR. COOKSON: That's correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? MR. COOKSON: Because the compact isapproved by Congress and it is not for the parties, andas this Court said in Alabama v. North Carolina, forthis Court to add terms to the compact that's beenapproved by Congress without congressionalauthorization.JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the appendix included in it when it was submitted to Congress?40Alderson Reporting Company4 States, the compact administration, which we5 the RRCA, would meet and establish rules and6 that were not inconsistent with the compact.7 actually did not occur until 1961.8 Justice Scalia: I see, I see...now know asregulationsThatOfficial￼1 afterwards?2 MR. COOKSON: In 1943 when the compact was3 complied, article 9 provides that at some point the9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I do think, though,10 it is still, the FSS is an agreement between two11 sovereigns, and I think, putting aside what contract12 principles may provide as a general matter, that the13 idea of a special master or this Court changing the14 nature of that agreement is a pretty radical one.15 MR. COOKSON: But we're not changing that16 agreement. The agreement in the final settlement17 stipulation is do not count imported Platte River18 water ­­19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Cookson, suppose the20 following: The parties are there and they're around the21 table and everybody agrees: We should not count Platte22 River water, we should only count Republican River23 water. But everybody also agrees that that's easier24 said than done and the devil is in the details. And25 there are three different plans for ­­ three different41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 formulas for how not to count Platte River water and2 instead only to count Republican River water.3 And each of these the parties think ­­ you4 know, the parties first, how accurate is that formula,5 but those formulas also do a range of other things that6 the parties may care about. And so there's a bargain7 and a negotiation about which of these three formulas to8 use in order to reach the result of not counting Platte9 River water and in order also to further the parties'10 other objectives, and one is chosen. Why isn't that one11 the one that continues to govern under the agreement?12 MR. COOKSON: Because the parties recognized13 in negotiating the agreement, and this was recognized by14 both Special Master McKusick in the first generation and15 Special Master Kayatta that we were proceeding with the16 notion that, as the technical appendix, Appendix C, the17 accounting procedures, moved forward, we would make18 changes. We've made roughly 14 changes to the19 accounting procedure through the process of the RRCA and20 agreement of the compact administrators.21 And what we have here is a Texas v. New22 Mexico situation, where Kansas has exercised its veto23 right, and in that case this Court said that the States24 may come to this Court, and in this case a special25 master, to seek vindication of its rights to correct42Alderson Reporting Company2324 that25 it'sSo they ­­ it's incorporated directly inprocedure that this is only a credit and thatgoing to be ­­ any credit shall be calculated in43Official￼1 what everyone agrees is a mistake that's not only in2 violation of the final settlement stipulation, but3 expanding the terms of the compact beyond what4 Congress intended.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the6 general rule that the specific controls the general?7 You have the general statement here, okay, we're not8 going to count imported water, but then you have a very9 specific calculation about how you're going to achieve10 that result. So why doesn't that control?11 MR. COOKSON: Because in this instance the12 specific statement in the deal is we're not going to13 count imported water supply. The accounting procedures,14 as all parties testified including Kansas, was simply15 the means, the tools, if you will, to effectuate the16 specific agreement of the parties.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, but it was18 clear that you knew19 the provision says.20 supply credit shall21 RRCA accounting procedures and by using the RRCA22 groundwater model.shouldn't count it because that's what  But then it says any imported waterbe calculated in accordance with theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 accordance with the procedures set forth therein. What2 gives us the right to, the special master or anyone,3 under reformation principles to create a new procedure4 because the 5­run mile protocol is a new procedure that5 they never agreed to.6 There's no argument that this is a procedure7 you put forth. It wasn't part of the original8 negotiations. This is a reformation that's one­sided.9 It's what you want. Or two; maybe Colorado does.10 So how do we11 principles, under12 do that?13 MR. COOKSON:14 the accounting provisions or each of the provisions of15 the final settlement stipulation that deal with16 accounting you will find that same language that you17 just quoted. In other words, the parties understood18 that they were not baking into the final settlement19 stipulation how they were going to do the accounting.20 They were going to refer to the technical appendix,21 which it is, it's an appendix to the final settlement22 stipulation, that this is how we'll do it and this is23 how the model will do it, understanding that at the time24 the final settlement stipulation and the accounting25 procedures were agreed to, the parties ­­ the States had44get there?

COOKSON:     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:contract principle or equitable principle permits us tocreate a procedure that they haven't agreed to?MR. COOKSON: Because it's the exact same situation that this Court exercised in Texas v. New Mexico with the appendix to that compact with the inflow/outflow model that the special master referred to.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you read Texas v. New Mexico as reforming the compact?MR. COOKSON: No. And I don't read what the special master has done here as reforming the compact. This is a technical appendix ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, or reforming the accounting procedures, I should say. Do you read Texas v. New Mexico as reforming anything?MR. COOKSON: It reforms the inflow and outflow steady plan to conform to the intent of the45Alderson Reporting CompanySo again ­­     All right.  You haven'tI believe ­­      ­­ which is whatOfficial￼1 parties in the Pecos River Compact.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just by appointing a3 special master to monitor it over time, correct?4 MR. COOKSON:5 issue other than the6 inflow/outflow study7 U.S.8 JUSTICE BREYER:9 extraneous question but I'm curious in light of the ­­10 part of this argument is about money. We can deal with11 that. But this part about the accounting, my instinct12 is that farmers and others who use the water have to13 know, and it hurts them when another 5 years goes by14 without anybody understanding what the procedure is.15 All right. Both sides say that, you know,16 you should be able to work this out. It looks as if what17 you're facing are nine people ­­ I'm not speaking for the18 other eight I'm just speaking for myself ­­ who couldn't19 know less about it, all right, and we're supposed to20 decide whether some system here is going to work or not.21 And that can be another 5 years. Is there any chance that22 you all could work this out?23 MR. COOKSON: I think, Your Honor, that what24 the special master has presented is not something that25 requires 5 years to work out.46      That was over a differentoriginal reformation of thethat was done at, I believe 446Alderson Reporting CompanyThis is a slightlyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 made an argument that if you look at the contract law,3 you will see that rescission is the normal remedy for4 this kind of a mistake rather than reformation. And you5 apparently, at some level, agree with that because what6 you've pointed to are not normal contract cases. You7 pointed to two cases involving State compacts in this8 Court.9 And suppose that I think that that is10 actually a difficult question.11 MR. COOKSON: I would suggest, Your Honor,12 that it is appropriate beyond contract principles, as13 you did in Texas v. New Mexico, to conform the terms of14 the accounting procedures to the final settlement so15 that they are consistent with both the compact and the16 final settlement stipulation.17 And to ­­ Mr. Chief Justice, to your18 question, this is significant. As the special master19 found, had he chosen to apply this retroactively, it20 would have reduced Nebraska's violation in 2006 by 2021 percent. And ongoing forward into the future is a22 significant amount. So it was both material, it was23 mutual, and it was significant.24 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, this may be an unfair25 question, so if you are not prepared to answer it,47Alderson Reporting CompanyThat's true, but they'veOfficial￼1 that's fine. But just out of curiosity, which would you2 prefer, a decision that agrees with the special master3 on both reformation and disgorgement or a decision that4 disagrees with the special master on both reformation5 and disgorgement?6 MR. COOKSON: I would agree with your7 characterization, Your Honor, that from my perspective8 that is probably not fair because we believe ­­9 (Laughter.)10 MR. COOKSON: ­­ the law and the facts11 justify reformation, they do not justify disgorgement,12 and they should not ­­ and there is no inherent or13 implied linkage of the two.14 And if I might turn to the disgorgement15 issue, obviously Nebraska excepted to the award of16 disgorgement because it did not act deliberately to17 violate the compact. Nor was ­­18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask what that means19 exactly? You know, because the special master said,20 well, it wasn't a deliberate breach. But the special21 master also said essentially what the SG ­­ how the SG22 characterized it, that you were a conscious wrongdoer,23 that you failed to act, refused to act in the face of a24 known risk and that the quite foreseeable effect of your25 actions was going to be, unless there was some very48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 lucky fortuitous thing that happened, the quite2 foreseeable effect of your actions was going to be that3 Kansas didn't have enough water.4 MR. COOKSON: Your Honor, I would point5 to ­­ I would respond to that in two ways. One, the6 master not only found there was not a deliberate intent7 to violate at page 111 of his report, but he also said8 Nebraska did not exercise a consciously opportunistic9 breach in the nature of an efficient breach at page 13110 of his report.11 But factually we have excepted to his12 finding of knowing and the findings that Nebraska13 somehow did nothing. Nebraska seized control of its14 consumptive use in 2002 while it was still negotiating15 the compact, and through 2006 reduced its pumping by16 over 500 million ­­ or 500,000 acre­feet, a 35 percent17 reduction.18 At the same time, however, Nebraska could19 not reasonably foresee that its allocations were going20 to fall even below the historical low period of record21 in this basin, which was the Dust Bowl.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG:23 say that was the risk that24 so ­­ and he said they did25 enough and it wasn't until49     Didn't the special masterNebraska should have known,this and that, but it wasn't2007 that they came intoAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 compliance in a way that didn't put Kansas in jeopardy.2 But he said all along Nebraska knew that Kansas3 might well be the loser, because Nebraska didn't take4 adequate steps. It was aware of the risk to Kansas,5 right?6 MR. COOKSON: No, we would not agree with7 the master's characterization of what was reasonably8 foreseeable, Your Honor.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but assume that the10 master's characterization as to that holds, that that's11 a matter of fact that we're not going to overturn; that12 he said that you knew that there was a risk and that the13 risk was a substantial one, that Kansas would end up on14 the short end of the stick in violation of the compact.15 I mean if that's the case, what does it even mean to say16 that you did not deliberately breach?17 MR. COOKSON: If you look at the master's18 report on page 111, he outlines the significant steps19 that Nebraska took from the beginning, including a20 substantial rewrite of its State water laws to ensure21 that its regulatory actions going forward ­­ and we did22 that in 2004 after this Court approved the final23 settlement stipulation in 2003. We started reducing24 pumping in 2002 and in 2003 and in 2004.25 But, again, to get to the characterization50Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of being reasonably foreseeable, understand that the2 compact allocations that you find in the compact before3 you were based on a 10­year period of the Dust Bowl, the4 historic low period. It was reasonable for Nebraska to5 rely that it would not go below the period of the Dust6 Bowl. And yet in '05 and '06, our allocations7 significantly fell below the Dust Bowl, and had they8 simply stayed at the Dust Bowl level, Nebraska would9 have been in compliance in 2005 and 2006 with the added10 water given to Nebraska by the special master under the11 imported water supply and the Harlan County event.12 There was nothing in the historical record to13 that we would go below the period of the Dust14 the time15 compact.16 And17 efforts,18 that we fell short in 2006. We conceded that we19 violated the compact. We offered to pay Kansas its20 actual expectation loss, its actual damages. And we21 moved forward with additional tools so that the next22 time this occurred, Nebraska would be in a position23 where it could stay in compliance. And as the master24 found, with the tools in place now, had we had those in25 2002 to 2006, Nebraska would have been in compliance51we were taking action to comply withsuggestBowl atthewas clearwe acted reasonably in measuring ourand we continued our efforts when itAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 even in the driest condition now of record in the basin.2 And we've added additional tools, should it get dryer,3 to address it.4 So for these reasons, disgorgement is not5 appropriate. There is no reason to incentivize6 Nebraska. There is no need to deter Nebraska.7 Moreover, there is no need for an injunctive relief, as8 the U.S. and Nebraska agree with the special master on9 this interest. We believe the Court should conform the10 accounting procedures to meet the compact. And it11 should not award disgorgement absent a deliberate act,12 which is not to be found in this case.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does disgorgement and14 injunction ­­ do the two go together?15 MR. COOKSON: No, Your Honor.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's inappropriate to17 issue an injunction, is it always inappropriate to18 require disgorgement? Are they both looking to the19 future, so that if there is no realistic possibility of20 future violation, you cannot issue an injunction and you21 should not require disgorgement? Is that a correct22 statement?23 MR. COOKSON: In our view, yes, disgorgement24 should not be used as a future­looking tool. Injunctive25 relief is the appropriate remedy, and in this case the52Alderson Reporting Company25 MR. COOKSON:This Court ­­Official￼1 facts don't justify it.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure you've3 answered my question. You say it should not be used as4 a future tool. So it can be used even though it's not5 being imposed in order to deter future action.6 MR. COOKSON: Well, in the context that7 Kansas sought in this case, they were seeking to ­­ from8 the initial arbitration through the trial with the9 master, Kansas sought unjust enrichment as a means of10 disgorging gain to Nebraska, and they also sought11 specific injunctive relief, more specific than what they12 have accepted to the Court now. So they sought both in13 the context of this litigation.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do I understand15 your answer to be that disgorgement serves at least an16 additional function beyond the injunction, sort of an17 unjust enrichment element? You've got to disgorge your18 profit in a typical contract case?19 MR. COOKSON: Yes, it does serve that20 function in a case where, as this Court suggested, there21 is a deliberate act, yes.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you get in a normal23 contract case both your damages and disgorgement? I24 always thought you were put to the choice.53Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 damages or you sue for unjust enrichment. Can you do3 both?

McALLISTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief15 Justice, and may it please the Court:16 I wanted to go back to something17 Justice Kagan correctly identified as that when these18 procedures were negotiated there were lots of options on19 the table. In fact, the groundwater model option the20 parties chose was not Kansas's first choice. It was21 Nebraska's first choice. And these kind of trade­offs22 were being made, and I think this case is directly23 analogous to New Hampshire v. Maine, which is talked24 about in the briefs, where those two States reached a25 boundary agreement. And the Court said, well, your54CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. McAllister, 2 minutes.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 agreement may not be perfect, but you were dealing with2 some vague terms, some uncertainties, you've done3 something reasonable, we bless it. 25 years later New4 Hampshire came back and said: You know, we made a bad5 deal. We'd like you to undo it because we shouldn't6 have agreed to that 25 years ago.7 And the Court gave New Hampshire the answer8 we think you should give Nebraska today, which is:9 Sorry; you made the deal, and just because you now think10 you have a better way of doing it doesn't mean we should11 rewrite the contract.12 If the Court rewrites the contract here, the13 compact ­­ well, the procedures which are part and14 parcel, as the United States recognizes of the FSS ­­15 there is no clear black and white distinction between16 the procedures and the settlement agreement, they don't17 work unless they are both present. If you rewrite them18 now, it opens the door ­­ if Kansas comes up with a19 better way 2 years from now to measure this, then we20 would be able to come back. And if Nebraska says no,21 we'd come all the way to this Court again, saying: You22 know, there was a mistake because there was a better way23 than 2425 morethe 5­run solution to do this.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McAllister, how much are you going to get under the accounting55Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425procedures as they exist without the 5­mile run? MR. McALLISTER: Yeah, I believe on anannual basis the difference is on the order of 8 to 10,000 acre feet. So that's the difference in what ­­ Nebraska wants that much more taken out of its consumptive use.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me money?MR. McALLISTER: Oh, what it's worth in money? Well, that's a big dispute. I mean, the master when he valued the gain used some figures from Nebraska evidence that was $362 per acre foot. There are other ways to try to value the water, and we haven't tried to quantify that amount. The reason it matters to us is it affects actually the total amount we get.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
