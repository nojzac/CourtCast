MADIGAN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          This Court has made clear on several occasions,including 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond,that a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a FourthAmendment search, and if something is neither a search nora seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendmentjustification.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, we've held that it'scertainly not a -- a full-blown search.  It's not a searchin the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in-- in thethat is athat thissomethingsearch atof a kindclassic sense either.  We -- we have said thatkind of seizure.Why do -- I think your -- your argument assumesfor -- for purposes of search analogies thatis either a -- a full-dress search or it's not aall.  Why isn't there a -- a possibility of --of middle ground on searches just as there is on31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 seizures?2 MS. MADIGAN: Well, this Court made clear in3 Arizona v. Hicks that it did not want to go down the road4 of creating something known as a quasi-search so that5 courts and police officers would be in the position of6 trying to determine whether or not something was a search7 or not.89 imagine  JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, I -- I can -- I can justthe problems, but I mean, what -- I think what'sthe -- what's bothering me about the case is that10 -- what11 if we persist in -- in saying that -- that it's -- that12 it's an either and or question with no question with no13 possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the14 police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage15 in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that16 prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any17 homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog18 gets a sniff of something when the door is opened. We're19 -- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog20 intrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's21 bothering me. Why -- why should we -- why should we open22 that vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle23 ground that would prevent it?24 MS. MADIGAN: Well, I would25 reality that dog sniffs by their very41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005start with thenature, as this￼1 Court recognized in both Place and Edmond, are very unique2 both in terms of the manner in which the sniff is3 conducted, as well as the content of -- of the information4 that the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going5 to be able to reveal the presence or absence of6 contraband. And this Court has recognized that7 individuals have no privacy interest in the possession of8 contraband.9JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that imply that youryes to the question?  If we say, as you urge, ais not a search, then the police are free toand down every street in the country with dogs10 answer is11 dog sniff12 parade up13 sniffing car trunks.14 MS. MADIGAN: Yes. Because a sniff is not a15 search, a police officer would be able to take a16 narcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her.17 I can tell you that because of the limited resources --18 and this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association19 of Chiefs20 likely to2122 State of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train23 their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people. They24 only use them25 But1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400on objects.yes, in answer to both of your questions,5Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOof Police amicus brief -- that that is notoccur.In addition, I can also tell you that in the￼1 because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs2 could be used to walk down streets. They could,3 hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they4 are used in parking lots.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are used. I mean, we6 don't have to make it up. From cases we've had here, we7 know that they're used in places like bus depots to -- to8 sniff luggage that -- that passengers have carried through9 on -- on buses.10 MS. MADIGAN: Yes, they are.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the republic seems to have12 survived.13 MS. MADIGAN: I agree.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One could characterize those15 episodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine. I16 mean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would17 not put up with walking up and down an ordinary street.18 So the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. These aren't sniffs for --20 for explosives. These are sniffs for drugs and -- and21 these -- these are not buses that are coming in from22 France. They're coming in from one American city to23 another. And -- and there's no more need in -- in that24 case than there was in this case. It25 good place to find criminals who were61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOwas just a good -- acarrying unlawfulWashington, DC 20005￼1 drugs.2 MS. MADIGAN: In the present case, Mr. Caballes3 was traveling from Las Vegas, Nevada apparently on his way4 to Chicago, Illinois. He was pulled over for speeding.5 Another officer overheard when Master Sergeant Gillette6 called in to dispatch that he effected --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt, General8 Madigan?9 MS. MADIGAN: You may.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: He was pulled over for11 speeding at 71 miles an hour in a 65 miles an hour zone on12 I-80. Right?13 MS. MADIGAN: Yes, that is correct, Justice14 Stevens.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did they know in advance that16 he was someone to look for? Because I don't imagine you17 arrest everybody on I-80 that goes 70 miles an hour. I've18 done it many times myself is why --192021222324 Illinois. 25(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA:  Inadvertently.JUSTICE STEVENS: Inadvertently.(Laughter.)MS. MADIGAN:  We always like to have you inObviously, the Illinois State Police have the 71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ability to pull somebody over whether they're going 1 mileover the speed limit or 26 miles over the speed limit, butthere is nothing in the record to indicate that they werelooking for Mr. Caballes as he was traveling eastbound onI-80timep.m.     towards Chicago.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does the record tell us what     of day it was?          MS. MADIGAN:  Yes.  It was approximately 5:10          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you answered one of theearlier questions about the possible intrusiveness of dogseverywhere by saying, well, you don't have a privacyinterest in contraband, but that's never true.  You don'thave a privacy interest in the murder victim's body, butyou still have to have a warrant to go in and get it.  Sothat -- that just doesn't work unless I missed something.          MS. MADIGAN:  You do not have a privacy interestin contraband, as this Court has recognized in theJacobsen case.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, but you have a privacyinterest in your person and in your place, and that's whatwe're talking about.  So that seems to me that that justdoesn't help us.MS. MADIGAN: Well, there is a distinction 81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that's made in terms of Fourth Amendment protections that2 are given to homes and people versus cars. Ever since the3 Carroll case, it has been recognized that a warrantless4 search of 56 nature of7 nature of89 1011 the fact that you don't have a privacy interest in12 contraband, it doesn't seem to me -- I -- I don't think13 you need that argument.14151617 it. 1819 sure that20 have come21 thing -- that the imaging could pick out is not any of the22 other private activities in the home, but the only thing23 it could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife24 through the heart? Are you sure the case would have come25 out the same way? I'm not at all sure.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOa car can be done if they found probable cause.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's because of thethe place being searched not because of thewhat you're searching for.MS. MADIGAN:  Correct.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not necessarily.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it just can't be that -- soJUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you should use it.(Laughter.)MS. MADIGAN:  I -- I plan on continuing to useJUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why do you -- are youKyllo, you know, the -- the imaging case, wouldout the same way if the only thing -- the only￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. MADIGAN:  I would hope the case would comeout differently than --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you have any authority forthat other than Justice Scalia's speculation about howthis --(Laughter.)          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- how his Kyllo case mighthave been written?          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What about a house and -- andthe use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a housejust because the police think, you know, it's possiblethis is somebody growing marijuana in the basement orsomething?  Is that all right?          MS. MADIGAN:  I would argue that, yes, it is allright to walk a dog around a house, but then as Justice --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  How do you -- how do youreconcile that with the heat sensor case then?          MS. MADIGAN:  The thermal imager that was usedin the Kyllo case was able to reveal intimate details ofthe house.  A dog sniff is only going to reveal thepresence or absence of contraband, and because of that,that's where we suddenly get into the tension betweenKyllo and Place and --JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the dogs get a little 101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 more sophisticated in the future and can also smell a2 certain kind of perfume, something like that? Would then3 the whole 45 situation6 cause when a dog, in fact, alerted. If he was alerting to7 the presence of perfume as opposed to narcotics, thereanalysis change?MS. MADIGAN:  Well, then you would end up in aas to whether or not an officer had probable8 would be--9 JUSTICE STEVENS: How would you know whether10 the -- the dog -- I don't think the dog alerts, as I'm11 alerting, 1213 dogs. In14 their handlers go through 320 hours of training, and15 they're specifically trained to only alert to narcotics.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just learned this morning17 that some very well trained dogs that are trained to alert18 for explosives will also alert for certain kinds of rubber19 in a tire. They didn't realize that. And I think it's20 entirely possible that dogs would -- there will be false21 alerts by -- by dogs because it's triggered by something22 that -- that is not really anticipated.23 MS. MADIGAN: One of the things that does take24 place during the training of these narcotics-detection25 dogs is to make sure that they are not alerting to things111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOfor one reason or another.  He just alerts.MS. MADIGAN:  Well, they're very well trainedfact, in the State of Illinois, the dogs and￼1 that are not narcotics or -- I don't know exactly how the2 explosive training is conducted because we don't train our3 dogs in Illinois for explosives, but they purposely train4 them on narcotics not to alert to plastic wrap that is5 frequently the container used for narcotics, not --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would agree the7 analysis would be different if there could be an innocent8 cause of the alert as well as the contraband being the9 cause of the alert.10 MS. MADIGAN: It depends. The analysis would be11 different if the dog was known to or had been trained to12 actually alert to the non-contraband.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or if that happened a large14 percentage of the time. I mean, surely you'd concede that15 the search is unreasonable if, for every -- every one16 time, you -- you make somebody open his bag because the17 dog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody18 open his bag because he has apples in it. I mean,19 wouldn't that go to the reasonableness of --20 MS. MADIGAN: Well, it would actually go to21 whether or not that dog provided -- that dog's alert22 provided probable cause to conduct a search.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we -- we don't have24 the probable cause question before us, do we?25 MS. MADIGAN: You do not have the probable cause121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question before you.  This dog was determined to bereliable by the trial court and the Illinois AppellateCourt, and it was not part of the Illinois Supreme Court'sdecision.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So what again in your view is thebest distinction from Kyllo?          MS. MADIGAN:  Two things.  One, the thermalimager used in Kyllo was able to reveal intimate detailsthat individuals --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Like what?  I thought it wasjust heat?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MS. MADIGAN:  There was some disagreement on theCourt about exactly what it revealed, but in terms ofintimate details, it then allowed somebody --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Excuse me.  What details?  Itis a device that measures heat.          MS. MADIGAN:  Because it could measure heat, itcould also potentially determine when somebody was takinga bath, taking a sauna, and doing other intimate things inthe house.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think there was a referenceto my lady's bath in the opinion.recall.JUSTICE SCALIA:  A nice turn of phrase, as I131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER:  What was -- and what was thesecond?          MS. MADIGAN:  The second one would be thedistinction between houses and cars and the protectionsthat houses are given under the Fourth Amendment, whichare far greater than the protections that people have intheir cars.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, so you think if thiswere a house, that the Kyllo case would apply?          MS. MADIGAN:  If this were a house in thesituation, it would certainly bring out the tensionbetween Kyllo and Place --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wasn't there -- didn't Kyllo --wasn't what -- what the Court was worried about in Kyllonot just the relatively crude heat imaging that existed inthe case before it, but the prospect of more and moresophisticated heat imaging which -- which we had evidencewas already in development that would enable you to seepeople moving around a room?  I thought the case referredto that.  Now, are we going to have more and more --what's going to happen with dogs?  I -- I can't imaginethat -- that this thing is going anywhere other thansmelling narcotics and smelling bombs.JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you would argue that 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the same rationale should apply if, instead of using dogs,2 you had some sophisticated device that would buzz or ring3 a bell or something whenever the odor of -- of narcotics4 was present, wouldn't you?5 MS. MADIGAN: I would argue that. So if there6 was an ability to create a -- a mechanical dog, for7 instance,8 dog sniff9we would again say that the use of a mechanicalwould not be a search and therefore would not --JUSTICE STEVENS:  There's nothing magical about10 the fact that it's an animal rather than a sophisticated11 device. It has better detection capacity than a human12 being does. That's the only difference.13 MS. MADIGAN: You are correct.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in discussing the -- the15 answer to the -- the Kyllo issue, you've -- you place an16 emphasis on the protection given to a house. Would you go17 back to Justice O'Connor's question and my earlier18 example? Is it still your answer that the police can walk19 dogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to20 the front21 it sniffs22 2324 and hence 25door and ring the bell and see what it -- whatwhen the door is opened --MS. MADIGAN:  I would --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- without there being a searchno Fourth Amendment concern?MS. MADIGAN: Yes, Justice Souter, I would say 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that that is possible because the sniff itself is not a2 search and it only reveals the presence or absence of3 contraband, which is something that the individual does4 not have privacy expectations --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.6 then there is no significance in7 MS. MADIGAN: There is8 in the house because the -- But then -- then the --the house.potentially significance9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well,10 occur? I mean, if -- if -- first you say the -- the house11 is -- is a matter of significance for Kyllo analysis.12 We're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one,13 between Kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the14 house. They can sniff the foundations. They can go to15 the front door, et cetera. I don't see that the house, in16 fact, is functioning as a distinction at all.17 MS. MADIGAN: This Court's precedents have shown18 us that in fact Fourth Amendment protections are higher in19 the home than they are in the car.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I realize that, but it21 seems to me your basic argument, if I understand it, is22 there is simply no search here, and because there is no23 search here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with24 a house or a parking lot or a car on the road. No search25 is no search. So for purposes of -- if I -- I want to161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOwhen does -- when does it￼1 understand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes2 of your case, there is no significance in the house3 because there doesn't have to be. The question doesn't4 arise because there's no search. Is that --5 MS. MADIGAN: Justice Souter, that is absolutely6 correct. A search, as far as we are concerned -- and I7 believe it's based on the precedents of this Court -- is a8 sniff is not a search, and therefore it requires no Fourth9 Amendment justification.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said there's no11 disturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the12 dog sniff from some other governmental intrusions. But13 dogs can be frightening, humiliating. It seems to me that14 there is some association with the idea that I have a15 right to be let alone by my government and having a large16 dog circle my car.17 MS. MADIGAN: There are in this country millions18 of dogs, many of the types of dogs that are used by19 narcotics detection teams, such as Labrador retrievers and20 shepherds, are identical to the pets that people own. We21 encounter them in the parks, on the streets, and I would22 contend that an officer cannot be in the position of23 making a determination as to whether or not the individual24 that he encounters is going to be frightened by the dog.25 Mr. Justice Stevens, if I may, I'd like to171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reserve the remainder of my time.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, you may save your time.          MS. MADIGAN:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Wray.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. WRAY              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,        AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MR. WRAY:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          There's no dispute that respondent here waslawfully stopped based on probable cause.  There's also nodispute that the entire stop took less than 9 minutes.The question is whether a second officer's use of a drugdog to sniff outside of that car during those 9 minutesrequired some separate Fourth Amendment justification.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree with -- withGeneral Madigan that it doesn't make any differencewhether the -- the dog is a -- is a mechanical instrumentor not?  Do you agree it makes no difference?          I thought that one of the -- one of the pointsin -- in the imaging case was that this was a newtechnology which didn't exist and that although theordinary rules in 1791 was that there was no search unless-- you know, unless you enter the house or unless you --you physically intrude upon the person's -- at least the181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 person's clothes, we made an exception to that rule2 because of this new technology that enabled you to find3 out things without having to intrude into the home or into4 the person. Now, but -- but this is not a new technology.5 This is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 17916 just as they had it today. And the rule that when there's7 no intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to8 depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there9 would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology10 that would enable you to find out all sorts of things.11 MR. WRAY: That's correct.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you shouldn't --13 you shouldn't assume that -- that the fact that this is a14 canine makes no difference.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you going to rely on the16 fact that dogs were trained to do this sort of thing back17 in the 18th century?18 MR. WRAY: I'm going to rely on -- on three19 distinctions between this case and Kyllo, Justice Stevens.20 The first is that the three points that the21 Court looked at in Kyllo were: one, as has already been22 referenced, the fact that it's a home, the most sacred23 place under the Fourth Amendment; second, that it revealed24 certain intimate details; and third, that that was a25 technology --191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: It was potentially revealed.2 It did not actually reveal any details.3 MR. WRAY: As -- as General Madigan referenced,4 there is obviously some disagreement within the Court on5 that issue, but the -- the fact was that the technology in6 Kyllo revealed information about heat in the house which7 could be thought to reveal intimate details about the8 house.9 The third point in Kyllo, which I think Justice10 Scalia is referring to, is that that was technology that11 was not in general public use. Dogs have been used by law12 enforcement across the country since Place and before to13 sniff everything from --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But not in 1790.15 MR. WRAY: Not --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you come here --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that, do you?18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you come here having19 researched all about dogs in 1790?20 (Laughter.)21 MR. WRAY: Justice Kennedy, I cannot, I regret22 to say, tell you what dogs were doing in 1790. I can tell23 you -- and this is maybe a factual thing that might be of24 interest to the Court -- that the dogs who train -- who25 are trained to alert to detect things -- it's not that201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 they are sniffing things that all dogs can't already2 smell. It's rather that they are trained to let the3 handler know that they've smelt whatever it is they've4 been trained to smell. So the smells that are coming out5 of Respondent Caballes' car are exposed to every dog.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you really think this would7 be a different case if the officer had a device that did8 exactly what the dog -- dog did?9 MR. WRAY: We -- our position would still be,10 Justice Stevens, that as long as the device only revealed,11 as this does --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I would think you'd take --13 MR. WRAY: -- the absence or presence of14 contraband, it would still be constitutional.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you rely on the -- in --16 in distinguishing Kyllo, why do you rely on the house if17 there's no search? Why do you have to rely on the fact18 that there was a house involved there? You -- you listed19 that as one of your three distinctions.20 MR. WRAY: We don't believe we have to rely on21 it, Justice Souter. We do believe that there were three22 things that were important in Kyllo. The fact that it was23 a home was one of those things. Again, the -- the fact of24 a home, the fact that it was technology not in general25 public use, and --211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that didn't go to whether2 it was a search or seizure. I think it goes to whether it3 was an unreasonable search or seizure. Don't you think4 so? That5 to a home6 suitcase?7810 is no search here. Period.11 MR. WRAY: That is correct, Justice Souter.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's because it's a dog sniff.13 MR. WRAY: We would -- we would submit this is14 not a search because, as this Court recognized in both15 Place and Edmond -- and the Jacobsen case is also16 significant because the Court said that the reason this is17 not a search, there using the dog sniff by analogy, is18 because it compromises no legitimate privacy interest.19 The language of the Court in Place is20 significant because it says that we are aware of no other21 investigative procedure that is so limited in both the22 manner in which the information is obtained and in the23 content of the information revealed. That language goes24 not only to why it's not a Fourth Amendment search but why25 the use of the dog sniff during a probable cause traffic221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOwhat -- what might be unreasonable with respectwould not be unreasonable with respect to aMR. WRAY:  Yes, Justice Scalia, that's correct.JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but your -- is -- is it 9 -- I understand it to be your position that there simply￼1 stop here, where it doesn't prolong the duration, does not2 transform an otherwise lawful seizure into an unlawful3 one.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Do you -- do you5 think it's -- it's reasonable to say that if the police6 take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the7 foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door8 and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open,9 that there is -- there is no compromise of a privacy10 interest?11 MR. WRAY: Well, there would be a question as to12 whether the officer, the human officer, that is, could be13 on private property -- I take it from your hypothetical,14 Justice Souter -- in the first place. But --1516 Amendment17 trespass,18 there is no search. And then you have quite rightly said19 that we have had as a consideration in our minds20 analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police21 were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest.22 So I'm assuming -- I'm assuming that the police23 can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can24 certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell.25 And if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I mean, the Fourthanalysis after Katz doesn't -- doesn't depend onand -- and you have said up to this point that￼1 the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to,2 is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the3 privacy interests of the people who own the house?4 MR. WRAY: Our position would be -- the answer5 to that question is yes. The Court does not have to6 resolve that issue to decide this case.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, we could separate8 the home from the -- from what happened here and still9 validate the search here if we held that it was a search,10 but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the11 person was carrying contraband. It's the only thing12 that's disclosed. Whereas, if you -- if you did the same13 thing with -- with regard to a house, which is a more14 sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an15 unreasonable search. We -- we could reach that result if16 we wanted to, couldn't we?17 MR. WRAY: I think you could, Justice Scalia.18 It's important to distinguish --19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the other hand, if it were20 a drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs21 are frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view22 for the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around23 the public street where cars are parked around that known24 drug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some25 contraband in the cars? Is that okay?241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. WRAY: We believe it would be okay, Justice2 O'Connor. It would be important not to use the dogs in a3 way to constitute a new seizure because in that case,4 you're not talking --5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm -- I'm assuming parked6 cars. You haven't interrupted anybody. Nobody is in the7 car, parked on a public street.8 MR. WRAY: In that instance, we believe that9 would be acceptable under the Fourth Amendment.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you give no11 significance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the12 course of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had13 already been curtailed to a significant extent?14 MR. WRAY: We believe, Justice Kennedy, that the15 -- that that context here makes this an even easier case16 under the Fourth Amendment, that is, the dog sniff not17 being a search compromising no legitimate privacy18 interests during the course of a lawful probable cause19 stop, which we know from Atwater -- the officer could have20 simply placed the woman under full custodial arrest and21 taken her down to jail -- was not an activity that22 transformed the seizure into an unlawful one.23 The Illinois Supreme Court's concern and where24 we think they got off track was that they were concerned25 that the use of the dog sniff during this 9-minute traffic251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 stop was that it transformed it -- it used the language2 that it transformed the sniff into a drug investigation.3 We would submit that the Fourth Amendment is about the4 reasonableness of searches and seizures and not about what5 the scope of the government's investigation is. And in6 that sense, the court got off track.7 These -- this is a -- this is a means that law8 enforcement has been using properly in reliance on this9 Court's decision in Place, reinforced just 4 years ago in10 Edmond, for more than 21 years to detect everything from11 drugs to bombs to smuggled -- we have beagles in the12 airports that smuggle produce that's being smuggled in.13 Dogs are used all over the country with great14 effectiveness in law enforcement, and the -- we -- that is15 a -- a technique that we want to encourage law enforcement16 to pursue.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there -- are there any18 manuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the19 time and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?20 MR. WRAY: Justice Ginsburg, there is extensive21 training of law enforcement to use dogs. It's a multi-22 week program that requires --23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't mean the training to24 make the dog alert properly. How the police will use25 them, when, under what circumstances.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WRAY:  Justice Ginsburg, each agency hasdifferent policies about when they use dogs and whatpurpose they're trained for.  In this case, as you heard,they're being used in the context of highway interdiction,and so they're trained to sniff around vehiclesspecifically.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Wray.          MR. WRAY:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Meczyk.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH E. MECZYK                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. MECZYK:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          The State does not offer any Fourth Amendmentjustification whatsoever in regards to -- in this case.It argues instead that there -- there was no need for anyjustification, and that is incorrect for two reasons.          The dog sniff in this case invaded a FourthAmendment interest of Mr. Caballes in the context of aroutine traffic search.  The sniff in this case was, infact, a search.  Albeit it was a limited intrusion, it wasstill a search nonetheless.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why do you say that?  Imean, is -- is anything that I observe a search?  I mean,suppose I -- I'm a policeman and -- and I'm looking out271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425for, I don't know, people with a nervous tic because Ithink that that might be somebody who's about to commit acrime or has committed a crime.  Have I searched thatperson because I -- I observe something external?          MR. MECZYK:  Any observation I think --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there no difference betweenan investigation and a search?          MR. MECZYK:  There is in this case -- see if Iunderstand you correctly.          JUSTICE SCALIA:and -- and your statementthere's a search whenever No.  It seems to me your briefhere both seem to assume thatthe police investigate.          MR. MECZYK:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not so.  They -- onecan investigate without searching.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, to -- see if I understandyour question correctly.  If you're looking with someonewith that nervous tic, that would be something in openview or plain view.  That's not the type of investigationI'm talking about.  There is in fact, most respectfully,an investigation technique here.  There's an investigationmeasure.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but that isn't the --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about a policeman whosmells marijuana coming out of a car or a residence.  He's281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 walking down the street, public street, and he smells2 marijuana.3 MR. MECZYK: The only way I can analogize that,4 Justice Kennedy, is that it -- that is akin to a plain5 smell or plain view.6 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So once you say7 that, you realize that there are billions and billions of8 searches that go on every day that the police don't have9 to justify at all. They just look around.10 MR. MECZYK: I don't --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? There are billions of12 them. So the real question is do they have to give a13 justification for this. And the argument that they don't14 is simply that it's not in the person's house. When you15 go out in a public place, even in your car, you might run16 into people or animals with sharp noses. And a lot of17 them can detect marijuana. And you know, maybe it's a18 Limburger 192021 that they22 they do get odors in your car on the street. So this is23 the kind of search. Yes, it's a search, but one that the24 police don't have to justify.cheese.  I don't know.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER:  But people are sniffing thingsdon't sniff through windows into your house, but25 MR. MECZYK: But this is with a specific 291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425investigative tool.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it's a specificinvestigative tool when I put on my glasses to lookthrough a window.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, this is --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see why it has to --why that matters if in fact all -- if you go into a car, apolice car, and you have -- drive through the neighborhoodand look around, you are using a specific investigativetool, the police car, to look around and find outgoing on.          MR. MECZYK:  This is a far more -- mostrespectfully, this is a far more sophisticatedinvestigative tool.what's          JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'm trying to getmy own mind it's not a question of the tools.  It's aquestion of the expectation of privacy.          MR. MECZYK:  Then maybe I can see if I couldanswer your question.  Mr. Caballes in this case indeedhad an expectation of privacy.  When he was asked by thepolice officer in this case if he can consent to thesearch, he said no.  He did not want that law enforcementofficer looking in --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that never --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes, but both Place and301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto is in￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Edmond, opinions from this Court, said sniffs are notsearches.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, I --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do you want us to reversethat?          MR. MECZYK:  Justice O'Connor, I do not -- I donot want you to reverse Place.  Place, no pun intended --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, and Edmond also saidit's not a search.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, there were --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It was the stop of the carsin that case that caused the result.          MR. MECZYK:  The way I understand Place it wascontextually limited.  In Place, the whole purpose of theseizure, the taking of the luggage, was to submit it to adrug-detection sniff.  That is the opinion authored byYour Honor, that specifically stated -- I'm not going tosay took for granted, but it specifically stated that the-- the context -- and that's what we have to look at Place-- the --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Fine.  We had a context therewhere we supported it, but in the process said the sniff,the dog sniff, was not a search.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, I -- I --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So you want us to say311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something else here.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, I think that first in -- inthat case, in Place, the -- the Court --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  The context here was alegitimate traffic stop.          MR. MECZYK:  But it was -- unlike Place, thelegitimate traffic stop here was completely unrelated tothe purpose of the dog sniff.  There was an absolute --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  The dog sniff is not asearch.  What difference does it make?          MR. MECZYK:  Well, again, I would againrespectfully assert that the dog sniff is a search and theway Place was decided, first, the decision had to be made,in the context of -- of that case, what was worse.  Whatwere they going to do with the luggage?  Were they goingto open the luggage first?  So, of course, the Court hadto decide in that case that it wasn't that kind of a -- asearch.  It wasn't as egregious a search as actuallyopening the luggage.Then you --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  This -- the trunk of the cardidn't have to be opened here.          MR. MECZYK:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  The trunk of the vehicle didnot have to be opened here.  You're talking about a dog321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sniffing on the exterior of the vehicle that waslegitimately stopped for a traffic violation.          MR. MECZYK:  Again, in this context, unlike inPlace, there was absolutely no relationship between the --the dog sniff and the dog sniff of Caballes' trunk and thesniff of the luggage that was placed at LaGuardia Airportin Place.  There's a great distinction.  Moreover --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose a policeman follows mearound.  He just -- just follows me around, observing withhis -- with plain eyes, nothing else.  Now, is that asearch?  Does he need probable cause to do that?  Now, he'swasting his time and he's wasting public money and maybe heshould get fired for doing it, if he has no reason to followme.          MR. MECZYK:  It's not a search.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And maybe -- maybe I'd have aharassment action against him if he does it, you know,blatantly.  But is that a search?          MR. MECZYK:  It is not a search.  If he followsyou --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So -- so the mere factthat one is in investigating something doesn't make it asearch.  What does make it a search?          MR. MECZYK:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The fact that you find out331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 something?2 MR. MECZYK: I think here the most distinctive3 point here is that Caballes had already been stopped4 unlike the hypothetical that you just presented to me.5 Caballes was already stopped for one -- for probable6 cause. There's no question about that. But then now the7 police launch into a wholly unrelated investigation8 that's --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it would be better if10 he hadn't been stopped? If -- if they just -- just11 randomly walked up to somebody who was going through a12 toll booth and had the dog sniff the car, you think that13 would be a better case --14 MR. MECZYK: I think --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for allowing it than -- than16 yours?17 MR. MECZYK: Even in that case, even in a18 hypothetical where they used the dog for a toll booth, I19 have a problem with that. That to me is a search. It's20 different than -- I would assert it's different than if21 they walked -- one of the hypotheticals that the Justices22 asked my adversary in this case, when they asked, well,23 what if they walked the dog instead around a -- parked24 cars or parked cars at a stadium? It depends for what25 purpose they want to walk those parked -- that dog around341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425those parked cars.  My assertion is --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, they said it's to findout if there's any contraband.          MR. MECZYK:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The answer was they are atliberty -- the police are at liberty to use dogs to findcontraband.  And your -- Illinois I think was very candidwith the Court in saying we have taken from your decisionsthat a dog sniff is not a search.  So anything else is amatter of police policy.  It had nothing to do with theFourth Amendment.          MR. MECZYK:  Well, I -- I strongly differ.  Ihave to look at the purpose that they are going to use thedog for.  This Court --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, does it matter if, forinstance, in today's world on Capitol Hill we're concernedabout terrorist attacks.  What if the dog is trained toalert to explosives?  Now, can the police just decidethey're going to sniff any car that's parked on CapitolHill?          MR. MECZYK:  Justice O'Connor, it depends on thepurpose.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes or no, in your view.  Thepurpose is to disclose potential explosives in a parkedvehicle.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. MECZYK: The answer is yes. I have no2 problem whatsoever.3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Wherever it is.4 MR. MECZYK: Wherever it is because I look at it5 as a public safety exception. And this Court in the6 Edmond case specifically condemned a general search -- a7 general crime -- let me use the exact words. General8 interest in crime control, to quote the Edmond case. And9 that's --10 JUSTICE BREYER: I still want to go back to my11 question because I think you may have an answer to it and12 I want to 131415 question.16 reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to17 the English definition of search. I say forget that.focus you --MR. MECZYK:  I'm struggling, yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to focus you on theI think what you're doing, which is a18 Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a19 whole range of searches that don't even fall within the20 Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a21 justification. And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs22 is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word23 English search.24 So I want to know why it is that this dog search25 is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e.,361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of2 what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.3 MR. MECZYK: It invades a public -- I'm sorry.4 It invades a private space that in this particular case5 the respondent Caballes had a privacy interest in, that he6 wanted to exclude the whole world from going inside his7 trunk. That's the difference.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't respond to9 one point in Place, if I remember correctly. It must be a10 legitimate expectation of privacy, and if the only thing11 the dog can detect is something illegitimate, how can you12 say there's an invasion of a legitimate expectation in13 privacy?14 MR. MECZYK: Well, it is -- it's true that one15 does not have an expectation of privacy in contraband, but16 by the same token, I have an expectation or Mr. Caballes17 had an expectation of -- of privacy of what's inside that18 closed trunk, his car. The Carroll doctrine is still good19 law. We still apply the Fourth Amendment in cars. It's20 true that the home is sacrosanct, but just because it's a21 home, it's not a talisman where -- where the Fourth22 Amendment no longer applies.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was something you said24 in -- in your brief that I thought was unclear. So may I25 ask you --371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MECZYK:  Of course.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- if Officer Gillette, theone who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the backof his car, instead of having the second officer come withthe dog, would it have been permissible?  I thought youhad conceded that it would be a different situation if thedog was already there when the car stopped.          MR. MECZYK:  First of all, Justice Ginsburg, myrecollection is that Trooper Gillette, who was the officerwho stopped Caballes, did not have a -- a dog in the car.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, he didn't, but I'm askingyou to imagine that he did.          MR. MECZYK:  I see.  If he had a dog in the carand the dog just happened to have alerted without hiscuing the dog or walking the dog -- and I'll answer thatin a moment too -- that would be pure serendipity.  Thatmight happen.  If -- if the dog just happened to havealerted.  But if the troopers deliberately drove the carclose by -- and in reality, that's not what happens.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No.  I would like to takethis scenario as it is except that when the officer getsout of the car, his dog comes with him.          MR. MECZYK:  Okay.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is very -- make no otherchanges except that Gillette has the dog and Gillette with381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the dog go to Mr. Caballes' car.          MR. MECZYK:  My understanding of the way thisworks, Justice Ginsburg, is that he just couldn't go up tothe car without -- and the dog would alert.  Myunderstanding of the way these dogs are trained is thatthey specifically -- that the officer has to walk the dogaround the car, the vehicle, first of all.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  He does that.  He does that.          MR. MECZYK:  He does that.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, in this case.          MR. MECZYK:  He does that.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          MR. MECZYK:  To cue the dog.  In other words,tell him it's not playtime anymore, that he has to work.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          MR. MECZYK:  To trigger something in the -- inthe canine brain.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- I'm --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would it be bad?  Would it bebad if that's what he did?          MR. MECZYK:  It wouldn't be bad that's what --well, yes.  In this case it's very bad because it's asearch.  There's no question.  I'm not coming off of that.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm -- I'm trying to 391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 understand what you meant in your brief when you said if2 the dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped3 Caballes, the situation would have been different.4 MR. MECZYK: I -- I think what I meant there --5 there would have been -- it would have been purely6 happenstance, almost like plain view. It would have been7 -- without him even cuing the dog or starting to walk the8 dog around, my answer to that Justice Ginsburg is that9 that would have been all right.10 Except now that -- the more I think about it,11 I'm not so sure that it would be all right. And my answer12 to -- and the reason for that is I think in that case the13 officer, if he could do such a thing and the dog would14 alert, would be exploiting the situation, would just be15 taking the dog and walking him around the car and seeing16 that the dog alerted. So in other words, there -- there17 would be, I think, an exploitation of -- of the -- of the18 traffic stop.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then it really makes no20 difference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his21 car or whether the dispatcher called another officer who22 had the dog.23 MR. MECZYK: That is correct, Your Honor.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't -- so you're25 retracting that.401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 You, I think, were asked but I'm -- I'm not sure2 you fully answered. Suppose the police, as Atwater would3 allow, arrested, made a full arrest of Caballes, and then4 they impound his car. In the place where they put it,5 couldn't they have a dog go around the car there?6 MR. MECZYK: Yes. Yes. I -- if we had an7 Atwater situation -- in this case there wasn't an Atwater8 situation because there was first a warning given. You're9 correct. There was a warning given. I'm sorry. The10 officer Gillette told Caballes he was going to give him a11 warning. So unlike the Knowles --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. He could13 have. I mean --14 MR. MECZYK: He could have, but he didn't.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is -- is --16 MR. MECZYK: But he didn't. He didn't.17 Instead, he chose to treat this as more of a Knowles18 situation. This case is -- is on all fours, no pun19 intended, like Knowles. In other words, in the -- in20 Knowles v. Iowa, the Court -- a case of this -- I'm sorry.21 Let me untwist my tongue. In Knowles v. Iowa, you had a --22 you had a traffic stop and after the traffic stop, there23 was a statute that said unrelated to the traffic stop, you24 can go in and search. And this is the same thing. This25 officer here Gillette treated Caballes as the officer in411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Knowles in -- treated Mr. Knowles in Iowa. It's the exact2 same thing.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the difficulty4 that I have with that argument is take the -- take the5 case of -- of the arrestable offense in which it is6 undoubtedly the case that although the police don't7 normally arrest, they -- they can. Your -- if I8 understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact,9 do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and10 indeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an11 inventory search because they've got to protect themselves12 against claims that they lost property and so on. So13 there's no question that in that case, as -- as you have14 argued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and15 certainly16 arrest on1718 reasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if19 you admit that the police can search in case number one.20 How does that affect the reasonable expectation ofcan use the dog.  But if they choose not tothe highway, they can't.My problem is how can you say that there is a21 privacy?22 MR. MECZYK: To me, once a person is told that23 he is not going to be under arrest, it changes the whole24 complexion of the case. I think it's a completely25 different -- a completely different scenario. We don't421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 have an arrest. It doesn't matter. Atwater --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the officer change his3 mind? I mean, he -- he did say I'm just going to give you4 a citation, and then he said, mind if I search your car.5 This is before the -- the dog showed up. And suppose the6 person who had been speeding said, yes, I mind. Don't7 search my car. And then the police said, well, in that8 case I'm going to arrest you.9 MR. MECZYK: It's a difficult question, but I10 have to look at what -- I think reasonableness is judged.11 Again, I'm going to remember what the -- those cases12 taught. I think what Knowles taught, that reasonableness13 is judged14 what they1516 answer to17 depot just to sniff the bags of people who were coming18 off, without stopping them, but just -- just to have the19 dogs there, that's unlawful.by what the police actually do as opposed tomight have done.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Meczyk, I assume that yourwhether it's lawful to have a -- a dog at a bus20 MR. MECZYK: It depends --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: For narcotics, not for bombs,22 not for -- just -- just for narcotics. The police think,23 you know, a lot of narcotics goes on interstate buses.24 We're going to put a dog in the bus depot.25 MR. MECZYK: It's a little less problematic to431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 me, Justice Scalia, than the type of stop I'm talking2 about here.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?4 MR. MECZYK: It's a little less problematic.5 One, because it's a public place and I -- I think --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so is the road, for7 Pete's sake.8MR. MECZYK:  I know, but -- but here I thinklesser expectation of privacy.  Well, I don'tto go that far.  I -- I have to answer your--JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MR. MECZYK:  -- unlike the caseJUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MR. MECZYK:  -- unlike the caseto me is still a search.  So --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  That's -- that's what Ishould say.MR. MECZYK:  And I am saying it.JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but that isn't -- I take9 there's a10 even want11 question.12 submitting the luggage without any reasonable articulable13 suspicion 141516--I think that submitting the dogs without any --1718 that that 1920 think you 212223 it you don't --24 MR. MECZYK: Sorry it took me so long.25 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything wrong with441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOin -- in Place,￼1 the policeman himself taking a sniff?2 MR. MECZYK: It goes back to --3 JUSTICE BREYER: It's the great4 robbery.5 (Laughter.)6 JUSTICE BREYER: He stopped the7 around. Anything wrong with that?8 MR. MECZYK: There's nothing wrong if he can9 detect Limburger cheese. That to me is like plain smell.10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.11 MR. MECZYK: As awful as that --12 JUSTICE BREYER: So plain --13 MR. MECZYK: As awful as it might be --14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- so what15 you're saying is -- and this must tie back to reasonable16 expectation of privacy. All right? Because it's okay for17 the policeman to do it, and it's okay for dogs to do it in18 the bus station, and it's okay to use a dog not in the bus19 station with a car if in fact you actually are going to20 put him under arrest, although here you had probable cause21 to do so, I take it. And now you have to draw a pretty22 fine line. But it's not okay where it's not the bus23 station, but it is the car and in fact the dog is doing24 the sniffing -- and there are a lot of dogs around that25 can sniff -- and you did have probable cause but you451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOLimburger cheesecar and he walks￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425didn't say it.  And in face of Justice O'Connor's casewhich said that -- you see.  Well, I mean, this is -- thisis --          MR. MECZYK:  I guess you --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I'm not saying youcouldn't draw that line, but I'm saying it's pretty toughI think.I'm thethat --well, I  MR. MECZYK:  I guess you're telling me I'm --underdog in this case.  JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't know.  (Laughter.)  JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm right?  Am I -- I mean,  MR. MECZYK:  It is --  JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're going to draw the --don't want you to repeat yourself necessarily.  MR. MECZYK:  No.  It --  JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you had already drawn thea different place than Justice Breyer suggestedin response to Justice Scalia, you said if it --line atbecauseif it were going into the bus terminal just to sniff fornarcotics, unlike explosives, it would be an impermissiblesearch.MR. MECZYK:  Yes, correct, Justice --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would be --461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. MECZYK: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.2 What makes this particular so --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but is -- why -- why4 don't you simply say, look -- have a very simple line. If5 they can arrest, they can sniff. If they can't arrest,6 they can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to7 drugs or whatever.8 MR. MECZYK: I would agree with that if I use an9 -- if -- if you're referring to an Atwater type scenario.10 If they have probable -- if they decide to arrest, even11 though it's on a minor traffic case, such as Atwater,12 which was a seat belt, as long as it's -- if -- if it's13 minor and if the officer elects to choose to do a full-14 blown arrest, then all the consequences that follow from15 that arrest are -- it's going to happen. Excuse me. It's16 going to happen.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what -- what is the answer18 to the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that19 case? Isn't your expectation of privacy identical,20 whatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of21 privacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to22 the discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or23 not?24 MR. MECZYK: I -- I think that when the officer25 does a full-blown arrest, as was envisioned in Atwater,471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 you know that you -- the person knows that he or she does2 not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that the --4 the reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the5 officer's discretionary judgment whether or not to arrest.6 Isn't that what you're saying?7 MR. MECZYK: Essentially yes, because I think8 that the officer takes a physical action. It's just more9 than words. It's also his deeds. I think in Atwater,10 unlike Knowles -- in Atwater, in that case, I think the --11 the officer did make an election, and there was a full-12 blown or a full-fledged arrest. And I think there your --13 your reasonable expectation to privacy does, in fact, go14 out the window.15 But this is so different. This was just a16 warning. Period. It was nothing worse than a warning.17 What makes this stop so pernicious is that it takes place18 in front of the whole world and is accusatory. It is19 profoundly embarrassing, and it is humiliating to everyone20 on the street. So if a person is stopped and the officer21 just decides to stop you for a minor traffic offense,22 that's the worst part about this case. Just a minor23 traffic offense, really a frivolous offense, basically24 what any law-abiding citizen would happen to -- it could25 happen to anyone. And as this Court has said, even in481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Whren, there are so many multiple technical violations of2 -- of -- technical violations --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I think it's worse if4 -- if you're subjected to it without having committed any5 violation at all. Every time I travel abroad and come6 back into the country, customs officers have dogs and --7 and they parade the dogs through -- through the baggage8 terminal. Do -- do I feel offended by that?9 MR. MECZYK: No, Justice Scalia --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't a public safety11 matter. They're -- they're not smelling for bombs.12 They're -- they're smelling for contraband. And according13 to you, that is bad.14 MR. MECZYK: That -- in that situation, when you15 enter the country -- and this Court has said many times16 again -- it's a border search. There's nothing that I can17 argue against the border search. It's the -- or the18 functional equivalent of the border. That is a border19 search. I bring luggage to the airport, in20 I have a lesser expectation of privacy. If21 traveling abroad and coming into the United22 different. That's different in an airport.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. A bus station is24 different, though.25 MR. MECZYK: A bus station here inside the 491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOtoday's worldI know I'mStates, that's￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425United States is different I think.  I -- I look at yourairport hypothetical as being -- as dealing with a border.If it's not at a border and I use your hypothetical, it'sat O'Hare Airport or Reagan International Airport and theybring a dog up to sniff for drugs at the carousel, that tome is a search.  It's like -- I think you said in oneopinion once if it -- you used the duck analogy, well, ifit walks like a duck or quacks like a duck.  Here it'sstill a search.  It walks like a -- a dog and it acts likea dog, but its specific function is in fact to search outin public and humiliate people.          If there are any further questions.          I respectfully ask this honorable Court toaffirm the wise judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Meczyk.          General Madigan, you have I think about 3minutes left.             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MS. MADIGAN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.          Let me make three brief points.          Number one, Justice Ginsburg asked a questionabout something that was in the respondent's brief,whether or not it made a difference if a dog was with501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Master Sergeant Gillette when he initiated the stop or if2 the dog was later brought, as was the case here, by3 Trooper Graham. Really what Mr. Caballes is arguing for4 here is an inadvertence requirement which this Court very5 clearly held in Horton, there is no such requirement of6 inadvertence. And so a law officer, if they are at a7 lawful vantage point, do have the ability to detect8 incriminating facts. That is not something that has to9 occur inadvertently. It can happen intentionally.10 Second, Justice Scalia asked a question about11 plain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does12 not effect an incremental search or seizure. And13 therefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not14 require Fourth Amendment justification.15 And let me finally acknowledge something that16 Justice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by17 walking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a18 search. Let me -- now, that is certainly a closer case19 than whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a20 search, which we say is not. But ultimately you would21 reach a similar result because the principle is not going22 to extend to cars in the same manner in -- in Kyllo as the23 thermal imager did.24 Finally, if there are no further questions, we25 would ask that the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400be reversed.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, General Madigan.The -- the case is submitted.          MS. MADIGAN:  Thank you.          (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)52Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
