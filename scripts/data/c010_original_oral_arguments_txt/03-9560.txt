MITCHELL                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. MITCHELL:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          The Court has directed us to address, inaddition to the question raised in the petition for writof certiorari, the following question.  Was petitioner'sFederal constitutional claim properly raised before theMississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 United StatesCode, section 1257?          Accordingly, we begin by addressing thatquestion and answering it affirmatively.  Here, Howellmaintains, one, the standards for adjudicating State andFederal claims of this particular type are identical --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where --          MR. MITCHELL:  -- where they're labeled assuch --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- where was that -- wherewas that maintained?  Because I thought that below, allthere were was this was a -- was it a lesser-included offense31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 under State law, and I didn't see below any reference to2 the Federal Constitution.3 MR. MITCHELL: Justice Ginsburg, we believe that4 the rule in Beck establishes that State law must be viewed5 and State law is the determiner of whether an offense is a6 lesser-included offense, but Federal law, the Federal7 Constitution determines whether, as a matter of due8 process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Eighth9 Amendment concerns, whether an instruction must be given10 as a Federal constitutional matter.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and the standards under12 Beck are different from the standards under the roughly13 comparable State rule, as I understand it, because under14 the State rule, the lesser offense need not be an included15 offense, in the technical sense; and number two, there16 need not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a --17 a limitation to the jury to two choices, death or18 acquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the19 Federal standard, simply raising the State standard20 wouldn't do it.21 MR. MITCHELL: Respectfully, Justice Souter, we22 would submit that Mississippi's own law says that it23 embraces the Beck standard and that Mississippi's own24 law --25JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, it embraces it because 41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it's broader, which means that if you raise -- if you --2 if you make a claim under the State standard, you are not3 necessarily making a claim under the narrower, more4 restrictive Federal standard.5 MR. MITCHELL: We would respectfully submit that6 -- that in Mississippi, for example, as contrasted with7 the statutory scheme that was present in Hopkins, the8 Nebraska scheme, in the Mississippi scheme, Mississippi9 has held that simple murder is a lesser-included offense,10 and therefore, by definition that offense at least mirrors11 what is required under Beck.12 Now, the question of whether some other13 lesser --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: What about -- what about the --15 the Beck condition that in the absence of the instruction,16 there must be a choice between -- the jury must be17 confined to a choice between death and acquittal?18 MR. MITCHELL: In --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's not the same20 in the State's scheme, is it?21 MR. MITCHELL: Well, we believe that -- that it22 is the same. And in fact, the -- the case that the State23 cites, State v. Goodin, explains that. The representation24 of Goodin in the State's brief, as it appears in the25 respondent's brief at page 23, we contend is not51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 faithfully representative of what the Court said in that2 case.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is Goodin the case that4 -- that stands for the proposition that under -- under5 State law, the -- the jury has an -- an option to sentence6 for life,7 sentence?89 cited foras -- as well as -- as to impose the deathMR. MITCHELL:  Goodin is the case that the State               that purpose, but an analysis of what the10 Mississippi Supreme Court actually said at page 656 of the11 Southern Reporter, 787, is this. The Goodin jury did not12 face the dilemma of the Beck jury. Here, the jury's13 alternatives in the guilt phase were to convict Goodin of14 capital murder, simple murder, or to acquit him, which is15 the very purpose that the later cases -- and Beck itself16 explains. Schad, for example, explains that the reason17 for the Beck determination was that presenting only the18 option of convicting of a capital offense or acquitting19 was not constitutionally permissible.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so I just want to make21 sure I know where we stand. You're saying that the22 assumption I was making, that under Mississippi law, in23 the absence of an instruction for a lesser offense, the24 jury has an option not only to acquit or to impose the25 death penalty, but an option of life with or without61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 parole, that assumption is simply incorrect as a -- as a2 fact about Mississippi law.3 MR. MITCHELL: No, I do not believe that is4 incorrect. I'm sorry, Your Honor. What I do believe is5 correct is that under Mississippi law, the jury, because6 of the bifurcated nature of the -- of the case, is given7 at least the preliminary reference or preliminary8 instruction that if there is a guilt verdict, then there9 will be a sentencing phase. But we submit that that is a10 distinction that this Court has not adopted, nor have11 other courts adopted because in this situation --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it takes you out of Beck,13 at least arguably, doesn't it? The -- the question is,14 have you raised something that is necessarily on all fours15 with Beck? And given this sentencing scheme, we can't say16 that simply raising a State claim necessarily raises the17 Beck claim. Isn't that true?18 MR. MITCHELL: Your Honor, we would respectfully19 disagree with that position because of the analysis that20 the Court has undertaken, for example, in Hopkins and21 because of the analysis in Spaziano v. Florida. In those22 cases, they were presented with schemes in which the jury23 did not, of necessity, impose the death penalty. However,24 the jury was confronted with exactly the same position --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the consequence of the jury71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 verdict was -- was the death penalty.2 MR. MITCHELL: Well, the consequence of the jury3 verdict may have been the death penalty. For example, in4 Spaziano, the -- the jury returned a verdict of guilty.5 The jury recommended life, but the judge imposed a6 sentence of death nevertheless. In the Hopkins case, the7 -- a three-judge panel then imposed the death penalty.8 Those -- those differences in sentencing schemes we do not9 believe separates the rationale of Beck which is the10 danger of affecting the jury verdict by being faced with11 the dilemma of either convicting of a capital offense or12 acquitting.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mitchell, my -- my problem14 is even more fundamental than Justice Souter's. Conceding15 that the rule in Mississippi is exactly the same as the16 Federal rule in Beck, it doesn't seem to me that arguing17 Mississippi law, just because it happens to be the same as18 Federal law, amounts to raising a Federal question.19 Let's assume you have a -- a State law against20 wire-tapping. It is unlawful. And you -- you come in and21 you ask that the evidence be -- be excluded because it's22 contrary to the State law. Have you raised a -- a Federal23 -- a Federal question when all you cite is the State law,24 even though the effect under State law is the same as the25 Federal effect under the Fourth Amendment? It's not my81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 understanding that you've raised a Federal question.2 MR. MITCHELL: I do not believe that I would3 have unless in that particular State, if its highest court4 had said, we embrace the same standard and we apply the5 same --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's all it takes for the New7 York State Supreme Court, for example, to have said, well,8 you know, our -- our wire-tap statute does the same thing9 as the Fourth Amendment does anyway? That's all it takes?10 MR. MITCHELL: I believe --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Thereafter, all you have to12 do is cite the New York State statute, and you've raised a13 Federal question.14 MR. MITCHELL: No, respectfully, Your Honor.15 However, if the State supreme court has adopted not only16 the same purpose, but the very language and has, in17 effect, said, our ruling in these cases is controlled by18 the same provision of law, whether a -- a decision of this19 Court, as in the Beck standard that we believe Mississippi20 has adopted, or if the court has articulated that the21 United States Constitution controls this particular22 provision.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, if -- but the24 State standard always has to -- has to comply with the25 Federal requirement, doesn't it?91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. MITCHELL: It always has to comply with the2 -- with the Federal requirement, but as Justice Souter3 pointed out, it may be broader, for example, in situations4 where there might be a right to a -- a jury instruction on5 a lesser-related offense. For --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: So all it takes is a -- is a7 single decision by the State supreme court which says that8 our rule is no broader than the Federal constitutional9 requirement, and thereafter all you have to do is appeal10 to State law.1112 minimally13 important14 on notice15 16 1718 -- I mean, it seems to me counsel should stand up on his19 two feet and say, we're raising a Federal question. Why20 is that too much of an imposition when the statute21 requires that you raise a Federal question? Why do we22 have to go researching what the State supreme court said23 several years ago?24 MR. MITCHELL: Where -- where it is generally25 understood, as in this case, that the two claims are101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. MITCHELL:  Well, while we believe that issufficient, we believe that thereafter it iscertainly to raise a claim which puts the courtof a --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course --MR. MITCHELL:  -- claim.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it does.  Why -- why is that￼1 interwoven, we believe the jurisdiction of this Court, as2 the Court has said, is plain.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So we have4 every case whether the two claims are5 think -- do you think counsel for the6 going to say that they're interwoven?7 MR. MITCHELL: I think counsel for the defense8 would, indeed, contend that they were interwoven.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's too much to10 ask counsel for the defense to say, we are raising a11 Federal question. And it solves the problem.12 MR. MITCHELL: The -- the difficulty in saying13 that we -- that we raise a Federal question is that14 suppose, in this instance, the trial counsel and appellate15 counsel, Mr. Lott, had said, the jury in this case is16 presented with an untenable position, convicting of a17 capital offense or acquitting. That's untenable and that18 raises a Federal question. Would the State then concede19 that that was a sufficient assertion of a Federal20 constitutional claim? Probably not, and that is because21 the State contends, just as the amicus brief contends,22 that this Court should adopt some inflexible rule that is23 extremely and extraordinarily difficult to apply in the24 context of, for example, a trial in Mississippi or North25 Carolina where counsel understands the lifeblood of the111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto figure out ininterwoven.  Do youdefense isn't always￼1 rule, the lifeblood even of the Constitution, but cannot2 at the moment recall the correct citation.3 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my goodness, all it4 requires -- look, the problem is not a technical problem.5 It's a human problem. A judge is a human being. He gets6 the petition. There are 28 different issues. That's a7 lot of work. He goes down one, two, three, four. He gets8 to this issue, which is somewhere hidden among the 28, and9 what it says is, there should have been a lesser-included10 offense instruction and it cites three Mississippi cases,11 which in turn cite one other case, and that -- that other12 case says that the Mississippi rule has constitutional13 implications and cites Beck. Well, I mean, if that's14 supposed to be sufficient, I as a judge would have to, in15 every one of these cases that's cited in these 2816 different issues, start looking up the other cases in17 Mississippi to see if there's some other place they cite18 some other case that says something about a Federal case.19 I mean, you see it's impossible.20 MR. MITCHELL: And -- and we would concede that21 but for the fact that in this particular instance, this22 particular rule is so clearly identifiable.23 JUSTICE BREYER: But it isn't even because,24 after all, Beck talked about an instruction where the25 choice was either convict the person of murder, death121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 penalty, or acquit him, and your case happens to involve2 an instruction which said to the jury, convict him or give3 him a life sentence or acquit him. So we don't even know4 if -- if Beck applies to your case. That's never been5 decided.6 MR. MITCHELL: Well, Your Honor, we would7 respectfully submit suppose that the -- that Howell's8 counsel here had called this a Schad issue, for example,9 where a sentencing scheme somewhat similar to the10 present --11 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't even know -- I am so12 ignorant I don't even know if Schad is a Federal case or a13 State case.141516 have said171819 burden.202122232425 State court judge as well.131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. MITCHELL:  And -- and --JUSTICE BREYER:  So I guess if he had, he shouldFed or U.S. or whatever it is so that I'll know.MR. MITCHELL:  Or -- or suppose --JUSTICE BREYER:  That doesn't seem like such aMR. MITCHELL:  Or -- or --JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I wrote it.(Laughter.)MR. MITCHELL:  But Justice Souter --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Souter was -- was a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)          MR. MITCHELL:  Suppose, though, that this werenot -- were not a -- a lesser-included instruction case.Suppose that what had happened in this case was thatHowell had stood before the judge and said, I'm asking foryou to appoint counsel, and the judge said, well, underthe law of this State, I don't have to do that.  But thenHowell had responded, but the Supreme Court says that youdo.  Would that then be sufficient to raise --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Supreme Court?  Yes, that'sprobably pretty clear it's Federal.          MR. MITCHELL:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe he meant the Statesupreme court.          MR. MITCHELL:  Maybe he meant the State supremecourt.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I'm saying youdon't carry it to extremes.  Don't be ridiculous about it,but that isn't an extreme case we have.  We have which isthe case we have, the State, and then three State cases,and then referring to one State case that says that Beckis -- is a constitutional implication citing Beck.  Imean, I don't have to be extreme in order to say yoursisn't that extreme example.MR. MITCHELL: No, but we would say -- we would 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 say this, Your Honor, that the effort to federalize the2 claim as was done in the Mississippi Supreme Court was3 done in an effort to address the instructions as a whole,4 and --56 here that7 it, in --8 sentence less than death despite the conviction. Isn't9 that right?JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, it isn't even clearBeck would have been violated.  As I understandin Mississippi the jury could have given a10 MR. MITCHELL: We would concede that. Once the11 sentencing phase was reached.12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. So I'm not sure if Beck13 even applies on its own terms.14 MR. MITCHELL: It would be our contention, Your15 Honor, that -- that Spaziano v. Florida, that Schad, and16 the cases following Beck, Hopkins v. Nebraska even would,17 of necessity -- or Hopkins v. Reeves -- I'm sorry -- the18 Nebraska scheme -- would, of necessity, report to the19 court the continuing vitality of Beck even under these20 circumstances, but it -- it is a matter that we believe21 was at least made fairly and reasonably presented to the22 court.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Mitchell, what gives me24 pause is that there are Mississippi cases -- you no doubt25 know them -- where the court has seemed to think that the151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Federal issue under Beck was discrete from the State2 issue. So I forgot the name of them, but one of them was3 striking because it says this doesn't run afoul of Beck,4 and then it says, now we turn to Mississippi law on5 lesser-included offense. And it -- the -- the State6 supreme court treated those two as discrete. So when you7 just say lesser-included offense, why should the Court8 assume that you're talking about one rather than the other9 when the Mississippi Supreme Court itself has made it10 clear that it thinks they are discrete inquiries?11 MR. MITCHELL: Justice Ginsburg, we would12 respectfully submit that -- that the State's recitation of13 Goodin is not a faithful representation of what happened14 in Goodin. In Goodin, he was -- the defendant was given15 the lesser-included simple murder instruction, which16 Howell seeks. It was a robbery case. The report of the17 case appears at 787 So.2d, beginning, I believe it's, 639.18 At pages 655 and 656, the court addresses the Beck issue,19 and it says there that because the jury's alternative in20 the guilt phase was either to convict of capital murder or21 simple murder or to acquit, then and in that circumstance,22 the Beck -- that Beck was not violated. It then says we23 must look to our practice to determine whether a24 manslaughter instruction should be given.25 And it is for that reason that we respectfully161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 submit that Goodin does not attempt to distinguish Beck,2 but in fact squarely addresses a Beck claim, although --3 and we candidly admit -- Goodin's counsel did cite Beck4 itself to the Mississippi court. Nevertheless, the claim5 was phrased in precisely the same manner in which Mr.6 Howell's counsel expressed the same claim.7 These claims, therefore, we would respectfully8 contend, are not virtually identical but are in fact9 identical. But even if there were some minor variations,10 some deviations, as this Court indicated would appear from11 time to time, we contend that clearly that such identity,12 such virtual identity is sufficient to raise the issue.13 In this case, Howell's trial and appellate14 counsel raised two issues with regard to the jury15 instructions. Those two issues themselves were16 interrelated. Those two issues were a whole. Those17 issues related to whether or not there was sufficient18 evidence to convict of robbery and whether or not -- or19 attempted robbery rather, and whether or not there was a20 basis to give a lesser-included instruction. The cases21 which he cites are State cases related to the necessity of22 giving lesser-included instructions where there's an23 attempted robbery and simple murder is, therefore,24 included in that offense.25 He also, at the outset of his contentions with171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 regard to jury instructions, says that under the Eighth2 and Fourteenth Amendments, these jury instructions -- and3 we contend that they must be considered as a whole. These4 jury instructions violate his rights under the Eighth and5 Fourteenth Amendments. It is our position that this is6 sufficient -- while not a cognate of that, is sufficient7 to at least be a corresponding claim, a substantially8 identical claim to Beck, and one which entitles the9 defendant as a matter of due process and as a matter of10 Eighth Amendment consideration and concern, to an11 instruction.12 The difficulty that we face in a circumstance13 such as this where the instruction is not given is that14 the jury's function, while not always reviewable, but15 which is always entitled to protection, may be called into16 question and the quality of the verdict impeached, in17 effect, by the failure to have the third option. In18 essence, it is our contention that where a defendant uses19 the very words that this Court has used to describe the20 constitutional claim, where it uses the very words that21 the State supreme court has used --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question,23 Mr. Mitchell? Supposing the -- there are alternative24 lesser-included offenses that might be urged by the25 defendant as to -- to get an instruction on, and he asks181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 for the wrong one. In other words, the question -- there2 is a question here about exactly what is the lesser-3 included offense. It seems to me that if he tried to kill4 -- if he killed the driver of the vehicle, there may well5 have been some kind of crime. But maybe you ask for a6 lesser-included offense of, say, simple murder and the7 facts don't fit simple murder, but they might fit8 manslaughter or something else. Would your request for --9 for a simple murder, lesser-included offense instruction10 be sufficient if you should really have asked for a11 different lesser-included offense instruction?12 MR. MITCHELL: We would respectfully submit that13 -- that even the Mississippi court has addressed that14 situation in -- in a case cited in -- in the briefs in15 Mease. And there, the defendant asked five times for16 instructions, lesser-included offense instructions, and17 never actually got them right. The court said that that18 is not a basis upon which to deny the instruction and19 then, citing Beck, said that where there is a proper20 lesser-included offense, the fact that the -- that the21 defendant does not request the proper instruction still22 rises to the constitutional proportions that a Beck claim23 does.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is that the case here25 too? One of the things that's neither here nor there I191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 guess, but one of the things that perplexed me was that I2 would have thought that the lesser-included offense on --3 on the theory that the -- that he didn't intend to kill,4 he was sprayed with mace, got mad, pulled out a gun, and5 shot and so on -- I would have thought the lesser-included6 offense was a heat of passion kind of killing. But as --7 as I read the -- the statement of -- of simple murder,8 which requires a deliberate act, that didn't sound like9 it. And I -- I read negligent homicide, and that didn't10 sound like heat of passion. But is -- is it your point11 here, if -- if we get into it, that as long as you asked12 for some lesser-includeds, under Mississippi law that13 raises the issue adequately?14 MR. MITCHELL: We -- we believe that it does15 raise it adequately. We believe that it --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then what would be a17 lesser-included offense? Because if it's not simple18 murder and it's not manslaughter, you haven't suggested a19 third that it might be. I thought your whole position was20 that this simple murder was right and the --21 MR. MITCHELL: We do contend that it was right,22 Your Honor.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the judge was obliged24 to give it. So why -- in view of what Justice Souter just25 said about simple murder requiring a deliberate design,201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 where was the deliberate design here?2 MR. MITCHELL: We believe that -- that there3 are, in effect, two forms of simple murder because of the4 structure of -- and in fact, the Mississippi Supreme Court5 has said this -- because of the structure of the6 Mississippi murder definitions. They are contained in a7 number of separate sections, but the most important of8 which is that a killing, not done in certain enumerated9 felonies, such as robbery or attempt to rob, would10 constitute simple murder. We believe that the simple11 murder instruction would have been correct. But even if12 it were not, we would respectfully submit that that is13 sufficient to raise the question.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what would be if it were15 not? What would be the lesser-included offense?16 MR. MITCHELL: Arguably it would be17 manslaughter. For example, the Mease case, which the18 State cites and to which I made reference, was a case in19 which capital murder was not robbery murder as in this20 case, but the killing of a police officer. In Mease,21 there was an altercation between the sheriff and Mease.22 During that altercation, Mease was struck on the head by23 another deputy. His contention was that the gun fired,24 which he was holding next to the sheriff's neck. The gun25 fired by reaction for two reasons, one that he was in a211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425fight and, secondly, that he was struck.  The Mease courtsaid that that was a proper basis to instruct onmanslaughter, the fact that he had pulled the gun and wasusing it during the course of the fight.          Now, while I find that case difficult to parse,we believe that that certainly could have been an argumentthat could have been raised and that, albeit it was not,it could have been a proper instruction to have beengiven.          If there are no further questions, I'd like toreserve the remainder of my time.Court:JUSTICE STEVENS:  You may.General Hood.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. HOOD, III      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. HOOD:  Justice Stevens, may it please the          I'd like to make the point, as far asjurisdiction goes, that -- that the defendant has failedto make a Federal claim and he is required under Webb v.Webb.  If the Mississippi Supreme Court -- if the lowercourt does not address the issue, then it is assumed thatit was not properly raised.          As to the issue of Beck, there is no Beckviolation.  Actually Mississippi finally -- we've gotten221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 in one instance, we've -- we've become first in -- in this2 regard. In Jackson v. State in 1976, our Supreme Court --3 which was cited in a footnote 10, I believe, in -- in4 Beck. In the Jackson case, Mississippi said -- we had the5 same statute, pretty much, that Alabama had that6 restricted a lesser-included offense instruction.7 Mississippi said, number one, you cannot restrict that8 lesser-included offense instruction if it is supported by9 the facts, and number two, in the Jackson case, the court10 held that it had to be bifurcation, which was the11 problem, the impact on the guilt phase. And -- and so I12 would submit to the Court that there is no impact in13 Mississippi in this case on the guilt phase, nothing to14 influence the jurors' decision, and that was the inherent15 problem that the Court recognized in Beck.16 Number two, Mississippi allows a life sentence,17 which also distinguishes Beck. It -- it allows the jury,18 in a separate, bifurcated hearing, to determine whether or19 not the defendant should receive life or the death20 penalty.21 And then thirdly, in Mississippi, we have a22 broader standard than the Federal standard. If it's any23 lesser offense in Mississippi, then the defendant is24 entitled to it if it's supported by the facts of the case.25 So we have a broader standard that gives the defendant an231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425easier opportunity to meet that standard.          And thirdly --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't get your point.  Itdoesn't have to be a -- a lesser-included offense --          MR. HOOD:  Yes, yes, sir --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- so long as it's a lesseroffense?          MR. HOOD:  -- Justice Scalia.  It just has to bea lesser offense.          And I would submit to the Court that if we areanalyzing a Federal constitutional issue, then perhaps we-- we should follow Federal constitutional standards,which was stated -- the strict elements test, in otherwords, because under -- under Federal law, it has to be,well, number one, a lesser-included offense, a truelesser-included offense, and under the Schmoke case, thisCourt has stated that that is in fact applying the strictelements --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I interrupt with aquestion there, General Cox?          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  In this case, if the manapproached the victim in the car and shot him and killedhim, as I understand it, and the theory was an attemptedrobbery and therefore the -- the capital offense.  Now,241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are you telling me that if they failed to prove there wasan attempted robbery, it was not an offense at all?          MR. HOOD:  No, sir.  I -- I'm not stating that.It would -- it would be an offense, but based upon thesefacts.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then why wasn't he entitled toan instruction on whatever offense it was?          MR. HOOD:  Because the -- the facts in this caseshow that there was no other reason for him to approachthat vehicle than to rob that individual.  There was nopremeditated intent.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But his theory was if therewas a failure of proof on the attempted robbery, that allwas left was a -- a killing for some other reason.  And ifthere was a killing -- if there was a failure of proof onattempted robbery, would he not then have been entitled toa -- a lesser offense instruction?          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir, Justice Stevens.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So what your theory is then --          MR. HOOD:  It depends on --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- if I understand itcorrectly, isrobbery is soavailable.MR.the proof that there was an attemptedconvincing that no other theory wasHOOD: Well, that's the facts that we had in 25Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 this case. And your analysis there again will -- will2 hinge on whether or not -- in Mississippi admittedly3 murder would be a lesser-included offense if the facts4 support it and also manslaughter. But now, if you apply5 the Federal standard --6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still don't understand7 your answer to Justice Stevens' question. I had the -- I8 had the same problem. The evidence of robbery here was9 circumstantial, strong, but still circumstantial based on10 his earlier statements that he was going to make a sting,11 I think he said, and then the witness saw him outside the12 window and -- and he stopped the car. And I take it, he13 didn't take the stand and say, I stopped the car to ask14 for directions or something. But still it's -- it's --15 that's certainly a jury issue as to whether there was a16 robbery.17 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir, it is. It's -- the -- the18 facts were in this case, though, all night long they had19 ridden around looking for someone to rob. They made a20 statement in Tupelo --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but would the State of22 Mississippi take the position that if there was no23 robbery, there was no crime in this case --24 MR. HOOD: No, sir.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when a man is shot and 261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425killed?          MR. HOOD:  On the facts that we had, if -- ifyou analyze it under the Federal standard -- and I wouldsubmit to the Court that we should apply --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  I'm talking about justMississippi law.  You're the prosecutor saying, we -- wemay not get robbery here.  The -- is that the only thingthey charge is robbery or let the man go after he shootsand kills the person he doesn't even know?          MR. HOOD:  We don't know -- he didn't know thisdefendant.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, but the question issuppose we have a different case, not this case.Everything is the same but for the fact we know for sureit wasn't a robbery.  That's all.  Now, in that differentcase, is it a crime under the law of Mississippi whathappened?          MR. HOOD:  Well, first --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I've told you everything aboutthe case.  It's just like this one except we know it isn'ta robbery.  Now, is it a crime?  The answer we think isabsolutely it's a crime.  And my next question is whichcrime.          MR. HOOD:  Which crime.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay?271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.  You're correct.  First, wewouldn't have -- have charged --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So which crime is it?          MR. HOOD:  Based upon the facts that we had --and he didn't know this individual.  He had nopremeditated intent to kill him.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.          MR. HOOD:  It would not be murder.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  So it would be something.What would it be?          MR. HOOD:  It could arguably be a felony murder,which is a separate statute in Mississippi.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So then maybethere's afelony --MR. HOOD:  He meant to commit another --JUSTICE BREYER:  Is anything else possible?MR. HOOD:  -- another crime.JUSTICE BREYER:  Manslaughter?MR. HOOD:  Well --JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, it's odd that inMississippi people just go around shooting each other allthe time and there's no statute that seems to cover it.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if you don't know someone,then it's not murder?281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          (Laughter.)          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand.          MR. HOOD:  Oh, yes, sir.  That -- that happensall the time.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So there must be --          MR. HOOD:  But, of course, it's premeditation.If there were evidence, say, for example --          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  They just do it --who knows why.  All we know about them is they went andkilled somebody.  Now, I think it's still a crime to killpeople in, I thought, all 50 States, but -- but --          (Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  So I'm going to say which --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's make it -- if we makeit concrete, let's take all that we have in this case isthe testimony that Rice gave.  Rice was the one whoobserved this murder, and he didn't have any statementsabout the defendant needing money to pay off his debt.You have only that snapshot scene of what the witness sawfrom the window, which doesn't establish any robbery atall because Rice said he didn't observe any robbery goingon.  All he observed was the killing.  Now, if that's allyou have in this case, a person was killed, an eyewitnessto the shooting, the eyewitness testifies exactly as Mr.Rice did in this case, what crime would you indict for?291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOOD:  Justice Ginsburg, to -- to -- firstof all, we wouldn't have indicted for capital murder if wedidn't have that evidence.  We wouldn't be discussing theBeck issue.  It wouldn't be a lesser-included offensequestion.  We'd strictly be focusing on those facts,number one, that particular witness Rice was on the otherside of the vehicle.  You had separate testimony fromLipsey, the co-defendant who was in the vehicle and could-- behind where -- where --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:hypothetical where --          JUSTICE STEVENS:try to answer her question.          JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm giving you aGeneral Scott, I suggest you Yes.  All you have --The question is that's -- one          JUSTICE STEVENS:witness is all you had.  Would there be a crime againstthe law of Mississippi and if so, what would it be?          MR. HOOD:  It would be manslaughter, I suppose,Your Honor.  That's not the facts in this case and -- andI apologize --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So what -- but -- butthe line of reasoning is -- is -- now, there is a crime.Let's call it X.  All right?  And what you're -- whatcounsel says is it's the law of Mississippi that if thereis a crime and it's X and it's lesser, you've got to301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 charge it if somebody just says, please give me a lesser-2 included instruction, even if he's all mixed up as to what3 the right crime is.4 I don't know if that's the law of Mississippi.5 From reading the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion, I6 would say it wasn't the law of Mississippi because they7 say you're not supposed to charge people in ways that8 would mix9 argument.101112 suggested13 response?1415 sections in the Mississippi code, not in one section.

We have one if you drive a18 nail in a tree and -- and you're -- you're cutting lumber19 and it kills someone, that's a manslaughter still.20 This defendant only requested a culpable21 negligence manslaughter instruction. There was no evidence22 to -- to support that. The only potentially -- I -- I could23 even make a stretch -- would be a heat of passion. He did24 not request that -- request instruction, and --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that fatal to him?

Is -- is that fatal to him?          MR. HOOD:  His failure to request --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Under Mississippi law, would hebe entitled to a lesser offense instruction if he askedfor the wrong lesser offense?  I.e., in this case, if hefailed to ask for heat of passion, would he still beentitled to a correct lesser instruction, even when hedidn't ask for it?          MR. HOOD:  Perhaps the judge should correctwithin a particular statute, but not go look at all 12statutes that he's under -- which -- which would classifyas murder.then.JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you say he's not entitledMR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  The -- the only thing he wouldbe entitled to, if he were correct, is the lesserinstruction that he asked for, and if he's not correct,there's no error.          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.  He would have had to -- tohave specifically requested heat of passion.  But thereagain, I don't believe that he put oneven --JUSTICE SOUTER: No. We're 32evidence to supportjust trying to getWashington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 at what Mississippi law is, and I think you've --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And under your view of the3 facts, as I understand it, he would have been entitled to4 a manslaughter instruction.5 MR. HOOD: I don't -- that's only a stretch to6 answer -- answer Justice Breyer's question.7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, surely -- surely, if one8 walks up to a car and shoots the driver dead, that's must9 be a crime.10 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir. It -- it would have to be11 classified as --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is we don't13 know exactly which of your several statutory provisions it14 violated, but if it violated one of them, I don't15 understand. And if he's correct -- maybe he misrepresents16 the law. He tells us, as a matter of State law, if he17 asked for the wrong lesser-included instruction, but there18 is a correct one, the judge has a duty to give the correct19 instruction. That's what -- what the counsel has told us.20 And if that's right, I don't understand why he wasn't21 entitled to some lesser-included offense instruction.22 MR. HOOD: I -- I believe what he was addressing23 was language within a particular statute, meaning a24 lesser-included offense of -- of murder or how you styled25 it, whether it be depraved heart murder or -- or felony331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 murder, first degree murder.2 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's -- it's your view he3 must ask for the correct lesser-included offense4 instruction.5 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir. And -- and there again,6 I'd like for the Court to -- to understand my statement7 that we should construe this on what -- how the Federal8 law -- how you -- how the Federal courts construe it, not9 use Mississippi's lesser standard, but let's -- let's10 construe it on whether or not, first, it is a true lesser-11 included offense because that's -- that's what the Federal12 standard is, and that's what we followed in Nebraska.13 And secondly, if it's a true lesser-included14 offense, we have to use the analysis of the Federal courts15 which says that it has to use the strict elements test.16 Well, murder would not be a lesser-included offense under17 Federal law because under the Mississippi capital murder18 statute can be with or without deliberate design.19 Therefore, there is no deliberate design. It would not be20 a lesser-included offense of murder. Manslaughter would21 not be a lesser-included offense under that same elements22 test because it requires the additional element of sudden23 provocation or heat of passion. So I would submit to the24 Court, if we apply what's fair under Federal law, what the25 floor is under Federal law, we should use the Federal341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 analysis and not Mississippi --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is sudden provocation or3 heat of passion part of the prosecution's burden or a part4 of his -- one of the -- is it a matter of defense?5 MR. HOOD: It would be a matter of the defense6 raising sudden provocation. And I don't believe that they7 -- they certainly didn't put on anything about culpable8 negligence. For example, maybe he was spinning the gun in9 his hand for culpable negligence. They didn't put on10 anything about deliberate design because he didn't want to11 testify. His defense was alibi and so he didn't take the12 stand and say, I intended to kill this person, therefore,13 give me the murder instruction. He's got to put on14 evidence to support it, and I don't believe he put on15 sufficient evidence for either of those.16 And -- and I was the district attorney who tried17 this case, so factually I -- I remember the -- the -- my18 argument was that we couldn't have proved murder if we had19 wanted to because there was no premeditation.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to the heat of21 passion point? You say he did not put on evidence, but22 wasn't there evidence in the record through a State's23 witness that at least would have supported a heat of24 passion argument, the evidence being that he went up to25 the car, no gun was apparent, something happened.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Evidence shows that he was sprayed with mace, and at thatpoint, he pulls out a gun and shoots.  That, I suppose, isevidence of heat of passion.  Couldn't he have asked for aheat of passion instruction even though he did not put onthe heat of passion evidence himself?          MR. HOOD:  He could have asked for a heat ofpassion instruction, but --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, but he did not do so.          MR. HOOD:  -- but he did not do so.  Yes, sir.That -- those facts --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  You're -- you're -- Idon't -- you're calling the heat of passion an element of-- of the crime of manslaughter?  It's not an element ofthe crime.          MR. HOOD:  It's sudden provocation, yes, sir.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose you walk up and -- andyou blow somebody away.  You can't -- there's no heat ofpassion.  There's no sudden provocation.  You just walk upand blow them away.  And you're telling me that that's nota crime because you can't -- you can't prove heat ofpassion?  You can't prove one of the other elements ofmanslaughter?  That can't be right.          MR. HOOD:  No, sir.  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't it enough that youkilled somebody?361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR.

Surely, there must besome crime in -- in Mississippi that -- that covers that.          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.  You --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is it?          MR. HOOD:  -- charge murder and -- and theprosecution --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  It's not murder.  Itwasn't -- you know, he didn't -- I didn't walk up to the-- to the car intending to kill him.  As you say, youcouldn't have indicted for murder.          MR. HOOD:  Likely, the State would -- would have-- have -- if those were the facts and that's all thefacts that we had, then the State would likely havecharged murder and asked for a lesser-included offenseinstruction for manslaughter.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Manslaughter being defined askilling without deliberation?          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  That's what he is saying --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There -- there is a -- you saythere -- there are what?  Nine different manslaughter, didyou say?371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. HOOD: Twelve different manslaughter --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Twelve different, and one of3 them is simply killing somebody simpliciter, without any4 provocation. Right?5 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir, without. But he requested6 the culpable negligent manslaughter instruction, and there7 was no evidence of culpable negligent manslaughter. It's8 a separate section in our code now. There are 129 different sections. It's not like we have one statute10 that lists all of those. And -- and some of them are --11 are arcane. And I think it's unfair to ask a trial court12 judge to correct every request for an instruction and --13 and -- he -- at trial, if you read --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- let me ask -- ask15 you this. Knowing what we know now, we have the record,16 we have the benefit of hindsight, we know the evidence, in17 your view now what would have been the closest lesser-18 included offense for which an instruction might have been19 sought?20 MR. HOOD: There are two possibilities that were21 not requested. One is our felony -- felony murder.22 Felony murder is -- is the killing of -- that occurs23 without occurring with one of the seven offenses that we24 have listed, murder, rape, and so forth, committing25 another crime. Or heat of passion manslaughter. And I381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 would submit to the Court that -- that they never2 requested3 requested45 to help me sort of -- what are the -- as a matter of State6 law, what are the elements of the offense for which he was7 convicted?anything about the felony murder and they neverthe heat of passion manslaughter.JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question just8 MR. HOOD: Elements of the offense are that he9 -- that he -- a killing occurred with or without intent10 and that it was in the commission of -- of a crime,11 robbery.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Those are the two elements.13 And so that if you take out with -- in the commission of14 another crime and just left the -- the other part of it,15 would that also be an offense?16 MR. HOOD: With or without under Mississippi17 law --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, you say -- you19 say the offenses are killing somebody with or without the20 intent to 212223 attempted24 felony and you proved the remainder of the -- the other25 elements. Is he guilty of anything in -- underdo so --MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- and in the course of anfelony.  Say you failed to prove the attempted391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Mississippi --2 MR. HOOD: It -- if you -- if you prove the3 intent --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if he is, why isn't it a5 lesser-included offense is my next question.6 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir. If you just take those7 away and you just have those two elements, with or8 without, if it's with intent, then it would be classified9 as murder. If it's without, it could possibly be --10 without intent, then it could be classified as11 manslaughter.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that then there13 are two lesser-included offenses, and either one would14 have -- he should have gotten an instruction on both.151617 not. 1819 again, if20 we're talking about what the United States Constitution21 requires, and therefore, I would submit to the Court that22 we should apply what the Federal law is. And that law is23 -- number one, is it a lesser-included offense? Using the24 elements test, murder is not a lesser-included offense to25 capital murder, and the reason being is because capital401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. HOOD:  I -- I --JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I don't understand whyMR. HOOD:  Yes, sir, I understand.  But therewe go back to what the Federal standards are,￼1 murder is with or without intent and you add an additional2 element of murder which requires intent. Same goes for3 manslaughter because you had the additional sudden4 provocation element.5 So I would say that if we follow the Federal6 standard and -- and that's -- that's the floor, and the7 floor is it's got to be a lesser-included offense, it --8 it's not a -- a lesser-included offense. So therefore9 that should answer the question.10 Secondly, under the Federal standard, you have11 to prove that -- that the court -- the judge has to decide12 that the -- a reasonable juror would acquit of the greater13 offense and also convict of the lesser. Well, Mississippi14 law does not require that, but I -- I'd submit to the15 Court that -- that after the Beck decision in 1980, our16 supreme court in the case of In re Jordan -- they applied17 the Federal standard. They required that -- when they18 analyzed Beck, they applied the Federal standard, in other19 words, the -- the part about that you have to acquit. You20 have to acquit on -- on the greater offense. And they21 also included the lesser-included offense language in that22 Beck analysis.23 So, therefore, had he properly raised the24 jurisdictional issue -- there's nowhere in the record does25 he cite Beck. There's nowhere in the record that he411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 states facts that would even support Beck. So had he even2 properly reached that issue and -- and cited Beck, I would3 submit to the Court that the facts don't support it under4 Mississippi law. The facts don't support it under Federal5 law. And it doesn't meet the lesser-included offense6 standard.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you? I'm8 unclear on -- on lesser-included in Mississippi. And I'm9 going to take this step by step.10 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And tell me if I'm right or12 wrong at each step.13 The offense that he was charged with -- the14 capital offense that he was charged with was killing with15 or without intent in the course of committing a crime. Is16 that correct?17 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now, his claim --19 let's assume he claims this. There is evidence from --20 from which you -- you could infer that he wasn't21 committing a crime. He may or may not be right, but let's22 assume that's his claim, and let's assume the judge says,23 yes, there's some evidence that would indicate that he24 wasn't up there robbing at the time he stood next to the25 car. Assume the judge accepts that. He then says, on421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that assumption, I want a lesser-included offense2 instruction of simple murder, killing with intent. Is3 that a lesser-included offense under -- under capital4 murder?5 MR. HOOD: There again, Your Honor --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because what he's saying is,7 I'm asking for an instruction on an offense which is8 lesser -- it does not -- it's an offense that doesn't9 include the course of the crime, but it does include the10 other elements. It includes killing with intent. Isn't11 that lesser-included on your definition of Mississippi12 homicide law?13 MR. HOOD: No, sir. And -- and I would say that14 under the Federal standard, clearly it's not a lesser-15 included offense. I would say under the State --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I mean, he's got to17 qualify under the Federal standard. He says, the offense18 I was charged with was killing with or without intent,19 plus crime. I want an instruction that says nothing about20 plus crime but simply charges on killing with or without21 intent. Isn't he asking under Federal law for a lesser-22 included instruction?23 MR. HOOD: No, sir. He didn't -- first of all,24 he never --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Confine it to431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425killing with intent.          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Under -- under -- as Iunderstood -- as I understood you to define the capitaloffense, the State could prove the capital offense bysaying he did have intent when he killed and he alsohappened to be committing a crime.  Am I wrong about thatstatement of Mississippi law?          MR. HOOD:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I apologize.I -- I didn't follow you.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought you said that on thecapital offense, the killing could be with or withoutintent.          MR. HOOD:  Right.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you confuse us bysaying that.  If you just left that out of your statement,felony murder is killing in the course of a crime.  Don'tsay anything about intent.  Intent is not an element offelony murder.  Right?          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So if you want to get plainmurder, you're adding an element.          MR. HOOD:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has to be murder with441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425intent, and that's why you say it's not a lesser-includedoffense because for plain murder, you need intent, and forfelony murder, you don't need intent.case?MR. HOOD:  Thank you, sir.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that -- isn't that yourMR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that the Mississippi law forfelony murder is killing, pure and simple, plus crime, andsimple murder is killing plus intent.  And that plusintent iswhy it is not lesser-included.MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir, on a felony --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.

So that's the secondreason why it would not fall within the -- the Beck rule.          MR.

HOOD: I'd like to also point out factually2 that in the -- in the -- initially in the petition, the --3 and actually at trial and at the Mississippi Supreme4 Court, they talked about that the defendant may have been5 able -- may have been out there selling drugs to the6 defendant. I'd submit to the Court that a proper review of7 the record, if you look at the Mississippi Supreme Court8 opinion at page 98 and -- 97 and 98 and page 40, the9 defendant in his own brief admits that that was not in10 evidence. It came from the -- from a plea where the --11 where one of the co-defendants pled, and it never was12 placed before the jury.1314 they talk15 the sting16 comment came from one of the witnesses named Powell who17 was merely speculating. I don't know what he was talking18 about a sting, but it could have been that he was going to19 borrow money or -- or rob somebody. So that -- that was20 speculation. So the -- the facts just don't support the21 granting of a lesser-included offense in this particular22 case.23 I'd also like to ask the Court to -- to note24 that in Hopkins v. Reeves in footnote 7, the -- the Court25 suggests that we don't decide that -- that particular case461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOHere in -- in the brief in this particular case,about, well, he -- maybe he was borrowing money,question, whether he was borrowing money.  That￼1 based upon the bifurcation issue alone. I would ask that2 the Court answer that question in this particular case and3 state that Beck has no application in this particular case4 because the danger that occurred and the Court's concern5 with in Beck is not -- doesn't happen here in the6 Mississippi instance because in Jackson v. State, we7 had already said that you have a bifurcated hearing --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but -- but it is true9 that -- that there's a difference between becoming10 eligible for the death penalty, on the one hand, and not11 being eligible on the other. And conceivably the Beck12 concern is triggered when the failure to give a lesser-13 included offense gives the jury the option of -- no other14 option other than convicting of a capital offense.15 MR. HOOD: Justice Stevens, I -- I would16 respectfully disagree. We believe that the -- the Beck17 issue is just with this question. You have a choice of18 guilt and death penalty or acquittal. This question that19 they're raising is conviction, not death penalty, or20 acquittal. And those are separate issues.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- an offense for which the22 death penalty is the punishment.23 MR. HOOD: Yes, sir, but it doesn't impact the24 guilt phase, and that was what the problem was, I believe,25 in Beck, was that -- that a jury might not -- they don't471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 want to turn him loose because -- and they give him a2 conviction, which automatically carries the death penalty.3 And that impacts the jury. And I understand that. That4 was a proper decision, but that just didn't happen here in5 this particular case. And Mississippi has just6 distinguished Beck.7 I don't believe that they properly raise this8 Court's jurisdiction. They never cite9 raised -- they never said due process.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if11 is that you either have to acquit themBeck.  They never12 make sure13 way to do14 the judge15 that Beck16the jurors' concernor -- we want toagain, and the onlyhe never walks out of prisonthat is to convict him of a capital offense socan impose the death penalty.  I don't know whywouldn't be triggered on those facts.MR. HOOD:  Well, maybe I don't understand the17 question correctly. But in Beck, you know, the jury18 wasn't told that the judge would have a separate option of19 denying the death penalty. In this case, judge in State's20 -- court instruction C-5, the court says you are not to21 consider the sentence, that you only consider the issue of22 guilt or innocence of the charge. And so that's why I say23 this is not a Beck issue because it doesn't impact the --24 the jury's determination in the guilt phase.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 works against you because it takes away from the jury the2 option of saying, well, we'll convict him of a serious3 offense, but we'll be sure not to give him a capital4 offense. So that -- it seems to me that that argument5 then works against you.6 MR. HOOD: Well, Justice Kennedy, in7 Mississippi, we have, there again, that open standard, not8 the Federal standard. And we would give him that9 instruction and give that jury that option if the facts10 support it, and I respectfully submit to the Court that --11 that the facts do not support a lesser-included offense12 under these facts.13 If the Court has no further questions, thank14 you.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Hood.16 Mr. Mitchell, you have about 4 and a half17 minutes left.18192021 it please 2223 here that24 with a plan to rob and that, therefore, there were no25 other -- there was no other possibility for the court to491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONNIE M. MITCHELL      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MITCHELL:  Justice Stevens, and -- and maythe Court:With regard to the argument that the State makesthese individuals had ridden around all night￼1 consider in -- in granting instructions, first, it is our2 contention that both Mississippi law and due process law3 requires a judge to instruct a jury on all of the relevant4 issues in the case, on all the relevant law in the case.5 And in Fairchild v. State, that is precisely what the6 Mississippi court did in saying that a court could not7 simply conclude, no matter how strong the evidence of8 attempt to rob or plan to rob, that it could, in effect,9 direct a verdict and not instruct on lesser-included10 offenses.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- were the two12 principal lesser-included offenses in -- in your view your13 D-13 and D-18 that are in the appendix?14 MR. MITCHELL: Your Honor, those are the ones15 that were -- were, in fact, raised. We believe that16 rather than intent the -- on the simple murder, that the17 issue is malice as opposed to intent. The statutory18 definition, for example, of manslaughter in -- in19 Mississippi statute 97-3 -- I believe -27 is a killing of20 a human being without malice and while not in the21 commission of these felonies.22 Now, it may be that simply a small-town lawyer23 from -- from North Carolina is told don't go to the big24 city and get stung by some guy coming up to you and25 saying, you know, I just got off the bus and I need to get501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 some money from you and my kids and my wife are waiting2 for me in the hotel room. But that happens not only in3 the big city, it also happens in Mississippi. And so4 there was a basis in which a jury could reasonably infer5 that there was a reason to approach that vehicle other6 than an attempted robbery. And the question is, what is a7 reasonable inference?8 The Mississippi court here in its opinion said9 that there was clearly evidence from which a jury could10 infer robbery. We concede that, but there were also other11 inferences that this evidence raised, and that evidence,12 we respectfully submit, mandated a lesser-included offense13 instruction.14 We also contend that -- that the State has not,15 heretofore, raised any issue about Beck's continuing16 vitality, but we respectfully submit that Beck is of17 continuing vitality. Just a -- a survey of even habeas18 corpus cases from the various circuits will show that the19 circuits are continuing to apply Beck even in States where20 the statutory sentencing scheme is far different from Beck21 and there is no preclusive statute involved, as there was22 in Alabama.23 We respectfully submit that the language in Beck24 itself speaks to this issue. The Beck court added, the25 same reasoning must apply to rules that diminish the511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reliability of the -- the guilt determination, the very2 point that Justice Kennedy pointed out undercuts3 Mississippi's argument. It is this diminution of the4 reliability of the guilt determination that is at issue5 here.6 In addition to that, we would respectfully7 submit that under these circumstances, there was a basis8 under which a lesser-included offense instruction was9 mandated because Beck did not apply the Blockburger test.10 In fact, it did not incorporate Blockburger, did not refer11 to Mullaney v. Wilbur. What it did was it said if there12 is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State law.13 All of the succeeding cases from this Court have said if14 there is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State15 law, conceding that State law is the applicable standard16 then and not the standard that the State now seeks to17 impose, which it never raised in -- in its brief, which it18 has never asserted to be the standard. Blockburger is19 certainly not cited in anything that the State has20 submitted. Blockburger is not contended to be the basis,21 nor could it be. The basis is is there a lesser-included22 offense under State law, and we contend that that is the23 basis on which this case should be decided.24 Thank you very much.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)53Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
