Murphy.          Mr. Kuntz.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. KUNTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The statute awarding attorneys' fees as partof the costs to the prevailing parents provides a clearrule, imposes a certain obligation.  It should not beexpanded to include fees for expert witnesses.          This is a case of statutory construction.Under longstanding rules, statutes are construed byfirst looking at the words of the statute.  Is themeaning plain?  If so, the inquiry stops there.          This statute is unambiguous.  Expert fees arenot a part of attorneys' fees.  Expert fees are notcosts.  The statute contains no reference to expertfees.  They are not shifted to the school district whenthe parents prevail.          It's our belief that the lack of compensationfor experts is an intentional exclusion and omission31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 from the statute. Congress knows how to add expert2 fees in a cost-shifting statute, and that omission is3 telling here.4 In that context, I think it's important to5 draw the Court's attention to the origin of the6 statute. It was in response to this Court's decision7 in Smith against Robinson. At the time that Smith8 against Robinson was heard, the EHA was often grafted9 onto other causes of action as a pleading device to --10 in an attempt to ensure that attorneys' fees flowed to11 the prevailing party at the conclusion of the case. So12 cases were brought not only under the -- the Education13 for All Handicapped Children Act, but also under 504 of14 the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and under 1983 as well15 of -- on the theory that these were equal protection16 claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment. In17 Smith against Robinson, this Court made it clear that18 the avenue that had to be followed by the parents was19 exclusively that of -- of the remedy provided under the20 Education for All Handicapped Children Act.21 In response to that decision of the Court, as22 my opponent points out in his brief -- I think it was23 19 days later -- bills were introduced into Congress to24 remedy what Congress at that point saw was a -- a lack25 of coverage for fees for attorneys for the prevailing41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425parties in cases under the -- under the act.  So it'sno -- no great surprise that what Congress did in thatinstance was to take the language that appears insection 1988 and, in effect, lift it and put it intothe -- into the act, into what we now call the IDEA.          And it's very clear that in doing so, itlimited the right of recovery to attorneys' fees, andthat right does not include the expert fees advocatedby the Respondents here this morning.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think the rightincludes any costs other than statutory costs, anyexpenses?          MR. KUNTZ:  No, it does not, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  How do you explain thereference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief whichquotes from the -- a section of the statute authorizinga report to be made, a report authorized under?  Theyshall include data about the specific amount ofattorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.  Why do yousuppose they put the word expenses in?          MR. KUNTZ:  Well, it said attorneys' fees,costs, and expenses.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.          MR. KUNTZ:  And it's a direction to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So the expenses must be51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something other than attorneys' fees or costs.          MR. KUNTZ:  Well, they could be expenses ofthe attorney.  But if they were to be -- be set asideseparately, that's no indication that -- that Congressintended that expenses of other individuals be shiftedto the cost -- shifted, rather, to the school district.It's a direction to the GAO to acquire data --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.          MR. KUNTZ:  -- for future reference by -- byCongress.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what about -- may Ijust take the question one step further?  I think it'sin a subsequent clause in that same section requiringthe GAO report that it refers to the -- the -- I forgetwhether -- the expenses of consultants.  Why was theword consultant in there?  Because as -- as Iunderstand it, a consultant would not be covered by thecosts -- the general costs statute.          MR. KUNTZ:  Your Honor, I believe that'scorrect.  That's in -- in subdivision (B).          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it?  Is it?  I thoughtthe -- there was a reference to hours of consultants,but not expenses.          MR. KUNTZ:  There are two subdivisions:subdivision (A) and subdivision (B).  Subdivision (A)61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 says attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses -- expenses,2 and in subdivision (B), it refers to consultants. But3 there isn't any --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I would have thought5 that your answer would be that the Congress was6 interested in finding out the cost of this act, and7 it's very clear that school districts hire consultants8 to assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to9 know the amount they were paying to the consultants.10 And that's also why it used the word personnel, which11 -- which is a word usually reserved for a government12 agency.13 MR. KUNTZ: I -- I believe Your Honor is14 correct in that it -- it's a direction by the GAO to15 acquire data. And I believe we argued that point in16 our brief, just as Your Honor has expressed it. We17 think that that direction to the GAO, however, does not18 relate back particularly and -- and certainly doesn't19 inform this Court or inform the statute that expert's20 fees are to be included and shifted over to the -- to21 the school district.22 JUSTICE BREYER: But does it make it possible23 to read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to24 do that, but I guess you could read it to do that,25 couldn't you? I mean, you said the word cost wasn't71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 ambiguous.2 MR. KUNTZ: Under this statute.3 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you might be right,4 maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong? How is5 it not ambiguous? It might cover -- it might cover the6 fees of consultants. It might be that the argument you7 made is right, but it also mightn't.8 MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I think this Court9 has looked at that issue in -- in two separate cases,10 and one of those cases is Crawford Fitting and the11 other is --12 JUSTICE BREYER: Which involved this statute?13 MR. KUNTZ: Well, it didn't involve this --14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, I mean, we15 have a statute and they're using the word costs in the16 statute, and whatever they used in some other statute17 they might have meant something different in this18 statute. And my question is simply how do we know they19 didn't by just reading the word five times,20 particularly since, in fact, if you look at another21 part of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost22 to include number of hours spent by personnel,23 including consultants, and the expenses incurred. I24 mean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says25 the word costs couldn't include that?81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KUNTZ:  Your Honor, it -- it could, but I--          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, once you say it could,then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the CongressMembers were actually thinking, and as soon as we lookat what they were actually thinking, that's perfectlyclear.  Isn't it?  Because both the conference reportand the Senate report say absolutely clearly that theyintended this kind of expense to be used, which is whythe GAO went out and did all the studies to include it.          MR. KUNTZ:  But we come back to thehistorical derivation of how this statute came into --into being, and it did come in in response to Smithagainst Robinson.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought the GAO studyincluded not just the -- the hours worked and the --the costs, however you choose to define it, on the partof the parent challenging the school board action, butit also included those hours and those costs expendedby the school.          MR. KUNTZ:  Yes, Your Honor, it does.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  In which case it could notpossibly havecompensable.MR.been directed to what items areKUNTZ: We think that's a separate 9Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425section.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  On its face, it covers atleast half of the items that are not compensable.          MR. KUNTZ:  That's true, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It's true, but --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Isn't it true that theprovision I referred to refers to the specific amountof attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to theprevailing party?   So it's definitely referring toexpenses incurred by the -- by the plaintiff.  Isn'tthat true?          MR. KUNTZ:  Your Honor, I -- that's correct.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. KUNTZ:  But I think there are expensesthat -- that the attorney bears in -- in the routine ofa -- of a -- of handling the client.  Those areexpenses --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you're saying the wordexpenses should refer only to expenses incurred bycounsel, which of course would be normallyreimbursable.          MR. KUNTZ:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I'm not -- I'mnot sure that you don't have a further answer toJustice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B).101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 (3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the2 prevailing party. (3)(B) says, for the same sample the3 number of hours spent.4 MR. KUNTZ: They're talking about -- the same5 sample refers to a -- a designated number of States, a6 representative number of States. So the sample refers7 to the States surveyed, not to those --8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's certainly possible.9 I just wonder why don't we look and see what they10 intended, since they told us. In the conference11 report, they say the conferees intend the phrase,12 attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable13 expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the14 reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is15 found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent16 or guardian's case in the action or proceeding. So why17 are we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress18 intended when they told us what they intended?19 MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I don't think it's so20 much a question of metaphysics or philosophy -- maybe21 perhaps of philosophy.22 JUSTICE BREYER: My question is why don't we23 just look and see what they intended since they wrote24 it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is25 read it?111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Kuntz?JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did Congress say that, Mr.MR. KUNTZ:  No, Congress didn't say that.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I thoughtthat the conferees in Congress wrotereport precisely what they intended.          MR. KUNTZ:  Your Honor, ifit did.  I thoughtin the conferenceI might respond tothat.to it.JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I'd like you to respond(Laughter.)          MR. KUNTZ:  It's -- it's a longstanding ruleof statutory construction that Congress' intent is bestfound in the language that Congress actually puts intothe statute.  And as we pointed out in the brief, therewere previous versions of this act which includedexperts' fees which did not make its way to the finalversion approved by both the -- the Senate and theHouse.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  There's no doubt that thebest evidence is the text of the statute, but at leastthe people who drafted this, even if they were not theconferees themselves but were just staff members, theyapparently thought the language was subject to thatreading.121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which would mean it would3 be ambiguous, wouldn't it?4 MR. KUNTZ: The rule that we look first to5 the -- yes, Your Honor. Yes.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: The rule that you refer to7 that you cannot look at legislative history -- of8 course, we always start with the plain language.9 That's clear. But the rule that you cannot look at10 legislative history didn't really get any emphasis till11 after 1987, and this statute was enacted in 1986.12 MR. KUNTZ: But that -- in -- in the13 retrospective view that the Court looked at in -- in14 the -- the Casey decision, it went back and it traced15 the origin of a number of -- of statutes and looked16 essentially to similar language, and it found that17 experts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and18 it found that experts' fees were not a part of -- of19 costs.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also found that21 there were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't22 Justice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on23 for a couple of pages, including footnotes? I think it24 was over 30 that did mention experts. It mentioned25 attorneys' fees and expert fees.131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. KUNTZ:  Yes, Your Honor, and to us thatproves that Congress knows how to distinguish betweenexperts' fees and attorneys' fees when it wants to.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was this language, by theway -- I'm not clear.  It always cited to the House --the House-- in theit was.conferees.  Was -- was this language in theSenate conference report?MR. KUNTZ:  No, Your Honor, I don't believeJUSTICE SCALIA:  So we don't really know --          MR. KUNTZ:  It emanates -- it emanates solelyfrom the House conference report.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's only half ofthe Congress, isn't it?  Even if --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I thought it was a jointexplanatory statement.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- even if everybody in theHouse agreed with that, which we don't really know.          What about the President?  When he signed it,did -- did he indicate any interpretation?          MR. KUNTZ:  His -- Your Honor, the -- thePresident's hesitancy was about the retroactive effect ofthe statute, and he noted that in his signingmemorandum, but he didn't note any other differences.JUSTICE SCALIA: So we have a committee of 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425one house that said -- that said that, that thought itmeant that or would have liked it to mean that.          MR. KUNTZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  And it isn'tall that unusual that the congressional history of aparticular statute might point one way and the actualplain meaning point another way.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  How do you explain thetitle, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee ofthe Conference?  Doesn't that speak for both the Houseand the Senate?          MR. KUNTZ:  It -- yes, Your Honor, it does.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So it's not correct it'sjust for one house.  It's -- what I have is the JointExplanatory Committee, and it says the managers, on thepart of the House and the Senate.Honor.MR. KUNTZ:  It -- it does say that, YourJUSTICE BREYER:  All right.          And is there some rule -- I don't know whatthis rule is you can't refer to legislative history.Does it say that in the Constitution of the UnitedStates?          MR. KUNTZ:  No, Your Honor, it doesn't.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  And so --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, sometimes151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 these joint statements are actually voted on by the2 Congress as a whole. Was this one -- was this one3 voted on?4 MR. KUNTZ: There was no evidence of that,5 Your Honor, in our review.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Which ones are voted on?7 I've not heard of that. I mean, they might be, but it8 used to be that the -- they circulate the report to all9 the Members and the Members read it, and if a Member10 disagrees with it, they note their dissent. Maybe it's11 changed. But I guess --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you cite an example of13 a conference report that was voted on by the Congress?14 MR. KUNTZ: I -- I cannot, Your Honor, and15 that's why I -- I responded as I did, which is that I16 know of no evidence.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we have said that18 conference reports are more valuable than the reports19 of a single house. I think we have said that.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are voted on when the21 -- when the conferees make changes, which they22 sometimes do. Then -- then, of course, they have to be23 voted on. So it's frequent. It's frequent that24 they're voted on, but this one apparently -- there were25 no changes made and it wasn't voted on.161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR.

KUNTZ:  Oh, I'm sorry.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't have an opportunityto work for a Senator who, in fact, to my experienceasked me to report on a vote on such a thing.  I justwasn't aware of it.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          MR.

KUNTZ:  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Mr. Salmons.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONSconference reports being voted on, don't you?          MR. SALMONS:  I do not, Your Honor.  I -- Ido not dispute the representations that have been madeabout that practice.          But let me begin by saying, thank you, Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 This Court should give the attorneys' fee2 provision of IDEA the same construction it gave the3 nearly identical language of section 1988 in Casey and4 hold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the5 cost does not include expert fees.6 Respondent's sole argument is that expert7 fees are included in the statutory term costs, but as8 this Court made clear in both Casey and Crawford9 Fitting, the term costs in a fee-shifting statute has a10 well-settled meaning and is a reference and is limited11 to those -- that modest category of costs that may be12 awarded under 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1821.13 Now --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say15 about expenses? Isn't -- isn't it a fairly common16 practice for a -- a trial lawyer to -- to hire his17 experts and pay them and then bill the client for --18 for whatever he's paid for the experts? I mean, if19 that is the -- this has been a long time since I've20 practiced law. So maybe that isn't the way it's done21 anymore. But it -- it certainly has been done that22 way, and -- and if that is still the practice, wouldn't23 it make sense24 would include25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400for Congress to have assumed that expensesthose kinds of expenses?SALMONS:  No.  No, I don't think so, Your18Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Honor. Now, first of all, just to be clear, the -- the2 fee provision that's at issue here is identical to the3 fee provision that was at issue in Casey, and it makes4 no reference to expenses. It says attorneys' fees as5 part of the costs.6 Now, in this separate section instructing the7 GAO to do a report --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's the GAO reference.9 You're right.10 MR. SALMONS: -- it says to look at the --11 the awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees,12 costs, and expenses. We don't think the term expenses13 in -- in that provision can fairly be read to somehow14 dramatically expand the meaning of the phrase,15 attorneys' fees as part of the costs. We think it's16 much more naturally to read that as just a reference,17 as this Court noted in Casey, to the common practice of18 including out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys for19 things like copying costs and -- and necessary travel20 expenses and things like that as -- as also being21 compensable. And so we don't think that that -- that22 term expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning23 of the statutory provision at issue here.24 And as far as subsection (B) of that25 provision related to the GAO, we think it's clear that191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases,2 and is instructing the GAO to do a broader study about3 the time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and4 others on both sides in these cases because Congress5 was very concerned about the amount of litigation and6 the expense of that litigation and the diversion of7 funds away from the core educational services of the8 schools. As this Court noted in Schaffer, that's one9 of the primary concerns Congress has had, especially in10 the more recent amendments to the act.11 And we think, in fact, that the -- the fact12 that Congress instructed the GAO to study that is, if13 anything, more consistent with the idea that Congress14 decided not to legislate on the question of expert15 fees, but to leave it for another day after they've had16 the benefit of that study at a minimum.17 Now --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salmons, there's one19 difference, a marked difference, between this statute20 and the others, and that is, in -- in many of these21 cases, it is the consultant that is the primary,22 perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent. There's not a23 case where they have these determinations, a lawyer is24 in the front line. Even in this very case, wasn't it25 true that it was the consultant who was the aide to the201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425parent and there was no lawyer on the scene?          MR. SALMONS:  That -- that is correct.During the administrative proceeding and in the -- andin the district court, there was no attorney here.          But -- but I think there's one importantthing to keep in mind about that is that that's --Congress expected that that would be the result.  Thisis not a statute where Congress didn't think about therole of experts.  Among other things, section --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you -- what do yousay about the legislative history, which has been soprominent in the discussion this morning?  Theconference report.          MR. SALMONS:  Sure.  Well, I think theconference report clearly represents the view of theauthor of the conference report with regard to themeaning of the language.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, don't you suppose itrepresents the view of the House and Senate conferees?          MR. SALMONS:  Well, I mean, I think -- Ithink what that points to is the perils of -- of usingcommittee reports and statements --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  I -- I realize that,but I mean, an --MR. SALMONS: -- from the legislative history 211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 when the text is clear.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- an argument, a perfectly3 fair argument, can be made, whether -- whether you find4 it dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a5 committee report of one house cannot simply be taken as6 a literal reflection of the thinking -- the -- the7 actual thinking of -- of everybody on that committee,8 let alone a whole house.9 But when we're talking about a conference10 report that has been hammered out between two sets of11 conferees, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the12 conferees know exactly what is in that report and would13 take exception to it if it didn't represent their14 views. Isn't -- isn't that a -- a fair reason for15 saying that whatever you may think of reports in16 general, the conference report probably has a -- a17 superior authority?18 MR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor,19 and let me try to explain why.20 First of all, this Court made clear in Casey,21 dealing with the exact same language, it took -- you22 know, that's at issue here --23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The text or --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Language in the statute but25 not in the conference report.221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼123 report in 45 referring6 Court considered this exact --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And would you agree, if the8 statute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference9 report?JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Was there a conference--MR. SALMONS:  No.  That's right.  And I'mto the statutory language here, that this10 MR. SALMONS: Well, but my point, Your Honor,11 is that what this Court said --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my13 question?14 MR. SALMONS: Yes. If the Court thinks the15 statute is ambiguous, it's fair to look at the16 conference report.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: And why is it not ambiguous18 if the author of the conference report read it that19 way?20 MR. SALMONS: For, among other reasons, Your21 Honor -- this is what I was trying to -- trying to22 state because this Court in Casey, dealing with this23 exact same language, said the following. It said where24 the statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous,25 attorneys' fees as part of the cost, that has a clearly231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial2 practices -- again, this Court in Casey tracked through3 the -- the usage, the history of the usage of this4 language and the way courts had responded to this over5 time -- that when that's the case, we do not permit it6 to be expanded or contracted by the statements of7 individual legislators or committees during the course8 of the enactment process. We think that holding in9 Casey is equally applicable here --10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, one thing here --11 MR. SALMONS: -- and it be would wrong to12 look to that.13 Now, if the Court did, I think the thing that14 the Court should take away from it, if you're going to15 look at what Congress intended here -- and this is16 undisputably true. Everyone agrees on this. The17 primary purpose of this legislation was to respond to18 this Court's decision in Smith v. Robinson. And prior19 to this Court's decision in Smith, section 1988 had20 provided the means by which courts had awarded21 attorneys' fees in cases under IDEA's predecessor.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the gravamen --23 MR. SALMONS: Smith foreclosed those fees --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does the gravamen --25 well, I'll let you finish your answer.241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SALMONS:  Sure.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the gravamen of theargument -- is it that this phrase is unambiguous?          MR. SALMONS:  That -- that is certainly ourfirst argument, absolutely, Your Honor.  The point I'mmaking now is that if you look at the context in whichthis language was used, Smith foreclosed the award ofsection 1988 fees.  Congress responded shortlythereafter by -- by adding the precise language ofsection 1988 to the language in IDEA's predecessor.Now, however anomalous it would normally be to give thesame language in two different fee provisions differentmeanings -- and it would be quite anomalous -- to do sohere with section --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But isn't it true that atthe time they did that, it was well settled in cases ofthis kind that the Court would look at the conferencereport to ascertain the meaning of the statute?  Atthat time, in 1986.          MR. SALMONS:  Well, I think --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Was there any case thatsaid you can't look at the conference report at thattime?          MR. SALMONS:  There are plenty of cases, YourHonor, that -- that point out --251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- later.          MR. SALMONS:  -- that the -- that -- thatpoint out, even -- even I think beforehand, that thelanguage is the primary basis to look.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is the best evidence, butnot the sole evidence.          MR. SALMONS:  And that even when it'sunambiguous, that's the end of the matter.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, even in -- in thosebenighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we everwould use the conference report when the statute wasnot ambiguous.  I thought it was always a rule that --that --          MR. SALMONS:  We certainly agree with that,and I would just add that I'm not aware of any decisionof this Court that would suggest that the type ofstatutory construction tools the Court would use woulddepend on what was in place at the time that thestatute was enacted.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Of course --          MR. SALMONS:  I mean, this Court applies therules that it thinks are appropriate at the time itissues its decision.          Now --          JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't use red if the261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 statute says green. Green doesn't include red. I2 understand that. And that's why, in fact, I wondered3 if the presence in this bill of the GAO section4 suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the5 word cost means something special.6 then I would think it is ambiguous7 the legislative history. It's not8 red and arguing it includes green.9 MR. SALMONS: Two responses to that, Your10 Honor. The first is that we don't think it's ambiguous11 at all, and we think when -- even if you look at the12 GAO provision, you don't get the kind of ambiguity that13 would allow you to otherwise deviate from the -- the14 clear meaning of this language when it's -- when it's15 been consistent with statutory usage over time. As16 this Court noted in Casey, more than 34 statutes use --17 expressly state attorneys' fees in addition to expert18 -- expert fees in addition to attorneys' fees, and19 there would be no point to those.20 But -- but moreover, I think the important21 thing to keep in mind is that it's not just this fee22 provision. If you want a further indication of23 Congress' intent, let me refer you to some other24 provisions of the statute itself, again, the language25 of the statute. Among other things, section 1415(d)(2)271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO And if that's so,enough to refer tolike using the word￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425expressly details the content of the notice that has tobe given to the parents about the procedural safeguardsin the act, and it's very specific.  It lists 13different things that States have to explain in full tothe parents.  The -- the 12th and the 13th items onthat list are the parents' ability to bring a civilaction and their right to bring, quote, attorneys'fees, no mention whatsoever of expert fees.Salmons.Thank you, Your Honors.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Mr. Vladeck.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. VLADECK     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. VLADECK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Murphys' principal submission in thiscase is that the text of IDEA authorizes courts toaward prevailing parents the costs of the experts whoassistbeforecourt.them in IDEA hearings which are typically heldState administrative tribunals and in Federal          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Vladeck, let mejust give you a purely hypothetical situation.  Let'ssuppose that the conferees can't agree whether expert281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 fees should be included. Some think they should; some2 think they shouldn't. And somebody suggests a3 compromise. The compromise is we won't put it in the4 statute, but we'll put it in the report and we'll let5 the courts figure it out.6 What should happen in that situation?7 MR. VLADECK: Thank you so much, Your Honor.8 I think -- I think that if the statutory text was9 clear, which -- and I believe this text is clear in the10 other direction -- I think we would lose that case.11 But that is not this case, Your Honor, and let me12 explain why.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if that's not14 this case, what in the world prevented the conferees15 from putting something as important in this context as16 expert fees, as I understand it, probably more17 important than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them18 from putting that in the statute if that clearly was19 their intent?20 MR. VLADECK: Without being flippant, Your21 Honor, I think that the conferees thought they had put22 it in the statute. Remember, this statute was passed23 back in 1986 when, at least with respect to the 99th24 Congress that enacted this provision, the word cost did25 not have the term-of-art meaning that was later291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 ascribed to it in this Court's opinion in Casey.2 JUSTICE ALITO: As you --3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to say it4 certainly had the meaning in Federal -- the Federal5 court context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial6 Code.7 MR. VLADECK: I understand that, Your Honor,8 but Congress thought it was adding -- that the use of the9 word cost and its breadth was a way of -- of including10 the cost. And -- and this is important, Your Honor.11 The language --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get past Casey,13 Casey didn't invent this as a definition. Casey said14 it has always meant this in innumerable Federal15 statutes. Casey was relying on a longstanding practice16 which existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced.1718 was -- at19 time this20 costs were routinely read to include expert fees in21 title VII cases, for example. So I don't disagree with22 Your Honor's point.23 I am simply saying that the lens through24 which this statute must be judged is the understanding25 of the 99th Congress, and every indication in the301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. VLADECK:  Your Honor, at the time Caseythe time this case was -- excuse me -- at thestatute was enacted by Congress, for example,￼1 legislative history here is that Congress used the word2 cost for its breadth, not as a term of art.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Vladeck, why -- if4 that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you5 explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey6 that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?7 MR. VLADECK: My only explanation, Your8 Honor, is that the -- the Members of Congress who wrote9 this provision were unaware of the difference this10 Court would later ascribe to those statutes in Casey.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not later ascribe. I mean,12 Casey was relying on --13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Casey -- Casey is very14 clear in saying the judicial background against which15 Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the16 statutory background, and it says the judicial17 background was that expert fees were quite different18 than attorneys' fees. They were not a subset of19 attorneys' fees.20 MR. VLADECK: Even -- even conceding all of21 that, which I -- I think is -- let me take a step back.22 Even if you reject that submission, the next provision23 of the statute on which we rely is section 4 of the24 Handicapped Children's Protection Act, which was25 enacted at the same time as section 1415(i)(3)(B), and311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if you look at that provision, it is clear thatCongress intended the word cost to have a broadermeaning.          Section 4(b)(A) directs the GeneralAccounting Office to study --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is that setforth?          MR. VLADECK:  I'm sorry?  That's page --excuse me.  Page 4 of the red brief, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.          MR. VLADECK:  That directs the GeneralAccounting Office, first, to study the amount ofattorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to theprevailing party.  In this statute, only the parentscould be the awarding -- the prevailing party because,unlike 1988, this statute is a one-way street andprovides only for awards to parents.          And secondly, it says that for -- for the --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what -- Mr. Vladeck,may I stop you there?  Because the parents are alwaysthe plaintiff.  It's not the child.  The parents arerepresenting the child.          MR. VLADECK:  That's correct, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So prevailing party isidentical to parents.  The parents are the ones who321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prevail.          MR. VLADECK:  That's exactly my point, YourHonor.  And -- and --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but the wordconsultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute.          MR. VLADECK:  Right, Your Honor.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that specificallyrefers to the State educational agency and localeducational agency.          MR. VLADECK:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it uses personnel,which sounds to me a very odd way to talk about privateexperts hired by an attorney.  You don't talk aboutthem as personnel.          MR. VLADECK:  Well, Your Honor, thisprovision, up until the last part which says, andexpenses incurred by the parents, the -- the lastclause of this provision was added in the conference.And the conference report makes that clear at page 7.The conference report makes it clear that the House --the Senate recedes to the House bill.  The GAO studyprovision was only in the House bill, with an amendmentexpanding the data collection requirements of the GAOstudy to include information recording the amount offunds expended by local educational agencies and State331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 education agencies on civil actions and administrative2 proceedings. That clause was added, Your Honor, in3 conference. Prior to the conference, the provision was4 very much the same as it is today. So --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Vladeck, my -- my6 problem with the argument you're now making is -- is a7 little more basic. Assuming, which I think is a -- is8 a major assumption, that expenses refers to expert9 fees, I don't see how it helps your case that in10 another part of the statute, the statute says, fees,11 costs, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that12 we're talking about here, it only refers to fees as13 part of costs. How does it help your case that --14 MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that elsewhere they go16 out of their way to add and -- and expenses? It seems17 to me that hurts your case.18 MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, I don't believe19 that this is an inoperative part of the statute. I20 believe that -- that -- this direction to GAO makes no21 sense if all Congress sought to authorize was22 attorneys' fees and the costs that are historically23 available24 provision25under section 1920 and section 1821.  Thismakes no sense.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't -- isn't it really the341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 point not that it makes no sense, but that it raises a2 question? It creates the question, which -- which we3 have in mind when we say the statute is ambiguous, and4 it is in answering that question, that you then turn to5 the legislative history, which has a pretty unequivocal6 statement in your favor. Isn't -- isn't that the --7 the way to analyze it?89 that way.10 statement1112 conclude that the statute is ambiguous, what do you do13 with the Spending Clause problem? We've said that when14 you're imposing conditions in Spending Clause15 legislation, you have to do that unambiguously. It's16 what the Court said in -- in Pennhurst.17 MR. VLADECK: That's correct.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's ambiguous, if19 the availability of expert fees, which is the big-20 ticket item in these things, not the attorneys' fees,21 States are not unambiguously on notice that they're22 accepting that liability when they take the funds.23 MR. VLADECK: With all respect, let me24 quarrel with one of the premises in your question,25 which is that the -- the expenses for experts are,351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. VLADECK:  I -- it certainly can be read I read it as more of an affirmativeby Congress --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if you￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425quote, a big-ticket item.  If you look at page 28,footnote 17 of our brief, we've tried to compile all ofthe reported cases on the amount of expert fees thatare awarded.  They tend to be exceedingly modest, YourHonor.  They run from a few hundred dollars to a fewthousand dollars.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's before theMagna Carta you're asking for in this case which wouldestablish a whole -- a whole --          MR. VLADECK:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- new profession ofexperts.          MR. VLADECK:  Your Honor, that is not thecase.  The -- the rule that we seek to preserve hasbeen the way courts have interpreted this provisionsince 1988.  That's --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, even if it isnot the big-ticket item --          MR. VLADECK:  So -- so these are modest.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- it still has to be-- it still has to be unambiguously set forth inSpending Clause legislation.          MR. VLADECK:  Right.  And -- and if the Courtfinds that the legislative history adds the claritythat the statute otherwise needed -- is needed, I do361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 not see why that would not comply with the Spending2 Clause, particularly since, Your Honor, this statute3 has been on the book for 20 years. There are dozens of4 opinions finding that expert fees are compensable. No5 Spending Clause argument has ever been raised in this6 kind of issue even though the statute has been on the7 books for 20 years.8 JUSTICE ALITO: Under your reading of 1415,9 may a court award to parents any costs that they incur10 in connection with the litigation, or -- or would you11 just add expert fees to the attorneys' fees?12 MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, there is a body of13 law on that issue that already exists because courts14 have interpreted this provision since 1986. By and15 large, the costs that have been awarded under the16 statute are costs that are normally associated with17 litigation, copying costs, computer-assisted research18 when there's a lawyer involved.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about testing? Isn't20 testing --21 MR. VLADECK: The cost of testing and22 evaluation, which is -- which is a crucial component of23 the statute -- those costs have been awarded.24 JUSTICE ALITO: But if costs is not a term --25 is not a legal term of art, if it really -- if it means371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 just the expenses that parents incur, why wouldn't it2 include things like travel expenses or lost wages to3 attend the court proceeding?4 MR. VLADECK: The -- the way the courts have5 addressed that issue, Your Honor, is they -- they have6 looked to the -- the initial phrase of the statute, in7 an action or a proceeding, and have found those costs8 not sufficiently closely enough related to the action9 or proceeding to justify an award.10 And also courts have applied the rule 5411 reasonableness standard in ordering costs under this12 provision, and therefore, expert costs have been13 reduced and other costs have been reduced to meet the14 general requirements of rule 54.15 I would like -- I would like to --16 JUSTICE BREYER: Would you read the phrase17 from the conference report as a limitation? That is,18 that -- we're trying to figure out what the Congress19 meant by the phrase costs. It says it means includes20 reasonable expense and fees of expert witnesses and21 reasonable costs of any test or evaluation that's22 necessary. So then is that -- have the courts read23 that as a -- as a limitation?24 MR. VLADECK: Yes, Your Honor, but they've25 also imposed limitations that are generally -- that381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 generally constrain the awards of costs in cases. They2 have not done what -- what I understood Justice Alito3 -- his question to -- to get to, was to use this as --4 as a broad, open door.5 I'd like to talk about the legislative6 history, and particularly I'd like to respond to7 Justice Scalia's comment about the conference report in8 this case.9 This statute was changed dramatically in10 conference. It does not reflect either the House bill11 or the Senate bill. If one reads the conference report12 in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of13 the Conference, which is three pages long, one will see14 that there were dramatic and substantial changes made15 because there were substantial disagreements between16 the House and the Senate, not on the question of17 reimbursement of expert costs. That -- that provision18 -- that understanding was shared on a bipartisan basis19 in both houses. But the --20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why were the earlier21 versions that included that expressly then not -- why22 didn't they make it through to the final version?23 MR. VLADECK: The -- the version that -- that24 was referred to earlier, Your Honor, came out of the25 Senate bill. The Senate bill contained a number of391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 very controversial features. It was pared down, and2 the word cost was substituted, as the drafter of the3 language made clear on the floor of the Senate before4 the Senate voted on its version of the bill, and5 Senator Weicker's explanation of what the word cost6 means could not be clearer, and he -- he --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, we've slid back8 from the joint statement to the statement of one Member9 on the floor now.10 MR. VLADECK: Well, I'm happy for you to rely11 on the joint statement, Your Honor.12 My only point is, is that the understanding13 in the House report is expert fees were included in the14 House bill, which referred to costs and expenses.15 Senator Weicker explains precisely the question you16 asked, which is what happened to the Senate bill. And17 Senator Weicker's explanation, which was made before18 the Senate, immediately before the Senate voted on the19 bill, makes clear that expert costs are included.20 Then, of course, you have the bill going to21 conference. There were many changes in the bill,22 including the language of section 1415. Prior to the23 conference, it did not say attorneys' fees as part of24 costs. It said attorneys' fees in addition to costs.25 That language was changed in conference to accommodate401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 this Court's decision in Marek v. Chesny, which had to2 do with the applicability of rule 68.3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, speaking of that -- of4 that language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as5 part of costs, does that suggest -- it doesn't say6 directly that costs may be awarded. Does that suggest7 that the attorneys' fees are simply to be regarded as8 another element of costs that -- that may be awarded9 under the costs statute?10 MR. VLADECK: I don't believe that Congress,11 when it used the word costs, was adverting to section12 1920. If that is your question, I do not believe that13 that is --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then where is the15 authorization? I think that's what Justice Alito's16 question goes to. You have to come up with some17 statutory authorization to pay expert fees. Now,18 attorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any19 costs. It just says whatever costs are otherwise20 authorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that.21 MR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, it says --22 it's part of the cost to the parents. And unlike23 section 1980, this language is not, contrary to the24 previous submissions to the Court, identical to the25 language in 1988. It says that a court may award411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425attorneys' fees as part of the costs to parents, andthe --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the authorization topay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees? All -- all this section says is they may awardattorneys' fees as part of costs, and costs arepresumably elsewhere authorized.          MR. VLADECK:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But where is theauthorization to pay?          MR. VLADECK:  Under -- under that reading, nostatute would authorize the -- the payment of costs.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Under that reading, wouldn't-- wouldn't you have a problem in a State court?Because doesn't this same provision govern in a Statecourt, so that if the State did not have a separatecost statute, it would -- it would authorize nothing.Isn't -- isn't that the problem you'd run into.          MR. VLADECK:  That is correct.          Let me make one last --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you know any State thatdoesn't have a cost statute?          MR. VLADECK:  I have not -- I've not lookedat them to see whether they correspond to 1920, YourHonor.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Vladeck, you have --you referred to the section on GAO reporting --          MR. VLADECK:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- as an assist to helpyou include consultant fees in -- in costs.  But how doyou explain the -- the provision in this very statutethat says attorneys' fees can be reduced?  Congressexplicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys'fees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one wordabout reducing the costs of testing fees or consultingfees.          MR. VLADECK:  Well, Your Honor, all costs aresubject to the general requirement in rule 54 ofreasonableness, and --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why -- then it wouldbe unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees.          MR. VLADECK:  Here's the reason, Your Honor. At least, here's the reason that -- as I understandit.  Much of the litigation in IDEA cases takes out --takes place outside the confines of Federal court.Most of the litigation takes place in State due processhearings.  And what I believe Congress was interestedin making sure were the general rules, like rule 11,the general rules that punish parties for engaging invexatious or frivolous litigation would have some431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 analog in these proceedings.2 And therefore, what the court -- what -- what3 Congress did was to authorize a Federal court, in4 reviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred5 before a State-administered tribunal, because that's6 where the action takes place in these cases, to -- to7 be able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was8 misconduct by the parent or -- or the lawyer,9 misconduct in the sense of trying to protract10 litigation or multiply proceedings.11 And interestingly, Your Honor, the -- the12 conference report addresses this issue and does explain13 -- and now I'm quoting from page 6 of the -- of the14 conference report, the joint explanation -- that the15 court shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys'16 fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they17 determine that this misconduct had taken place. So I18 think that at least in the conference report, Congress19 is signaling that if there were other costs that were20 incurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers21 protracting or delaying the proceeding, they too would be22 subject to the same reduction.2324 though it25 committee441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's effective too, aswere written into the statute, because oneof Congress said so.

This was -- this -- theconference report was circulated to all Members ofCongress before they voted on the final bill.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and they read it.          MR. VLADECK:  Well, Your Honor, this is thefinal bill they voted on, and if they turned the page--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the only thing weknow for sure that they voted on.          MR. VLADECK:  That is correct, Your Honor,though the vote technically, of course, is a vote toapprove the conference report.  That is the final voteCongress took on this legislation.  The vote was a voteto approve the conference report, which contains fourpages -- three pages of text and three pages ofexplanation.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the -- did the finalbill say we adopt the findings of the conferencereport?that.MR. VLADECK:  It did not, Your Honor.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And other bills have saidMR.

VLADECK:  As far as I know, Your Honor,the procedure followed here was the standard procedurewhen the conference report takes bills and essentiallyamalgamates them or redrafts them --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But was this legislationvetoed by the President?          MR. VLADECK:  It was not, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, when the Presidentsigned it, did -- did he also approve the conferencereport?  Did he have the conference report in front ofhim?          MR. VLADECK:  I do not know that.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  He had the statute in frontof him, didn't he?          MR. VLADECK:  I -- he -- my assumption, YourHonor, is he had this.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you think he read theconference report too.          MR. VLADECK:  I don't believe that.          (Laughter.)          MR. VLADECK:  I'm not arguing that he did.My assumption, though, is if he had the statute beforehim, he probably had this.  The President --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Was there any opposition?Was there any -- is there any history of anyone in this461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Senate or2 that they3 fees?4the House either before or after suggestingdidn't want to allow recovery for the expertMR. VLADECK: Not at all, Your Honor. And 5 one of the points that I would like to make -- and I6 would like to return to the language of 1415 -- is this7 statute is all -- the IDEA is a statute all about8 protecting parents and children with disabilities. One9 provision of IDEA we have not mentioned, but I think is10 an important one, is the general guarantee that --1112 interrupt13 where you14 scenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986,15 that your position would not be the same. In other16 words, you said -- your suggestion was that it was the17 legal context at the time in '86 that governed what18 Congress thought the effectiveness of its statements in19 committee reports would be. Maybe I'm ascribing one of20 the Justice's views to you.21 MR. VLADECK: If -- if you're -- and -- and22 forgive my -- my lack of knowledge of the exact history23 of this, but if 1988 is a date upon which the Court24 begins to be reluctant to look at legislative history,25 I would concede that my case would be different post-471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if I couldyou.  As I understood it, this gets back tostarted.  Your position is that if this same￼1 1988. It is quite clear that the Congress that enacted2 this bill assumed, and rightly so, that this Court and3 reviewing courts would rely on legislative history.4 Indeed, when this Court issued its opinion in Casey,5 footnote 5 of Casey says that this case may be6 different because of the conference report.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what date in -- I8 mean, so we have two different modes of interpreting9 statutes: one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative10 history, and one post-1988 in which we don't use11 legislative history?12 MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that -- that's what14 you're suggesting, isn't it?15 MR. VLADECK: What I am suggesting is that16 the Court's role, as I understand it, is to be the17 faithful agent of Congress, and if the -- if the18 expectation of Members of Congress is that language in19 committee reports will -- will garner respect from the20 Court, it is hard to then change the rules on Congress.21 The operative question here is what --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The reason one does not use23 legislative history, if one does not use it, as I don't24 -- as I don't, is not because Congress doesn't expect25 it to be used, but because Congress does not have the481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 power to delegate to one of its committees the content2 of -- of its statutes. The Constitution provides that3 legislation will be passed by two houses and signed by4 the President, and the problem with legislative5 history, for those of us who have a problem with it, is6 this amounts to a delegation by Congress.7 It's not a matter of what Congress expected.8 I don't care what Congress expected. It can't do it.9 It can't leave it to a -- to a committee to -- to fill10 in the blanks in a statute. That's the problem, and11 that has nothing to do with expectations.12 MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, my only point is13 that the Congress that enacted this statute, the 99th14 Congress, thought -- and this -- this view is expressed15 repeatedly in the legislative history, and I believe it16 -- it is reflected in the statutory language as well --17 that the word costs here would be given a broad meaning18 to ensure that parents were made whole when they have19 to fight against school boards to secure that which20 IDEA guarantees their child, which is a free and21 appropriate public education.22 This Court has repeatedly in Township of23 Burlington, in Tatrow, in Florence County said that24 provisions of IDEA should not be interpreted in ways25 that detract from this fundamental guarantee. There491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 would be no more clear detraction from that guarantee2 than requiring parents to bear the expense, which for3 many of these parents is enormous, even though Chief4 Justice, it may amount to only a few hundred or a few5 thousand dollars, to retain an expert, to do battle6 with school boards who have experts on staff.7 Earlier this term, this Court decided8 Schaffer v. Weast. Post Schaffer, parents cannot hope9 to meet their burden of production, let alone their10 burden of proof in IDEA hearings without expert11 assistance. To force parents to bear those expenses,12 even when they prevail, will detract from IDEA's core13 guarantee that the -- that the education provided to14 the child is both appropriate and free. Those15 provisions are in the statute to avoid having parents16 being compelled to make the Hobson's choice: a free17 education18 education1920 to interpret statutes consistent with the statutory21 context. I would urge that in looking at section 1415,22 you take a look at -- at -- there are now eightthat's inappropriate or an appropriatethat is not free.This Court repeatedly instructs lower courts23 sections of the statute that reinforce this guarantee.24 It is hard to imagine a statutory guarantee more25 deeply embedded in an act than the guarantee of a free501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and appropriate public education than is embedded inthe IDEA.  Permitting parents to recover their expertcosts --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's not -- if theparents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it'snot going to be free.  I mean, the -- the statute givesthem --          MR. VLADECK:  But -- but --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- a right to oppose theschool board's choice, and if what you say about makingit easier on parents of limited resources, they're toldit's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't getyour fees.          MR. VLADECK:  That's correct, Your Honor, butthey lose only when the school board is providing, infact, an education that is appropriate.  But where theparent prevails because the school board was notproviding a free and appropriate education, the act'sguarantee would be seriously eroded unless parents canrecover the costs of their expert -- of their experts.          If there are no further questions, thank youvery much.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          Mr. Kuntz, you have 4 minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER2 MR. KUNTZ: Thank you, Your Honor.3 Shifting the costs to the school district of4 experts' fees will also shift scarce public resources5 away from the point where it's most effective, at the6 stage when the parent meets with the IEP team to7 resolve the differences.8 When Congress has revisited this statute, as9 it has since 1986, time and time and again, it's --10 it's spoken to the -- to the goal of reducing11 litigation and -- and reducing the costs associated12 with litigation. If -- if as the Respondents claim,13 it's central to the fulfillment of this statute that --14 that Congress be seen to have shifted the costs of15 these so-called experts to the -- to the school16 district when -- when they prevail, I -- I call to the17 Court's attention that the reality is that the school18 district has no staff of experts as Respondents19 intimate. It has no staff of consultants.20 What it has are the people who actually21 provide the services to the child, and when they come22 to testify at the hearing, typically they're -- they're23 scared or nervous because it's the first time that24 they've been at such a hearing. They're not25 professional experts. They're not testimonial experts.521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Those are the kinds of experts that the Respondents2 are talking about and asking this Court to see in the3 statute.4 One needs to ask the question if Congress5 really intended expert fees to be a part of this6 statute, what stayed Congress' hand from writing those7 words into the statute? It's very clear that Congress8 knew how to do that when it became appropriate, in its9 judgment, for it to do that. To sort of see it here10 lurking in the shadows in -- in sort of the backwaters11 of -- of the act and to intimate from there that the12 plain language of the statute has meaning that needs to13 be expanded and enlightened by the congressional report14 doesn't make a lot of -- of sense. If -- if it's that15 important, it should have been there. The -- its16 absence is very, very telling. And --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't the school boards18 have some consultants and experts in this area other19 than the teachers?20 MR. KUNTZ: Typically they do not, Your21 Honor. The typical IEP team meeting has the school22 psychologist perhaps, has the -- the teachers of the --23 of the child. Those -- some of those are required24 members. It has the parent of a handicapped child. It25 might have the -- the service providers like the speech531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 pathologist. And when -- when it comes to a trial,2 comes to a due process hearing, those are the folks who3 come and testify as to what they know about the child,4 the test results they have. There are no typical5 consultants or testimonial experts that appear for the6 school district.7 So the -- the central part of this statute,8 its -- its revolution, where it brings parents of9 children who are disabled into contact with the -- with10 the school, has had a wonderful effect in fulfilling11 the promise of this statute. Energizing the litigation12 aspect of this by transferring those costs to the13 school district will -- will take away and will detract14 from the -- the true meaning of the statute, which was15 to build a partnership between the parents and the16 school district, not to let it dribble off into17 litigation.18 Thank you.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kuntz.20 The case is submitted.21 (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the22 above-entitled matter was submitted.)23 24 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40054Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
