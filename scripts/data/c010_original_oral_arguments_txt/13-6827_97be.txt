LAYCOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      40 other prison systems permit beardswithout a length limit, yet Arkansas prohibits even halfan inch.  And in their brief, they reject every meansthat courts have devised to evaluate their testimony.      So what they really seek is absolutedeference to anything they say just because they say it.And that would be to repeal this statute de facto.      There may be deference to prison officials,but there must be concrete limits to that deference.JUSTICE GINSBURG: If this prisoner wanted to have a full beard, would RLUIPA require that the prison administration allow him to do that?MR. LAYCOCK: Well, some courts have said yes. There's very little in this record about full beards and whether they're safe or whether they're dangerous, but the 40 States that permit them suggest4Official￼Alderson Reporting Company7 8 9that requires polygamy.      I mean, could ­­ could I say to the prison,Official￼1   that the State would have a difficult burden of proof.2   But that question is not presented here.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Laycock, the problem I4   have with ­­ with your client's claim of ­­ of religious5   requirement is the religious requirement is  that he grow a6   full beard, isn't it?  Now, let's assume  I’m in a religion     well, you know, okay, I won't have three wives; just let10   me have two wives.  I mean, you're still violating your11121314   is a full beard.  He testified that religiously half anreligion, it seems to me, if he allows his beard to beclipped to one ­­ one inch, isn't he?MR. LAYCOCK: Well, the religious teaching1516171819202122   aren't reasonable.  I mean, religious beliefs are23   categorical.  You know, it's God tells you.  It's not a24   matter of being reasonable.  God be reasonable?  He's25   supposed to have a full beard.5inch is better than nothing, and he explained that interms of Hadith that he referenced.He's in a very difficult situation. I don't think he should be penalized for being reasonable here. He offered an extremely conservative compromise to the prison ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, religious beliefsAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. LAYCOCK: He's ­­ he's supposed to have a full beard, but a partial beard is better than none. And that's not just in secular terms. That's also in religious terms, which he explained on the record.JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. You think on the record that's what his religion would require if he can't have a full beard.MR. LAYCOCK: That's correct, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I ­­ I mean, you're really just making your case too easy. I mean, one of the difficult issues in a case like this is where to draw the line. And you just say, well, we want to draw the line at half inch because that lets us win.And the next day someone's going to be here with one inch. And maybe it'll be you. And then, you know, two inches.      It seems to me you can't avoid the legaldifficulty just by saying, all we want is half an inch.MR. LAYCOCK: Well, most of the cases seek a full beard or full hair. And sooner or later, you will have to decide one of those cases. But this case, he made a pro se decision to limit his request. The Court expressly limited the question presented. So this case is only about half an inch.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we have to6Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 decide this case pursuant to a generally applicable2 legal principle, and that legal principle is one, it3 seems to me, that demands some sort of a limit. And if4 you're unwilling to articulate a limit to the principle5 itself, it becomes a little bit difficult to apply it,6 say, well, we don't know what the limit is because7 you're only asking a half inch. We'll apply a ­­ a8 theoretical legal structure and ­­ and say you fall9 within it.10 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, I think, you know, the11 limit has to be determined on a record in a case that is12 seeking a ­­ a longer beard. I think, you know, what ­­13 the larger issue than just half an inch that this case14 presents is how do you administer ­­ the legislative15 history suggests deference to prison officials in the16 context of a compelling interest standard.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. So maybe we should ­­18 maybe this was improvidently granted. I don't want to19 do these cases half inch by half inch. Let's ­­ let's20 take a case that involves a full beard. I mean, the21 next ­­ the next case will be one inch, then one and a22 half inches, two inches.23 MR. LAYCOCK: They're not going to come in24 that order. The next case is going to be ­­ most25 likely, the next case is going to be a full beard7Alderson Reporting Companyreplace Turner.  It textually      JUSTICE KENNEDY:replaces Turner.And what is the testOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because that's the great bulk of the cases.  This casehas a limited question presented and has a seriousquestion of statutory interpretation.      The courts below essentially applied thepre­ RLUIPA  constitutional standard that you haveessentially unlimited deference to the prison officials.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then what has this Court said about the standard under RLUIPA with reference to prisons? That the ­­ that the prison has to show that its least ­­ least restrictive alternative in order to meet the requirements of strict scrutiny, and that's the prison's burden? Is that proposition established?MR. LAYCOCK: Well, your only prison RLUIPA case is Cutter and that was a constitutional challenge.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Doyou ­­ do you think RLUIPA displaces Turner as the right standard?MR. LAYCOCK: It was clearly intended toinsofar as you're concerned?MR. LAYCOCK: The test is compellinginterests and least restrictive means and deference mustbe administered in the context of that standard, not8Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425instead of that standard.      So if it's a close case on compellinginterest, they may well get deference.  If they give areasoned and well­considered and informed explanation,they deserve more deference.  More deference would bedue.      Cutter says some ­­ Cutter says they get duedeference, but Cutter had no occasion to decide how muchdeference is due or ­­ or how that ­­ how that should beadministered.      The textual standard is clearly compellinginterest and least restrictive means.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you put your answer in practical terms. The Chief Justice asks you what's the legal principle that you want us to apply, and you announce it as give them the right deference. It's a little bit circular, the answer, in my mind.      Looking at what the circuits have beendoing, which one do you think articulates the bestapproach to RLUIPA and what courts should be doing?MR. LAYCOCK: Well, maybe Judge Gorsuch's opinion in the ­­ in the Tenth Circuit. But I'm not sure any circuit has given a fully elaborated account of deference in the context of a compelling interest test.      We think the more reasoned and informed9Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 their explanation, the more deference is due. So do2 they give concrete examples of specific harms? Do they3 treat similar risks the same way? Do they ­­ do they4 take account of solutions that have been found to work5 in other jurisdictions? Do they take account of the6 religious needs of prisoners at any point, or do they7 just reflexively say no?8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the standard is other9 similar risks. The same way, then, what about a10 1/4­inch rule? Because that's what they allowed for11 people who have dermatological problems.12 MR. LAYCOCK: They allow ­­ they allow a13 quarter inch for medical beards. They don't allow even14 a quarter inch for religious beards. But the quarter15 inch, I think, for medical beards, I think, fatally16 undermines their claim that they can't administer a17 length limit. And it ­­ and it somewhat undermines all18 their other claims about ­­ about a 1/2­inch beard, that19 this is in some ways like the case Justice Alito wrote20 in Newark in the Third Circuit. The medical exception21 undermines all the alleged reasons for not allowing a22 religious exception.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are ­­ there are24 some religious practices ­­ I think that the Sikh25 practice of not cutting hair ranks as a religious10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 practice. So not cutting hair and wearing a turban,2 consistent with what you say is the standard, could a3 prison say, we won't allow that because it is too easy4 to hide contraband?5 MR. LAYCOCK: Yeah, that may be. I don't6 know what the evidence would show about Sikh hair7 wrapped in a ­­ in a turban. But that's clearly a much8 more serious issue than ­­ than what's presented in this9 case. You know, Sikh hair wrapped in a turban may well10 be different, but we11 this case. We don't12 record in this case.13 JUSTICE KAGAN:14 on this case really on ­­ on felt intuitions that this15 couldn't possibly advance the State's interest. But for16 the most part in these cases, there will be some17 incremental gain with respect to the interests that this18 State has.19 So whether it's a full beard or whether it's20 long hair or whether it's a turban, there will be some21 ability to say, even though it's just teeny tiny, there22 is some increase in prison security that results from23 disallowing this practice.24 And I guess I want to know, and this really25 fits in with several of the other questions that have11don't have any evidence about it inreally have a way to know on theAlderson Reporting CompanyMr. Laycock, you're relyingOfficial￼1 been asked here, is how do we think about that question2 in the context of this statute?3 MR. LAYCOCK: I think they have to show4 material ­­ this is a phrase in the government's brief,5 and I think it's helpful ­­ a material effect on their6 security situation. Any teeny tiny risk, however small,7 is another way of de facto repealing the statute,8 because you can always imagine some teeny tiny risk.9 And even in Turner, under the rational10 basis standard, the Court said the test isn't zero risk.11 Even in Turner, the Court said you have to incur ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Teeny tiny isn't enough.13 But how about, you know, measurable, although small?14 Or, you know, at what point does it become something15 that we say, yes, we have to take that into account?16 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, I think material or17 significant may be the best we can do. They say, for18 example, that in 2011, they confiscated a thousand19 cellphones. I don't think a 1/2­inch beard would change20 that number. But if it went to 1,001 or 1,010, I don't21 think that's material.22 But if it goes to 1,100, that's a23 significant increment. But they have to show some24 material effect on their security situation. And here,25 where they allowed beards for many years, where 4312Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 States allowed beards, there should be plenty of2 examples if it were a problem. And this is not3 something that's so dangerous no one has tried it. So4 there should be plenty of examples. And in fact, they5 have no examples of anything hidden in beards, and6 certainly not in a very short beard, such as half an7 inch.8 This ­­ this idea of deference comes from9 legislative history, and that very same legislative10 history said post hoc rationalizations, exaggerated11 fears, mere speculation are not enough. And it's for12 the judiciary to distinguish the two.13 And I think what we have in this case is14 exaggerated fears and post hoc rationalization.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the ­­ the16 problem with deference, I think, is that if you accept17 the fact that there is a point at which it does become a18 problem, the full beard, Sikh with the ­­ the turban,19 then you ­­ then there's the question of how you draw20 the line.21 And drawing the line, it strikes me, may be22 the point at which you will consider deference to the23 prison administrators. You take deference entirely out24 of the equation by saying, look, we're only asking for25 half an inch.13Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, we haven't taken2 deference out of the equation, but when we only ask for3 half an inch and when they offer so little evidence and4 no examples and no consideration of solutions5 elsewhere, they haven't done anything to deserve6 deference. They haven't shown expertise. And ­­ and7 even with deference, you know ­­ even with some degree8 of deference, it doesn't make out a compelling interest9 on these facts and that's the question presented.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ­­ you know,11 we seem to be arguing rules. They say no beards. You12 say half­inch is okay. And then the question begs13 itself, if ­­ how about three­quarters of an inch, how14 about an inch, and what about full beard? What are we15 measuring this against? Are you seeking to establish a16 rule that every prisoner has to be permitted to grow a17 1/2­inch beard and no more, or are you asking for a rule18 that applies just to your client and then articulate why19 for your client?20 MR. LAYCOCK: No. We think, you know,21 reversal here would establish a right to a 1/2­inch22 beard for all prisoners on this record and, you know,23 unless some other State made a very different showing,24 all prisoners more generally.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14Alderson Reporting CompanySo what happens ­­ IOfficial￼1 know the magistrate judge or the judge below here said2 that it was preposterous to think that this prisoner3 could hide anything in his 1/2­inch beard. Assuming4 that his 1/2­inch beard was not thickly grown, but some5 are, and some you can't see the skin. Should that6 1/2­inch issue be applied to that prisoner? Wouldn't it7 be a different set of facts in that case to consider?8 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, the State might be able9 to show that's a different set of facts, you know.10 But ­­ but the question is not just, is it conceivably11 imaginable that some prisoner somewhere could hide12 something in a 1/2­inch beard, but could he hide13 something there that he couldn't much more easily and14 more securely hide in the hair on top of his head, in15 his shoe, in the lining of his clothes, you know ­­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're arguing for all17 1/2­inch beards, right? I mean, I ­­18 MR. LAYCOCK: Yes.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: We've got to assume all20 1/2­inch beards are ­­ are okay if ­­ if God tells you21 to grow them, right?22 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, you know, I think that's23 right. And again, subject to somebody producing24 evidence that we're wrong about some 1/2­inch beards,25 but I think yes.15Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:mean, whose ­­ whose burden is that?  I mean ­­MR. LAYCOCK: It is the State's burden that is explicit in the statute. This is an affirmative defense we're talking about of compelling interest in least restrictive means. You know, the ­­ the only limit to ­­ they impose on the hair on the top of your head is it can't extend below the middle of the neck.So you can have long hair, curly hair, Afros on top of your head without a length limit. The difference between hair on top of your head and hair in the front of your head is ­­ is not even rational. They could hide more and the ­­ and the prison warden testified to this. Yeah, you could hide things in the hair on top of your head, but that's not against the rules. So they have singled out the beard that is preserved for ­­ that is more to religious reasons and ­­ and not treated other things that are really indistinguishable.      If there are no further questions, I'llreserve the remaining time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Professor. Mr. Yang?      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES    AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER16Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, really subject ­­ IOfficial￼1 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it2 please the Court:3 This case involves the religious4 accommodation of 1/2­inch long beard that BOP in over 405 states would allow a prisoner to wear. The State failed6 its burden of proving that denying a 1/2­inch religious7 beard would be the least restrictive means to further a8 compelling interest.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that10 if, what, 90 percent of other ­­ of other institutions11 similar to the one at issue in the case permit the12 practice that is challenged, it cannot be a compelling13 interest? Is that your position?14 MR. YANG: No. In fact, I think our15 position is that security interests in prisons are16 compelling, but the burden that RLUIPA imposes upon the17 State is a burden to show that the means selected, that18 is, the denial of a 1/2­inch beard is the least19 restrictive means to further that interest. And in this20 case, that is a showing that has to be made in court.21 It is something that Congress specifically recognized22 would be showing ­­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. But I'm24 asking what is the relevance of the fact that other25 instances ­­17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. YANG: Well, the relevance is that ­­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we going to say3 whenever an institution comes up here that has a4 restriction which other institutions of the same type do5 not have, or at least a large majority of them, it's6 ipso facto bad?7 MR. YANG: No. I don't think it's a8 dispositive factor. However, it significantly9 undermines the State showing that a similar restriction10 could not be had in this context. And the State, in the11 face of that example if raised in litigation, would have12 to provide a reasonable basis for explaining why there13 might be a distinction between what's going on in other14 States in BOP and what's going on in this State. And15 the showing in this case is exceptionally near. I16 mean ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why does it have to18 show a distinction? It can just say the other States19 are wrong. We ­­ we think this is dangerous. I don't20 care what other States think.21 MR. YANG: I think a little more will be22 required under the compelling interest test. Now, this23 Court in Cutter recognized ­­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose a State just25 simply says this: You know, actually, there's nothing18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 special about our prison. We can't show you some2 special circumstance, but what we can show you is that3 prisons are in the business of making tradeoffs between4 security and other values, they do that every single5 day, and our State just thinks that the tradeoff should6 be more security oriented, so we insist on a greater7 level of security than our peer institutions do. And ­­8 and are you saying that the statute prevents a State9 from doing that?10 MR. YANG: No. I don't think that the11 statute imposes a least common denominator amongst State12 prison systems. However, I think there is some bounds13 to the State's judgment that needs to be ­­ there are14 some limits and the State needs to provide a reasoned15 explanation in order to get16 predictive judgment in this17 JUSTICE ALITO:18 you ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:20 JUSTICE ALITO:21 deference with the strict scrutiny that the statute22 requires?23 MR. YANG: Well, this Court in Cutter, for24 instance, explained that the strict scrutiny ­­ when25 deciding what was required by strict scrutiny, context19Alderson Reporting Companydeference to its ­­ itscontext.Where are you ­­ how do        Go ahead.How do you reconcileOfficial￼1 matters.2 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there are ­­ there are3 two questions there. One is, which you've ­­ is a good4 question. Where does this idea of deference come from5 in this context? But the question I was asking was:6 How do you think, assuming that there is a role for7 deference, how does it fit together with what the8 statute expressly requires?9 MR. YANG: I don't think there's any10 dissonance between the idea of strict scrutiny, which is11 not a degree of proof required, it is a question about12 whether you've identified a compelling interest and13 shown that what the ­­ the burden is the least14 restrictive means, that can be shown by preponderance of15 the evidence.16 And so when you're talking about deference17 in this context, you're talking about deference to the18 predictive judgments of officials based on their19 experience and expertise, based on the fact that they20 are, in fact, charged with protecting the public and21 administering these prisons. And so when they provide a22 reasoned explanation based on experience and expertise,23 they can ­­ don't have to point to a specific example of24 a 1/2­inch beard in the past resulting in something25 horrible, but ­­20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I do share Justice2 Alito's confusion on this point, because all the things3 that you're talking about are things that we would never4 allow in the typical strict scrutiny context. You know,5 all this kind of well, as long as they say something,6 they don't really have to prove it and it just has to7 sound kind of reasonable. And that's the very opposite8 of strict scrutiny generally.9 MR. YANG: Well, in this context, remember,10 the statute doesn't say strict scrutiny. It shows ­­11 says that the State has to identify a compelling12 interest and show that the burden that it is imposing is13 the least restrictive means.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't this Court15 establish ­­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It sounds like17 statute.18 MR. YANG: It's ­­ it's similar. But19 remember, this Court in ­­ in Grutter and in Cutter has20 recognized that the application of strict ­­ what you21 might broadly label strict scrutiny depends on context.22 And Congress, when they enacted both RFRA and RLUIPA,23 understood that these two concepts could be administered24 together.25 JUSTICE KAGAN:21Alderson Reporting CompanyDo you think it's the sameOfficial￼1 standard in both of those statutes?2 MR. YANG: For the large part, yes. I want3 to caveat that because ­­4 JUSTICE KAGAN: The language is completely5 the same.6 MR. YANG: Yes. But in ­­ most of the7 language is completely the same. The standard is the8 same, but in RLUIPA, RLUIPA has this additional9 provision that requires that the terms of the statute be10 broadly construed to the maximum extent possible to11 protect religious exercise.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought we actually13 used that in the recent RFRA case to suggest something14 about RFRA as well. Is that right?15 MR. YANG: That's because RFRA's definition16 of religious exercise incorporates the RLUIPA17 definition. But beyond that context, it's at least18 conceivable that the Court might have a broader19 interpretation of the protections in RLUIPA than in20 RFRA.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, before you sit22 down, your brief lists a whole series of cases on page23 14 that were decided before RLUIPA. Safley and a bunch24 of others. Are all those practices which we approved up25 for grabs now under RLUIPA? There ­­ there were22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 restrictions on receipt of publications was one.2 MR. YANG: I think the analysis is different3 now. It has ­­ it could be litigated. Any of these4 claims could be litigated. The State would then have5 the burden of coming forward to show that the6 restriction would, in fact, be a least restrictive means7 of ­­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they would ­­ all9 those that we approved, correspondence limitations, all10 those would have to be looked at anew under the RLUIPA11 standard.12 MR. YANG: I think that's right, because if13 you were to go back to pre­RLUIPA case law, no one would14 doubt that a State could, in fact, prohibit a 1/2­inch15 beard under the prior constitutional standards. But20212223242516 Congress has set a higher bar and it imposes upon States17 the obligation to come forward to explain and justify18 it. Now ­­ 19CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where ­­ where are you on the full beard?MR. YANG: On the full beard, I think there might well be a difference. But again, RLUIPA depends on a showing in litigation by the State that the means selected is the least restrictive means. A State may well be able to show that a full beard would run real23Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425risks that are just not present in the 1/2­inch beardthat we have here.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, assuming that's the case, assuming they have some evidence of concealment or whatever in ­­ in a full beard, what dowe do? Just litigate a dozen cases till one and three quarters inches, or what? MR. YANG: Well, I think ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What the same question I asked your friend ­­ MR. YANG: Yes. There's notwe settle onI'm doing, it'sOfficial￼going to be a ­­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ which is what'sthe legal principle?  And if there is no direct legalprinciple, then isn't it a situation in which you wouldemploy deference to the administrative judgment?MR.

CURRAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it23 please the Court:24 Arkansas' security objectives are undermined25 by the Petitioner's 1/2­inch beard because he could use26Alderson Reporting Companyon the record.

CURRAN: Your Honor, that ­­ that is notJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you just said.MR. CURRAN: Well, there ­­ there is two points in altered appearance.

If ­­ if3 you're claiming if he escapes, he can shave off his4 1/2­inch beard and thereby alter his appearance, and5 the ­­ the response is, well, just take a photograph of6 him before he grows his 1/2­inch beard, why do you need7 that evidence on that point? It seems to me it's ­­8 it's obvious.9 What prevents you from taking a photograph10 before he grows the 1/2­inch beard, which can then be11 distributed to police departments if he escapes?12 MR. CURRAN: You know, I agree, Your Honor.13 I mean, there ­­ there are scenarios ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is not an evidentiary15 matter at all.16 MR. CURRAN: The ­­ the point of17 identification within the prison, though, is an18 evidentiary matter on this record, and let me get to19 that, because it's very important to understand this in20 our prison's unique environment.21 that shaving a beard can enable an22 area where he's not supposed to be23 Appendix page 104 ­­ and that a beard can enable an24 inmate to deviate from an inmate's appearance on an ID25 badge. That's at Joint Appendix 100. And, of course, a28Alderson Reporting CompanyWhy do you need recordWarden Lay testifiedinmate to get into anin ­­ that's at JointOfficial￼1 beard is one of the quickest and easiest ways to change2 one's appearance. That's on page 97 of the Joint3 Appendix.4 And, of course, the grooming policy itself5 speaks in terms of maintaining the standard appearance6 throughout the period of incarceration, minimizing7 opportunities for disguise. And let me explain a minute8 why this matters in our prison's unique environment and9 why we're different, because it's a very important point10 here.11 The testimony on the record on page 101 of12 the Joint Appendix was that we have a very different13 situation with barracks housing and inmates going14 outside the fence in large groups of 30 to 60 per15 barracks unit every day. It's a very high­traffic,16 maximum security facility where they come out of a large17 barracks holding 30 or 60 inmates, go out, and then come18 back.19 And there's a lot of traffic there, and in20 that environment rapid and accurate identification of21 the inmate by his face, his ­­ his ID badge and the22 like, but also general familiarity with the inmate and23 who the guards are dealing with is very important in24 that process. And if a mistake is made, an inmate could25 get into the barracks where he is not supposed to be in29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 and an assault could occur. And these are separated by2 enemies and the like. And that is very serious in our3 environment. It was made on the record, and it4 differentiates Arkansas from every State mentioned by5 the Petitioner and the United States.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have no7 example of that ever happening.8 MR. CURRAN: I have no example of a ­­ well,9 let me say this. In our brief, on footnote 13 and on10 page 26 of the 18 States amicus briefs, there are11 examples. There are no record ­­ there are no record12 examples here.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Examples ­­ examples14 of what?15 MR. CURRAN: Of interprison identification16 problems, of ­­ of ­­ with an escape type; you know, in17 the prison,­­ some ­­ a beard being used to thwart18 identification. And ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you have that same20 concern with the prisoners who have a very short beard21 for medical reasons?22 MR. CURRAN: No. And let me explain why.23 There is confusion here as to what this so­called24 medical beard is. There is no exception in practice of25 a quantitative matter for medical beards. It is a30Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 means­of­shaving exception. In fact, our policy changed2 to reflect our actual practice about a year ago.3 What the ­­ what the practice is is that4 when a doctor's order says the person has a5 dermatological condition or some other scarring or skin6 condition that needs a shave, they use barber­style7 clippers, electric clippers without a guard, and they're8 used directly on the skin. And the result is a very9 clean­shaven look, not quite as close as using a10 tamper­resistant safety razor that other inmates use.11 But it is a very clean­shaven face. The clippers are12 kept in the barber facility and a couple of days will go13 by ­­ 14151617181920212223242531JUSTICE ALITO: How long is ­­ how long are the whiskers when that is done?MR. CURRAN: So ­­ so they may take barber call maybe twice a week. So they'll have a clean­shaven face and then go a couple days, three days, and then go back to the barber facility.JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying that they're completely clean­shaven?MR. CURRAN: I'm saying that they are clean ­­ I mean, what is clean­shaven? Some would say a razor shave looks slightly ­­JUSTICE ALITO:Clean­shaven is somebodyAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425like you, all right?MR. CURRAN: Right. I would say that's ­­ Iwould say that's fair.  I've got a ­­ I've got a fairly,fairly dense hair.  But that's ­­ but that's theappearance immediately after ­­JUSTICE ALITO: And that's how they ­­ and that would satisfy the medical problem?                         That's correct.                            To be shaved that closely?                         That's right.  The doctor'sprescriptions invariably are get a clipper shave.  Andthat brings a second point up, Your Honor, is that thepolicy's rationale was follow doctor's orders.  And wethink that is fundamentally of a different nature than areligious reason, because the Eighth Amendment law ofdeliberate indifference and the like admits a nocountervailing security interest that come into play.Our policy is we follow doctor's orders and that's theend of the matter.  Under the medical ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: So are you telling us that the quarter inch is wrong? I thought that that was in the record as a given, that a quarter inch is allowed for medical reasons.MR. CURRAN: The policy states that, Your Honor, and it's confusing. In practice there is no32MR. CURRAN:JUSTICE ALITO:MR. CURRAN:Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 quantitative quarter inch rule for beards. There is a2 clean­shaven rule that's allowed some length to go to3 the next barber call a few days later. You can still4 see the skin the entire time in that scenario. And if5 the Petitioner wanted to avail himself of that6 accommodation, we would let him do that.7 JUSTICE GINSBERG: What about the argument8 that it's ­­ never mind the least restrictive means, you9 have no comparable rule about hair on one's head, where10 it seems more could be hidden than in the beard, where11 hide something in a beard and it might drop out.12 MR. CURRAN: Yes, Justice Ginsberg. The13 material difference there is our professional judgment14 is the disguise­related component of a beard and shaving15 that beard is more profound than one on the head. So16 your point speaks to one of contraband and I agree as a17 matter of common sense and logic there is a length and18 gravity component to a head that's different than a19 beard, for sure. But the risk is still there none the20 same. I mean, there is a interest in regulating the21 contraband element, but the head hair doesn'tpose22 the same disguise­related problem as a beard.23 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that? Why is that24 so? Are you saying that somebody with or without a half25 inch beard ­­ that's a bigger difference than somebody33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 who has longish hair versus the same person with a2 shaved head?3 MR. CURRAN: In our professional judgment,4 it is, yes, that's correct. Because you're looking at5 the essential features of a person's face, their6 jawline, their chin and the like, and that's the means7 by which we identify each other. And so that is a8 significant difference in our view. And really the9 head­hair policy complements the facial identification10 policy because it's not allowed to get to a length that11 could obscure the hair and that's the rationale for12 that.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Laycock characterizes14 your position as being essentially all deference all the15 time. So I'll give you an opportunity to say when would16 deference be inappropriate?17 MR. CURRAN: Deference would be18 inappropriate when the explanation offered on the19 witness stand in the record of compelling interest and20 the least restrictive means is ­­ neither comports with21 logic or common sense.22 I mean, I think ­­ I think it sounds like we23 are all in agreement on that. And Justice Sotomayor24 asked what lower court decision would maybe lend the25 most guidance. I think a rather straightforward but apt34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 analysis is in the Couch case in the Fourth Circuit,2 where Judge Traxler, joined by Justice O'Connor and3 Judge Shedd, sort of went through ­­ the initial4 obligation is to explain the reason and common sense why5 that approach furthers a compelling interest in the6 least restrictive means. And once that happens,7 deference attaches, but that doesn't mean either that8 you win the case. It just means that you have9 substantial weight. There's sort of a thumb on the10 scale, so to speak, and more evidence can come into play11 and you could still lose.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go back to ­­ just13 so I'm clear in my head ­­ is it two compelling, or two14 compelling interests, one in identification, one in15 contraband.16 MR. CURRAN: That's right, Justice17 Sotomayor.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a third or a19 fourth or are those the only two?20 MR. CURRAN: Those are the only two we are21 talking about here.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in this case, the23 magistrate judge has said it's preposterous to think24 that you could hide something. So You don't have a25 security ­­ contraband ­­35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. CURRAN: Let me take on the almost2 "preposterous," if I might. If you look at the written3 findings, there is no such finding. In fact, the4 finding was to the contrary. I believe it's on page 1675 of the Joint Appendix. The magistrate judge says: "The6 testimony about small bits of dangerous contraband is7 indeed the most compelling in the entire case."8 Then if you go back and looked at the verbal9 musings from the bench, the judge sort of reflects a10 layman's view of, well, the idea of contraband in a half11 inch beard seems almost preposterous. And then he jumps12 down in the next paragraph, the immediate paragraph13 after that, and said: Well, then I heard the testimony14 of experienced, highly experienced correction15 professionals, and they made me change my mind.16 didn't say "change my mind." He used the word17 "impressed." The word "impressed" is at 155 of18 Joint Appendix.19 So I think what you see here is a judge20 doing what judges ought to do, which is come to21 with their layman's understanding of how things22 then hearing this testimony and thinking, oh ­­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It is somewhat hard for24 me, given what you just said, to figure this out,25 because there may be in my mind some situations with36Alderson Reporting CompanyI mean Hethecourtwork and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425some prisoners where a half inch beard won't hideanything, and with others that it will.  Doesn't thislaw require you to consider the individual before youand to accommodate them in the least restrictive way?MR. CURRAN: I think ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's assume that what the magistrate judge meant ­­ which is what I assumed; you have a different read ­­ that it's preposterous to think this prisoner could hide something in his beard, but not preposterous to think that others might not be able to do so.MR.

I think it's fair to say 14 that if the Court actually did say it was preposterous,15 in other words saying that defies common sense.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In this case.17 MR. CURRAN: In this case, yes. I think18 that's right. But I don't think that's an accurate19 finding of what the magistrate judge says, and I do20 think that's a problem and that rule is not21 administrable.22 It's far easier to say how about an eighth23 inch beard where in all scenarios you can't see the24 skin. I mean, you can imagine a warden running that25 kind of rule much better than what can we show as to38Alderson Reporting Companythink that's ato think of how tothat that level ofOfficial￼1 each person's hair type. And if he asked for that kind2 of accommodation, we would grant it. But he, you know,3 is not offered that.

You say ­­ Could you describe8 in more detail? Because I obviously missed it in the9 record. What is this barracks situation?10 MR. CURRAN: Sure.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 Where do they go when they leave the compound?13 MR. CURRAN: So they're in a barracks14 situation, they've got 30 to 50 or so in a room, and15 there are four barracks on each side of a common roof.16 They go out and they get in a line in different shifts,17 so to speak, and they go out and they will go to chow18 and they will do their business and they will go out and19 work outside the prison fence in fields, and they will20 come back again. And it's a very high traffic21 environment that's ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are these unprotected23 fields?24 MR. CURRAN: There is guards there watching25 them. You're not just out working alone, but there not39Alderson Reporting CompanyThey leave the compound.Official￼1 – there is no prison fence there. I mean, it's up to the2 guard to keep up with them. So what you have is an3 environment which on this record on page 101 of the Joint4 Appendix was we are not like California. We are not like5 New York. They have cell block housing. And there is no6 instance in which the government or the Petitioner has7 said to challenge that as to maximum security8 facilities. That's a very big difference in the nature9 of how our institution runs.10 And we think if deference means anything, it11 means you don't have to copy the prison policies of12 other States who don't even have the similar security13 concerns that we do.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you establish that15 Arkansas is unlike all these other States, that the16 other States don't have barracks, they don't have people17 going out to work in the field? I thought that that was18 not so, that there are other prisons that operate19 similarly with housing and having the prisoners work on20 a farm.21 MR. CURRAN:22 Justice Ginsburg. First23 only two States offered,24 the undisputed testimony25 they are different. And40Two things in response to that,is on this record there wasCalifornia and New York, andon this record at page 101 isthat stands undisputed.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Now, your question as to what about all thefootnotes in the briefs to this Court.  If you lookbehind all of the sources cited on those Internet sites,which that's what Petitioner mostly uses, and thegovernment uses Internet sites and also some case lawexamples, each one of those is referring to a minimumsecurity institution.  They have not offered anyinstitutions like ours.  As far as I can tell, the onlyinstitutions that have something similar to ours haveclean­shaven rules.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Federal prison system? I thought the rule was throughout the prison system.MR. CURRAN: Both the Government and the Petitioner cite a link to the regulation in their briefs and that is to minimum security status inmates.JUSTICE ALITO: When a prisoner goes out in the field and then wants to come back to the barracks, are the prisoners wearing an ID; is that correct.MR. CURRAN: That's correct.JUSTICE ALITO: And does it say which barracks that prisoner is supposed to go to?MR. CURRAN: Yes. And what happens is they trade ID's and they trade shirts. That happens even now.41Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Does the ID have a picture 2 on it?3 MR. CURRAN: Yes. So ­­ so the person4 guarding the barracks, so to speak, the ­­ the flow to5 and from the barracks, relies on the ID and the face,6 but also general familiarity with who he's working with7 because that's sort of the ­­ I mean, that happens, that8 general familiarity ­­9 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm just trying ­­ I'm10 having difficulty envisioning what you're ­­ the11 scenario that you're ­­ you're suggesting. So a12 prisoner who's supposed to be in barracks A has a13 1/2­inch beard, has an ID that says barracks A, has that14 person's picture on it, goes out in the field, brings a15 razor with him?16 MR. CURRAN: Shaves ­­17 JUSTICE ALITO: While he's out there, he18 shaves, then he wants to come back and go into barracks19 B. And how's he going to get into barracks B if he has20 an ID that says barracks A? Now you say he's going to21 trade with another prisoner? Then he will have a22 different picture on the ID, he's going to alter ­­23 they're going to alter the IDs also while they're out24 there in the fields?25 MR. CURRAN: No. They ­­ they alter the ­­42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 they would alter the ID. I mean, they ­­ what happens2 is you've got very fast recognition and if they favor3 each other at all ­­ I mean, this happens now, Your4 Honor. I mean, so ­­ and the shave would take place5 probably in the barracks in the morning. But when they6 come back, the person monitoring the flow of 60 inmates7 through there gets beaten, and that happens. And the8 concern is the ­­9 JUSTICE ALITO: So he has to find somebody10 who also looks like him from barracks B.11 MR. CURRAN: I would think that's how that12 scenario would work, but that's ­­ that happens. And13 that's ­­ I mean, prisoners are capable of doing a lot14 of mischief in prison, as you understand, I think,15 and ­­ and that kind of thing happens even now. I mean,16 we have assaults in the wrong barracks because17 correctional officers get beaten.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the hazards is19 razors. You just said that they can shave themselves in20 the barracks. Where do they get those razors and what21 happens to them?22 MR. CURRAN: The ­­ we have tamper­resistant23 safety razors that are issued and they keep them in24 their personal possession, and then they ­­ when they're25 through with them, they can turn them back in on a43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 one­to­one basis and get a new one if they exchange an2 old one.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your standard ­­4 how, if at all, does your standard differ from what it5 would be if we had no RLUIPA? Is there any case ­­ now6 we have RLUIPA ­­ any case that would come up7 differently in Arkansas under RLUIPA than under the8 preexisting law?9 MR. CURRAN: Well, I have to kind of get to10 the different elements. I think, O'Lone ­­ I mean, I'll11 talk first about maybe compelling interest. O'Lone12 credited prison officials' testimony that Muslim inmates13 are sort of getting a good rehabilitative event by not14 having to go back into the prison for Friday prayer15 because they might as well get used to an intolerant16 employer when they're out in the free world. That won't17 pass muster under compelling interest anymore. I mean,18 that just ­­ that was the old standard and the interest19 has to be truly compelling.20 On least­restrictive means, we think that21 interest grounded mostly in cost and hassle would have22 survived under the old regime which had a lot of, say,23 dietary cases and the like. Those probably will ­­ will24 fail a lot more often under RLUIPA than under the25 previous standard. So if an incremental, like the44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Yellowbear case, maybe an incremental increase in more2 staffing, ever so slight, might say, okay, that ­­ that3 is required to pass least restrictive means, but it4 wasn't under ­­ under the prior standard.5 So I think even under a deferential approach6 to RLUIPA, grounded in logic and common sense, you'll7 still8 cases9 priorhave more vigor under the RLUIPA standard andwill go the other way more often than under thestandard.1011 issue12 "This13 in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial14 burden on religious exercise."JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What about this whole about cost in the statute 2000­cc­3(c) that says, chapter may require a government to incur expenses15 MR.

I ­­ I thought earlier that youhad pretty much abandoned the concealment justificationfor the policy.  Do you ­­ do you still ­­ and wererelying upon the identification justification.MR. CURRAN: No. We think each justification stands on its own weight and we're ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You think something can be concealed within a 1/2­inch beard.MR. CURRAN: I think that on this record that something as small as a SIM card, which the Court found compelling, could. I do think that the identification within the prison is more weighty here.JUSTICE ALITO: As far as concealment is concerned, what ­­ what is the difference between a 1/2­inch beard and hair on the head that's much longer?MR. CURRAN: Well, the testimony on the46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 record was that your common sense view that longer hair2 is a better way to conceal contraband, I think, is a3 right one. The question really is: Is a beard an4 unlikely place? Well, the testimony here is not only5 can something fit in ­­ in a beard, but correctional6 officers very likely will be somewhat reluctant to do a7 full search of the beard like they would with, say, head8 hair.9 JUSTICE BREYER: I take it there's no10 example, not a single example in any State, that allows11 beard policies where somebody did hide something in his12 beard.13 MR. CURRAN: I think that's mostly right,14 Your Honor. I think there's an affidavit ­­15 JUSTICE BREYER:16 MR. CURRAN:17 JUSTICE BREYER:18 examples. Then do you think it might fit within the19 language of that report which says that the fear of20 people hiding things in their beards is, to use their21 language ­­ what was it ­­ grossly exaggerated? I mean22 42 States. You know where I'm quoting from. I'm23 quoting from the report there. The exact words are what24 they are trying to get at is "exaggerated fears." It25 doesn't even say gross there. Would you say it's an47    So we have no example.There is no example.Alderson Reporting CompanySo there is no suchOfficial￼1 exaggerated fear that people would hide something in2 their beards when, in a country of a very high prison3 population, not one example has ever been found of4 anybody hiding anything in his beard, as far as you can5 tell and as far as I can tell.6 MR. CURRAN:7 JUSTICE BREYER:8 MR. CURRAN:9 me make a caveat there that I think is important, which10 is that just because we haven't found the example11 doesn't mean they aren't there. And the courts ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. There are a lot of13 things we've never found that might be there and I'll14 refrain from mentioning them. You see them on15 television, a lot of weird programs from time to time.16 (Laughter.)17 MR. CURRAN: The problem, Your Honor ­­18 Justice Breyer, with ­­ with this scenario is these kind19 of things are buried in incident reports among thousands20 of other things. And this Court, in the Florence case,21 Justice Kennedy asked the assistant to the Solicitor22 General, I thought the evidence here of contraband was23 rather skimpy. I was surprised to see that there24 weren't more of this. And the ­­ the attorney's25 response was these things are buried in incident48As far as ­­    Do I have that right?As far as I can tell.  But letAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 reports. We can't find all of these examples. It's the2 nature of prisons, but take my newspaper articles.3 And ­­ and the Court actually, you know, took note of4 that as confirming its common sense intuition there in5 part 3 of its opinion. And I think that's just a6 problem of empiricism in the ­­ in the prison7 environment.8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, as far as searching a9 beard is concerned, why can't the prison just give the10 inmate a comb, you could develop whatever kind of comb11 you want, and say comb your beard, and if there's12 anything in there, if there's a SIM card in there or a13 revolver or anything else you think ­­14 (Laughter.)15 JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ can be hidden in a16 1/2­inch beard, a tiny revolver, it'll fall out.17 MR. CURRAN: You know, I suppose that's a18 possible alternative. I think the concern there is19 there's no perfect way of searching and ­­ and there's a20 lot of area there and you're going to have to really21 monitor to make sure they get all the spots. But ­­22 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you really think that23 would be difficult, to say here's a comb, comb your24 beard?25 MR. CURRAN: I don't think it would be that49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 difficult. I mean, I'm not in the prison environment.2 It really wasn't raised on this record. My clients3 might think that it is, but based on the information I4 have, I would agree that sounds like that would be5 something that could be done.6 And I do think it's important to distinguish7 sort of the rule that I would propose and that's in the8 Couch case, and that is ­­ what I think is very similar9 to what the government's offering here, is really an10 effort to marry strict scrutiny with deference in a way11 that doesn't invite empiricism. This Court's strict12 scrutiny jurisprudence hadn't always demanded examples,13 especially in the prison context. And I think that it's14 important that we do be allowed to have prophylactic15 rules in some settings.16 Justice Ginsburg asked, well, what about17 literature? We have a rule that says racially18 inflammatory literature of a religious nature that19 incites violence isn't allowed in the prison.20 And Justice Ginsburg in the footnote in the21 Cutter opinion seemed to think that of course that's a22 concern that prisons ought to be worried about. That's23 not susceptible to any kind of empirical proof, I don't24 think.25 And as I understand my friend's50Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 understanding of the rule, we are in a land of strict2 scrutiny really that's akin to content­based speech3 restriction analysis, where prophylaxis is to be4 condemned, we ought to really be using after­the­fact5 deterrent measures against maximum security inmates,6 that have already shown themselves not to sort of7 comport with that view of how to behave. And I think8 that's particularly dangerous in the prison setting,9 particularly in our prison's environment.10 Thank you, Your Honor.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.12 Professor Laycock, you have five minutes13 left.14 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF15 THE PETITIONER16 MR. LAYCOCK: On the issue of the written17 findings, the magistrate said it's almost preposterous18 to believe he can hide anything in his beard, and then19 he immediately said: But there's a larger principle20 here, which is I have to defer to these people. And the21 subsequent written findings are based on that mistaken22 level of deference. He said three times: I'm23 constrained by the Fegans case.24 The Eighth Circuit precedent essentially25 applied the pre­RLUIPA constitutional rule, the51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 magistrate was bound by that, and he gave that level of2 deference and he made written findings apart from what3 he had actually seen.4 On the issue of identification inside the5 prison, prisoners can shave their heads, shave their6 mustache, shave their medical beards. They don't claim7 that's a significant problem. The other 43 States do8 not appear to have found this to be a significant9 problem. It is ­­ it is a small and manageable problem.10 The ­­ on the question of the quarter inch11 medical beard, the policy is in the appendix to our12 brief at page 11A. This morning is the first time we've13 heard, well, it's really not a quarter­inch rule, it's14 really some other kind of rule. It's the first time15 we've heard we let a religious claimant to have a medical16 beard. They never said that before. And, you know,17 they have not been able to justify their policy.18 They do have to prove it, Justice Kagan, and19 if the proof comes close they get deference. If they20 offer serious evidence they get deference. But here21 they offered very limited conclusory testimony, no22 examples, in a situation where there should be plenty of23 examples. You can't administer a prison and maintain24 any kind of safety and security if you don't have some25 sense of where prisoners hide things.52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 They don't have to dig out the data from the2 files. If prisoners were routinely hiding things in3 beards these two witnesses would have known that, would4 have remembered it from the earlier rule in Arkansas and5 it would be easy to get examples to that from other6 States.7 There's simply no evidence in this record8 that it's a significant problem.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument10 that there's no comparison, that Arkansas is unique in11 the way it houses its prisoners, and that the rules that12 were cited elsewhere have13 facilities?14 MR. LAYCOCK:15 different in how it ­­ in16 prisoners working outside17 not make the half­inch beard any more attractive of a18 hiding place.19 If I'm out in ­­ if I'm out in the fields20 and I'm trying to smuggle something back in, I've still21 got lots of better places to smuggle it, including my22 shoes and my pockets and the lining of my clothes and,23 as Mr. Curran just agreed, the hair on top of my head.24 Again, there's just not a rational25 difference between where on the head the hair is53to do with minimum securityArkansas may be somewhatthe number of maximum securityin the fields, but that doesAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 located.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: You made a statement just3 then, Mr. Laycock, about how to think about deference in4 the context of this statute and it's something that5 still troubles me, so I'm going to ask you to expand on6 that. To say ­­ it just seems like a contradiction in7 terms, so I want to understand how it's not a8 contradiction in terms.9 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, it ­­ there's obviously10 some tension here, but the legislative history says due11 deference. The Cutter opinion quotes that legislative12 history and says due deference to expertise. It doesn't13 say how much deference is due. That's the question to14 be decided here.15 You know, we think the more informed and16 considered and well­explained their decision, the more17 deference it naturally deserves, the more deference is18 due. But they have to take some account of the19 prisoner's religious needs. They have to take some20 account of solutions that have been found to work in21 other States.22 If it's something so dangerous no one would23 ever try it like the Sikh Kirpan , then of course you24 wouldn't expect examples. But here 43 States have tried25 it, Arkansas tried it for years throughout ­­ in a54Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425situation like that, where there ought to be plenty ofexamples if there's a problem, they ought to have toproduce some of those examples.      So the degree of deference it is due dependson the quality of their explanation, the quality oftheir consideration of the issue, and here there's noindication they ever considered the religious needs ofthe prisoners in the adoption of this rule, or if theyever took a second look at it after RLUIPA was adopted.And the testimony is very conclusory, devoid ofexamples, devoid of attention to other jurisdictions.      The level of deference cannot be so great asto negate the statutory standard.  You have toadminister deference within that standard, notsubstitute deference for the standard, and the statutorystandard is still compelling interest and leastrestrictive means.Thank you, Your Honors.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
