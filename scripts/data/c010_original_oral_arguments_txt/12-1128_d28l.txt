Boston Scientific Corporation.      Mr. Waxman.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      Patent law places the burden of provinginfringement on the patentee.  And until this case, itwas settled that the burden does not shift if the issuearises in a declaratory action seeking a judgment ofnon­infringement.  The Federal circuit imposed adifferent rule in suits brought under MedImmune wherethe party seeking a declaration of non­infringement is alicensee.  That was error.      Allocation of the burden of proof inheres inthe governing substantive law, while the DeclaratoryJudgment Act is procedural only and does not changesubstantive rights.  The burden of proof in MedImmuneactions, like all other declaratory actions, remainswhere it would have rested in the equivalent coercivesuit brought by that patentee.3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, this concerns just the2 risk of nonpersuasion. It doesn't concern the burden of3 production; is that right?4 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. That's ­­5 that's the issue in this case. Although as we point6 out, that the word "burden of proof" ­­ I think the word7 "burden of proof" used in the opinion below could be8 thought to be addressed to both points, but the parties9 agree that the relevant consideration here is the burden10 of proof and that trial judges do retain discretion to11 make rules about ordering ­­ the ordering of proof in12 patent cases.13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's all that's14 involved, then the case doesn't seem to amount to quite15 as much as one might have thought otherwise, does it?16 If ­­ suppose the ­­ the patentee has the burden of17 production, so they would have to explain why there was18 infringement; they would have to introduce proof of19 infringement.20 And the only difference is who wins when21 the ­­ the factfinder thinks that it is exactly in22 equipoise.23 MR. WAXMAN:24 was not what happened in25 maintained should happenRight.  Well, that, of course,­­ not what the Respondentin this case.  But taking your4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 question as it is, this Court has pointed out repeatedly2 that the burden of ­­ where the burden of persuasion3 rests is very often outcome ­­ outcome determinative.4 And that is certainly true in patent cases. What the5 jury is told about who has the burden of persuasion is6 surpassingly important in many cases, including many7 patent cases.8 And that's the issue in this case. I mean,9 the substantive ­­ the ­­ the reason why the Federal10 circuit erred is clearly doctrinal, which is this Court11 has said, over and over again, that burdens of proof,12 like standards of proof, are substantive. They inhere13 in the substantive right, and the Court has also said,14 repeatedly, that the declaratory judgment action is15 procedural only and doesn't change substantive rights.16 But I think if you go to a ­­ to the policy17 question, Justice Alito, reversing the burden in a18 declaratory action would impair the purpose and utility19 of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which was enacted to20 provide a mechanism for determining how the equivalent21 coercive action would be resolved without the ­­ without22 requiring the declaratory judgment plaintiff to subject23 itself to retrospective liability.24 And, indeed, shifting the burden would25 threaten the issue preclusive effect of the declaratory5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 judgment, frustrated ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me we3 could ­­ all that may be true, but we need to cut down4 to the basic issue, which is MedImmune changes all that.5 The idea is you're moving along with the license,6 everybody's happy. All of a sudden, you jump into7 court. Why shouldn't you have the burden as the party8 who seeks to disturb the status quo?9 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the ­­ the reason,10 Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason that the burden of11 proof is substantive, and a declaratory judgment action12 under the Act is not ­­ is aimed not to change any13 substantive rights. And that's why all of the decided14 cases in this area, except for the one below, left the15 burden exactly where substantive patent law left it.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does it help your answer17 or ­­ or does it limit the theory of your case too much18 to say that, in this case, there is a controversy19 satisfying the declaratory judgment rules because the20 patentholder gave notice of potential ­­ or of21 infringement? Am I right about that?22 MR. WAXMAN: You're right about that, and23 that would be true, Justice Kennedy, on all MedImmune24 cases.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:6Alderson Reporting CompanyNow, could we ­­ or shouldOfficial￼1 we make the case turn on that, or can we say, with2 declaratory judgment, there has to be a dispute, we ­­3 we know that a dispute is likely, a controversy, so the4 formality of a notice is not important.5 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't know that it's a6 formality of a notice. I mean, the issue that this7 Court addressed in MedImmune ­­ the question that you're8 raising, I think, is one that goes to Article III9 jurisdiction. You can't use the declaratory judgment10 procedure to get the Court to answer a hypothetical11 question.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it goes to me to ­­13 a basic question of fairness. When I picked up this14 case, I thought, how is the patentholder supposed to15 know what all these new inventions are? What does it16 know about it? But then I answered my own question by17 saying, well, it gave notice of infringement.18 But ­­ that's why I've asked if the notice19 is essential to your position?20 MR. WAXMAN: I think the notice is the ­­21 well, it's essential to the Article III MedImmune22 question, whether or not there actually is a case or23 controversy.24 So, in this case, it's perfectly obvious25 because the ­­ the license requires Medtronic to7Alderson Reporting Company25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:Mr. Waxman, what do youOfficial￼1 affirmatively go to Mirowski within 30 days of2 introducing any product and not only tell ­­ providing3 notice of the product, but providing the manual ­­ the4 diagrams and the manuals that are given to physicians so5 that Mirowski can determine, within 60 days, whether or6 not to assert infringement.7 In MedImmune, you didn't have that8 procedure, but the Court still held in the context of9 that case that, because Genentech had made clear that it10 thought that the Cabilly patent covered the accused11 devices, there was sufficient ­­ sufficiently concrete12 controversy that MedImmune did not have to stop paying13 royalties and breach the license.14 And ­­ and so, therefore ­­ I think I may be15 talking around your question, but I am trying to get to16 the point that the ­­ the requirement of some notice,17 the ­­ the patentee ­­ there's no declaratory judgment18 jurisdiction if the patentee doesn't know about the19 product, has ­­ has never done anything to suggest that20 the product ­­ that his or her patent reads on the21 product.22 But that is an Article III question that23 would be ­­ you wouldn't get to the burden of proof if24 you couldn't satisfy MedImmune.8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 make of the ­­ the patent listing non­infringement as an2 affirmative defense in an infringement suit?3 MR. WAXMAN: We agree with the articulation4 of the point by the Solicitor General in the United5 States brief, which is that the cases have recognized6 that non­infringement can either be a general defense ­­7 that is, when ­­ when non­infringement is simply a8 general denial of a cause of ­­ of a claim of9 infringement, it is not an affirmative defense.10 But there are particular types of11 non­infringement claims. And the ones that I'm familiar12 with are prosecution history estoppel and the13 experimental use exception that are affirmative14 defenses.15 In other words, those are situations in16 which the alleged infringer says, hey, I'm not saying17 that your patent doesn't read ­­ all the claims of your18 patent don't read on my invention; I'm claiming19 non­infringement because I was making experimental use,20 and that has affirmatively been determined by Congress21 not to infringe.22 Or, yes, your ­­ the elements of your claim23 read upon my invention, but during the prosecution of24 the patent in the Patent Office, you disclaimed some25 claim scope, and under prosecution history estoppel,9Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this Court elucidated in Festow, there is noinfringement.     This is a case involving a general denial ofinfringement, and therefore, it is not an affirmativedefense.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What you ­­ what you just responded, that would go as well for an allegedinfringer who is not a licensee, right?MR. WAXMAN: Yes. I mean ­­ absolutely. I mean, the point here ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: This here ­­ this case is about the difference between the licensee and the non­licensee.     MR. WAXMAN:non­infringementnon­infringement         Right.  So a defense of­­ a general defense ofis not an affirmative defense. And in the ­­ the potential or correlative coercive actionOfficial￼ which would have been a suit for patent infringement by Mirowski, had we ceased making the royalty payments, they would have borne the burden of proving infringement, unless we raised an affirmative defense, like prosecution history estoppel or experimental use, in which case wewould have the burden.      The point of the Declaratory Judgment Act is that the burden is left exactly where it would have10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 been, had there been no ­­ had this identical issue2 arisen in the absence of the declaratory judgment3 procedure.4 And in this respect, it is identical to the5 jury trial right, which this Court held in Beacon6 Theatres v. Westover, is also an element of the7 substantive claim and also cannot be deprived by the8 peculiarity of a declaratory judgment being a claim for9 an equitable remedy.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, as I understand11 it, the agreement in this case identified certain12 patents and contemplated that there would be disputes13 about whether particular products of Medtronic violated14 or infringed or practiced, whatever, those patents.15 But there might be some other kinds of16 agreements which, instead, identify certain products ­­17 MR. WAXMAN: Mm­hmm.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ and essentially treat19 those as infringing products in the absence of a20 license. In that sort of agreement, would you make the21 same kind of claim, that if Medtronic had that agreement22 that identified certain products, but Medtronic woke up23 one day and said, you know what, we don't think that24 those products infringe, we essentially want to25 relitigate our agreement, can Medtronic come to court11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 and do that via a declaratory judgment action?2 And if so, who would bear the burden of3 proof?4 MR. WAXMAN: So if I understand your5 question, first, to ­­ to go to the license in this6 case. This case not only involves products that7 didn't ­­ that aren't specifically articulated in a8 license agreement; neither the patents nor the products9 at issue in this case had even been conceived, much less10 in existence, at the time the license agreement was in11 effect.12 But in ­­ if I understand your question, in13 a situation in which I make Widget A and you claim that14 you have the patent that reads on that widget, and I ­­15 you agree to license me to do it, if the license ­­ if16 payment of the license depends upon a determination that17 it otherwise would be infringing, I can file a18 declaratory judgment19 it's not infringing.20 That is, if the21 covers only products22 can bring a DEC action, claiming non­infringement, and23 you would bear the burden, assuming that you had24 threatened, in some way, to enforce your patent against25 me.12action and seek a declaration thatcover ­­ if the licensethat otherwise would infringe, IAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 In ­­ in the ­­ the situation that ­­ sort2 of bogeyman situation that Mirowski and the ­­ the3 intellectual property owner's brief articulate, which ­­4 imagine, which is you license ­­ I have a ­­ I have a5 product, you have a patent, you license it to me, and I6 turn around the next day and sue for ­­ a declaration of7 non­infringement, there are any number of ways that you,8 as the patentee, could protect yourself from that9 extraordinary eventuality.10 You could provide, for example, that ­­ I ­­11 you would require me to issue a ­­ you know, to ­­ to ­­12 to pay a paid­up royalty for all use. Or you could13 simply say, we don't care whether the patent infringes14 or not; you agree to pay me three dollars per unit sold.15 Or you could put a provision in that would say, if you16 sue for patent infringement, the royalty rate goes to17 3X.18 Or, for that matter, if you sue, that19 will ­­ that can ­­ I can deem that a breach of the20 license agreement and ­­ and recover the ­­ the remedies21 that patent law allows, an22 and attorneys' fees in the23 action.24 I want to underscore,25 circuit made a broad rule,13injunction and treble damagescontext of a ­­ a willfulalthough the Federalexactly what we have here.Alderson Reporting Company22 special rule only in MedImmune­type cases.23 rationale of the court is that what causes24 shift is the absence of a counterclaim for25 That would have, for example, caused the14Official￼1 In this case, Mirowski ­­ this license is from 1991.2 Mirowski ­­ it's not in the record, but there's no3 dispute that Mirowski has received hundreds of millions4 of dollars of royalties from Medtronic for its patents.5 It gets, as a benefit of this license ­­6 notice, as I said, within 30 days of every new product7 and the manual, and it can require Medtronic to start8 accruing royalties and an interest rate of 2 ­­ of 29 points over prime, as soon as it sends us a notice.10 And moreover, in the ­­ in the litigation11 tolling agreement, we agree that, even though we are not12 a party in the referenced St. Jude action, we would be13 bound by any determination in that adjudication,14 whereas, otherwise, we wouldn't.15 So this license agreement was enormously16 beneficial and couldn't be farther from the scenario of17 I have a widget, I agree to license it, and the next18 day, I turn around and sue you. But, in that event,19 there would be lots and lots of remedies.20 I do want to underscore one other thing,21 that the Federal circuit said that it was applying thisAlderson Reporting Company  But thethe burden toinfringement.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425burden to shift in the Myriad case that this Courtdecided last term, where there was one researcher at NYUwho had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action.There was no basis for Myriad to claiminfringement because he had made clear that hewouldn't ­­ he wouldn't engage in the research and clinical work that he was going to, so long as he was in risk of patent infringement remedies. And that ­­ the source of the rule ­­ the source of the law where the burden of proof lies, is in substantive patent law. And this Court has said, for 125 years, that it rests with the infringer.What neither the Federal circuit nor myfriend on the other side of this case has ever identified is what is the source of the rule that shifts the burden in a declaratory judgment action? It can't be the Declaratory Judgment Act because that Act is procedural only.If I can reserve the balance of my time?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,    FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it15Official￼Alderson Reporting Company25 that, Justice Sotomayor.I was going to say that IOfficial￼1 please the Court:2 The government agrees that using the same3 burden of proof that would apply in the hypothetical4 coercive action that underlies the Declaratory Judgment5 Act is the best thing to do in this mirror image6 declaratory judgment action. That best serves the7 purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act and allows for8 final resolution of the types of controversies that this9 Court contemplated in MedImmune.10 If I could turn to Justice Kagan's points11 about an incident in which the parties had actually12 agreed to ­­ whether certain products were covered by a13 particular license.14 That would be different from the situation15 we have here because the products in question here16 weren't actually in existence at the time of the17 underlying license agreement. The whole point of that18 aspect of the license agreement was to, as you said,19 channel future disputes into this particular dispute20 resolution mechanism.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are ­­ are you22 suggesting that the burden­shifting rule should be23 different in the hypothetical Justice Kagan ­­24 MR. GANNON: I was not about to suggest16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 think that's the ­­ that ­­ that that would probably be2 the least logical way to deal with the quandary that3 might arise from thinking that somebody is then trying4 to breach the license.5 And we don't think there's any license6 breach here because there wasn't any prior agreement on7 the fact that these future products were going to be8 covered by the ­­ by these patents, that they'd be9 practicing these patents.10 But, even if there were some concern about11 the licensee turning around and challenging the12 agreement that it had previously made, it seems like the13 problem there is either that they should be estopped by14 what they already said in the agreement or Lear needs to15 be extended to keep them from being estopped in that16 way. But shifting the burden of proof seems like an odd17 way to get at solving whatever the quandary there might18 be.19 And I think that, at some point, this ­­20 this also interweaves with a point that the Chief21 Justice made, about whether Medtronic here is seeking to22 change the status quo. And we don't think that23 Medtronic is seeking to change the status quo here, for24 a couple different reasons.25 One of them is, as I was just saying, that17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the agreement here didn't actually reach ­­ the license2 agreement here didn't ­­ it didn't include a meeting of3 the minds about whether these particular future products4 would be covered by these patents, including one of the5 patents was reissued after the time of the license.6 And also, this license agreement expressly7 preserved the parties' ability, including Medtronic's8 ability, to challenge both the validity and the9 enforceability of the patent. That's at page 13 of the10 Joint Appendix. And so there's no way in which I think11 it can be legitimately said that Medtronic is trying to12 either get out of its contractual obligations or to13 change the status quo.14 The status quo, right now, is that the15 royalties are collecting in a certified account, and so,16 in a sense, both parties are trying to change the status17 quo, in trying to get the stream of royalties that18 either is applicable to these products or isn't, on the19 basis of the resolution of a question that the parties20 had not decided, but said would be decided in a21 declaratory judgment action like this.22 And we think that the best way to think of a23 declaratory judgment action like this is that it is the24 mirror image of the underlying coercive hypothetical25 action that could have been brought against Medtronic.18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well ­­ well, but I2 guess the argument is that it's the mirror image of an3 action that could not have been brought because4 Medtronic is paying royalties.5 MR. GANNON: Well, the same thing is true in6 MedImmune, and I think that the Court noted that the ­­7 in MedImmune, that the Declaratory Judgment Act was8 intended to help get the party out of the dilemma it9 would be in, in deciding whether it should continue to10 be effectively coerced into paying royalties that it11 thinks it doesn't need to pay or exposing itself to the12 risks associated with ­­ with breaching the license13 and ­­ and being subject to treble damages, attorneys'14 fees, and the other remedies that would be available15 under the Patent Act.16 And, yet, even though there had been no17 infringement in that case and no breach of the contract18 in that case, which is also true here, because, so far,19 everybody has been behaving the way the license expected20 them to behave, the Court recognized that the parties21 had a concrete dispute about the applicability of the22 patents to those particular products, that the scope of23 the contract was not going to require payment of24 royalties where the patent did not apply, and said that25 the ­­ the issues that were going to be resolved in the19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 declaratory judgment action there were going to involve2 questions of patent validity, patent enforceability, and3 scope of coverage, patent infringement, which is exactly4 what we have here.5 Medtronic has raised in their complaint ­­6 the well­pleaded complaint that you would look to here,7 is one that arises under the Patent Act and includes8 claims involving all three of those issues, just as was9 the case in MedImmune.1011 with12 says13 arises under contract law. It's a contract case with a14 patent issue.15 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do16 disagree with that. We think that this case involves a17 claim that arises under the patent laws, for the reasons18 that I was just saying.19 I think that the way to ­­ the way to20 conceptualize this is to look to what the well­pleaded21 complaint would be in the hypothetical coercive action22 that would be being brought against Medtronic if we23 didn't have the problem presented by the fact that they24 haven't actually breached the contract or infringed at25 this point.20JUSTICE GINSBURG: I take it you disagree the ­­ we have one friend of the Court brief that this is not a case arising under the patent law; itAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And we have every reason to think that that2 hypothetical coercive action is one that arises under3 the patent laws because it's one involving infringement.4 That's the dispute that the parties acknowledge that5 they have.6 In the litigation tolling agreement at page7 20 of the Joint Appendix, it talks about the fact that8 the parties have a dispute under Section 271 of the9 Patent Act. In the red brief here, Mirowski has ­­ has10 told us on page 48 that, if Medtronic were to cease11 paying royalties, that the recourse would be that they12 would bring an infringement suit. And the complaint13 here in paragraph 5 alleges that the claim here arises14 under the Patent Act.15 And because it does arise under the Patent16 Act and because it's clear here that all of the17 defensive issues would also be Federal, as I mentioned18 before, I think there is no dispute here that this ­­19 this would arise under the patent laws, which would20 provide for district court jurisdiction under Section21 1338 and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Federal22 circuit under Section 1295(a), even before the23 amendments in the America Invents Act in 2011.24 I think that there is one other point that25 would be worth making in response to some of the amicus21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 briefs about the ­­ the potential problems here2 associated with whether the parties have an incentive to3 enter into these type of licensing arrangements.4 As Mr. Waxman already explained, the5 patentholder here got lots of benefits out of ­­ out of6 entering into an agreement like this, notwithstanding7 the fact that they would leave themselves open to8 precisely the suits that the agreement contemplated,9 which was a suit involving both infringement and10 validity questions; and that, under the circumstances,11 there's ­­ they had plenty of incentive to enter into a12 license agreement, notwithstanding the fact that they13 would continue to bear the same burden of proof that14 they would bear in every other procedural context in15 which patent infringement claims have arisen up until16 now.17 And so I think that, in that sense,18 that's ­­ that's not a sea change from their19 perspective. And ­­ and, yet, even if they were to20 think it so, as Mr. Waxman explained, a licensor in that21 context would have several mechanisms that they could22 use in order to rejigger the balance between the parties23 if they wanted to.24 And ­­ and I think that we agree with ­­25 with everything on the list that Mr. Waxman mentioned,22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 including having fully paid­up licenses or allowing a2 suit for infringement or invalidity to constitute a3 termination of the license that would allow the4 patentholder to bring an infringement action.56 urge 78910 1112 Mr. Chief Justice,13 The Federal circuit got it right in this14 case. The Federal circuit took the well­settled law on15 burden of proof, and it applied it to two stipulated16 facts and reached a conclusion that it had to reach. It17 was controlled by it.1819 when20 that21 no infringement in this case. Infringement is defined22 as "using a patented invention without authority."23 Medtronic had authority.

NEUSTADT:THE RESPONDENTS         Thank you, Your Honor.and may it please the Court:The two stipulated facts were, number one, Mirowski's counsel, me, wrote letters to Medtronic, was not a notice of infringement. There could beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 licensee. It cannot be an infringer. So everything2 that you say about infringement involves a completely3 different situation.4 There was no shifting of the burden of5 proof. The well­settled law that I referred to is the6 normal default rule. The normal default rule is perhaps7 one of the most fundamental tenets of our jurisprudence.8 It says that, if a party files a complaint and seeks9 relief, it has the responsibility to prove that it is10 entitled to that relief.11 And the normal default rule has the word12 "default" in there because it refers to the fact that13 the statute doesn't decide the burden of proof. And14 there's no dispute in this case that the statute does15 not decide the burden of proof.16 So ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but you could say18 that about any declaratory judgment action. You can say19 the person bringing the declaratory judgment action is20 seeking the relief. And if ­­ if we follow what you21 said, that then the burden shifts in every declaratory22 judgment action.

The problem is that they could ­­ if they don't have a license, they28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 can get enjoined.

In that response, where you are8 talking about infringement and not claim coverage, the9 patentee has to counterclaim. It's compulsory.10 The patentee then has the burden of proof in11 that case because he has claimed infringement.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it is often13 the case, in declaratory judgment actions, that the14 defendant in the action cannot counterclaim.

And ­­ and it's ­­ there are many,16 many, many possibilities.17 I take it that's what they mean when they18 say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating19 how the claim limitations map onto the accused product20 because infringement may be found only when the product21 falls within the scope ­­ scope of the asserted claim or22 claims in every respect.23 Your client, who's the patentee, knows how.24 Otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringement25 suit or the inside­the­coverage suit or responding to40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 someone who says it's outside the coverage.2 But ­­ but the person who is the alleged3 infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes4 sense to put everything in the same place; notice of5 infringement, burden of production, burden of proof.6 And that way, it will be easier to focus on what's at7 stake.89 I'veThat's what I take it their argument is.

NEUSTADT: Yeah. And that argument wasn't even presented to the Federal circuit before its decision. And the Federal circuit would have openly rejected it and say, you've got to be kidding.JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying, I don't really care about what is an action where there is an infringement action or there even could be one in the circumstances before us, that's not my case because they're going to pay me forever, if they lose this declaratory judgment, so there's no shift.     And where there's no shift, you ought tofollow the rules for where there's no shift, which isthat the burden lies on the person bringing the suit.MR.

Let me find the controlling9 law. I’ll look to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court says10 there is a normal default rule, and it's the party11 seeking relief.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but you are13 overlooking the ­­ the elephant in the room, which is14 the relief they are seeking is protection against the15 relief that you would be seeking, but for the16 declaratory judgment action.17 MR. NEUSTADT: We ­­ we can never seek it18 because they are not infringing. And we do not have to19 file a counterclaim for claim coverage because there is20 no requirement that we do so. There is no coercive21 complaint. If they are suing ­­ if there was a22 non­infringement situation, we'd would have to file the23 coercive complaint.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Declaratory Judgment25 Act is addressed to potential coercion, not actual45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 coercion. That's the whole point. You should be able2 to bring the suit before coercion is applied.3 Now, it is true that you're not applying4 coercion right now, but what they're worried about is,5 if they stop paying the royalties, you will apply6 coercion, and the Declaratory Judgment Act is a way of7 getting this on the table before a court without their8 having to go into default and incurring all the9 penalties, but it is not intended to shift the burden of10 proof.11 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, it doesn't shift the12 burden of proof.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does shift the burden of14 proof because if what they are worried about is your15 claiming infringement and ­­ and exacting a penalty from16 them for their not paying the royalties that the17 agreement provides, okay, that's what they are worried18 about.19 The Declaratory Judgment Act enables them to20 sue beforehand, before they incur liability. That's its21 whole purpose, and its purpose is not to shift the22 burden of proof.23 MR. NEUSTADT: The ­­ in answer to your ­­24 your hypothetical, I agree with you on all of that. But25 as in the MedImmune case, MedImmune ends up with the46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 burden of proof. MedImmune says, I've got to get a2 resolution to this question. I want you to overrule3 Gen­Pro, I want to show why the ­­ why my product is not4 covered.5 Well, all of that's fine, there is nothing6 the matter with that, there is no coercion. It's just7 that, when MedImmune does this, it's going to have the8 burden to show it.9 JUSTICE BREYER: But you would agree with10 this, you would agree that, if that agreement of yours11 read a little differently, if MedImmune ­­ if they had12 said ­­ you know, we are not going to pay royalties13 until your client brings an infringement suit, which you14 intend to do, at that point, if you'd made that promise,15 you would have the burden of proof because you'd bring16 an infringement suit.17 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, of course.18 JUSTICE BREYER: And if they said either an19 infringement suit or a declaratory judgment action,20 then, again, you would have the burden of proof, even in21 the declaratory judgment action because then they would22 be totally parallel.23 I mean, then you'd have, if you brought the24 infringement suit, it's yours. And then, in the25 declaratory judgment action, it should be true, too, in47Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. NEUSTADT:Official￼1 your 23 have 4view.MR. NEUSTADT:one party seeking relief, the licensee ­­JUSTICE BREYER:56 burden.7 JUSTICE BREYER:8 The answer is yes or no.9 understanding your argument that if that agreement had10 said you can bring either kind of suit, either we ­­11 yes, we the patentee, will bring a suit, in which case,12 you will defend it; or if you bring it first, you can13 bring a declaratory judgment action, okay, for the same14 thing.15 If it had said that and the agreement had16 held up the royalties until one or the other was17 decided, then your client, the patentee, would have the18 burden of proof in either because it's exactly the same19 thing.2021 me? 2223242548You could have brought ­­ are you followingMR. NEUSTADT:JUSTICE BREYER:(Laughter.)MR. NEUSTADT:No, I'm afraid not.  Okay.  Skip it.Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, the way it is, if you  But I mean ­­­­ the licensee's got the   The answer is yes or no.That is, am I right in ­­ inSo, really, what the FederalOfficial￼1 circuit did ­­ said there was no shifting here. First,2 you've got to look to who's got the burden of proof.3 You get that from Schaffer, the normal default rule,4 only one party seeking relief.5 And then they said, and besides, the6 patentee could not have brought suit because you can’t7 accuse him of infringement. So you have a simple case of8 only one party seeking relief; that party has the9 burden.10 And you would have that anyway even ­­ even11 without this agreement, because only one party can bring12 suit. It's just like in Schaffer. This party brings13 suit, they have the burden. Other party brings suit,14 they have the burden.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are really16 looking at it, though, from the point of view of a contract17 action, rather than a patent action.18 MR. NEUSTADT: Well, it can't be a patent19 action because the whole purpose of the license is not20 to have an infringer. And it is a contract action and21 that 2223 yes,24 have25 fromgets into the jurisdictional question.And, to answer Justice Ginsburg's question,there isn't the usual jurisdiction that you would in a patent infringement action. And this comes the unanimous opinion of this Court earlier this49Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425year in Gunn vs. Minton, in which I think Your Honor ­­Your Honor was the author, which says that that's just acontract action.     Just having a patent question doesn't getyou into Federal court.JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Neustadt, I was under the impression that, according to this contract, if Medtronic stops paying royalties, you can bring notOfficial￼onlywithcontract.JUSTICE KAGAN: But you can bring an infringement suit according to the very agreement that you signed.MR.

NEUSTADT: Well, of course. But that's not the situation we face here. That ­­ that's always been true. I mean, if they want to, if the burden of proof is so burdensome to them, just go ahead andbreach. And then we will sue them, and we will have the burden of proof.JUSTICE SCALIA: You can always say that in declaratory judgment actions, that is not the situation we face. The Declaratory Judgment Act posits ahypothetical situation.     MR. NEUSTADT:JUSTICE SCALIA:going to sue me later.That's not the situation I face. But I worry that you will sue me later.MR. NEUSTADT: But you have ­­ but how can I sue later if you're continuing to pay royalties? That was ­­ that was the MedImmune situation. MedImmune said, I've got to pay you royalties ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't want to ­­ they don't want to continue to pay royalties. That's the point. That's why they bring the Declaratory Judgment Act, so that the court can tell them, you don't have to pay royalties because this stuff is not covered.MR. NEUSTADT: Well, that's absolutely51It always does.  You cannot say that we’re going to ­­     I am worried that you areYou are not suing me now.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425right. But in that case ­­ and the court didn't rule upon it because it got remanded ­­ they would have the burden of proof because they are the only party seeking relief. You can't say not only ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: You cite ­­ you cite the default rule, and you rely on that totally. But there are other rules on burden of proof, for example, the party who has better access to the information, so it's not as though there is this firm rule with no exceptions.I take it, from your answers toJustice Scalia, that you are saying in every declaratory judgment action where only one party is seeking relief, that party has the burden of proof. So you're not limiting this to patent cases; is that right?MR. NEUSTADT: Oh, that's correct. That's the normal default rule. And there should be no exception to that.I see my light is red.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman, you have three minutesremaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P.
