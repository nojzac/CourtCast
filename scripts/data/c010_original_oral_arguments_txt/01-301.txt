CROSS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          AEDPA's language, purpose, and legislativehistory supports the conclusion that the circuit conflictover the meaning of pending in 28 U.S.C., section2244(d)(2) can be resolved by reversing the Ninth Circuitfor one or more of the following three reasons.          First, the Ninth Circuit improperly permitstolling for substantial delay if the State Supreme Courtaddresses the merits when denying an application forcollateral review.          Second, under California's system of successiveoriginal petitions, nothing is pending under State orFederal law following the denial of an application forcollateral review and prior to the proper filing of a newapplication for review.          And third, the gap theory relied upon by thedistrict court more accurately reflects congressionalAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200054￼1 intent and the policy judgments underlying AEDPA's 1-year2 statute of limitations than does the Ninth Circuit's3 interpretation of pending --4 QUESTION: Mr. Cross, would you explain to us5 what it is in California -- what is the system and the6 time within which post-conviction relief can be applied7 for in California courts? Is there any time limit for8 filing it with the trial court level?9 MR. CROSS: It's within a reasonable time, Your10 Honor, the general rule of timeliness. However, within a11 reasonable time has parameters which I can give you the12 case of In re Harris, a California Supreme Court case,13 which addresses that. Specifically, it says the following14 in footnote 7. That's -- the cite is 5 Cal.4th at 828-15 829. Footnote 7 says the following. The general rule16 regarding timeliness is the habeas corpus petition must be17 filed within a reasonable time after the petitioner18 counsel knew or with due diligence should have known the19 facts underlying the claim, as well as the legal basis of20 the claim.21 They then follow that up with two significant22 points. The first is, is that ineffective assistance of23 counsel claims, which is the claim in this particular24 litigation, should be filed as a verified -- excuse me --25 a verified petition jointly with the direct appeal. InAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

You have apresumption that you have not exceeded substantial delayif you do it within 90 days.          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, here there was aprompt filing in the -- at the trial court level.          MR. CROSS:  Pardon?          QUESTION:  Here there was a prompt filing at thetrial court level for habeas, State habeas.          MR. CROSS:  I would -- Your Honor, I wouldrespectfully disagree that it was prompt since he waited 5years --          QUESTION:  Well, all right.  It was -- it waswithin the statutory period that we have imposed for thesesituations where it had -- AEDPA became effective.          MR. CROSS:  He filed his claim with 7 daysremaining --          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. CROSS:  -- in the grace period of theAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

CROSS:  Correct.          QUESTION:  Is that how it's done?          MR. CROSS:  Correct, in California.          QUESTION:  And is that again a reasonable timeperiod within which to seek review by that mechanism inthe court of appeals?  Or is there a time limit?          MR. CROSS:  As far as the -- the time betweeneach original petition, there is no time limit.  You wouldbe looking at the overall time period because you'redealing with -- Your Honor, with original petitions here.So he has every right in California to go directly to theCalifornia Supreme Court or the Third District Court ofAppeal.          QUESTION:  Well, that's the traditional rule inhabeas corpus, at least in -- in England.          MR. CROSS:  Correct.          QUESTION:  Wasn't it?  That you could go fromone court to another and have -- have a different judgelook at it in a different proceeding and get a differentresult.Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200057￼1 MR. CROSS: Absolutely, Your Honor.2 QUESTION: But if he goes -- if he's -- I take3 it, under the California system, if he starts in the4 Supreme Court of California, and there's a fact issue,5 they're going to say, go back to the trial court and start6 there. They're not going to have a factual trial, are7 they?8 MR. CROSS: In fact, Your Honor, I'd like to9 correct a misunderstanding that's promoted by the10 respondent's brief. If you look at the red brief at page11 31, it gives the impression that you are indicating that12 if you were to go directly to the California Supreme13 Court --14 QUESTION: Whereabouts on page 31?15 MR. CROSS: On page 31 at the top paragraph,16 there's a reference in the third line to In re Hillery.17 Then there's a reference, the Ninth Circuit case, Harris18 v. Superior Court, indicating that California appellate19 courts may refuse to entertain habeas and that it be sent20 back to the trial court. That's an incorrect statement of21 law, and I'll refer you to the actual footnote on that22 page, footnote 19, referring to California Rule of Court23 56(a)(1).24 The problem with respondent's position is that25 he gives a literal quote of 56(a)(1) and it sounds likeAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 that's the proposition that you're referring to, but he2 ignores to cite to the subsection (h), which is, as of3 January 1st of this year, is now labeled subsection (i),4 which specifically states, quote -- and the title of the5 subsection is proceedings not covered by this rule.6 Quote: the provisions of this rule shall not apply to7 applications for a writ of habeas corpus or to petitions8 for review pursuant to rules 57, 58, and 59.9 1011 court. 1213141516 higher17 How do1819 Honor,20 opinion --21 QUESTION: Well, I haven't read --22 QUESTION: Why don't you tell us?23 MR. CROSS: I will tell you, Your Honor. The --24 the way it is handled is the California Supreme Court25 around 1969 set up a procedure in which for originalAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Well, what happens --QUESTION:  So, you -- you can begin in a higherMR. CROSS:  Yes.QUESTION:  You don't have to begin --MR. CROSS:  Right, correct.QUESTION:  What happens if you do begin in acourt and -- and there are disputed factual issues?they resolve the factual issues?   MR. CROSS:  The -- that is explained, Yourin Harris v. Superior Court, the Ninth Circuit8￼9￼1 petitions in the appellate court that are filed there,2 either in the -- the district court of appeal or the3 California Supreme Court, they can have a special master,4 or they can send it back to the trial court, so that5 there's no prevention from them taking the court and6 deciding it with or without the hearing. But a prima7 facie case must be made to them in order for those --8 QUESTION: Did -- in the proceedings involved in9 this particular case, did either of the appellate courts10 go the -- do that?11 MR. CROSS: No. There was -- the -- the12 district court of appeal is a one-line denial, simply13 stating denied. And in the California Supreme Court, the14 petition was denied on the merits and for lack of15 diligence.16 QUESTION: But in this --17 QUESTION: What happens just as a practical18 matter? You go to the superior court on a collateral19 attack with a -- with a petition for a writ, and the court20 makes lots of findings and rulings of law. Some of those21 rulings of law are absolutely wrong, but still, the22 ultimate outcome may be in doubt. And so then the23 petitioner, the original petitioner, wants to go to the24 court of appeals. Does -- does he annex what happens in25 -- in the superior court just for the enlightenment of theAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000510￼1 court of appeals as to what the issues are or what the2 wrong rulings were, what the right rulings were, what the3 findings were?4 MR. CROSS: The forms, Your Honor, are in the5 joint appendix where you are expected to indicate -- it's6 -- all three petitions use the same judicial counsel form.7 California Supreme Court petition -- if you want to look,8 it starts at page 31. And there -- I believe there is a9 question which asks the defendant if they've sought review10 in another court and to explain what the finding was of11 that court and what claims were requested. That would be,12 for example, question 9, did you seek review in the --13 excuse me.14 QUESTION: Well, it's just background. I -- I15 see where to find it now.16 MR. CROSS: The -- that's the extent of it. And17 so, the purpose of that question is to determine whether18 or not it's a -- it's a successive petition so they cannot19 -- if they had gone to the lower court, it can't be20 remanded back because the -- if the petition has been21 denied in the lower court, they don't want to send it back22 for an evidentiary hearing to the same judge or court who23 has gone through the proceeding before and denied it.24 QUESTION: Well, getting to the issue in the25 case, the respondent's brief points out that under theAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000511￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425theory you propose, what would happen if it's the -- theState that's appealing or filing a new -- not appealing,but filing a new action?  The -- the prisoner wins in --in the lower court, and then the State files an action.How -- how would you count that or not count that so faras the limitations period is concerned?          MR. CROSS:  That is the most difficult questionthat is posed, without question, Your Honor.  The responseI would have is it appears to me that Congress perhaps didnot think of that particular scenario other than perhapsthat under 2244(d)(1)(B), the State-created impedimentissue would take care of the extreme case where the --where the State was trying to prevent the person's timefrom --          QUESTION:  This is the case where the petitionerprevails --          MR. CROSS:  Right.          QUESTION:  -- in superior court, and by statute,now California allows the State to appeal that.          MR. CROSS:  Correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, certainly that would be -- thatwould be pending all that time, would it not?          MR. CROSS:  If you --          QUESTION:  Or would it not?          MR. CROSS:  If you take the position that it'sAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200058 the State9 appellate10loses, it can appeal, then that would be anproceeding, wouldn't it?MR. CROSS:  For California -- under CaliforniaHonor, absolutely.  But as far as this statute11 law, Your12 is concerned, I think we're interested in what the Federal13 law is and how the Congress would have viewed it.14 QUESTION: So, looking at how Federal law --15 QUESTION: But I -- but -- if -- if I may, just16 one moment, Justice Breyer.17 What the Chief Justice suggests is that I -- I18 did not pose a problem because what happens is is that the19 State simply appeals the -- what it thinks to be the20 erroneous ruling, and that means the action is still21 pending. But I -- I thought from our earlier interchange22 that you thought there was a bigger problem than that.23 MR. CROSS: I think there is a bigger problem24 because if there is -- it depends on when finality occurs,25 and if -- if you have an original proceeding and theAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000512￼1 not an appellate system in a State like California, I2 don't think it would be.3 QUESTION: Well, but you know, it can -- it4 could be not an appellate system from the point of view of5 the petitioner who has to have an original petition each6 -- each time he goes again to a new court. But the7 legislature said, with respect to the State, if the -- if13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decision is final upon that decision, the clock would, Iwould assume, start at least under California law.  Thecase laws that's referred to in the yellow brief undersubsection (c) --          QUESTION:  Well, but the Chief Justice suggestsit's not rocket science for us to say it's still pendingif there's an appeal.          QUESTION:  Well, I -- I thought your --          QUESTION:  Or am I missing something?          QUESTION:  I am confused now.  I thought yourposition was that the case may well be pending, as JusticeKennedy says, but there's no application pending --          MR. CROSS:  Correct.          QUESTION:  -- on the appeal.  The applicationhas been disposed of in the first court.  There's anappeal, but there's no longer an application pending.  Andthat's how the statute reads, not the case is pending.          MR. CROSS:  Right.          QUESTION:  There is an appeal?  I thought thatwhat happened -- I guess I'm mixed up.  Maybe go back toJustice O'Connor.  But I thought I understood this.  Ithought that they -- but that there is -- first of all,you file in the district court normally.  You don't haveto in California.          QUESTION:  Superior.Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000514￼1 QUESTION: But almost always they'll go to the2 superior court and file a petition. And then in every3 other State, the losing party would appeal, but in4 California, they use different words. The words are not5 you appeal; the words are you file a new petition in the6 court of appeals. And indeed, if you lose there, the7 words are not you have 10 days to seek review in the8 Supreme Court; the words are you have whatever time you9 want. You have to file a new petition in the Supreme10 Court, but if you're too late, they're going to tell you11 you're too late.12 So, it functions exactly as if the words were13 the following. You must appeal within -- now, normally it14 will say 60 days, but in California it says within a15 reasonable time.16 Now, those aren't the words of the statute, but17 that's how it functions. And if we don't read it that way18 for purposes of Federal law, I guess we'd have to say that19 in 10,000 case a year in the California superior courts20 involving State habeas petitions -- as soon as those are21 decided, they have to come here because they're all final22 decisions of the State Supreme Court. And 5,000 cases in23 the courts of appeals in California. Once they said24 final, they have to come here. So, we better have 20,00025 new petitions each year from the State of CaliforniaAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000510 just mere11 different12 at all.13semantics because they can go to California withclaims.  It doesn't have to be the same petition                QUESTION:  Justice Breyer suggests that when you14 go, say, from the superior court to the district court of15 appeal, it's -- it's like an appeal. Well, now, is there16 a transcript of the record made in the superior court that17 you have to file with the district court of appeal like18 you would in other appeals?19 MR. CROSS: Typically not. There could be some20 circumstances, under rare circumstances, where the21 superior court would have some sort of evidentiary22 hearing. There would be a transcript.23 QUESTION: Do you have to file a notice of24 appeal in the superior court to go to the district court25 of appeal?Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000515￼1 because California happens to use the word final and new2 petition instead of using the word appeal.3 Now, what's wrong with what I said?4 MR. CROSS: What's wrong with what you said,5 Your Honor, first of all, is that although California may6 say that it's final at that level, it does not prevent the7 individual from going to either of the other two next8 levels or skipping one and going to the other because they9 are in fact original and in fact not -- it's more than16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. CROSS:  No, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  In other words, in the -- I've neverheard of this, and I know a lot of California lawyers.  Ithought when you go to the superior court in California --a prisoner and he says, I raise issues 1, 2, and 3, andthey have a record and they decide it.  And now you go tothe California court of appeals.  I thought in the normalcase they'll say, and the superior court judge made anerror, and the reason he made an error is because of --and then they'll cite witnesses just like an appeal.          Now, I grant you they can do some extra things.They can raise extra issues if they want, and they don'thave to raise everything below like any other appeal.  Butaside from that, I don't know the differences.  I've beenaround for a while.  I've seen a few cases.  I've nevernoticed some big difference.  Now, you'll tell me I'm allwrong about California, and I'm open to hearing that.          MR. CROSS:  The California case law, in fact,indicates that --          QUESTION:  I'm not interested in California caselaw.  I want to know what the practice is in California.          MR. CROSS:  The practice is quite different fromthe description that you gave.          QUESTION:  Fine.  That's what I want to know.          MR. CROSS:  In fact, there are -- I don't haveAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000517￼1 the exact statistics, but in my 15 years of experience in2 practicing, I have seen probably around 40 to 50 percent3 of the cases not go to the trial court, that in fact, very4 commonly they go directly to the California Supreme Court,5 and they are denied. That's a very common experience in6 California --7 QUESTION: Then can they go -- start over again8 and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?9 MR. CROSS: Not -- Your Honor, not on those same10 claims, they certainly can't. California and other States11 would perhaps bar successive petitions if it's the same12 claims. It doesn't necessarily prevent them from coming13 back with something else that they've discovered at a14 later time --15 QUESTION: There's no bar in California to going16 back as many times as you want if you have a new claim17 each time?18 MR. CROSS: There are escape clauses in19 California, as well as other States, that -- that allow20 you, if you discover, just like the Federal statute, new21 claims.22 QUESTION: All right. What -- what is the23 general rule in other States that are unlike California24 that say you go for post-conviction relief first to the25 trial court? Let them decide it. Then you have 30 daysAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000518￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425or whatever it is to go to the court of appeals.  Ifthat's denied, you have X number of days to go to theState Supreme Court.          Now, in a State like that, is it the case thatin applying AEDPA in this statute of limitations, that weexclude all of the time for decision making as well asthat statutory time within which to file the appeal?          MR. CROSS:  AEDPA grants --          QUESTION:  Is that what a majority of courts areholding?          MR. CROSS:  The majority of courts are holdingthat -- and the statute specifically provides for tollingfor all the time in which the decision -- excuse me -- inwhich the petition is before a court.  That's, you know,specifically provided.          QUESTION:  Well, yes, but is it -- is it thecase that most courts are holding, under the scheme Idescribed, that not only while the court is deciding it,but the time allowed to enable them to go to the nexthigher court is excluded as well?          MR. CROSS:  The majority of courts are holdingthat you will get time for the appeal time that'sspecified by the State, for example, 60 days or 90 days.          QUESTION:  Yes, all right.  So, the problem withCalifornia is we have no time specified.  We have aAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

Should we certify a questionback to the California Supreme Court and say, was this areasonable time?  How do we know?          MR. CROSS:  One --          QUESTION:  What do we do?          MR. CROSS:  One suggestion that was made in theamicus briefs by the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation isto adopt the nearest analogous State rule, which inCalifornia under rule 2 or 30 through 31 would be 60 days.That's one thing that could be done by the court whichwould stretch the statutory language to -- to bringCalifornia into an appellate system which --          QUESTION:  Wouldn't that be up to California todo?  What we have is a system that allows a reasonabletime.  I'm asking you how we determine what is areasonable time.          MR. CROSS:  I think, Your Honor, the way todetermine a reasonable time would be to look at theCalifornia rules for their original habeas petitions anddetermine that under California law, we know that -- thatyou are expected to file no longer than 90 days in acapital case without having a presumption of timeliness --          QUESTION:  May I just interrupt --          MR. CROSS:  And that would be the absoluteAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

Ifin this case the California court did decide on the merits-- apparently -- it's a little ambiguous, but it seems to-- wouldn't that definitely disclose a decision that itwas reasonable?  They took jurisdiction.          MR. CROSS:  No, Your Honor.  I -- I believe thatthe -- the interpretation would be that even though a -- aState Supreme Court decided, at least alternatively on themerits -- simply indicates that for one reason or another,they decided to perhaps excuse untimeliness if they didn'thave a -- an untimeliness finding --          QUESTION:  To excuse untimeliness, they'resaying in this particular case we think it must have beenreasonable.  Aren't -- isn't that -- doesn't thatnecessarily follow?          MR. CROSS:  In this particular case, they saidhe acted with a lack of diligence.          QUESTION:  But that might have been --          QUESTION:  No, but it didn't excuseuntimeliness.  Untimeliness was one of the two bases fortheir decision, wasn't it?          MR. CROSS:  In this case, absolutely.          QUESTION:  We don't know whether thatAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000521￼1 untimeliness was the 5 years that he took to even get2 started.3 There's one fact question here that may make the4 rest of this rather abstract. This petitioner says that5 he never got notice of the -- of the intermediate6 appellate court's decision and he -- when he did -- I7 mean, the only gap here that's relevant for AEDPA -- the 58 years is gone. He gets that free. But the only gap we're9 talking about, as I understand it, is the 4-and-a-half10 months. And he says, as to that, I never knew. I wrote a11 letter and finally they told me, and within 3 days after I12 got notice, I filed in the next court. So, I was diligent13 from the time I knew of that decision.14 There is no -- there's been no determination by15 anybody whether that 4-and-a-half-month interval was16 beyond his control. I mean, you recognize that there17 would be an exception for situations beyond his control.18 So, how do we determine whether there was any lack of19 diligence with respect to that 4-and-a-half months? This20 record is totally blank on it.21 MR. CROSS: Your Honor, this situation is even22 more perplexing than what you set forth because there are23 three possibilities. One is that it's the 5-year period24 the California is returning to -- referring to. Another25 possibility it's just the 4-and-a-half-month. And theAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000522￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425third possibility is the combination of all of thoseperiods.          The question simply is what is meant by timelyand what is meant by properly pursuing.          QUESTION:  Well, and also I think what is meantby pending because if -- if we were -- if it weredetermined that these separate matters, as you say, beforethree different courts were pending only during the timethose particular courts had them for consideration, itmight be quite a different result than if you say look atthe reasonableness of the whole series of proceedingstogether.          MR. CROSS:  Your Honor, absolutely that iscorrect.  If we look at the language --          QUESTION:  Mr. Cross, as -- as I understand yoursubmission, it doesn't matter.  That was not the ground onwhich the Ninth Circuit decided the case, you contend.They decided it simply on the ground that the SupremeCourt of California addressed the merits.  End of case.          MR. CROSS:  Right.          QUESTION:  Right?          MR. CROSS:  The California Supreme Court holdingand the -- the problem it presents for the statute is --is that it eviscerates the statute by holding that as longas -- as the State Supreme Court addresses the merits,Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000523￼1 that regardless of the length of the delay, which could be2 not just 4-and-a-half months in this case, but 4-and-a-3 half years or 4-and-a-half decades, they will excuse the4 delay.5 QUESTION: But isn't the -- the answer that --6 your -- your friends on the other side give a -- a good7 answer. They say, look, the -- the point of requiring8 speed here is to preserve the State interest and make sure9 States don't have to retry cases years and years later and10 there's relative finality and so on.11 If the State wants to allow this kind of, in12 effect, dilatory proceeding, the State has no claim to be13 offended by it. It's in the State's power. So, if the14 State wants to give you 10 years for habeas, the State15 hasn't got any complaint. It gave the 10 years and it can16 change its rule if it wants to. What's the answer to17 that?18 MR. CROSS: Your Honor, the answer to that is19 that this is a Federal statute not a State statute. We're20 not changing the --21 QUESTION: It is a Federal statute that is keyed22 to a State statute, and the point of doing this is to23 preserve the State's interest in -- in finality in their24 own proceedings and to -- to protect the State from being25 forced, in effect, to retry cases years and years in theAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000524￼1 future after the -- the evidence has grown stale.2 MR. CROSS: That's --3 QUESTION: And if that -- if those are the4 objectives of the statute -- and I thought they were --5 then California, in effect, or any State can control the6 proceedings simply by its own time schedule.7 MR. CROSS: Your Honor, that is certainly one of8 the objectives of the statute, but there are a number of9 policy interests related to the statute of limitations10 itself which is part of AEDPA. You're absolutely correct11 in that finality is one of the three main concerns of12 AEDPA itself, but there are other concerns and policy13 concerns related to the statute itself.14 QUESTION: Mr. Cross, a State Supreme Court that15 had that attitude, that didn't care that you were late,16 would not -- would not have dismissed this case on two17 grounds, one of which is it's untimely. That's not what18 we have here. We don't have a situation in which the19 California Supreme Court said, we don't care how late it20 is; we're going to decide it on the merits. It decided on21 two grounds, one of which is you -- you are too late under22 our -- under our rules. And -- and the Ninth Circuit just23 ignored that. Isn't that right?24 MR. CROSS: That's absolutely right, Your Honor.25 QUESTION: Isn't the counter argument equallyAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 possible? A State that was really concerned about2 timeliness would not have decided the case also on the3 merits as an alternative ground. Therefore, if it does4 decide that it's significant enough to get into the5 merits, we ought to take the -- the State Supreme Court at6 its word and say, if there was a merits determination, it7 obviously8 Why isn't9was not untimely in -- in any dispositive sense.that an equally good interpretation?MR. CROSS:  I think, Your Honor, this Court has10 stated before in Coleman v. Thompson that we -- that you11 don't want to direct the State courts how to issue their12 rulings for whatever State reasons they have for doing it.13 QUESTION: No, but when the State says two14 things and they seem to be in contradiction -- if it's15 untimely, then you don't get to the merits. It's -- it's16 unreasonable in time. If you do get to the merits, it17 suggests that there is something timely about it.18 And all, I think, the Ninth Circuit was saying19 and all I'm suggesting is we're not mind readers. We20 can't say, well, we guess they really meant the first part21 of -- the first reason they gave or they really meant the22 second reason. We're simply going to come up with a --23 with a rule that everyone will understand and that the24 State courts can understand.25 And if they get to the merits, we're going toAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000525￼26￼1 deem it timely because we -- we assume these people are2 not going to be reaching merits decisions on -- on matters3 that are totally untimely under their law. Why -- why4 doesn't that respect the State courts, give a rule that5 everybody pretty much can follow and know where he stands?6 MR. CROSS: Your Honor, because it would, in7 effect, eviscerate the statute of limitations under8 Federal law. If you have unlimited tolling for 20 or 309 years, there is not much left of the 1-year Federal10 statute of limitations. And under Harris v. Reed,11 alternative --12 QUESTION: What's left is a 1-year Federal13 statute of limitations after the conclusion of the State14 proceedings, and if the State proceedings were begun in a15 timely fashion, I don't know what else the statute is16 supposed to accomplish.17 MR. CROSS: Well, Your Honor, the statute --18 statutory schemes across the country -- there's a wide19 variety, of which there are over 20 States that have no20 statute of limitations.21 QUESTION: Do you know how the California22 Supreme Court operates generally with respect to petitions23 of this kind, post-conviction petitions? Is it common for24 them to say on the merits, but anyway it's untimely, or do25 they often say it's untimely, that's the end of it withoutAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

CROSS:  It's usually a combination, YourHonor.  There's in fact, a dispute between the members ofthe California Supreme Court as to whether to even poseprocedural bars.  Justice Brown has argued that it onlyshould be addressed on the merits.  So, there's acombination usually or sometimes just a denial on themerits.          If you don't mind, Your Honor, I'd like toreserve the remainder of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Cross.          Mr. Ogden, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. OGDEN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. OGDEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          I would like to go directly to the two mostdifficult questions that I need to answer this morning andwhich have been addressed extensively thus far.          First, that the rule adopted by the -- by theunanimous courts of appeals that any gaps between stagesof the State habeas process should be tolled so long asthe next stage is initiated in a timely fashion shouldapply to California.And second --Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000528￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  What happens if it -- go on.  Give usyour second --          MR. OGDEN:  And -- and the second point that I'dlike to address is that under that rule on the record inthis case, there is an insufficient basis to conclude thatthe filing in the State Supreme Court was late andtherefore that the judgment below should be affirmed.          QUESTION:  Are you going to cover the questionof whether these various actions were pending and for howlong?          MR. OGDEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's the first-- that's -- that's the first subject that I'd like tocover because I know that one of the concerns and one ofthe difficulties of this case is applying the concepts ofthe statute to California's unique system.          Now, California's system of original writ shouldbe subject to the rule that tolls the entire period oftime for two reasons.  First, that is the bestunderstanding of the text of the statute becauseCalifornia's system --          QUESTION:  The text of AEDPA or the text ofCalifornia's statute?          MR. OGDEN:  Of AEDPA, Your Honor, of -- ofsection 2244(d)(2).          Because California's system functions as anAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000513 meaning14 long as15 phrases16 review.17of the statute is simply a request for relief soit is submitted in the context of, as the statuteit, State post-conviction or other collateralNow, that request for relief is distinct from 18 the claims that support it, and it is pending so long as19 it -- as it is unresolved in the State system.20 QUESTION: You -- you say the -- the application21 is distinct from the claim. Granted, both words -- how22 does that work out?23 MR. OGDEN: The claims are the arguments that24 support the request for relief in -- in a habeas or post-25 conviction context. Typically the request is to beAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000529￼1 integrated appellate style process for prisoners seeking2 to exhaust State remedies.3 And second, because just as in other States, the4 so-called gap theory espoused by the State would5 discourage prisoners from making full use of California's6 process and encourage premature Federal filings.7 Now, turning to the text of the statute -- and8 Justice Scalia asked about the -- about the word9 application in particular -- Congress wrote a statute in10 general terms intended to apply nationwide. It does not11 turn on the particular form of pleading or the nature of12 the action. To the contrary, an application within the30￼1 released from an unconstitutional confinement. That2 request is supported by -- by a set of claims. And -- and3 it's the request that constitutes the application.4 QUESTION: But, you know, we were confronted5 with precisely the same argument in Artuz which dealt with6 what constitutes a properly filed application. And the7 argument was if the claim is not a proper claim, if it8 does not lie under the State law, it is not a properly9 filed application. And we held, no, that's not so. An10 application is an application and a claim is -- is a11 claim. And the -- the application is properly filed so12 long as it's given to the -- you know, to the proper clerk13 in the proper court and -- and so forth. Now, dealing14 with the very same -- very same provision of law.15 MR. OGDEN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe my16 argument is entirely consistent with Artuz. Indeed, it's17 -- it's really based on the reasoning there.18 Artuz makes a distinction between bars that go19 to claims and bars that go to the form of the -- of the20 application itself. My submission is that the application21 is the request for relief, that is, regardless of what22 form it takes and what kind of proceeding, it is a request23 that contains claims in the same way that an application24 contains claims. A request is an application. And that25 request, the request for relief, continues to be pendingAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000510 with, you11 thing.1213 different14 functions15 development is required, quite naturally, is that that16 claim should be brought in the superior court.17 As we say in our brief, if you attempt to file18 an original petition initially in a higher court and19 factual development is required, typically if it's a non-20 capital case, what that court will do is to issue an order21 to show cause, returnable in the superior court. And once22 you are there as a -- as a petitioner, if you lose, your23 only recourse for further review is to file an original24 petition yet again above.25 Now, critically from the standpoint ofAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

App. 3d at801 to 802; People against Singer, which is 226 Cal.

Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000537￼1 been a prior petition there and the same claims are2 brought in the next court is a process of reviewing the3 record, and where what is presented are findings of fact4 by the superior court that are based on credibility5 determinations, great weight is given to those credibility6 determinations by the reviewing court. And -- and that is7 the -- the fundamental functionality, the way the system8 works.9 It can be used in other ways without question.10 A petitioner can attempt to file, you know, claims at a11 higher level.12 QUESTION: You've practiced here a lot. I mean,13 if the -- if the superior court decision in a State habeas14 matter is a final decision and there's no more review of15 it in the State, I guess then we have jurisdiction to16 review that. But I have never seen someone come here17 directly from the decision of the superior court of18 California in a State habeas matter. Maybe they just19 haven't thought of it.20 MR.

If you still25 have State remedies available, we wouldn't issue FederalAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000538￼1 habeas.

OGDEN: I think it sheds substantial light17 on it, Your Honor, because as was made clear in Duncan18 against Walker by this Court, the very purpose of this19 tolling provision is to facilitate and to, indeed, promote20 the full and complete exhaustion of State remedies.21 QUESTION: Okay. Well, let me ask you this.22 Suppose that a -- a prisoner has filed in California for23 State post-conviction review in the superior court and24 then in the court of appeals and then makes no filing in25 the State supreme court, could but years go by. ThenAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000539￼1 there's a petition filed for habeas in the Federal court.2 Now, the Federal court under your view presumably would3 have to say, no, it's still pending in the State court.4 MR. OGDEN: I believe the appropriate course for5 the Federal court in that situation --6 QUESTION: What would you do?7 MR. OGDEN: -- would be to apply this Court's8 decision in O'Sullivan against Boerckel and deem the9 petition to be unexhausted. At that point, the petitioner10 could apply to the California Supreme Court.11 QUESTION: And say it is unexhausted and -- and12 the -- a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run.13 MR. OGDEN: Because simply it's unknowable. You14 asked the question earlier whether -- who decides whether15 it's a reasonable time or not, and I think it's very clear16 the design of the statute of -- of 2244(d)(2) is that the17 State of California decides. Whether something continues18 to be pending in exhaustion law is a question of whether19 it is possible whether there is a -- an available20 procedure under State law to raise the claim to a higher21 level.22 QUESTION: Okay. Let's -- let's continue that23 hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives. There's a long24 wait, years of wait. They go to the -- the prisoner goes25 to the California Supreme Court.

Wewill not rule on the merits.  Dismissed.  When does theFederal statute -- how does the Federal statute applythere?          MR. OGDEN:  That implicates a -- a circuit splitthat's not presented in this case, Your Honor.  There is adifference of opinion among the circuits about how toapply the -- the endpoint of -- of the tolling process.In the majority of circuits, tolling terminates at thepoint it is no longer possible to file a --          QUESTION:  What is the position that you urgeupon us here in that instance?          MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor, I don't believe it's --it is important for my client what the answer to thatquestion is because the second point I want to make thismorning is that the submission to the California SupremeCourt was not late under California law.          QUESTION:  I'm trying to -- I'm trying tointerpret the statute, and so I imagined this case and Iwant to know how it would come out --          MR. OGDEN:  I think the most --          QUESTION:  -- under your view.          MR. OGDEN:  I'm sorry.  I think the most naturalinterpretation of the statute is the majority of thecourt's view which is that it continues to be pendingAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000541￼1 until it is too late to file a submission, and then the2 opportunity to file -- if you file for leave to file out3 of time, that would then resume the tolling if that motion4 were granted. In California, that --5 QUESTION: Retroactively. I mean, there's a6 split. There are real problems and -- and those problems,7 as well as the problems with the California system, seem8 to me good reason to read the statute the way it's written9 so that there has to be an application pending, not -- not10 a case pending, but an application. On appeal, it could11 be the application of either the petitioner or the12 government if it lost, but the only time counted is the --13 is the time during the pending application. Then you14 would not have to worry about these problems. What15 happens if they accept a -- you know, a late petition?16 Does it automatically toll retroactively for the -- for17 the period after the due date and so forth?18 MR. OGDEN: Your Honor --19 QUESTION: None of those problems exist if you20 -- if you say it's pending when it's pending.21 MR. OGDEN: I think those problems are more22 complicated in a system like California's or North23 Carolina's which is an appellate system that involves an24 unreasonable delay standard than they are in a -- in a25 system that has clear time lines. And California andAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000542￼1 North Carolina, if they don't like the way it's playing2 out under their provisions, can simply create time3 lines --4 QUESTION: Mr. Ogden --5 QUESTION: Just so -- just so I understand your6 answer. In the case that I put that I didn't quite get7 the whole -- the California court says, you've waited 48 years. That's too late. How do I apply the statute of9 limitations to that context or the pending rule that we're10 discussing?11 MR. OGDEN: I -- I believe there are about three12 different ways that you can --13 QUESTION: And what is -- what is your14 submission as to how we ought to interpret the rule in15 that instance?16 MR. OGDEN: My submission would be that until17 the California Supreme Court indicates how long the time18 period is that -- that he would have had to file, the best19 thing to do is to look to evidence of other cases that20 have been decided by California to determine what is an21 acceptable gap in the process.22 And that's why in this case the evidence is23 absolutely overwhelming that the 4-and-a-half-month period24 that the State relies on simply wasn't the basis for the25 California Supreme Court's decision.Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000543￼1 QUESTION: How is that? It seems to me the2 record is a blank on that, and with all this talk, if you3 don't count those 4-and-a-half months, he's timely no --4 no matter whether it's discrete applications. So, what do5 we do? He says, I never got that notice. And it's not6 established in the record whether he did or he didn't.7 MR. OGDEN: Well, the only evidence in the8 record is that he did not. He submitted a sworn statement9 to that effect in the California Supreme Court in his10 petition.11 But as the Ninth Circuit said, there are two12 possible bases for the lack of diligence finding in the13 record. One is 5 years before he filed his initial claim.14 The other is this 4-and-a-half-month period in which he15 says and swears that he did not receive notice.16 The -- when you look at the record of the minute17 orders that have been entered by California on the very18 day and in the very weeks -- the California Supreme Court19 -- around when Mr. Saffold's case was dismissed, you see20 that cases -- for example, the Davis case. There was an21 18-month gap between the decision in the court of appeal22 and the petition in the California Supreme Court, and the23 California Supreme Court simply denied it, which under the24 Ylst standard, looking through, goes back to the merits25 determination before. No lack of diligence, noAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000544￼1 untimeliness.2 In the Sampson case, over 9 months had elapsed3 between the court of appeal decision and the supreme court4 decision. Again, absolutely no indication of a lack of5 diligence or untimeliness.6 In the Viegas case, over 7 months elapsed7 between the court of appeal and the decision -- and the8 petition. No explanation from Mr. Viegas, as there wasn't9 from Davis and nothing meaningful from Sampson for the10 delay again. And the Saenz case is another.11 So, there are those four --12 QUESTION: Is -- is there any -- some13 possibility that those perhaps inconsistent rulings coming14 from the Supreme Court of California might be based on15 what Mr. Cross referred to as the division of opinion16 within that court as to whether they should give any sort17 of an explanation?18 MR. OGDEN: Your Honor, I think anything is19 possible because, as -- as somebody said, we're in a mind-20 reading mode here, and so certainly that's possible. And21 I can't stand here and tell you it is impossible that they22 simply acted in an -- in an irrational and inconsistent23 fashion.24 The fact is while Mr. Saffold submitted a -- an25 explanation which, at least on the surface, has someAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 appeal to it, none of these others did, and yet much2 longer periods of time --3 QUESTION: That's not the basis on which the4 Ninth Circuit decided the case. It did not resolve5 whether, you know, the 4-and-a-half or the other one. It6 -- it did not do it. It just simply said, since the7 Supreme Court of California alternatively addressed the8 merits, that's the end of it. And so you're -- you're not9 defending 10their basis for -- for deciding the case?MR. OGDEN:  I think it's somewhat unclear whatCircuit's basis was, Your Honor.  I concedethe extent that the Ninth Circuit held that a --11 the Ninth12 that. To13 a ruling on the merits would trump a clear finding by the14 -- by the California Supreme Court that the petition to it15 was untimely, I think that would be an -- an incorrect16 interpretation of the statute. That's my view.17 QUESTION: What would you say to the possibility18 that we might19 Supreme Court20 was untimely?21 MR.22 whether the case was dismissed based on the gap between23 the court of appeal and the supreme court as opposed to24 the -- the portion that preceded the original filing in25 the -- in the trial court which obviously could not makeAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

OGDEN: 11 courts of appeals have considered47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425judge decided it, i.e., an appeal, quotes, in any othersuperior court, but I can do it in a higher court.  Am Iright?  Because they'll treat it as successive if I go tothe parallel level, but if I go to the next level, theywon't treat it as successive.          MR. OGDEN:  That's my understanding.          QUESTION:  But then if in fact I wait too long,I'm beyond a reasonable time.          MR. OGDEN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And so, to put in terms of exhausted,unexhausted as if he did -- as he did, you'd say the onlyunexhausted remedy you have left to you, once you're inthe superior court, is to go up, as long as you do itwithin a reasonable time.  But once you exceed thereasonable time, you're out.          MR. OGDEN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right.  So, what we would have tosay is that that system, looking to the exhausted insteadof the technical word appeal, we'd get to approximatelythe same place, and then our issue would be, well, wasthis beyond a reasonable time or not.  And then I'd haveto say maybe we don't know.  We'd have to find out in someway or other.  That -- that --          MR. OGDEN:  Well, I think the generaldescription is fine and I think it's true that we don'tAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000548￼1 know whether it was considered unreasonable by the2 California Supreme Court.3 QUESTION: I mean, I can't see how we can accept4 the Ninth Circuit's reasoning frankly because they said5 the very fact that they say both, the very fact that they6 say we'll consider it on the merits but it's untimely,7 that that means that it wasn't untimely. Of course, they8 didn't use the word untimely. They used a different word9 which is harder to understand.10 MR. OGDEN: Your Honor, I think that we -- it's11 -- while we don't know, I think that a fair reading of12 this record would lead one to the conclusion that it was13 not the 4-and-a-half months. When we have four other14 cases, two of them decided the same day, one of them15 decided --16 QUESTION: But it's way beyond what any other17 State would have, isn't it? 4-and-a-half months? Unless18 there's some excuse here that he didn't get the record or19 he didn't know about it.20 MR. OGDEN: Well, North Carolina has an undue21 delay standard. Massachusetts, until just very recently,22 as the First Circuit explained in the Curry case just last23 week, previously had no time limit, has now imposed a 30-24 day time limit presumably to deal with some of these25 problems. The times in other States vary. 4-and-a-halfAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

OGDEN:  The Federal magistrate, yes, Your-- in this case applying the Federal duestandard.  Mr. Saffold suggested that the timetolled for -- for the running of the entire21 I think looking at the face -- at the -- at the22 joint appendix at 38, looking at the face of the23 application Mr. Saffold submitted to the California24 Supreme Court where he attempts to justify the 5 years on25 that basis and notes, with respect to the 4-and-a-halfAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000549￼1 months is -- is somewhat longer than the certiorari time2 in this Court, but it's not by an entire order of3 magnitude. And the point is that the California Supreme4 Court routinely seems to reach the merits despite this5 period.6 And in this case we have a 5-year delay staring7 us in the face in which the only justification offered by8 Mr. Saffold was that he needed to hire a private9 investigator to -- essentially to interview the jurors.10 The magistrate judge in this case, applying the due50￼1 months, that he only received notice the very day he2 filed, the only reasonable interpretation is that they3 relied on the 5 years, a period of time irrelevant to the4 question of whether review in the supreme court was5 unavailable. And therefore, it is -- it is -- it would be6 unreasonable for this Court to suppose that -- that the7 period was the 4-and-a-half months.8 This is somewhat similar to the approach to9 questions of -- of -- related to procedural bars that this10 Court adopted and modified in the Coleman against Thompson11 case where -- where an underlying State decision leaves12 reason to question whether the Federal bar is applicable,13 this Court has gone ahead and decided the -- the merits of14 the Federal claim because it's entirely within the power15 of the State, the State of California or in the Coleman v.16 Thompson circumstance, to be clear about the fact that17 what was the period and when did it expire, or18 alternatively, simply like most States, to have a clear,19 definable period of time in which --20 QUESTION: Didn't the -- didn't the superior21 court here, or at least the magistrate did, made a22 specific finding to the effect that the 4-month delay was23 not excusable, that it was an excessive delay? Wasn't24 there that finding below?25 MR. OGDEN: The magistrate did not find that heAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000551￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425received notice earlier than he says.  What the magistratesaid was that he should have been more diligent in callingthe court and contacting them and so forth.          QUESTION:  But it was a finding that the 4-month period was the -- was a period of inexcusable delay.          MR. OGDEN:  He indicated -- suggested that hewould not --          QUESTION:  So, to say that that couldn't havebeen what the supreme court was thinking of strikes me asimplausible.          MR. OGDEN:  Your Honor, I'm not saying that itcouldn't be.  I'm saying it's far less likely that it was.          QUESTION:  But that wasn't reviewed by the NinthCircuit.          MR. OGDEN:  No.  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit leftopen the question of equitable tolling which depends onthat -- on that fact.  And furthermore, again, it doesn'tgo to whether he received notice.  It's simply the opinionof the magistrate that he should have called the court orsent a letter to the court or done something within that4-and-a-half-month period.          QUESTION:  I do -- I do want, if I can, veryquickly to get to the question that Mr. Cross said wasvery difficult and you raise it at pages 24 and 25 of yourAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000552￼1 brief. You say what -- what happens if the -- under the2 theory that the petitioner proposes, if the State files an3 appeal when the State has lost. And the Chief Justice4 said, well, that shouldn't be a problem because we can5 then easily say that the application is still pending.6 How long does the State have to appeal generally?7 MR. OGDEN: I believe it's 30 days in8 California.9 QUESTION: So, then -- so, then it seems to me10 that isn't a problem. A, it's just 30 days, and B, you11 can say that it's still pending. So, that's not a big12 problem.13 Mr. Cross, whose right of rebuttal we've14 demolished, so I can't ask him, has said that that's a15 very hard question.16 MR. OGDEN: Well, I think it's a very hard17 question for him because his -- his gap theory taken to18 its literal extreme, taken to -- to the application that19 it would -- that -- that gaps are not tolled, even in a --20 an appeals situation, would cause that entire period of21 time on the State's clock to run.22 QUESTION: But why can't we easily say the23 application is pending so long as the State has an24 appeal --25 MR. OGDEN: Well, that --Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000553￼1 QUESTION: -- prevail?2 MR. OGDEN: That would -- that would undermine3 the so-called gap theory in every State but -- but4 California where typically you do have appeals on both5 sides. In California, you have a State appeal and a6 functional appeal on the petitioner's side. And so, the7 argument could be made -- I think it's a hyper-technical8 argument. I think it's an argument that's inconsistent9 with the purpose of this statute, but you could make the10 hyper-technical argument that because California gives11 unequal rights to the two sides, an appeal on the one hand12 and a functional appeal on the other, we're going to treat13 the functional appeal in a different way for Federal14 purposes.15 I would submit there is no way that Congress16 intended to take a functional appeal that has the purpose17 of -- of presenting claims that are required for18 exhaustion and said, we want to treat that differently19 because it's merely a functional appeal, not a real20 appeal. That makes no sense.21 All of the reasons why tolling should apply in22 the gaps prescribed by the State, the period the State23 believes is appropriate for the presentation of these24 claims, the period the State believes prisoners should25 have in order to prepare and present their claims, thatAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000554￼1 we're not going to toll that, the consequence of that will2 be that petitioners will not wait for the transcript.3 They will file their -- their motions in the -- in the4 court of appeal without transcripts. They will not5 develop their arguments well, and then those arguments6 will finally be made for the first time effectively in the7 Federal court. That is not what was intended by the8 statute.9 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Ogden.10 Mr. Cross, you have 1 minute remaining.11 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. CROSS12 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER13 MR. CROSS: I think the answer to Mr. Ogden,14 Your Honor, is that the reason would be that Congress was15 concerned about undue delay. In the last 10 years before16 AEDPA was passed, over 80 bills were attempted to -- to17 deal with this problem. And lack of diligence by18 petitioners was the main concern of Congress, and they19 dealt with that by writing into the statute the following20 phrase. 2244(d)(2) at page 3 of the blue brief. Quote,21 the time during which a properly filed application for22 State post-conviction or other collateral review with23 respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending24 shall not be counted toward any limitation under this25 subsection.

They chose application for the reason thatJustice Scalia was talking about.  They were concernedthat there would be undue delay in between applications.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Cross.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
