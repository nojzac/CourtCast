Mr. Machat?ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MACHAT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:This case concerns whether or not a defendant in a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of that affirmative defense.Now, here are four reasons why that should not be the case. In the first place, if that is the case it would render the defense useless, because if there is no likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark infringement? Second -­CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You agree with Judge Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 4003Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005MR. MACHAT: Yes.1 Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the2 burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.3 There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to4 prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a5 defendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove6 the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence7 of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of8 a burden. You have to prove, first of all -­9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In this case, did the10 plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer11 confusion?12 MR. MACHAT: This was a motion for summary13 judgement.14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there anything in the15 affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer16 confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?17 MR. MACHAT: Yeah, actually, the record does18 contain some references to confusion. The -- in this19 case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did20 have some people that actually were confused. And when21 that happens, you need to look at what is causing the22 confusion. And essentially -­23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it might make it￼24 necessary for a25 avoid some kind1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400defendant in such a situation, in order to of summary judgement, to also offer4Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't2 any.3 MR. MACHAT: Well, but that's shifting the4 issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of5 confusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is6 even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of7 the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any8 resulting confusion.9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is it possible that10 showing consumer confusion could be considered by the11 court on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair?12 MR. MACHAT: Well, the thing is, a lot of times13 when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or14 the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the15 confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the16 fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used17 descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements￼18 are being 1920 confusion21 elements of the fair-use -­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm interested in23 Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to24 whether or not the use is in good faith and it's onlymet.The confusion does not go to the likelihood of issue; rather, it goes to the individual25 discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's1111 14th Street NW, Suite 4005Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly2 infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith3 assessment?4 In other words, suppose that it were shown that5 the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged6 infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used7 the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion.8 Would that -­9 MR. MACHAT: Yes -- well, that would show an10 absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the11 elements of the fair-use defense.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so that if you know13 that there's going to be confusion, there is no good14 faith? You wouldn't go that far.15 MR. MACHAT: No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a16 balancing Test and that's why it says "fairly and in good17 faith," and you have to look at how descriptive the word18 is, in particular.19 For instance, if you're using the word "best" -­20 as in "best buy" or "best foods" -- I mean, best is an21 extremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further22 in claiming, "Hey, I have the best -- I have the best23 food," or, you know, "Come to my store. I have the best24 buy." And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one25 of the risks that -­￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 4006Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is it your position2 that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter3 how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is4 that your position?5 MR. MACHAT: No, I wouldn't go that far, because6 you also have to look at the objective use.7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would have thought that8 consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness;9 perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the10 issue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position,11 do they not?12 MR. MACHAT: Well, I think -- I was reading the13 amici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion,14 as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at15 whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not16 the term is being used as a mark or not. The same17 evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a18 likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the19 case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the20 case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair­21 use defense have been -- have been met.22 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What did -- what did23 the district court do here? Did it grant summary24 judgement or deny summary judgement?25 MR. MACHAT: The -- well, the district court￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 4007Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found2 that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that3 my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to4 describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good5 faith. The Ninth Circuit -­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district court -- the7 district court -- this way --8 [Laughter.]9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- seemed to focus on the use10 of the word "micro color," just the word. It didn't bring11 up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears12 where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears13 in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the14 district court said you could use "micro color" as you had15 been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized16 1999 new brochure. So -­17 MR. MACHAT: Yes, that is correct. The district18 court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that19 use in 1999.￼JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it might not have been just by using the word. But when you're using logo-like appearance, maybe that's different. MR. MACHAT: Well, in the abstract case, it2021 confusion22 it in the2324 could be.25 because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page1111 14th Street NW, Suite 4008Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005I would argue, though, in this case it's not,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate to the reason for which we took this case.MR. MACHAT: Correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied "fairly and in good faith" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I understand it, the only question we have before us is whether the "fairly and in good faith" provision is an exception even when there is confusion.MR. MACHAT: Yes, I would agree.JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.MR. MACHAT: Yes, I think -­JUSTICE BREYER: So as far as -­MR. MACHAT: -- I think we're both saying thesame thingJUSTICE BREYER: So as far as Justice O'Connor'squestion is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 4009Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair,2 it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to3 that?4 MR. MACHAT: No, I agree.5 JUSTICE BREYER: No. So your answer to her6 question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the7 other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't8 have to show that there is no confusion.9 1011 right? 121314MR. MACHAT: Absolutely.JUSTICE BREYER: That's where we are, is thatMR. MACHAT: That's exactly -­JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.MR. MACHAT: -- where we are.JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you give us a -- I'd be sympathetic to your case if I could readily1516 much more17 envision a situation where there is confusion but,18 nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a19 clear example.20 MR. MACHAT: In my particular case? This -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I mean, make up one -­22 MR. MACHAT: Okay.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's really clear.24 MR. MACHAT: Let's use the words "best buy."25 Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40010Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, "Mark's,2 he has the best buy." He wants to advertise on radio,3 "Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for4 the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's," and5 he keeps using those words "best buy."6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there's any7 likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean -­8 MR. MACHAT: Well -­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what if he just takes out an10 ad that says, "Best Buy," exclamation point? That would11 be closer.12 MR. MACHAT: Okay, in that case there would be13 confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using "best14 buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore,15 he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair­16 use defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes17 up, it comes up in the case that -­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to make it that19 in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type20 at the beginning of the piece, "Best Buy," exclamation21 point. That means it's a trademark?22 MR. MACHAT: Well, it would be evidence that it23 is a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the24 words "best buy" were in relation to the word "Mark's25 Electronics."￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40011Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but if you had a2 -- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, "Great3 Sale," that surely is not a trademark, just because you4 have it in boldfaced print.5 MR. MACHAT: I agree, it's not necessarily a6 trademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad,7 and you have to look at what the person is trying to use8 to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the9 products, 1011 that says12 and a capital "F," then it's arguably being used as a13 trademark.14 MR. MACHAT: Well -­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whereas, if you say in a16 brochure, "Rent a car from us, and park and fly," then17 that's okay. Is that the distinction?18 MR. MACHAT: Yes, but I'd go even further and19 say that the -- if you had a big sign that said "Park `n20 Fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not21 necessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like,22 "Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly," I would say23 that's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue24 differently in that case.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth -- the Ninthor, in this case, the store.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if you have a sign "Park `n Fly" and an arrow, with a capital "P"￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40012Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on2 the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at3 the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to4 recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the5 alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause6 confusion 78 know that9 obliged to show likelihood of confusion."or to cause mistake or to deceive.So this opinion starts out by saying, "Yes, we under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is10 MR. MACHAT: They do it. But then on -- if you11 look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion,12 the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle13 paragraph, "As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis14 only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood15 of customer confusion analysis." And then they quote from￼16 Transgo, and they17 use a term in its18 such use does notsay -- explain that "anyone is free to primary descriptive sense as long as result in consumer confusion as to the19 source of 2021 expanding22 words. Essentially what they're saying is -­23 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, they go further24 in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer25 to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40013Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005goods."In effect, what they're doing is, they'rethe rights of trademark-holders of descriptive1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.MR. MACHAT: Right, and that's -- that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion.JUSTICE GINSBURG: They do have one authority for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think they're right about that.MR. MACHAT: Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense.MR. MACHAT: Well, there are other treatise writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if - even if there is likelihood of confusion.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So does the -- what is it -­ the unfair competition restatement?MR. MACHAT: Yes, that takes a similar position, as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the same time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the confusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is being caused because the person with the words in question is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion.￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40014Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 If -- there's certain -- there's certain -­2 there's certain terms and words that Congress has said3 never get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of4 course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never5 get trademark protection in their primary descriptive6 sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in7 their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove8 secondary meaning.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought we're dealing10 with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning11 would be assumed.12 MR. MACHAT: Yes. In the case of an13 incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed;14 however, that still does not take away the burden of the15 holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of16 confusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches17 only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the18 primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question.19 And one other quick example. The laws say you20 cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have21 12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on22 their ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone23 will say, "I want the ice cream with the flag on it." But24 they all have a flag on it. That's another example where25 Congress said, "We will tolerate confusion." Sometimes we￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40015Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so business owners are free to describe their goods to consumers.And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Machat. Now, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of acase where there might be confusion, but there would still be a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold.And this Court held, as a matter of the common law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair, truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result.There are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe Scale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus Clark case.￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40016Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes2 its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and3 that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly,4 Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to5 your questions about, what does a fairness component of6 this test in the statute mean.7 There is not a general requirement that the -­8 say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but9 the non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what10 Congress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can11 see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief12 -- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -­13 putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the14 product.15 That is not some sort of general equitable16 receptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what17 the defendant did and how they acted in describing.18 That's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the19 defendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner,20 Canal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at.21 In common parlance, in a common dictionary22 meaning, when you talk about fairly describing something,23 that's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate,24 reasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to25 describe a product. One could reasonably --￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40017Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does -- does consumer2 -- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the3 plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?4 MS. MILLETT: Not by itself, no, Justice5 O'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense,6 and that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is7 being used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you8 could explain that that demonstrates that it's being used9 as a mark. It might show that you're not objectively,10 reasonably, accurately describing your product.11 If I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's12 a -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I13 can't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, in the Coco-quinine15 case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine16 without using the particular term, and then he decides,17 "you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm18 going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do19 that just in order to get more customers away from the20 trademark-holder." Is that good faith?21 MS. MILLETT: Yes, because there's nothing, in22 the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business23 and to do better and to use descriptive terms24 descriptively to do that. The good-faith -­25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -­￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40018Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 MS. MILLETT: -- continued here -­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what if he intends to3 increase his market share precisely by causing the4 confusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element,5 wouldn't it?6 MS. MILLETT: The good-faith element is, do I7 intend -- it depends on what you mean by "causing8 confusion." If I intend to freeload or ride or exploit9 the secondary -­10 11 12 1314 trademark15 component.16 JUSTICE SCALIA:17 MS. MILLETT: If18 showing that consumer confusion could result, or that I19 hope consumers will pause and think about, you know, "what20 -- what's in the -- what am I now being offered in theJUSTICE KENNEDY: MS.

MILLETT: -- if there's confusion, that's abad-­JUSTICE STEVENS: What does the term "micro color" describe?MS. MILLETT: The term "micro color" describes -- this is not my area of expertise, but -- describes, as I understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent make-up process. And the reason it's called "micro color" --JUSTICE STEVENS: Does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the -- one party's product in this case?MS. MILLETT: I wouldn't begin to know whether other professions or occupations use the term "micro color." But my understanding, from the record, is that the color is obvious. That's -- it's different color inks.And the reason that they use the term "micro" -­ and this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of the joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these inks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's micron-size.And so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40020Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 petitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term2 "micro color."3 Now, "micro" is a common term that's -- common4 descriptive term in its own right. It appears in many5 contexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all6 familiar with. Medical devices often will refer to7 "micro." But "micro color" -­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there -- wasn't there9 something to the effect that "micro pigmentation" is a10 synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another11 name for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has "micro" in12 it, "micro pigmentation."13 MS. MILLETT: That's my understanding, yes.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Micro pigmentation" sounds15 awfully close to "micro color."16 MS. MILLETT: "Micro color," yeah. That's my17 understanding. Again, I don't really want to weigh in on18 one side of the dispute or the other on the merits of19 whether "micro color" is a generic or a -­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to weigh in on21 it. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me,22 if you think that side should win, that the words are23 being used in a descriptive sense. And if "micro color"24 doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they25 associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40021Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 lose.2 MS. MILLETT: But, Justice Scalia, the problem3 here is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them4 lose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe5 their product, or not that they failed to act in good6 faith, or not that they were using this as a trademark,7 butthatitwasa-­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right, that's not the9 issue in the case.10 MS. MILLETT: Right. Right. And my11 understanding -- again, the record shows that, in fact,12 the descriptive use of this was conceded in this case, and13 that's on14 the joint15 16page 29a of the petition appendix, and also in appendix on 152.JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right.MS. MILLETT: But, again, our concern is that￼17 this statute has to be read with the terms Congress18 enacted. Congress drew a balance here. Congress struck19 the balance between allowing -- giving unprecedented20 protection that this Court recognized in "Park 'n Fly" to21 descriptive terms, but policing the line between the22 secondary meaning that attaches to descriptive terms and23 the -- reserving for the marketplace, for competition, the24 availability of descriptive terms in their original25 descriptive sense.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40022Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances -­MS. MILLETT: Exactly.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.MS. MILLETT: Exactly.JUSTICE SCALIA: And if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.MS. MILLETT: That's exactly right. There's a tradeoff. When you pick a descriptive term, you get right up front, right up front, the immediate appeal and resonance of a term to the -- to the consumers. "Best buy." Who wouldn't want the best buy? I want the best buy. "Chunky" candy bars. It's going to be easier to break into the marketplace with "Chunky" candy bars or "Almond Joy" candy bars, because consumers will have a￼sense--bars. don'tof what they're getting, than if you come in with aJUSTICE SCALIA: "Schwartz," "Schwartz" candy1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40023Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005MS. MILLETT: "Schwartz" candy bar, "Kodak," I knowJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't do anything for you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425[Laughter.]MS. MILLETT: I don't know why that is, and why would I want to eat it. They're going to have to do more work. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said, Justice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms out of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words.And if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair, in the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as this Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe Scale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg versus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case, if it's apt and accurate, that's what "used fairly" means.And if its satisfies that objective test, and if it satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's notused as that -­a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, becauseJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you tell whether it's a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems￼used asto be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as a mark, then there is a violation.MS. MILLETT: The fair-use defense is unavailable if it's used as a mark. There are other --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.MS. MILLETT: -- defenses that are available, but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40024Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That's correct.The way you prove whether something is used as amark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end. When something is used as a mark, that means it is signifying to the origin or source of those goods in the marketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling you who is making it or who is putting it out on the market.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as they're using just the word "micro color," I see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. But what about when they use something that looks like a mark?MS. MILLETT: Well, there's -- there's going to be difficult questions of proof. Our position is that, by taking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign everybody else to ten point Times New Roman font, and that they can do some colorful display, but not a mark.￼Millett.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANNON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40025Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 please the Court:2 Defendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is3 contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of4 the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to5 Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that6 someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this7 defense does not apply only to descriptive terms.8 Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be9 available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive10 marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a11 mark. Indeed, our mark here is not --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you13 descriptively? I mean, I think that's14 an arbitrary or fanciful term, that it15 anything.use a fanciful term the definition of doesn't mean￼16 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, it may17 different context, I think an example you could use would18 be the arbitrary trademark of "Apple" for computers.19 There could be advertising for Computer Electronics,20 Incorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school21 rush, using the term "Apple" in a descriptive sense:22 "Apples for Teachers," you know, the beginning of the23 year, "Come to our store."24 So, in reliance on that, you drive two hours25 because you're the school district director who needs to1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40026Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005mean something in a1 buy ten new computers to hook into the system. You get2 there, it turns out they're not Apple Computers.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but do they use the apple4 as clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning,5 that's what gives it protection. But if you have an6 arbitrary term, as Justice Scalia says, how could that be,7 how could the defense have any relevance to a fanciful or8 arbitrary term. And I thought the defense only was9 relevant when you -- everybody agrees you're talking about10 descriptive terms?11 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, the Solicitor12 General does not take that position either, in their brief13 they recognize that this applies to all level of mark.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that, all we need to15 decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive.16 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, the Ninth17 Circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive,18 or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as19 was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be20 found in the English language anywhere, it doesn't21 describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests￼22 the small23 used when2425 descriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply?1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40027Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005nature and the fine lines that are ultimately this is applied.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that it was1 That you would have to show absence of confusion before2 you raised the good faith defense?3 MS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that's what the4 Ninth Circuit test does, this was a summary judgment5 entered against us when we had introduced -­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you agree, then,7 that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non­8 trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the9 fair-use defense without having to show that there's no10 confusion?11 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, we believe it's the12 plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden13 to show likelihood of confusion. The point is, under the14 district court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence15 in this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment16 was entered against us because the district court took17 Petitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance18 whatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination19 of fair use, that's the rule in the Ninth Circuit overall,20 and that's what needs to be affirmed.21 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm confused. I thought22 the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the23 blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of24 confusion. And I guess now you agree the answer to that25 question is "no." Is that right, you agree with that?￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40028Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the end of this3 case, isn't it? That's what we took it to decide, and4 that's -- you agree with it and they agree with it, so5 everybody's happy. We don't even have to write an6 opinion, we can just--7 MS. BRINKMANN: I believe the Petitioner came up8 with that formulation because they had taken on the burden9 because they were the movant on summary judgment. That's10 where that misnomer came from.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you object to the12 formulation of the question presented? Here's the13 question, "Does the classic fair-use defense to trademark14 infringement require the party asserting the defense to15 demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion?" That's16 the question. And you say, "no."17 MS. BRINKMANN: We agree that the plaintiff,18 it's clear that under - in the Ninth Circuit - the Ninth19 Circuit pointed out that, Justice Ginsburg quoted before,20 made clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of21 establishing likelihood of confusion.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose you establish it,23 maybe we can find some differences here, would you also24 agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to25 overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40029Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 that the confusion, along with possibly other things are2 such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word,3 unfairness, or lack of good faith?4 MS. BRINKMANN: We believe that when Congress -5 JUSTICE BREYER: You agree with that, or not?6 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, we agree that7 when Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms8 "used fairly" to refer to the common law, which included9 not only the common law of technical trademark, but the10 common law of unfair competition.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Good, so now we have something12 I can disagree with you about. Now, the question would13 be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show14 there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or15 quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome16 their defense that they put here?17 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the time that those18 words were used, the common law, and we respectfully19 disagree with the Solicitor General's office on the20 reading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that. The21 reason the Court allowed the use of the term in that case22 is because they quite clearly said it did not have a23 secondary meaning. There is no trademark protection for24 descriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in25 complete agreement with that. We're dealing with the￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40030Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 secondary meaning.2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so now, if we're3 going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that4 I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get5 protection at all, because I was thinking "micro color,"6 well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny,7 teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color.8 And when I think of "micro pigment," I think of9 a farm animal, I think -- I don't know what I think, it's10 confusing me. So, for an average person, the word "micro11 color," I thought, "Gee, that's very descriptive of just12 what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color."13 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, I would urge14 you to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it15 lists twenty other competitors that sell this very16 product, they have no cause to use that word. It is not17 used in the industry as a descriptive term, they're called18 "pigment," they're called "ink," they're not called "micro19 colors," that is my client's trademark.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference between21 pigment and color, especially when it's not just "micro22 color," don't they advertise "micro color red," "micro23 color grey," so pigment -­24 MS. BRINKMANN: The typical suggestive term, it25 was created to associate the high quality that my client￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40031Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425markets in this product with that term, I want the "micro color" pigments, not the other pigments that are sold by --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, what about the word, is it -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the word, "micro pigmentation" is used in the trade as a synonym for permanent makeup?MS. BRINKMANN: That's correct, and oftentimes, trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology. The fact is it is suggestive because "micro colors" is the protected trademark here.JUSTICE SOUTER: But there is a sense of color in which color is synonymous with pigment. And I assume that's what was accepted here, which leads me to my question, I don't understand why we're having this discussion.JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.JUSTICE SOUTER: Because I thought it was agreed that for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive use, is that incorrect?MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of the defense, it's the other party that has to be using the term differently.JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could you just point to me -- I'm not asking so much about the "why," I just want￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40032Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 to know what this case is. Is there someplace in the2 materials that we've got that indicate that, in fact, you3 dispute that there is a descriptive use here?4 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, footnote 3 of the red brief5 explains that this purported concession that they discuss6 about the use of this mark had to do because Justice7 Ginsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a8 bottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but9 assuming they occurred, those were descriptive. In 199810 and 1999,11 brochures1213 the merits of the defense and not to the question14 presented. The question presented is, descriptive or not15 descriptive, do you have a defense if it's, if there is16 consumer confusion? And your position, if you're opposing17 the question presented, is that if there is consumerPetitioner started using this on their marketing in a very different manner.JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, this still goes to￼18 confusion, there is no defense. And it's -- I thought19 that was the only question you were going to discuss here,20 not in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has21 been made out in this case, because these words were or22 were not descriptive. I mean, that's a -­23 MS. BRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor, I'd be24 happy to discuss that. As I pointed out, it's contrary to25 the textual language used by the Congress in 1946. They1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40033Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 meant "used fairly" to mean what the common law meant.2 The common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical3 trademarks and trade names.4 Moreover, Petitioner's interpretation is5 contrary to the clear focus of the Lanham Act, which is to6 prevent customer confusion.7 you can walk into a store -­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG:9 there, because I thought youThe whole point is so thatMs. Brinkmann, may I stop you have conceded, as I think you quite clearly, I wrote down10 must, I thought you conceded11 that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show12 likelihood of confusion. So, if it's the plaintiff's13 burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the14 defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?15 MS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe it's the16 defendant's burden, we believe we -- the district court17 was correctly reversed by the Ninth Circuit in entering18 summary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that19 there was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion. And20 the district court did that, because as I said it was21 absolutely irrelevant to the determination of used22 fairly.23 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I think this is really24 quite confusing, Ms. Brinkmann. The question presented,25 as several people have pointed out, whether the Lanham￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40034Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Act's fair-use defense to trademark infringement requires a party asserting the defense to demonstrate the absence of a likelihood of consumer confusion.Now, do you agree or disagree with that?MS. BRINKMANN: We -­CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You can surely answer that, "we agree," or "we don't agree."MS. BRINKMANN: We don't agree. We believe that likelihood of confusion defeats the fair-use defense.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Okay, okay.MS. BRINKMANN: And we would point out that as a textual argument and the purpose argument -JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, may I just interrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the defense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, prima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion. So, is there any room for the defense at all?MS. BRINKMANN: As we point out in our brief, Your Honor, we do believe that since the amendment in 1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the plaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion -JUSTICE STEVENS: So the answer is no.MS. BRINKMANN: It remains as a Congressional emphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40035Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 that is not likely to confuse is allowed. That is what,2 thiswasa -3 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's allowed without the4 affirmative defense.5 MS. BRINKMANN: To understand why this came in,6 it's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied7 only to incontestable marks. It did not apply to other8 registered marks.9 At that time, incontestable mark holders did not10 have to prove likelihood of confusion. That incontestable11 mark was a conclusive evidence of the mark holder's12 exclusive right to use that mark on the same goods. Same13 mark, on the same goods that were set forth in the14 affidavit with the PTO. That was akin to early common15 law.16 At that point, the plaintiff could go into court17 with their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive18 evidence. So there had to be a safety valve for19 defendants to be able to say, "Okay, I know this is an20 incontestable mark, I know that, and I know I'm using it21 on the same goods, but notwithstanding, I can use it22 because I'm using it fairly, I'm not confusing consumers23 with this. That's what the purpose was. In 19 -24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But are you suggesting, I want25 to be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in,￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40036Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425back in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark did not have to prove likelihood of confusion?MS. BRINKMANN: It was presumed by the weight of that, that was the conclusive evidence.JUSTICE STEVENS: Because otherwise, wouldn't that defeat the defense, too, then?MS. BRINKMANN: Because the way Congress structured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except subject to the seven specific defenses, this was the fourth one.JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying, isn't your answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable presumption?MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Yes, YourHonor. I would also point out that when Congress amended in 1988, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that they intended to change this and that's what's so fundamental about the position - the district court position. This is a gaping hole in the core purpose of the Lanham Act.JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose IBM had used the word "computers" when they were the only company for ten or fifteen years to mark their product. Now, another￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40037Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 company comes along and they produce the same thing, they2 want to use the word "computer." You're saying that that3 would be the end of it, they couldn't do it?4 MS. BRINKMANN: Not at all, Your Honor.5 JUSTICE BREYER: People would be confused. For6 a while they'll think that "computer" refers to IBM, there7 would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the8 product, in fact, at least a very good one.9 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, if that were the10 case, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a11 generic term with no protection.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, at the very beginning,13 IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it14 computer, they could have called it a word processor, they15 could have called it a "think faster." I don't know what16 they could have called it, but I mean, you know, they17 chose the word computer.18 MS. BRINKMANN: And Congress took that19 explicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be20 canceled at any time for genericism. Escalator, aspirin21 are all examples of your situation. That's exactly what22 happened, and when they came a generic term, that23 trademark was canceled and it became used as generic.24 Congress took that into account.25 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is this fair-use￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40038Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?MS. BRINKMANN: Since 1988 it's a vestigial reminder of what Congress wanted to make sure was understood in 1946. Even for the strongest, incontestable mark on the same goods, we are still going to always allow uses that are not likely to confuse.JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't usually interpret statutes that way. I mean, you tell us what Congress had in mind, but our best indication of what Congress had in mind is the words of the statute. And the words of the statute make no sense if they say you have to prove confusion and the only -- however, there's a special defense which you have, which turns out to be there's no confusion, that's not a special defense.MS. BRINKMANN: Two points, Your Honor - JUSTICE SCALIA: Makes it a meaningless statute,really.MS. BRINKMANN: Two points. Petitioner gives no meaning to words "used fairly." So if a worst statutory construction -JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they did when they outlined to us what it means is you're using it descriptively, and not as a mark.￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40039Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, those are other1 terms that are used in the statute, those are separate2 requirements. There are four requirements in the3 provision, used not as a mark, used descriptively, used in4 good faith, and used fairly. They read "used fairly"5 right out of the language.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, am I right7 that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it8 as a mark. Because that suggests you're trying to pawn9 off your goods as another's. Are you using it as a mark?10 Or, are you using it, merely descriptively? I thought use11 as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're12 not using it in good faith.13 MS. BRINKMANN: No, that is one of the factors14 in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into15 account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are16 confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full17 of examples of that.18 I would like to make one other response to19 Justice Scalia's point, if I could. Justice Scalia, to20 the extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no21 longer prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as22 unfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici23 that there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in24 any event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used25 fairly determination, as Petitioner in the district court￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40040Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 would have it.2 We discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example,3 the Restatement's position, which we would urge the Court4 to look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but I don't6 think that's the question presented here. I mean, we7 could agree with that, that it's relevant to deciding the8 defense, and still answer the question presented the way9 that the Petitioner wants.10 MS. BRINKMANN: The district court's entry of11 summary judgment must be reversed, the Ninth Circuit did12 that because of its total disregard for likely to13 confusion -­14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but the15 issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too16 far in the other direction and required too much. And all17 we have to determine is whether there is a per se18 obligation to prove non-confusion. If we do so, that19 doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's20 position, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too21 far, isn't that correct? I mean, that is what is -- that22 is the issue before us?23 MS. BRINKMANN: I think the ruling from this24 Court would have to be that it's not an absolute defense25 against likelihood of confusion.￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40041Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about if the ruling were2 a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good3 faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for4 infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely.5 That's what the Restatement that you've just been6 applauding says.7 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, and that discussion8 explains a couple of things. It explains that if there is9 a likelihood of substantial confusion, that would be the10 outer limit, ordinarily that would not be a fair use. It11 also points out that likelihood of confusion is relevant12 to that determination that Your Honor just described.13 Yes, we would win under that position, Your Honor, that's14 absolutely correct, that's the middle ground of the15 Restatement -16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would win -17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You'd still have to vacate18 the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying19 that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of20 it.21 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we would22 actually urge the Court to affirm the judgment below, in23 support of we cite cases in our brief, the Meritor case24 and the Yakima case, in which the judgment of the Ninth25 Circuit reversing the district court should be affirmed,￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40042Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 and there are other holdings of the Ninth Circuit also2 that are not before the Court that should be affirmed.34 then that5 grounds.6789 that, but1011 it, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't12 address, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate13 the judgment and send it back?14 MS. BRINKMANN: We certainly would agree, Your15 Honor, that if we are then given an opportunity on remand16 to go back to summary judgment and carry our burden of17 establishing a likelihood of confusion, but not have it18 held against us. For example, in the middle ground, to19 determine what used fairly is, in addition to likelihood20 of confusion, we would suggest that there are other21 factors that the Restatement puts forth. For example,22 whether there is commercial justification for the use.23 Did we point out, there is no commercial justification,24 there are twenty other competitors that don't use this25 terminology.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you're urging the Ninth Circuit be affirmed on alternateMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that's - CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We rarely do that. MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, I understand in this particular situation -JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why wouldn't we just vacate￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40043Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: They might have been afraid that you'd sue them.MS. BRINKMANN: That's quite a strong mark, YourHonor.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that they were, "they" being KP, they were in fact using the word "micro color" before you registered your trademark?MS. BRINKMANN: No, we dispute that, Your Honor, they've never produced one bottle from that period. In fact, we introduced four bottles of their -JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be -- that would be a disputed issue of fact.MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And are we making any differentiation at all between the mini color red or whatever, and this logo that appears?MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, all the difference in the world, Your Honor. We maintain that that is a mark use. I mean, the district court rejected that as well, but that is one of the issues where you suggested that courts have resolved these on whether something is used as a mark or not, that is not an easy answer, and that is why it's always part and parcel of the likelihood of confusion.That's the purpose of the Lanham Act, to ensure￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40044Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 that when you go into a store, you can buy the products2 you want. For example, in the health and safety area3 here, you may be willing to buy a product that costs more4 money because you know of the quality of them. At the5 same time, you want to be assured when you go in, because6 you don't want to buy the one that's recalled all the7 time, or that has ingredients that cause allergies for8 you, that's what the Lanham Act is to protect. And it9 encourages the economic efficiency of the market -10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your customers are pretty11 sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an12 unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking13 off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably14 know this market pretty well.15 MS. BRINKMANN: That's directly relevant to the16 likelihood of confusion, Your Honor. In fact, the typical17 way of proving that when it ultimately goes to trial is18 through consumer survey. And the law is clear that that19 survey would not be of the person on the street, it would20 be of the appropriate purchasers, who are more21 sophisticated clinicians and cosmetologists.22 But, Your Honor, even on that situation in this23 record, we have direct evidence of confusion. It's at24 joint appendix page 170, Your Honor, it's the declaration25 of Gloria Torres, where about 1998, 1999, she was one of￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40045Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 the people who did sales, and she started getting calls2 from people wanting products, and it confused her because3 they weren't on my client's customer list, and also they4 were citing different prices. It didn't mean anything to5 her at the time, it turns out this was the confusion6 because they were actually seeing this new usage on the7 marketing brochure by KP Permanent.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just out of curiosity, it has9 nothing to do with the case, do they market this product10 with color charts, just like paint companies do?11 MS. BRINKMANN: They do, Your Honor, that's12 absolutely right, color wheels, color -- and also in the13 micro pigmentation history, it's very important, because14 even though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely15 the opposite, it's to hide the color. So mixing of the16 colors is a critical component of that industry.17 I want to make another point about the economic18 efficiency that is furthered by the trademark laws and not19 allowing likelihood of confusing uses, which is what20 Congress intended. By allowing purchasers to know that21 they're getting the product that they want, they're a lot,22 able to be more efficient in the market -23 JUSTICE BREYER: I also -- it's very efficient24 to allow people to communicate, in English.25 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, there's nothing to￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40046Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 prevent that.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I guess that's the3 question, because sometimes people -- I have no doubt -4 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I don't think5 there's anything -- the way that Petitioner passed the6 Lanham Act grossly overstates it. I mean, I would just7 submit the following list. The only thing that the Lanham8 -- the Lanham Act does not allow registration of generic9 brands, as we mentioned before.10 It allows cancellation of any mark if it becomes11 generic. It applies only to commercial uses, not usage in12 ordinary English language, only in connection with the13 mark. It can only have a valid trademark when it's14 actively being used, any mark can be canceled or abandoned15 after three years.16 It also, of course, only applies when there's17 likelihood of confusion. Also there is an expert agency18 that reviews and goes through a process in which there can19 be oppositions, objections, all of this could be brought20 up at that point.21 And also Congress directly addressed22 anticompetitive interests when it enacted the statute.23 It, in 1946, enacted B(7) as a defense for antitrust24 violations. It also reinforced the Justice Department,25 and the FTC maintains its enforcement authority, and it￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40047Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425also had a particular provision that allowed the FTC to go in and cancel registration. I'd also point out -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What would be a really expert agency, which you referred to as represented by the government here, and it takes the position quite different from yours.MS. BRINKMANN: At this point in time, Your Honor. I would also point out economic efficiency -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You say atthis point in time? Are you suggesting that it took a different position some other time?MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in this case, it -­ this mark has been put through becoming to -- but went through all of the procedures that the PTO required. There's no question that this is a valid mark.JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not assailing the validity of the mark.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Nobody is challenging it, it's the fair-use defense.MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, no, what I -- the government's position is the same position that, in fact, it urged before Congress in 1946. The Court's opinion in Park 'n Fly makes this clear. They did not want descriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary meaning. And as the Park 'n Fly opinion makes clear,￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40048Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 Congress rejected that and struck the balance this way and2 included all of these other safeguards, not allowing3 registration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses4 that are likely to confuse.5 We would also point out that that encourages6 economic efficiencies for businesses as well. By being7 able to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the8 business invests more. As soon as confusion is allowed,9 there is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free10 riding on that investment. And it's a disincentive for11 further investment and it undermines the quality of the12 goods, because the only way -13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Certainly the Restatement and14 the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on15 this.16 MS. BRINKMANN: We believe that the Restatement17 and the amici are very consistent in rejecting18 Petitioner's position and the district court's position19 that likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant. We20 embrace that, I think that's a consistent position, and21 that would be the bottom line, I would urge, on this22 Court, because Petitioner's position in the district court23 wreaks havoc, truly, with the statutory framework that24 Congress set up and intended.25 We believe as a matter of strict statutory￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40049Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 construction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision,2 the fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the3 inconstestability provision. But if the Court is not4 going to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses5 that are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to6 adopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the7 circumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we8 think factors that it's confusing in relationship to a9 health and safety issue would be relevant, the investment10 by the mark holder could be relevant. And to the extent11 the competitor had a commercial justification for it,12 because it was a term that everyone needed to use, but13 "micro colors" is just not that kind of terminology as the14 record in this case demonstrates.15 If there are no further questions, Your Honor.￼16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,17 Brinkmann. Mr. Machat, you have three minutes18 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT19 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMs. remaining.20 MR. MACHAT: Thank you. I'd like to21 that Ms. Brinkmann's reference to the legislative history22 is incorrect, and I'd just like to refer the Court's23 attention to my reply brief, pages 14 to 17 where24 basically it shows that prior to 1988, courts were25 required to find a likelihood of confusion before finding1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40050Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005point out1 for the plaintiff on a trademark case. I'd also like to2 point out that in this particular case, the trademark is3 not for the word "micro color," the trademark is for the4 logo mark, and here's some of the confusion.5 The Respondents were able to obtain a trademark6 registration for the logo itself, and the strength in the7 logo itself is not being copied, we're just using the8 descriptive words within the logo itself. And Congress9 always intended for descriptive words to be free for10 everybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so11 long as the person, the subsequent user, is not using12 those descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense,13 and that's the distinction.14 The confusion is only an issue to determine15 whether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is16 being met, but that confusion should be distinguished from17 likelihood of confusion. Confusion is a factual18 determination, likelihood of confusion is a legal19 determination. So you can use whether or not there is20 actual confusion to determine whether or not the mark, sorry,21 the word is being used as a mark.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: I forget your position, if23 you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion24 that is predictable or that is likely is one of the25 elements that can be used to determine whether the use is￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40051Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 a fair one? Do you agree or disagree with that?2 MR. MACHAT: I would agree, the degree of3 confusion, but that comes into whether or not -4 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, that's all I wanted5 to know.6 MR. MACHAT: In this case, "used fairly" means,7 it does mean something, we're saying used fairly refers to8 whether or not the use is a truthful or reasonably9 accurate description of the mark. And it always -­10 truthful is something that the common law always looked at11 to see, that was a term used, in fact, by this Court in12 the Warner decision, basically, to quote briefly from that13 decision, it said "the use of a similar name by another to14 truthfully describe the same product does not constitute15 a legal or moral wrong."16 So I would maintain that "used fairly" means17 truthful, or can determine whether or not it's exactly18 true, reasonably accurate. And that would be the meaning19 of "used fairly." And of course, good faith refers to the20 intent, and there you have the elements of the fair-use21 defense.22 Also, I'd just like to point out once again the23 Ninth Circuit opinion, it says on the bottom of page 17a,24 it says, "KP can only benefit from the fair-use defense if25 there is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of￼1111 14th Street NW, Suite 40052Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street NW, Suite 400the term `micro color', and Lasting's mark." And then they go on to say, "as discussed above, because in this case they can be no fair use --"CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Machat, the case is submitted.(Whereupon at 11:02 a.m., the case in the above­ entitled matter was submitted.)￼53Alderson Reporting CompanyWashington, DC 20005
