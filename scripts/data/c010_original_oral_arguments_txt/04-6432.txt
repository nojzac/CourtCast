James Crosby.          Mr. Rashkind.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. RASHKIND:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          We confront today the Eleventh Circuit'scategorical and jurisdictional prohibition of rule 60(b)in habeas corpus cases absent fraud.  That is a rule thathas been rejected by nearly all of the other circuits and,in fact, has been rejected by the United States in itsamicus brief filed in this case.          We urge the Court to adopt instead the approachof the other nine circuits that have commented on thisissue, the functional approach, in which a court is deemedto examine each motion individually to determine whetheror not the motion comports with both rule 60(b) and AEDPA.          I think the test we proposed here is a fairlysimple one, although I'm not sure in the briefing it comesacross as being as simple as it really is, but the test weare proposing, as opposed to the test proposed by theUnited States, is the one being used in nearly all of the31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 other circuits and it has percolated through the system as2 one that seems to work very well. It's a two-part test3 and it's very simple I think.4 First, does the motion that's filed challenge5 the Federal judgment on a ground cognizable under one of6 the six prongs of rule 60(b)? If not, if it's really a7 new claim, if it is not within one of the six prongs of8 rule 60(b), then simply the district court denies it.9 If, on the other hand, the motion is a true10 60(b) motion, as ours was in this case, then the court11 goes to step two, which is to examine which is the six12 prongs is implicated, what is the jurisprudence regarding13 the six -- that particular prong, and how would it apply14 in this particular case. That's the functional approach15 that most of the circuits have been using.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: At that point when the court17 makes that examination under your rule and it comes to18 point six 192021 or in any 22--MR. RASHKIND:  Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- does it refer at any pointcircumstance to AEDPA?MR. RASHKIND:  It does not but -- but point six23 has been cabined by jurisprudence. Although point six24 appears to be a wide-open door for any motion to be filed25 and granted, the courts, even before AEDPA, have treated41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 category six as one that requires extraordinary2 circumstances.3 We have been able to quantify. Both an amicus4 who filed on behalf of the petitioner and the United5 States and the respondent have quantified the number of6 cases that have gone through the rule 60(b) process.7 There have only been, since AEDPA was passed, 288 successful motions that we can quantify, that are9 published in any way. And we would like to think, at10 least, that if the State or the Federal Government thought11 there was an inappropriate application, it would have been12 raised on appeal and we'd have that statistic. 28 in the13 9-year history of the statute means fewer than 3 per year14 -- or slightly more than 3 per year for the whole country,15 a fraction for circuits.16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we were to make17 clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six,18 don't you think -- and as a result the AEDPA restrictions19 don't apply, don't you think that number would increase20 rather dramatically?21 MR. RASHKIND: I do not. And I do not because22 at this point apparently nine circuits are following the23 rule we propose, and so the statistics that both the24 respondent that we bring to you are that small, are that25 infinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b)51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 as a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required.2 One can go through each of the six prongs and easily3 hypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1),4 (b)(2) --5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there's no language in6 category six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any7 other reason justifying relief.8 MR. RASHKIND: The Court in the Ackermann9 decision -- there were two early decisions construing10 60(b). The first was the Klapprott decision in which the11 Court recognized that 60(b) is intended to correct the12 kind of errors that might occur that are important. The13 Ackermann decision followed a year later and said,14 however, this is not a wide-open door. Extraordinary15 circumstances are required.16 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it's still very17 vague.18 MR. RASHKIND: It is but it isn't. It's vague19 in terms of reading the simple rule, but it's not vague if20 one considers the jurisprudence that surrounds the rule.21 One cannot ignore a half-century of -- of decisions, which22 have rejected 60(b)(6) and other 60(b) --23 JUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, but I think24 that the court below and the other parties say -- almost25 everybody is on your side. However, they also note a61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425problem, and the problem is that given the very rigidstructure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around theAEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers willdo is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a secondhabeas and put it in the form of a 60(b).          And so I can accept everything you say, but ifthat in the back of my mind is a concern running aroundCongress in this way, what form of words could you put into restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain inwhich it's been used so far?          Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation fileda brief in which they tried to do that.  I thought thatwas a constructive effort.  So what's your opinion --          MR. RASHKIND:  Well, I would --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- about how best to do that?          MR. RASHKIND:  I would prefer to rely upon theCourt's principles in this regard.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but that's --          MR. RASHKIND:  Rhines -- Rhines v. Weber is ofgood help here.  Rhines v. Weber, that the Court deliveredjust very recently, considered the interaction of a ruleand of AEDPA, and I thought it very clearly set forththree principles which work well within the test here.First, that there has to be good cause and good 71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 cause, of course, is clear in the jurisprudence here, that2 we're talking about extraordinary circumstances, not a3 simple legal error. In this case, for example, the4 extraordinary circumstance is that, for all intents and5 purposes, my client has been denied his first petition of6 right because the court foreclosed the issues erroneously.7 So good cause is the first thing that I learned from8 Rhines.9 Secondly, that there have to be potentially10 meritorious underlying issues. Now, that's going to11 filter out a lot of the cases because you can't come into12 court with another issue that might not be good, it13 mightn't be an unexhausted issue, it might be --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.15 MR. RASHKIND: -- one procedurally defaulted.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.17 Potentially meritorious? Not probably, potentially.18 MR. RASHKIND: Well, it is -- it is the19 terminology used in Rhines. And what I'm trying to do20 here for the Court is to draw upon your own authority, the21 words you've spoken, as opposed22 the Criminal Justice Foundation23 which are interesting tests but24 Court's own jurisprudence. I'm25 its own tests that have worked.81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOto the test proposed byand by the United States,in no way depend upon thetrying to offer the Court￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But this is going to2 be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple3 hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have4 the final5 decide so67 works.810 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, aren't we dealing here11 with a time bar issue?12 MR. RASHKIND: We are.13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, there -- there was14 not a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of15 time expired before the application was made. Why would16 that count as some extraordinary circumstance? Whysay in most of these cases just because wefew.MR. RASHKIND:  And I think that's why this testThe third point would be that there be 9 timeliness.17 shouldn't18 don't see1920 question.21 get. It comes up all the time. I mean, this is not a22 cosmic legal issue.the petitioner be stuck with the time bar?  Ihow this fits even under your proposed rule.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I was going to ask the sameIt's about as pedestrian an issue as you could23 MR. RASHKIND: It really isn't as pedestrian as24 it may have seemed. We underwent a change in the law, in25 AEDPA, that the Court has recognized is not fully clear.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 And so this was one provision the Court had to clarify in2 Artuz v. Bennett, and there was a very small number of3 cases. I think we totaled eight in which relief was4 granted because district courts had incorrectly barred a5 petitioner from the first petition because it really6 wasn't a violation of -- of the statute of limitations.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why did Florida deny8 relief in -- in the post-conviction? I mean, one reason9 that looks like it might apply is that Florida had a 2-10 year statute of limitations and this was brought up 1411 years later.12 MR. RASHKIND: Well, it wasn't a 2-year statute13 of limitations, Your Honor. In fact, it was slightly14 different from the Federal statute of limitations as well.15 There is a provision that allows for newly discovered16 evidence to bypass the standard 2-year statute of17 limitations, which by the way, the Florida statute of18 limitations wasn't even adopted until well after my client19 was convicted.20 As you know, he says that he was told at his21 sentencing proceeding, you'll serve 13 years, thereabouts,22 on a 99-year sentence, and that induced his plea of guilty23 in this case. And when 13 years came about, he inquired24 what's happening and they said, no, that's not going to25 happen. You have a release date of 2057.101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And as I think the Court knows from its decisionin Linz v. Mathis, Florida -- Florida statutes reallychanged in that way.  Gain time was reduced gradually andthen much more quickly so that someone who might haveserved 13 years in 1982 is really looking at serving the99.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying that counsel-- what -- what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact,accurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody whogot a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13years?          MR. RASHKIND:  To be clear -- and -- and I wantto be clear about his allegation is -- because he does notspeak English -- that the interpreter told him this, andthis was not during a plea colloquy.  This was duringdiscussions between the lawyer and the client through aninterpreter in advance of the plea itself.  And so hisallegation has consistently been that that's what theinterpreter told him his lawyer said.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But has that beendetermined --          MR. RASHKIND:  No.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- by some court?  That's theallegation --MR. RASHKIND: Correct. 111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- pure and simple --2 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- yet to be determined.4 MR. RASHKIND: And it's never been.5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And so we have to know how6 the time bar element folds in here, and in an ordinary7 civil case, a time bar would be an adjudication on the8 merits. I mean, that -- that would end the case, and why9 would it be a different, more liberal rule in habeas?10 MR. RASHKIND: It is because that's the way the11 Court has treated the rule. The Court has always --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're saying it13 is extraordinary.14 MR. RASHKIND: In a different sense I'm saying15 it. In terms of computing whether a time bar is on the16 merits, the Court has not used that concept, which does17 relate to some sort of civil proceedings. Plaut would18 make it appear first to money judgment type cases. But19 the Court has not used that standard, for example, in20 Martinez-Villareal, has not used it in Slack v. McDaniel.21 Instead, the Court has not looked at the22 nomenclature of the order that dismissed the case or23 denied this case. Instead, the Court looks to did the --24 the court below address the claims of the petitioner. And25 of course, a claim of statute of limitations is not a121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 claim of a petitioner. That's an affirmative defense of2 the State.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Counsel, what -- that --4 that brings me to a question that I don't understand about5 your argument. It seems to me you're biting off more than6 you have to bite off here. Would you win on the following7 argument? And I will tell you in advance that it looks to8 me as though you would. But maybe there's some reason9 you're not making it.10 Number one, your statute of limitations claim is11 not the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it12 deals with limits on second and successive petitions.13 Number two, although a statute of limitations14 issue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the15 second or successive petition category. In this case, you16 don't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end17 run so far as second or successive goes, and therefore,18 60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a19 door that could be opened when your claim is a claim about20 a rule that barred you from getting into Federal court,21 which is what the statute of limitations rule does.22 That's all you're asking for.23 MR. RASHKIND: That's right.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: And finally, you have an25 extraordinary situation here because you have a later131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 determination in Artuz which declared the law not as a2 change in the law, but as what the law presumably meant3 from day one.45 argument, 678 argument? 9As I understand it, if we accepted thatyou would win.  Do you agree?MR. RASHKIND:  Yes, sir.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then why don't you make thatMR. RASHKIND: I do make that argument, and to 10 the extent -- and -- and I make that argument, but that11 argument was rejected in the court below which addressed12 it with a completely different approach. And so I begin13 in this Court by having to address where I was in the14 Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the16 district court before the Eleventh Circuit? You've now17 told me that the ground on which the Florida court denied18 relief was not based on the statute of limitations.19 Right?20 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Federal court, what is22 the ground on which relief was denied and how would Artuz23 affect that decision?24 MR. RASHKIND: In the Federal court, the25 district judge said that the tolling provision would not141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 apply here because it was the district court's2 determination that it was untimely when filed in the State3 court. That was not, however, the position of the Florida4 courts.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your -- your immediate6 concern is how do I get into a Federal court. Whether you7 win or lose once you get in there is another problem, but8 I -- as I understand it, that's not what we're dealing9 with here. And -- and the -- you -- you were kept out of10 the district court on a statute of limitations issue. If11 you can say -- if you argue all I've got in front of you,12 us, is a statute of limitations issue, that's all I want13 under -- to raise under 60(b) and I have an extraordinary14 claim here because of the subsequent Artuz decision, that15 will get you into Federal court, if we accept that16 argument. Whether -- whether you win or lose, once you17 get there, I don't know, and I don't know that that's18 before us.19 MR. RASHKIND: And it is not clear. I wish it20 were because that's precisely what my pro se client wrote21 in his rule 60(b) motion. He said I have been denied my22 right to a first petition because of an incorrect23 determination on the statute of limitations, that the24 Artuz decision makes clear that I was entitled to a25 tolling period that I was not awarded, and I would like151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the judgment modified or reopened.  And that's as clear asa pro se litigant can make that claim.  That's what theclaim has been from the very beginning, long before I wasever his counsel.          JUSTICE BREYER:  You -- you had a question.Remember my -- you were giving me the three principles toprevent the end run.          MR. RASHKIND:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And the first was good cause.The second was potentially meritorious underlying issues,and the third is?          MR. RASHKIND:  No indication of dilatory tacticsby the plaintiff.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you.          MR. RASHKIND:  And this is very helpful I thinkbecause it gives those three rules, which the Court hasgiven us in Rhines, helped us and helped the districtcourt to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping orreopening proceedings.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May -- may I ask you aquestion that may be a little bit collateral?  There wasdisagreement on the court of appeals, as I remember it, asto whether or not a COA requirement applies to a denial ofa 60(b) motion.  What is your view on that issue?MR. RASHKIND: Well, I actually argued and I do 161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 believe that it shouldn't require a COA. And the reason2 is because -- part of the reason is because this case3 began before Slack v. McDaniel and continued after. And I4 think that's where Judge Tjoflat's opinion came from. How5 can someone whose case is dismissed procedurally ever get6 a COA? It's impossible because there's never going to be7 a constitutional issue. By virtue of the procedural8 ruling, the constitutional was not addressed.9 And Judge Tjoflat continued that dissenting10 position through the en banc decision, and I share the11 view that it is virtually impossible, if not completely12 impossible, in the typical case of a procedural13 of the case, to ever get a COA.14 In this case, majority would point to15 fact the my client did receive a certificate of16 appealability, but I don't think there are many17 will every get it because the question presented was, is a18 rule 60(b) still viable post AEDPA? And that question19 won't recur, certainly not after the Court rules here.20 And I think the very genuine concern that Judge Tjoflat21 had was and that he -- that he articulated is it's22 virtually impossible to get appellate review.2324 is -- 25One of the things we know about habeas corpusCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, we're not 171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOresolutiontheothers who￼1 talking about ordinary appellate review. We're talking2 about an appeal from an adverse decision by a Federal3 habeas court.4 MR. RASHKIND: Correct.5 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that isn't quite6 as strange as you make it sound.7 MR. RASHKIND: It is for this reason, Mr. Chief8 Justice. Before, you could file successive applications.9 In the early days of habeas corpus, you could file10 successive applications. And the reason given was there11 was no appeal. And so you could go from one judge to the12 next judge because there were no appeals. Then, of13 course, we had appeals, and the reason for having14 successive petitions would diminish.15 But what has happened to the appeal in a habeas16 corpus case is it has become so constrained that in many17 respects it doesn't exist, and that's what happened here.18 Here's my client who faces a situation in which he has19 clearly been thrown out of court improperly, and he goes20 to the court of appeals to have that decision reviewed and21 can't get past the gateway of the certificate of22 appealability. And so he has no opportunity to really23 have an appellate review. He has none.24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but maybe that's25 what Congress wanted.181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. RASHKIND:  I don't think Congress did intendthat.  When we looked --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But why isn't that always thecase if it's time-barred?          MR. RASHKIND:  If it is time --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  If it's time-barred, younever have your chance to have the merits argued.          MR. RASHKIND:  Well, that's one of the ways inwhich a case could be dismissed procedurally, but it's nottime-barred if the court rules it was erroneously.  Andthat's the concern that I think my client has here.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  But at what point do we bringthis all to a halt?  I mean, there's always one more argumentto make that the last court to rule against me was wrong.          MR. RASHKIND:  One of the nice things about rule60(b) is it really is a disciplined approach to a courtexamining its own mistakes.  It isn't a wide-open door inany respect.  It is a disciplined approach.  There are sixspecific grounds, and even though the sixth one looks likeit's wide-open, it certainly isn't under the jurisprudenceof the Court.          And so what this does is provide a veryimportant opportunity for a judge to be able to look at anintervening decision from the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates and say, I have denied this person what Congress191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 wanted them to have. There's no question. One reads2 AEDPA and one thing is very clear. They -- Congress3 intended for a person who has exhausted claims, not4 procedurally defaulted them in State court, and has filed5 a timely petition, that person under 2254 is entitled to6 have the claim entertained. And when a court makes a7 mistake, a procedural mistake, that forgoes or eliminates8 the opportunity for review, and that's barely reviewable on9 appeal, depending on how the certificate of appealability10 may be phrased -- and often these folks are pro se -- I11 think what happens is 2254 has failed and what Congress12 intended to happen isn't going to happen. The person was13 entitled to one petition, one bite at the apple and never14 receives that bite at the apple.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, the Federal16 Government has a different proposed rule than yours. Are17 you going to comment on their proposal?18 MR. RASHKIND: I will. With due deference to my19 colleagues, it's 177 words long, over two pages. And20 that's why I thought that the approach that we brought to21 the Court from the other nine circuits is a simpler --22 what I would call a simple two-step.23 Their approach actually can be read, as we did24 in our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but I25 think the problem with the Government's rule is it is so201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 broad and it does not rely upon any of the Court's2 precedents in -- in its writing. And so what you do, if3 you adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create4 confusion. And secondly, what you do is you make a whole5 new set of rules that are separate and apart from what you6 -- the Court has previously done in its AEDPA7 jurisprudence.8 To be able to touch upon Slack v. McDaniel, to9 be able to draw upon Martinez-Villareal, to be able to10 take from Rhines v. Weber, create a formula and a package11 that's familiar to the courts, to take a rule that's 17712 words long that the Government puts together that I13 interpret as being favorable to my client and they14 interpret as being unfavorable to my client, I think just15 puts the kind of difficulty in the courts that this case16 should try to avoid.17 So my comment on it is that it may well, if it's18 read as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that19 we're saying and what I refer to as a simple two-step20 test. And if not, it's just going to be a source of great21 confusion.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- you -- you23 said 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the24 district court correcting its own errors. But it isn't25 usually -- 60(b) was framed with the idea of the district211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 court being the very first instance court. And here you2 will have the district court as the third going up the3 ladder. So -- and -- and given that the habeas rules say4 that -- that civil rules are applicable but have to be5 modified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction.6 MR. RASHKIND: I think it's very important to7 realize that both rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil8 Procedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure,9 which the State would have us use as a constraint, really10 are the first things that tell us that there's supposed to11 be a functional approach. Both of those rules tell us12 that the rules apply to the extent that they're13 compatible, and so that's certainly not a14 approach. That is a functional approach.15 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the16 the way, seems a broader rule than yours.17 it rules out is new legal claims or new evidence. I don't18 see anything in your -- tell me if I'm wrong, but I don't19 see anywhere where you say we should be able to bring a20 60(b) motion based on new legal claims or new evidence.21 MR. RASHKIND: New legal -- this is the part22 that I think we have to look both at 60(b) and the23 statute. New claims -- new claims -- are brought under24 2244(b)(2). Same claims are either going to be barred by25 (b)(1) or, if heard at all, under 60(b).221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOcategoricalGovernment, by The only thing￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I said. I don't2 see how the Government hurts you. I think -- I think if3 you the Government's, you're even better off.4 MR. RASHKIND: Well, I think that they're --5 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's even -- but I want6 to know why -- why -- there's some reason you don't like7 the Government, and -- and -- other than fact that they8 must hurt910 they do. 11121314 their test, my client should not prevail. I can make an15 argument under our test my client prevails.16 JUSTICE BREYER: And under their test too, you17 say it's applying the same rule of -- it's not a new18 claim. It's the same claim as -- as -- just that they --19 shows that the district judge got it wrong.20 MR. RASHKIND: I think the heart of the21 Government's position is it requires a much more radical22 departure from general procedure than a simple change of23 law. But I don't think it's a simple change of law, for24 example, when it is an intervening decision that25 interprets a statute that was in effect and that the231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOyou in some way.  I don't see how it hurts you.MR. RASHKIND:  Well, I don't think it does, butSo that troubles me.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER:  -- make us --MR. RASHKIND:  They make an argument that under￼1 mistake of not interpreting correctly is to effectively2 bar the first bite at the habeas apple.3 Now, the Government does not give that ground in4 their test, and I think it's important that the Court5 leave that door open. And that's why I think our test is6 better and theirs in inadequate.7 I think ultimately we come down to three issues8 that support the position that we're taking. Chief Judge9 Edmonson made note of this in his concurring and10 dissenting opinion. He was troubled that we were not11 giving effect to both laws that Congress had approved,12 60(b) and AEDPA. By virtue of the majority rule, 60(b)13 had been categorically eliminated. And I think the14 position we take before the Court today is that the Court15 should honor both provisions that Congress has adopted.161718 Rashkind. 192021 from you. 22232425 it pleaseMay I reserve the balance of my time?CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr.MR. RASHKIND:  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Mr. Kise, we'll hear ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400MR. theKISE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and mayCourt:24Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 This case presents a fundamental inconsistency2 to this Court. Congress said through AEDPA that a habeas3 petitioner is to take all their claims, put them in one4 basket, bring them to court within 1 year, and a sovereign5 State is going to defend that judgment in Federal court6 one time. Rule 60(b) says, petitioner, use as many7 baskets as you need, take as long as you like, and the8 State, you're going to have to keep coming back over and9 over and over again.10 And this case here presents that -- that very11 problem.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that an exaggeration of13 how 60(b) works in practice? It isn't that every civil14 judgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions.15 The district courts have been rather disciplined in16 handling 60(b) motions. So I think you have exaggerated17 what 60(b) does in the ordinary civil rules context.18 MR. KISE: Well, respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,19 I -- I would disagree with that in this sense. I would20 disagree with it in the sense that as Justice O'Connor21 pointed out, if this Court were to open that door, I think22 you would23 that sort24 would see25see that sort of abuse.  I think you would seeof manipulation of the process.  I think youthat sort of --JUSTICE STEVENS:  But have we seen it in the --251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 there are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't2 there? And have we seen the abuse you're describing?3 MR. KISE: We have not yet, but I would submit4 to Your Honor that that is because there is still this5 uncertainty because this case is here before this Court,6 and -- and because this has not yet been approved. If7 this is approved by this Court, then you're going to see8 sovereign States like Florida dragged back in here nearly9 25 years later --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that depends --11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I had the same comment12 or the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg. Forget about13 the habeas area. Just in -- with general civil judgments,14 have there been Law Review articles saying that rule 60(b)15 undermines finality? People kept going back, back, and16 back. I -- I thought quite the opposite, that we were17 living very well with rule 60(b).18 MR. KISE: Well, in -- in the ordinary civil19 context, that's perhaps correct, Your Honor, but -- but20 this isn't the ordinary civil context. This is the habeas21 context. And Congress has said that this is the structure22 that we want to take. This is the rule that we want to23 take. And as this Court has recognized that -- that AEDPA24 was passed with -- with this enduring respect for25 finality, this respect for the sovereignty of States.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 State, you're only going to have to come back here one2 time. You're only supposed to litigate one time, one --3 all the claims in one basket. They're brought within 14 year, and the State is to defend its judgment one time5 because --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But his -- his whole7 argument is you, State, get exactly what you're entitled8 to if I win on 60(b) because what I was entitled to and9 what you were entitled to was the 1-year statute but10 subject to the rule in Artuz. That's all you get, State.11 And what he is saying is, I want to get back into court so12 that I can have the statute of limitations -- the benefit13 of the statute of limitations as Artuz construed it. That14 means you, State, get what you want and I get my one15 chance. How is that an open door to the abuse that you're16 talking about?17 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, again, there --18 there has to be some finality to the process, and -- and19 here what the petitioner got was at the time a20 perceptively correct view of the law.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: He got what Artuz said was an22 erroneous view of the statute of limitations.23 MR. KISE: 2 years after the district judge made24 his ruling in this particular case. And it -- it was in25 this particular case 2 years. It could be 10 years. It271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 could be 15 years, and that's the problem that we see is2 that if --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And do you -- do you think that4 there is -- that there is this -- this sort of tidal wave5 of -- of erroneous statute of limitations determinations6 that, if Artuz is applied, will suddenly be coming 5, 10,7 and 20 years into Federal court? I mean, it -- it -- your8 argument, in relation to his particular claim seems9 exaggerated.10 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, it's not11 exaggerated when you look at it from the standpoint that12 -- that Congress intended us to be in court one time to13 defend this judgment in Federal court. We were there. He14 received a --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you were there for the16 purpose of getting him booted out. I mean,17 you didn't get into the merits of anything.18 MR. KISE: Well, he received a --19 disposition on the non-technical procedural20 was the applicable law at the time. He received that21 adjudication and --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it was not the23 applicable law at the time. The decision related back to24 before that hearing.25 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, then that would,281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOyou didn't --a finalbasis which￼1 respectfully, eviscerate any -- any notion of -- of the2 statute of limitations --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. Sometimes there are law-4 changing decisions, but this was not a law-changing5 decision. It's a decision interpreting what the law was6 from the date of its enactment.7 MR. KISE: But based on that, Your Honor, then8 there would be no statute of limitations. If -- if that9 decision came out 10 years from now, we would then be back10 in this Court on a 60(b) motion, which I would submit is11 fundamentally inconsistent with what Congress intended.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: If there had been an Artuz13 violation and not every statute of limitations14 determination implicates Artuz.15 MR. KISE: That's correct, Your Honor. But at16 the same time, there may be some other mistake or some17 other excusable neglect or some other issue that comes up.18 I mean, what Congress intended to prevent is not19 just the successful filing of a 60(b) or the successful20 revisiting, if you will, of the judgment. It -- it21 intended to prevent the actual attempt itself. I mean,22 the idea is -- is that once this judgment is adjudicated,23 once we've had this adjudication, you are not to come24 back. You are not to --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what Congress was291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 principally concerned with -- Congress was concerned with2 two things. It was concerned with second and successive.3 That's not what is before us. Congress was also concerned4 with a 1-year statute of limitations. What is before us5 on that point is that this guy did not get the benefit of6 the statute of limitations that he had a right to get the7 benefit of, that there was a flat mistake of law. So by8 -- by recognizing his statute of limitations claim, we do9 not open the door to second and successive litigation. We10 open the door simply to Artuz problems on statute of11 limitations rulings and that's a pretty narrow category it12 seems to me.13 MR. KISE: But I would -- I would respectfully14 disagree with Your Honor's premise that -- that he -- he's15 not seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition. He did --16 he is seeking, as -- as we see it, to --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. Sure, he does. And if18 it's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out19 again.20 MR. KISE: And we would submit that it is second21 and successive because it's seeking to revisit that22 adjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non-23 technical procedural basis.24 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: You may -- you may be right,301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425but that's what district courts are there for.          MR. KISE:  But -- but the Congress intended totake that discretion away from the district courts.2244(b)(1) says you will not look at it again, and2244(b)(3) says, in fact, that when you do go back topotentially revisit an issue, when you do go back topotentially look at a second or successive, that it's noteven the same district judge that makes thatdetermination.  As in 60(b), you go back to the samejudge.  2244(b)(3) says, no, a three-judge panel of acircuit court of appeals must first determine whether ornot you even have a right to get in --          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's also true of (b)(3).          MR. KISE:  Yes, Your Honor --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And not even the EleventhCircuit said (b)(3).  And therefore, you want to sayabsolute, or are we really talking about which 60(b)motions escape the strictures of AEDPA?          MR. KISE:  Well, I -- I think we're talkingabout which 60(b)(3) motions -- or 60(b) motions do escapethe strictures of AEDPA.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're prepared to defendthe -- the Eleventh Circuit.          MR. KISE:  I -- I am , Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct, though you're alone on311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that because even the Government doesn't and nor does the2 criminal justice.3 But if you're prepared to defend them, I guess4 you'd say why is it that they will allow (b)(3), fraud on5 the court by the adverse party, to escape, but should your6 own witness turn out to have been committing his own fraud7 for whatever set of reasons, you can't.8 MR. KISE: Well, I would -- I would say why9 fraud -- to answer your question, Your Honor, why fraud --10 let me back up first to the premise that -- that our11 position and the Government's position are that far apart.12 I would respectfully say that -- that we are not that far13 apart. I do not see that much light between the14 positions, although I know their brief leaves some room --15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, under I guess the16 Government, you can bring everything under 60(b). By the17 way, if they do bring a motion to reopen under 60(b)18 because of change of law, they're almost bound to lose.19 There are hardly any cases which find that an adequate20 ground under 60(b).21 But they let you do anything under 60(b), I take22 it, as long as the claims presented do not -- as long as23 they are not trying to obtain relief on the basis of new24 legal claims or new evidence.25 Now, I just noticed there's another one here. 321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Do not support habeas relief.  Maybe that's the problem.          MR. KISE:  Perhaps I --          JUSTICE BREYER:  You explain.  I -- I thoughtwhen I first read this, that this was quite broad, but Imay not have read it perfectly.          MR. KISE:  Well, and I don't want to pretend tospeak for the United States because -- because that --that might cause me to misspeak.          But to answer your question about why fraud isdifferent, I -- I have three bases for why fraud isdifferent and why we think that that exception is theright exception.          One, this Court has said in the past that fraudis different than other things.  In the Hazel case that'scited in Calderon, this Court has said that tampering withthe administration of justice through fraud involves morethan an injury to a single litigant.  It is a wrongagainst the very institutions designed to safeguard thepublic, institutions that cannot tolerate fraud.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So is that also true if his ownwitness has committed the fraud?          MR. KISE:  Well, I -- I would -- our fraudexception that -- that we -- we are delineating here ismaterial, intentional conduct that subverts the process.And it can't be just anyone, Your Honor.331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.2 MR. KISE: It needs to be someone in a position3 to subvert the process for -- for a purpose like the4 Government or the court if you -- if -- a judge that's5 been bribed in the unusual example of that, or -- or the6 -- the subornation of perjury in the Hazel sense. Those7 examples -- that would be fraud that I think is what this8 Court was talking about in Hazel --9 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about a claim10 that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the11 government, during trial?12 MR. KISE: Well, a witness for -- a -- a claim13 that a witness for the government perjured himself during14 the trial would certainly implicate material, intentional15 conduct designed to subvert the process. And one of the16 advantages to using fraud is -- is that it is a familiar17 bright line, workable standard for district courts. And18 with fraud, you have to plead a little bit more19 particularly, and so you would avoid in some respects some20 of the question marks that would come up --21 JUSTICE BREYER: And all I'm saying is exactly22 whatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own23 witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their24 little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the25 same thing.341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. KISE: Well --2 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that not count too?3 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that would4 leave so much room for mischief, it would not be possible5 to contain the potential for -- for abuse. I mean, if6 every jailhouse snitch were -- were subject to -- to the7 -- the 60(b) exception that we're -- we're articulating8 here, if every -- every petitioner could simply say, well,9 my own witness that I put up on the stand -- that -- that10 witness perjured himself or herself, then -- then the11 opportunity for mischief would abound, and we would be12 back in the same position that we would be in general with13 -- with States having to respond again.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kise, this may be15 important. Do you agree with Mr. Rashkind that in the16 Florida court the dismissal or the denial of relief was17 not on the Florida statute of limitations --18 MR. KISE: No, Your Honor. We -- we would19 submit that it is on the statute of limitations, that --20 that rule 3.850 provided the petitioner with 2 years21 within which to apply, and both of his petitions were22 dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. And I don't23 know that that matters --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- not clear25 from --351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. KISE:  -- to the end result here, but -- butthat -- that's our position.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's not what the -- thisis -- the -- the form of dismissal in the Florida SupremeCourt doesn't tell us that.  It just says something aboutallegations contained therein do not constitute legalgrounds for granting the new trial.          MR. KISE:  Your Honor may be referring to thesecond 3.850 dismissal, and that second 3.850 didn't meetthe requirements of the successive rule.  There -- therewas a first --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The first one was on thestatute of limitations?          MR. KISE:  Yes, Your Honor, and then the secondone was also on the statute of limitations in addition tothe fact that it did not meet the requirements of -- ofthe successive rule because it was essentially the sameclaim time.raised again.  He raised the same claim a second    JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we have that anyplace atthe papers before us, the first -- the first-- indismissal in the Florida -- in the Florida trial court?          MR. KISE:  I'm not sure exactly where it is inthe appendix, Your Honor.  Let me see.  I -- I don't knowthat we do.  I know we have reference to it, but I don't361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425know that we have the actual language.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said --          MR. KISE:  It is -- it is in the EleventhCircuit opinion, I believe, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that it was based on theFlorida 2-year statute of limitations.          MR. KISE:  Yes.  I believe -- when I saidopinion, I'm sorry.  The Eleventh Circuit record, YourHonor.  It is in the Eleventh Circuit record, the -- thedecision of the Florida court.  But it is not in theappendix before this Court.          But returning again to Justice Breyer, because Idon't think I finished my three reasons.          The first was because this Court said and saysfraud is different.          The second is because there never was a firstreview in that sense.  I mean, they never obtained thefirst review that they -- they were seeking.          And the third is -- is the State's finalityinterest, which this Court has -- has recognized as -- asnear paramount under certain circumstances, must yieldwhere you have the presence of fraud.  And -- and sothat's why Florida maintains that this is the correct and-- and only exception.  And -- and there are severalreasons that we maintain that this is the correct and only371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 exception.2 The first and -- and most important, and -- and3 as I started this presentation, is that this is the only4 exception that preserves congressional intent.5 The second is -- is that AEDPA and rule 60(b)6 cannot coexist except in very narrow circumstances because7 they address the same subject matter in fundamentally8 different910 the court 1112 address the same subject matter? Isn't 60(b) directed at13 the integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas AEDPA is14 directed at the integrity of the original conviction?15 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I would respectfully16 disagree with Your Honor because 2244(b)(1) does deal with17 the -- the revisiting of the Federal habeas petition. The18 2244(b)(1) specifically applies to the revisitation of the19 Federal habeas petition. And in -- in terms of how they20 deal with the same subject matter in different ways, as I21 began, AEDPA's whole purpose is to provide one basket of22 claims within 1 year so the State has to defend one time,23 and 60(b) allows for the potential -- and -- and I would24 submit to you more than just the potential if this Court25 were to approve a standard -- for -- for repetitive381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOways.And the third is, as I mentioned before, because--JUSTICE STEVENS:  But is it correct that they￼1 claims, many baskets, many -- many years, and -- and many2 times that the State has to come back.3 And as I say, in this case the -- the principle4 of finality is all but abolished in this case and all be5 eviscerated simply by the fact that nearly 25 years later6 Florida is still in this Court defending this judgment7 that was based on a guilty plea, not even a -- a8 conviction. And -- and as this Court recognized, albeit9 not as part of the holding, but -- but mentioned in -- in10 Calderon with respect to the enduring respect for11 finality, this is something that has survived both direct12 and post-conviction review in the State court system.13 I mean, this is -- this is Federal review of a14 sovereign State's determination as to the application of15 its criminal laws, and Congress has made a policy16 determination that -- that that Federal review must be17 limited because State -- State exercise of its -- of its18 police power and -- and the enforcement of its judgments19 is something that needs to be respected.2021 habeas is22 make that23 argues that 60(b) somehow strikes a balance, I would24 submit to this Court that Congress has already struck that25 balance. Congress has already made that determination.391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOAnd Congress -- because the power to grantgiven by written law, Congress has the power topolicy determination.  And while the petitioner￼1 There isn't another balance to be struck by the use of2 60(b), but that a balance has already been struck by3 Congress and Congress has made a determination that in4 most circumstances finality is going to trump.5 And this isn't a perfect system. There are6 going to be exceptions with any bright line rule. With7 any bright line rule that this Court has ever carved8 out --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Congress rule -- rule10 out 60(b) in -- in death cases?11 MR. KISE: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Specifically12 rule out 60(b) --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.14 MR. KISE: -- in -- in capital cases.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.16 MR. KISE: I don't know -- under the statute?17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I may be wrong about18 having --19 MR. KISE: I'm not certain. We -- we're20 submitting that the Congress under -- under AEDPA ruled21 out 60(b) in all cases with the exception of -- of the22 fraud.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a special24 provision for25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400capital cases.KISE:  I don't believe so, Your Honor.40Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 But with respect to the bright line rule that --2 that we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional3 intent, as I was saying, that it's not a perfect system.4 And the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples5 that -- that seem to implicate various policy6 determinations about what should or should not happen in a7 given situation.8 But -- but our position -- and we believe the9 position of the Eleventh Circuit is -- is that Congress10 has already weighed that now. Congress has already made11 that determination. Congress has already told us where12 the line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn13 on the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the14 side of respect for State sovereignty.15 And I would -- would also submit that -- that16 the Sixth Circuit test and the functional equivalent17 approach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores18 really both the statute and it ignores reality. It19 ignores the statute because AEDPA tells us you can't20 revisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are21 certain limited circumstances that are met. And it22 ignores reality because the only reason to revisit a23 habeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying24 State court judgment. And the only purpose for being25 there is to ultimately get at that State court conviction411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that is -- that is under siege.2 With respect to the coexistence, the petitioner3 made a point about this case is somehow like the Rhines4 case that was decided recently by this Court. But in the5 Rhines case, this Court was balancing the exhaustion6 requirements with the statute of limitations provisions.7 Here there's nothing to balance. Here this is just simply8 a prohibition. Congress says you cannot revisit except in9 these isolated, limited circumstances. And so rule 81,10 habeas rule 11, and this Court's decision in Pitchess all11 say that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds12 differently.13 And finally, the courts do need a bright line14 that's not subject to variance, as I mentioned earlier.15 This is a workable standard. They're familiar with fraud.16 It's well defined in the case law. It requires more17 particularized pleading which makes less room for18 mischief, and it -- it gives the courts an easily19 identifiable standard by which they can effectuate that20 congressional policy, that congressional policy of one21 basket of22 into this23 judgment.2425claims within 1 year and the State will comeFederal court one time to defend its sovereignIf there are no further questions, thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Kise.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A.

That is the territory thatAEDPA occupies.  That includes, Justice Souter, not justdeterminations on the --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Would you say that again?          MS. MILLETT:  A rule 60(b) motion that seeks toset aside a final judgment denying Federal habeas reliefon the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a secondor successive petition under AEDPA.  It can proceed onlyunder AEDPA's terms, which change not only the standardsfor a second decision, but the decision-maker, thegatekeeper.          Justice Souter --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that a statement of whenit's not available?  I want to be sure I -- are youstating it positively or negatively?          MS. MILLETT:  It --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It is not available in thecircumstance you described.

If you are seeking to upset a final2 determination, you are governed by 2244 not 60(b).3 If you are not seeking to upset a final4 determination, let me give you the two -- the two5 circumstances that come to mind right away.6 One is the fraud exception recognized by the7 court of appeals, and there could be similar errors like8 that -- and this is what we talk about in our brief -- that9 essentially vitiate the existence of a determination in10 the first place. They are that profound and that11 rudimentary. Then you are not upsetting what our system12 recognizes to be a determination and what Congress wanted13 you to have.14 The other exception is essentially 60(a),15 clerical -- you're not -- errors. You're not really16 upsetting anything. You're actually trying to implement17 or effectuate the actual ruling by the court of appeals.18 The only gap -- I'm not sure it's a gap at all19 after the argument here -- is that we don't limit it to20 fraud. We recognize that there are some other21 foundational, rudimentary, fundamental errors that22 conceivably could occur. I'm not aware of them happening,23 but something like a biased judge addressed by this Court24 in Toomey v. Ohio.25 JUSTICE BREYER: But now you're into -- I mean,451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you can use a tone of voice.  You know, it sounds verystrong.  But I thought 60(b)(6) is weird things happen,and 60(b)(1) is there are all kinds of mistakes.  Youknow, some of them can just be accidental.  The lawyer washit by a trolley.  And in fact, all of 60(b) is meant tocapture that kind of thing.          So it sounds like what you're saying is, sure,follow 60(b), maybe not the evidentiary, maybe not the newevidence part, follow it, but be sure you do so strictly.Are you saying more than that?          MS. MILLETT:  I am saying a lot more than that,and that is, first of all, because the vast majority ofthings that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify astantamount to fraud or a biased judge.          And -- and the second incredibly important thingis that Congress changed the decision-maker.  Under 60(b),you have 645 individual district court judges applying thehistoric equity power to -- to overturn final judgments.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Where -- where do you disagreewith Judge Carnes?          MS. MILLETT:  With Judge?          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  With -- with the majority of-- in -- in the Eleventh Circuit.          MS. MILLETT:  If that opinion is read -- and Ithink fairly it has to be -- as saying only fraud and not461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 errors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some2 other complete breakdown so that our system doesn't3 recognize that to be a judgment -- it's not what Congress4 thought it was giving you -- then that would be -- I can't5 tell you there's cases where this happens, but that -- but6 the -- the rationale for including fraud would exclude --7 include some other similar errors of magnitude. That's8 our only --9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, how do you apply it in10 this case, the Artuz problem?11 MS. MILLETT: In -- in this case, the Artuz12 problem is only an argument, and I -- we're not even13 accepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that14 the court made a mistake of law. A mistake of law is not15 a fundamental breakdown in our system. It does not mean16 the court didn't act as a court. This Court reverses in17 -- or vacates in about 75 percent of its cases. It doesn't18 mean all the lower courts were not operating as courts as19 we recognize them as at the same level of fraud. It's20 routine to have mistakes of law --21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose Artuz had been22 decided and it was in the mail and the judge forgot to23 open his advance sheets that day. And so he goes back to24 his office, says, oh, my God. You know, I mean, a weird25 thing like that. And of course, he says nobody has been471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 hurt yet. 23 rule -- 4 I'll reopen it.  Okay?  Is that all right?MS. MILLETT:  If he does it within 10 days underJUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it's 10 days and a half.MS. MILLETT:  10 --(Laughter.)MS. MILLETT:  Then, Justice Breyer, the nature5 6 78 of lines is somebody falls on the other side sometimes.9 There's an appeal process to deal with exactly that.10 JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it's11 happened is because all the lawyers were hit by four12 trolleys.13 (Laughter.)14 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you see what I'm doing?15 I'm simply trying to find cases that fit within the16 language, but they're very weird and justice cries out for17 a reopening. Now, that's what it seems to me one is18 about. Two is about. Three doesn't really. Three you19 agree applies. Two may not apply. Three you agree20 applies. Four I think you probably agree applies or not21 at all. Five doesn't apply at all, and six is anything22 under the sun.23 MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the problem is --24 and -- and Justice Souter, you referenced this. There25 have been many references to this, that 60(b) is not a481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 problem. It's already cabined out there. In fact, it's2 not. It's abuse of discretion review in courts of3 appeals.4 We cite a case, Hamilton v. Newland, from the5 Ninth Circuit where they used 60(b)(6). The -- the6 petitioner filed his claims. They were clearly barred by7 the statute of limitations, not an Artuz problem. So he8 said, all right, I'm going back to Federal court with a9 60(b)(6) claim. I'm actually innocent. That puts me in10 60(b)(6). I admit actual innocence. It's -- it's a very11 weak claim. I can't been get relief on it. But the12 district court said, come on in. I'm going to decide your13 claims.14 15 1617 shouldn't18 wrong there, it was merely a classic application of -- of19 review of a statute of limitations point. There -- there20 was much else involved and maybe it was improper.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, maybe --MS. MILLETT:  And the -- and the --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- maybe the district courthave done that, but whatever -- whatever was21 My question, I guess, is why do you say that the22 -- why do you assume that the policy animating applying23 60(b) to a gatekeeping issue like statute of limitations,24 where there is an unusual circumstance as in Artuz, should25 be the same policy that animates applying 60(b), let's491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 say, when there is an attempt to -- to make an end run2 around the second and successive rules?3 The latter I think we can all understand pretty4 readily. I mean, it's very important. You've got the --5 the -- AEDPA if you allow that.6 With respect to this kind of a statute of7 limitations problem, what the guy is asking for is what he8 was entitled to under AEDPA as a matter of timing and9 gatekeeping. Why is the policy under 60(b) the same in10 those two cases?11 MS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, there's two12 answers to that. The first is that this won't be -- it13 will be hard to limit this to a statute of limitations14 because the next argument is going to be procedural15 default, and the next argument is going to be16 misapplication of Teague's non-retroactivity principle,17 and the next one is going to be mistake in applying18 adequate, independent State grounds.19 The -- a bulk -- a huge percentage of Federal20 court decision-making in habeas cases is procedural rules21 because Federal habeas is not a roving commission for22 error correction. You have to -- at -- in the same breath23 that you establish a constitutional violation, you have to24 show it's proper for Federal courts to act. Procedural25 default and statute of limitations are as much your job to501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 show to have Federal relief as it is to show that2 something went wrong under the Constitution. It's a --3 there's a dual character to Federal habeas relief. So4 this, in fact, is exactly part of the habeas -- this is5 part of the second or successive determinations that --6 applications that Congress wanted to bar.7 And we have to step back and think about what8 would happen here. What we have is the State of Florida9 coming up 23 years after a guilty plea not because to10 defend -- once again, it's judgment. It's conviction not11 because of anything they did in the conduct of the trial,12 not because the guy claims to be actually innocent, but13 because almost 2 decades after the plea, a Federal court14 allegedly made a mistake of law that wasn't cleared up15 through the appellate process. That's not the point of16 Federal habeas corpus. That's not what it's supposed to17 be about.18 But if we open the door, if we let the camel's19 nose in the tent, a camel is going to come behind it, and20 it's going to be procedural default, non-retroactivity of21 Teague, and all of the multiple other grounds on which22 Federal habeas decisions are made by courts.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Federal court make a24 mistake of -- of law if the -- if the Florida court25 dismissed under the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS.

MILLETT:  Right.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But do you agree with Mr.Kise that the first dismissal in the Florida court, thefirst denial was on the Florida 2-year statute oflimitations?          MS. MILLETT:  My -- the order from the court, myunderstanding, simply denied it on the grounds of legalinsufficiency, and it didn't give a further explanation.It doesn't say what exact grounds was, but if you look towhat was argued by Florida, they were arguing ontimeliness.Millett.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.Mr. Rashkind, you have 4 minutes left. 521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. RASHKIND:  Thank you, Your Honor.          If I may begin by correcting what I think aretwo inadvertent mistakes, but important ones.          Justice Ginsburg, in answer to your questionabout the first State habeas, these are -- these documentsare contained in --joint appendix 2-5.          The firstin your record.  They're noted atState habeas was dismissed because itwas not notarized.dismissal:  it was not notarized.That's the sole basis for its          The second one was brought and denied, and thecourt specifically notes, as we note in the yellow brief,footnote 7 on page 12, it set forth the -- the court'sgrounds.  It says the motion does not state grounds forrelief.          At no point does Florida ever adopt the State'sposition that either of the petitions was untimely.  TheState court addressed them directly on the merits.          Justice Breyer, if I may, I can actuallyhypothesize several examples under subsection (5), ofsubsection (4), and perhaps even subsection (2) of rule60(b), which would be permissible.  For example, under(5), a judgment that should no longer have continuing531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 effect might be that the district court entered an2 alternative writ of habeas corpus, tried the defendant3 within 60 days or 90 days, or set him free. And when4 everyone gets back to State court, it becomes plainly5 apparent that can't be done within 60 days, and either the6 State or the defendant might go back and say, please,7 amend that order out of time. It's a final order. Please8 amend it to make it 180 days.9 We can come up with examples, I think, for each10 of the provisions, and I think that's really what's11 interesting about this rule. It is written in a way12 that's durable against AEDPA, and it conforms nicely with13 AEDPA. And it does not take a lot of extra thought, it14 does not take a lot more than adopting the Court's15 previous holdings for us to be able to make it workable16 within AEDPA.17 The fact that this case is now in its 25th year18 is a result of law and not of delay. Mr. Gonzalez alleges19 -- and no one has ever been able to say otherwise because20 we've never had a hearing -- that it took him 13 years to21 find out about the newly discovered evidence. He22 exhausted his claims for 4 years. He was only in Federal23 court for 1 year before the State raised a bar, a statute24 of limitations bar, which turns out to be incorrect. In25 the last 7 years, there's been litigation both in the541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 court of appeals and now before this Court caused by the2 State's argument that the case should have been dismissed3 on the statute of limitations.4 My client is not responsible for the fact that5 it's the 25th year, but what we do know about this case is6 he has approximately 76 years remaining on his 99-year7 sentence. And unless he gets one bite at the habeas8 apple, he has not gotten what Congress directed he9 receive. Congress made one thing clear in AEDPA, and I10 think it's a good thing, and that is, if a defendant goes11 through and does what he's supposed to do in State court,12 he does not procedurally default the issues, he exhausts13 fully, and he timely files a petition, that was the14 candidate Congress wanted to have to get habeas review.15 In this case Aurelio Gonzalez did all of those16 things, and he sits on the outside, having been told you17 get no bite at the apple, it's too late. And that's just18 plain wrong. And there's something wrong about that, and19 that's why there's rule 60(b).20 60(b) is nothing but a coalescence of many great21 writs that were designed for one purpose and one purpose22 alone and that was to correct mistakes in extraordinary23 circumstances. There can be no more extraordinary24 circumstance than that a person is denied their right to25 habeas review, and that's what's happened here.
