CHATMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Ninth Circuit decision in the court belowwas wrong, for three reasons.  It adopted a rule thatfrustrates Congress's intent to protect Federal Courtsfrom hearing stale claims and to respect the finalityof State Court convictions.  It does so by improperlyand arbitrarily adopting a conclusive presumption thatmisunderstands or ignores State law and practice.  Andit is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Careyversus Saffold.          If the Federal Courts, on the other hand,complete their analysis of the Federal question oftolling the AEDPA statute of limitations by decidingwhether a State petition was timely before grantingtolling, it can properly dismiss more Federal petitionson statute-of-limitations grounds and can avoidlitigating stale claims on the merits.  Any3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 difficulties in doing so can be ameliorated by the2 limited nature of the State-law inquiry and adoption of3 a 60-day presumption of timeliness.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's something --5 where would we -- we would just pick that number, that6 --7 MS. CHATMAN: The 60 days?8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Because that's a9 normal appeal period?10 MS. CHATMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, when11 California does look to timeliness in proceeding from12 one lower court to a higher court, then we see that it13 contemplates that a -- that a litigant will proceed in14 60 days or less, because -- and the reason we have to15 turn to analogies is because nothing in California law16 requires the appellate courts in State habeas to look17 to that particular period of time between the lower18 court decision and proceeding to that court, because19 they're courts of original jurisdiction. So, they look20 at how long the prisoner proceeded from conviction to21 their court, as a whole.22 But the reason that we need to figure out23 this period is because this Court, in Carey versus24 Saffold, has said that our system functions enough like25 an appellate system to bring those periods into the4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425tolling provision.  So, when --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, can't --          MS. CHATMAN:  -- we look --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the -- can't theCalifornia courts adopt a -- give us a 60-day rule, ora 30-day rule, or a 90-day rule?  And if they don't doit, why should we do it?          MS. CHATMAN:  Up to this point, they have notdone so.  And I think that is because, as I said, theyare looking at the time from conviction.  How long didit take the prisoner to get to their court with theirclaims?  And how -- and how long they take properlyproceeding up the ladder through the courts is just onefactor that they look at.  And they --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know how this cameabout.  I mean -- I mean, I'm asking both sides thesame question.  It'll sound very favorable to you, butif you answer it just yes, because it's favorable toyou, I might learn, later, I was wrong, and you won'thave had a chance to answer.  So, I want your honestopinion on this.  I don't know how this happened.  AndI don't know -- did you ask for en banc?          MS. CHATMAN:  I'm sorry, how the 3-year delayhappened?JUSTICE BREYER: No. I don't know how the 5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 California Court could have read the opinion -- which,2 of course, I wrote for the Court, so maybe I am reading3 things into it that weren't there -- but I don't know4 how any judge could read that opinion we wrote and come5 to this conclusion. I thought that it said, you know,6 on -- that there are three issues -- what's the word7 "pending"? Does the word "pending" apply to the time8 period between when the lower court decides a case and9 you appeal? That's typically 20 days or 30 days.10 MS. CHATMAN: Correct.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Are those 20 days or 30 days12 counted in the tolling period? I thought part one13 clearly said the answer is yes. Then we looked at14 California, and they don't have the words "20 days" or15 "30 days." They say "reasonable time." And then we16 said, "Still applies, because 'reasonable time' is17 probably 20 or 30 days." They don't have a radically18 different rule; it's a similar rule. Then we come to19 part three, and it says, "This is 45 days." There's --20 no 4 and a half months, wasn't it?212223 days. 2425MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.JUSTICE BREYER:  This isn't just 20 or 30MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.JUSTICE BREYER:  So, is it timely?6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.2 JUSTICE BREYER: And, there, I thought the3 Court said -- I mean, I was reading it -- say, "Well,4 it's hard to say, because there might have been excuses5 for the delay." What about the words that were written6 there, "on the merits"?7 MS. CHATMAN: And there was an equitable- --8 JUSTICE BREYER: On --9 MS. CHATMAN: -- -tolling question.10 JUSTICE BREYER: But that had nothing to --11 MS. CHATMAN: Right.12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- do with the case. The13 lack of diligence had nothing to do with this aspect of14 the case. But, what about the words "on the merits"?15 And there, what I think the court wrote is that the16 fact that it says "on the merits" doesn't prove it --17 what -- it doesn't prove that it was timely. Why? And18 then I listed a bunch of reasons. There are reasons.19 Sometimes courts say "on the merits," even though it's20 delayed. All right? They say "on the merits." Or21 because they want to tell the prisoner or -- there are22 a lot of reasons why, all of which are listed. So, we23 send it back to see whether this 4-and-a-half-month24 delay, given the excuses, was still timely. We -- all25 right?7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. CHATMAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now --          MS. CHATMAN:  Justice --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- we now get a case whereit's 3 years.          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And the court says, "It'stimely, because they used the word 'on the merits.'"But I thought -- I said, in the opinion, I thought thecourt adopted that the words "on the merits" do notdecide the matter.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't it --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what do you --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- worse than that?          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- do in thosecircumstances?          MS. CHATMAN:  Justice Breyer, Icould notagree --JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but did --MS. CHATMAN:  -- with you more.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you ask for                                          rehearing enbanc?  Because any judge, including me, can make a     mistake.  What did you do?               MS. CHATMAN:  We petitioned for certiorari inthis Court.8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: And you didn't ask for a2 hearing en banc.34567 judge can 8MS. CHATMAN:  No, we did not.JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why, when you --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- get a fair -- because anymake a mistake --MS. CHATMAN:  The --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- why don't you just go and910 ask the Ninth Circuit to say, "Look, this is not --11 read the opinion, read what they said. Correct it."12 MS. CHATMAN: This is not the first time that13 we have tried to take that approach with the Ninth14 Circuit on this issue. They -- on remand, in Saffold15 versus Carey, they made the same mistake, and the16 rehearing has got us nowhere -- asking for a rehearing.17 And so, we felt that in order to get this clarified as18 soon as possible, it seems futile to ask for rehearing19 when on the -- when we had not been successful before.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Well this --21 MS. CHATMAN: This is, by the way --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- this case is different,23 actually, from the one that Justice Breyer put,24 because, in this case, the California Supreme Court25 didn't say --9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- "on the merits."  It saidnothing at all.  It just disposed of it.  So, thequestion presented is quite different.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It's worse.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's whether -- not whetherit can be, nonetheless, timely when they say "on themerits," but whether it can be, nonetheless, timelywhen they don't say anything at all.          MS. CHATMAN:  But --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would think it's an afortiori case, in other words.          MS. CHATMAN:  And the Ninth Circuit istreating it as if it were the same sort of decisionthat was before this Court in Carey versus Saffold.  Itis a decision on the merits.  And they are reading thatas excluding any other possible grounds that might haveexisted for the denial in that case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  You're representing theattorney general of California, and you have a lot oflitigation in the Ninth Circuit.  It's -- I mean, theother side's going to answer on the merits, if theycan.  And they're in an awkward position here, Iunderstand.  But I need to know what to -- what do youthink we should do?  I mean, here, we write an opinion,10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and they --          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it seems to perhaps,inadvertently or not -- and the reason I turn to youis, judges are busy, they have huge dockets --          MS. CHATMAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And, often, unless it's veryclearly pointed out by the lawyers, or the lawyers takeaction, you get -- waste everybody's time and money.          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think theanswer is to instruct the Federal Courts that, whenthey're undertaking this inquiry of whether anapplication is pending during the intervals, a Federalquestion that has a State-law component, then they mustapply the State law to figure out if it's timely.  And,you know, as this Court said in Carey the -- versusSaffold -- it's a matter of whether it's timely; it'snot a matter of the basis of the State Court decision. And in the context of California, I think the answeris to adopt a presumption of 60 days, because that isthe most analogous --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In -- even if, as healleged, he was unable to do anything in --          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is a layperson.  He11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 said, "I tripped in the intermediate appellate court,2 because I didn't do any research. And so, I wanted to3 do better, but they gave me a job where, during the4 hours that the library was open" --5 MS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "I had to be at work.7 And that's why it took me all this time."8 MS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, is that -- suppose10 the prison locks down someone and says, "You can't go to11 the library."12 MS. CHATMAN: This is an easy decision for13 the Federal Court, even on these facts. Okay, this14 Petitioner has taken longer than 60 days, and he's15 offered an explanation. But if you look at his16 explanation, on its face, it's completely inadequate to17 account for a 3-year delay, because he doesn't take18 action to get -- to get library access for an entire19 year after the Court of Appeals decision denying his20 application is issued. Then he spends 3 months, quite21 correctly, going through the administrative procedures22 of the prison to get a job change. And he does, in23 fact, get a job change 3 months later -- about 3 months24 later. Then, he waits still more than another year25 before he files his petition in the California Supreme12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court presenting essentially the same claims, samefacts, same law.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, in other words, hedelays, after he gets the library access, for an extrayear.          MS. CHATMAN:  Yes, he does.  Now, he --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is there any excusethey're making for that?  Because if you don't tell me,they're --          MS. CHATMAN:  Later on --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- going to tell me.          MS. CHATMAN:  -- later on, once he gets toFederal Court --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.          MS. CHATMAN:  -- he offers the explanationthat the prison was on lockdowns.  There are severalproblems with that assertion; the first being, itwasn't presented to the State Court, so it's -- itcannot cure his State untimeliness.  The second beingthat he doesn't offer specific dates or explain how itprevented him from filing his petition.  And the thirdproblem is that State prisons provide procedures duringlockdowns to get library materials to prisoners.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I ask a rather probablysort of stupid question?  But I gather there are a13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425large number of these cases disposed of by a postcard. Would there be anything wrong if the CaliforniaSupreme Court said, "We're going to have two postcards. One says that 'the delay was unreasonable, denied';and the other said, 'there's nothing to the merits,denied'" -- you use two postcards -- wouldn't that solveall the problems?          MS. CHATMAN:  The problem with that is --certainly, it would solve things, but the problem withthat is, it would require the -- require the Californiacourts to make both of those determinations in everycase.  And, as it is now, they use a procedure muchlike --JUSTICE STEVENS: But they could adopt a 60- day rule, or a 90-day rule, and then just, when they decided to not follow the rule, they'd put a check on - - say, "Well, we did look at the merits in this case."          MS. CHATMAN:  They could do that --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Under our current law, itwouldn't make any difference, would it?  Because even ifthey sent the "on the merits" postcard, Carey versusSaffold says --          MS. CHATMAN:  Correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it doesn't matter.          MS. CHATMAN:  That's true.  And that is why I14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 say they would have to make both determinations,2 because --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, may --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it might --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- may I -- no, go ahead.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to7 say, it might matter if they had another postcard that8 said it's untimely, and they didn't send that. That9 would be a whole different situation, right?10 MS. CHATMAN: That's true, but we are -- we11 are engaging here in trying to tell the California12 State Courts how to dispose of these cases, which I am13 really not sure is an appropriate thing for us to do.14 They're --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but --16 MS. CHATMAN: -- using a --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we --18 MS. CHATMAN: -- procedure --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we decided it -- it20 was at least appropriate to give a hint, aren't we in a21 little bit better position than you suggested, in the22 light of Carey? Because in -- is -- correct me if I'm23 wrong, but I thought, in Carey, the State order was not24 merely that it was on the merits, but that it was on25 the merits and it was untimely. In other words, it15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425said A and B.  And we said, you know, "That'sambiguous," to start with, and then we went on andsaid, "You know, sometimes 'merits' don't mean merits." But if the State were to revise its procedure and say,"We're either going to say A or we're going to say B,and that's our reason," and they said, "It's on themerits" or "it's untimely," wouldn't it make sense forus, even in the light of Carey, to say, "Okay, we'llaccept that as the -- as the State's reason"?          MS. CHATMAN:  If they were to do that.  But Idon't anticipate the State Courts adopting thatpractice, because it would double their work.  Theywould have to make both decisions, merits anduntimeliness.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't --          MS. CHATMAN:  It --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- see why.  If they'regoing to follow something like a prima facie 60-dayrule, and it's -- it's on day 65, all they've got tosay is, "It's untimely."          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, in this --          MS. CHATMAN:  But the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- in this case, in order todetermine it was untimely, they would have presumablyhad to have gone into the factual analysis of whether16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a2 year after getting the materials, and all of that3 stuff. So, it's a lot easier for them, when the merits4 of it seem to them absolutely clear, to simply deny it5 on the merits and not reach the "timely" question.6 MS. CHATMAN: And that --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the "timely" question is8 still before Federal Courts. That's what we said in9 Carey versus Saffold. So --10 MS. CHATMAN: I agree. And they --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- although they can avoid12 it, we can't.13 MS. CHATMAN: And that -- and that is the way14 the State Courts are approaching these cases. They,15 for the most part, will look first for a prima facie16 case, and in -- much like the Federal Courts do in17 Federal habeas under Rule 4, where they scream for18 frivolous petitions that can be dismissed outright19 without asking for a response from the warden or20 instituting briefing, then they can deny those21 summarily. And the reason why they cannot just decide22 timeliness is because then the Ninth Circuit will23 interpret that as not reaching the merits, and we will24 have a problem of deference. So, if they were to25 decide one explicitly, they'd have to decide the other,17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the way things stand now.  And I --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I --          MS. CHATMAN:  -- as a --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- I must say, I don'tquite follow the -- why couldn't they simply say it'suntimely?  Wouldn't that -- that it -- there was -- itwas not pending during this period, because it -- 3years elapsed, and that's unreasonable.  Wouldn't thatend the case?          MS. CHATMAN:  It would, but it's not a State-law question.  They don't -- whether it's pendingduring that period is not a --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I understand --          MS. CHATMAN:  -- State law --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- but whether --          MS. CHATMAN:  -- question, because --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- it was a reasonable timeto file is a State-law question.          MS. CHATMAN:  Whether he took a reasonabletime from the lower -- from time of conviction to theircourt is the only State-law question --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, isn't the --          MS.

CHATMAN:  -- original --18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- California Supreme Court2 sometimes decide that the time between the intermediate3 court's decision and the filing in the California4 Supreme Court -- don't they ask whether that was5 reasonable?6 MS. CHATMAN: I have --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Or they only relate it back8 to the day of the conviction?9 MS. CHATMAN: I have only seen one case in10 California where they specifically addressed that11 particular interval because the Attorney General raised12 it, and that's Moss -- In Re Moss, which is cited13 in the red brief.14 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask that, if you had15 a case in which the Attorney General raised the -- say,16 this case, and yet -- and say California Supreme Court17 wrote an opinion in which it said, "Now, 3 years has18 gone by, but the prisoner has given us a very elaborate19 explanation," as Justice Ginsburg suggested, "and we20 find that explanation sufficient; therefore, we21 conclude that, even though it was 3 years, it was a22 reasonable time; and, therefore, we're going to address23 the merits. And we now address the merits and say you24 lose." Now, in that case, would it be pending, for our25 purposes?19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. CHATMAN: Yes, because the State Court2 found it timely, and that would be --3 JUSTICE BREYER: It would? I thought --4 MS. CHATMAN: -- that would be --5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that was --6 MS. CHATMAN: -- the end of --7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- an open --8 MS. CHATMAN: -- the matter.9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- question, frankly. I10 mean, I can't imagine California would do this, but I11 guess if California did say that, "The period of time12 between the time you lost in the District Court and the13 time you filed, in every other State, is 30 days, but,14 in California, it's a reasonable time. And what we15 mean by a 'reasonable time' is 3 years, without any16 excuses" -- I guess, then, maybe the dissent in Carey17 v. Saffold would have been right in respect to that.18 MS. CHATMAN: If --19 JUSTICE BREYER: It would have said that that20 isn't pending under Federal law, whether California21 says it or not. So, the role of the Federal law versus22 the State law, I thought we left open.23 MS. CHATMAN: I think this Court, in Carey24 versus Saffold, and in Pace versus DiGuglielmo, has25 stressed the importance of deferring to State-law20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 determinations --2 3 4 5 67 Congress8 have thought they did have in mind a --9 MS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.JUSTICE BREYER:  But you can't --MS. CHATMAN:  -- State Court --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- defer to something --MS. CHATMAN:  -- determinations.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- under this statute, wherewrote the word "pending."  And I wouldn't10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- State that says, "It's11 pending, even though you have no excuse and didn't file12 anything for 3 years, your appeal." Now, I haven't13 heard that fully briefed and so forth, so I hesitate to14 express a final conclusion on it. But it --15 MS. CHATMAN: Well, it's --16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- since it's never going to17 come up, I don't think, I don't know I have to have a18 final conclusion.19 MS. CHATMAN: I don't think so. But it's20 pending -- it's pending while -- if it's timely under21 State law. And if the State Court has already spoken22 to State law, I don't know that there's a question left23 for the Federal Court. I think -- I think they say,24 "Okay, this was timely, and, therefore, pending during25 the interval." But --21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, you want us to applya presumption that a petition is timely if it's filedwithin 60 days.  But California doesn't apply such apresumption, does it?          MS. CHATMAN:  No, it does --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And --          MS. CHATMAN:  -- not, but --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- where do we get that?I mean, where does that come from?          MS. CHATMAN:  Where that comes from is, ifyou look to the closest analogous State procedures --say, direct appeal from a conviction -- then you'reallowed 60 days to go to the next -- to the appellatecourt.  Similarly, if the State appeals the grant ofhabeas relief -- the State, unlike the defendant, canappeal -- then the State gets 60 days.  So, whenCalifornia thinks -- when California quantifies theconcept of reasonableness in the appellate context,they do so in terms of 60 days or less.  And I say "orless," because State habeas is actually supposed to bea quicker process than the appellate process.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, shouldn't we leaveit to California to adopt such a presumption?          MS.that, becauseCHATMAN:  California's not going to doit's not a State-law question.  It's just22Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400￼1 not a State-law question. But it's -- I think it's2 acceptable for a Federal Court to adopt a presumption3 to assist 456them in deciding a State-law issue, much --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What --MS. CHATMAN:  -- the way.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- good would the --would the presumption do if it's just a7 what good8 presumption? Presumably, if it's a presumption, the9 prisoner is --10 MS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- going to say,12 "Well, here's why you shouldn't follow the presumption13 in my case," just as, if it looks like he's waited a14 long time, he's going to say, "Well, here's why that15 delay was reasonable." I don't know that the16 presumption you're proposing serves much of a purpose.17 MS. CHATMAN: The value of a 60-day18 presumption is that it saves the Federal Court from19 having to look at the State-law time -- of the20 timeliness in that particular case and --21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it doesn't --22 MS. CHATMAN: -- it ought --23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- not if the24 prisoner says, "Here's why you shouldn't follow the25 presumption."23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. CHATMAN: Well, that's true. But if it -2 - but if he files within 60 days, there's no need to3 look further or consider his argument regarding4 timeliness. And the other value in the 60-day --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why phrase it as a6 presumption? Why not phrase it, "We determine7 California law to be, unless we hear otherwise, having8 examined what it does in other situations, that 60 days9 is timely"?10 MS. CHATMAN: I think that would be perfectly11 fair.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same thing. But I13 wouldn't call it --14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a presumption.16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that's a --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then --18 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that's --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and then the -- you know,20 the incarcerated individual can come forward with21 excuses and say that, "California would make an22 exception to the 60-day rule for this," and we're back23 where we were.24 MS. CHATMAN: Well, that would be fair, and25 it would accomplish the other thing that I offered the24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242560-day presumption to accomplish, is to offer a sort ofsafe harbor where the Petitioner knows that he getstolling for 60 days, and need not file a protectivepetition.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it would --          MS. CHATMAN:  So, it alleviates that problem.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- it would -- it would befair, but to call it a finding of California State lawis a -- would be a bit of a stretch, wouldn't it?  Imean, you -- you've made a perfectly good argument thatit would be a sensible rule for California --          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- to adopt, would not besensible for us to adopt.  But I'd have a hard timesaying that I could justify it as a statement ofcurrent California law, and I'm --          MS. CHATMAN:  Well --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Am I missing something?          MS. CHATMAN:  Well, Justice Souter, I thinkit works very well as a presumption adopted by theFederal Courts for ease of administrability and, youknow, at the same time, reflecting State law.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, the --          MS. CHATMAN:  But the --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you're back to the25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 presumption. But --2 MS. CHATMAN: Right. But --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but if --4 MS. CHATMAN: -- but the one thing --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we're going to go6 further and say, "Oh, well, we find that that's what7 the State law is, unless they tell us differently,"8 that's where I'm having trouble.9 MS. CHATMAN: Well, it's not very different10 from when the Federal Courts adopt a State statute of11 limitations --121314151617 There's a 18JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but we --MS. CHATMAN:  -- for a Federal --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- know what it --MS. CHATMAN:  -- cause of action.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- we know what it is.State statute of limitations.  It says --MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- 3 years.MS. CHATMAN:  Well --JUSTICE SOUTER:  We don't have anything likeMS. CHATMAN:  By analogy, you know that thetime for seeking direct appeal is 60 days.-- it's deciding something by analogy, in2619202122 that here. 2324 period of25 So, it isAlderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 much the same way the Federal Courts do for a Federal2 cause of action that has no statute of limitations.3 JUSTICE BREYER: How many cases are there on4 habeas in California every year, about?5 MS. CHATMAN: Oh.6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I mean about. Just give7 me the rough ballpark.8 MS. CHATMAN: I would -- there are about9 8,000, I would say.10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, the -- in11 the Supreme Court.1213 would say 1415 there are 1617181920 I'm doing21 pass a law, is what it would be. Write a rule, write a22 presumption. I have no idea what I'm doing there.23 They've worked out a system. But I don't -- why24 doesn't it work just to say to the lower courts, "Do25 your job"? What we said -- and maybe it wasn't27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MS. CHATMAN:  No.  In the Supreme Court, Iit is more like about 2500.JUSTICE BREYER:  So, there are 25- -- soseveral thousand cases every year.MS. CHATMAN:  Thousands.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Thousands.MS. CHATMAN:  Thousands.JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, I don't know whatwith California procedure when I pass a --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425expressed clearly -- maybe -- "Courts, look, it says'reasonable time.'  All right?  Now, reasonable time,in every other State is 30 days, sometimes 20 days."          MS. CHATMAN:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE BREYER:  "Sometimes the most, 60days.  So, look and see if it was filed within areasonable time.  That's all.  And if California passes-- some specific thing says something special about it,of course, pay attention to that."  What's wrong withthat?  They just would do it like they do any otherthing of deciding what happens in --          MS. CHATMAN:  That is -- that is exactly whatI would ask this Court to do.  Exactly -- is to --Federal Courts take on this Federal question of tollingand complete the analysis by applying State law to findout if these petitions were timely filed in merittolling.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is "reasonable time" theissue, or is it what California would consider a"reasonable time"?  I mean, that's the problem.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that is the problem.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We're not --          MS. CHATMAN:  It --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- making up, for ourselves,what's a reasonable time. If California says a year is 28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 a reasonable time, that would be the reasonable time at2 issue, wouldn't it?3 MS. CHATMAN: I don't think it would be, in4 light of --56 State law 789-- in light of the analogousthat you only get 60 days to --JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but if --MS. CHATMAN:  -- appeal, but --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the California Supreme10 Court says, "Despite all of these, in this kind of a11 situation, we think a year is a reasonable time" --12 MS. CHATMAN: But they --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you --14 MS. CHATMAN: -- haven't said so. The -- of15 course, you --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but if they said so17 --18 MS. CHATMAN: If they said so --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that would be binding --20 MS. CHATMAN: -- if they had --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on us, wouldn't it?22 MS. CHATMAN: If they said so, then we'd have23 State law, and we would have to apply that. But we24 don't.25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would you have to 29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 apply that? It's a Federal question whether the claim2 is pending or not during that whole period, right?3 MS. CHATMAN: Of -- certainly it is.4 Certainly it is. But, at the end of the analysis,5 there is a little bit of State-law analysis. It has to6 be timely under State law. And if California Supreme7 Court tells us more about what's timely under their8 reasonableness standard, then I think you would have to9 take that1011 diligence12 California's timeliness standards, I don't think13 "reasonableness" and "due diligence" mean anything14 different at the Federal courthouse in Sacramento than15 they do at the State Court of Appeal five blocks away,16 or in this Court. It's -- these are common terms that17 are used in the law all the time.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? I19 think our opinion the last time around suggested that20 possibility would certify into the California --21 MS. CHATMAN: Uh-huh.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Supreme Court, and that23 was not done. Was any other effort made that you can24 tell us about? Maybe you should, off the record, but25 to try and get the guidance of the California Supreme30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005into account.But the concept of reasonableness and duethat are employed in States -- in￼1 Court on the -- on the State-law problem here? Has2 anybody suggested to the court they might adopt a rule3 or a different practice or anything like that?4 MS. CHATMAN: Your Honor, yes, we have5 suggested that. The California Supreme Court -- and,6 as you said, this is not within the record -- the7 California -- but, if I may, the California Supreme8 Court has declined to adopt a rule. They think it's a9 political question that has to be decided by the10 Legislature. And the Legislature, to date, has not11 adopted a rule or -- not a rule, a statute of12 limitations for these cases. And I have to say that,13 if they undertook that, then there would be certain14 costs to doing that, as well. You know, we would -- we15 would -- we would ease this issue, but we would16 confront the cost of considerable litigation, I would17 imagine, if we adopted a new statute for collateral18 relief in California. So, there's a cost to doing19 that, that might outweigh the benefits of --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.21 MS. CHATMAN: -- clarifying this issue.22 If I may reserve my time?23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.24 Mr. Stris.25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT2 MR. STRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it3 please the Court:4 In light of Justice Breyer's questions, I5 feel compelled to begin with a brief explanation of why6 this case is a necessary consequence of Saffold. And,7 although it wasn't my initial intention to speak8 plainly, what I would suggest is that the problem is9 not the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case, but,10 rather, California's timeliness standards. And the11 problem that's presented by this case is one of Federal12 line-drawing. And it presents serious federalism,13 comity, and fairness concerns. And if we could step14 back from the facts of this case for a moment -- and I15 will discuss them -- I think it -- I hope, at least, it16 will become clear that the Ninth Circuit, in light of17 what it's dealing with in California, adopted the only18 sensible rule.19 So, the place to begin in answering some of20 your questions, Justice Breyer, is with California's21 timeliness standards. And to give some background, I22 would start with the principle that was articulated in23 the Warden's brief and that the California Supreme24 Court has articulated, which is that California does25 enforce its timeliness standards. It's usually done by32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- in the summary-denial context, by citing to In re2 Swain or In re Robbins --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I missed it. You said the4 problem is, California doesn't "support" or "import"?5 I just didn't --6 7 8 9MR. STRIS:  Oh, I --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- hear your word.MR. STRIS:  -- apologize.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- the -- I just didn'tyou said.MR. STRIS:  What I had said is that10 hear what 1112 California does enforce its --13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Enforce.14 MR. STRIS: -- timeliness standards. And the15 way they customarily do that --16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what are those17 standards, please?18 MR. STRIS: Okay. The standards are that a19 prisoner must file within a reasonable time. And that20 requires a two-part inquiry, Justice O'Connor. The21 first part is, Was there substantial delay? It's22 determined based upon a set standard, when the delay23 begins. But California's never articulated any24 standards for what period of time constitutes25 "substantial." That's the first problem. It's33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 essentially an ad hoc determination that's made by2 individual California Courts. And that's why former3 Justice Brown described that as "an abstraction," and4 former Justice Moss described it as "vague and5 indeterminate at its very core." But that's what the6 Ninth Circuit is dealing with when it reviews these7 cases.8 So, to put it context for a moment, the way9 the State Courts do enforce this on a case-by-case10 basis, to be practical, is, the State Supreme Court11 often summarily dismisses cases on procedural bars,12 including timeliness. And, to give you some statistics13 from the Warden's brief, in 2004 there were 1,22314 unexplained summary denials -- in other words, just15 denied -- and there were 1,174 denials with a citation16 to a case. And this is significant, because this means17 that, in about half of the cases in 2004 that went to18 the California Supreme Court, they enforced one of19 their procedural bars, and, in many of them, it was20 timeliness.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. A case that was a22 procedural-bar case?23 MR. STRIS: I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I24 follow the --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you --34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. STRIS:  -- question, Justice.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you could summarily denyand cite a case that showed you were denying on themerits.          MR. STRIS:  Oh.  What I -- what I wassuggesting is that there were 1,174 cases that wereprocedural-bar cases, where it said --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where they cited aprocedural-bar case.          MR. STRIS:  That's correct.          It would say, "Denied, In Re Swain," meaningdenied for being untimely.  As opposed, JusticeScalia, to the 1,223 cases that wereunexplained.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this could be --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But, now, maybe I'm --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- just one point, if Imay, Justice Breyer -- those are the California SupremeCourt or California appellate court?Court.MR. STRIS:  That's the California SupremeJUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you.MR. STRIS:  Okay.JUSTICE BREYER:  So, the difficulty  oflooking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I 35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we2 wrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here.3 First, which was bothering me, had to do with our4 Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be5 simple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm6 not sure about it. The other, which is much more7 interesting, is what you're talking about.8 All right, now, on the first one, I read the9 words. It says the words "on the merits." The Ninth10 Circuit thought those three words meant that the11 California Supreme Court could not have considered the12 petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the13 merits, just as with the cite. Now, whether these14 words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we15 wrote. The next words were, "There are many plausible16 answers to this question." Sometimes, a court17 addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was18 presented in an untimely way. Why? Because they don't19 present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does,20 or because it wants to give the reviewing court21 alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just22 wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim23 on the merits. He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer.24 He gets a postcard. That helps him. So, there are a25 lot of reasons. And it says, "Conclusion." Given the36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 variety of reasons why they might have put the words2 "on the merits," the fact that they are there, those3 words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was4 timely. So, then I read what they wrote. What they5 wrote is, "When the California Court denies a habeas6 petition without comment or citation, we have long7 treated the denial as a decision on the merits." Okay?8 And then it cites a pre-Carey case. "Therefore, the9 summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was10 not dismissed as untimely," citing two pre-Carey cases.11 Now, I don't see how, since I just said the12 words "on the merits do not end the issue" -- here, the13 words weren't even there, but they say, "We're treating14 it as if they were, and that ends the issue." So, what15 do we do about that?16 Then the next question, once I figure that17 one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're18 raising, which is quite important and interesting and19 so forth?20 MR. STRIS: Okay. Well, as to the first21 question, the explanation that you just provided22 clearly requires the Federal Courts, when there's some23 indication from the State Court that it might have been24 untimely, to look into it. And that was the very25 problem with what the Ninth Circuit did in that case.37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 It said "on the merits and for lack of diligence." So,2 to presume that that was just on the merits, that's3 flatly wrong. You'd need to do some further4 investigation.5 In light of the context of what's happening6 in California, however, when the State Court says7 nothing, there has to be some process by which the8 Federal Court can make a decision as to what that9 means, because if, in fact, in that case it was denied10 on the merits and the State Court thought it was11 timely, it would be extremely invasive for the Federal12 Court to re-review the case, potentially come to a13 different conclusion, and, we would suggest,14 dramatically alter the landscape of how prisoners15 exhaust their remedies in California, because now16 you're developing a Federal body of law that may be17 very different in deciding what's substantial and18 what's reasonable than California did. And so, what19 the Ninth Circuit, I believe, did in this case was look20 to context and come up with the presumption that was21 most reasonable in light of what's going on.22 So, the first thing that is relevant, from a23 --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that the most25 reasonable presumption? Why isn't the most reasonable38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 presumption that the California Court denies, for2 untimeliness, wherever that issue is absolutely clear -3-4 MR. STRIS: The --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and where that issue is6 not absolutely clear, and the -- and the merits issue7 is absolutely clear, it just -- it just denies?8 MR. STRIS: The answer -- pardon me --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't want to say10 "denied on the merits," because that would suggest that11 it was timely.12 MR. STRIS: The answer, I would suggest,13 Justice Scalia, requires looking to California14 practice. And where I would start is with the15 California Supreme Court's decision in In re Sanders.16 And in In re Sanders, the Court made clear that after17 the Supreme Court adopted their policies in 198918 regarding certain presumptions in capital cases, and19 after the seminal In re Clark case in 1993, which20 asserted -- rather, articulated California's timeliness21 standards, most petitions -- and these are the22 California Supreme Court's words -- "Most petitions are23 timely filed." So, with that backdrop and the fact24 that half of the California Supreme Court's cases are25 being denied with a case citation, it's reasonable to39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 conclude that the unexplained denials are not2 necessarily untimely.3 Now, I would add to that --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what it --5 "most" is 51 percent. I mean, among those that you6 don't know whether it was the merits or not, there7 could be a lot of ones where the timeliness is simply8 not decided upon.9 MR. STRIS: It's certainly the case, Justice10 Scalia, that the presumptions the Ninth Circuit adopted11 could permit cases that even the California State12 Courts would consider to be untimely --13 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could work with14 that. Now, that's, sort of, helpful, because if they15 say "most16 would be,17 18are timely filed," then the next question"All right, what period of time is it?"MR. STRIS:  Well, that's the --JUSTICE BREYER:  You'd have to get someto go through these cases, and they could --19 professor20 they could figure out how long it is. What do you21 think it is, from your experience?22 MR. STRIS: I can't really answer that, and23 that's at the heart of --24 JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, is it more like25 a month, or is it more like 3 years?40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. STRIS:  Well, the reason I would suggestthat -- and answering that is not necessarilyappropriate or helpful in resolving the question -- isbecause of the series of cases that we quoted infootnote 15 of our brief.  In certain instances, theCalifornia Courts have found 3 and a half years, 1 anda half years, 2 years to be reasonable.  Now, thatdoesn't mean --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?          MR. STRIS:  In one instance, it was becauseof attorney abandonment.  In other cases, it wasbecause the prisoner was indigent.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, there's a specialreason.  In your case, is there really a year thatisn't explained at all?          MR. STRIS:  Oh, I think it would apply to ourcase, as well.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?          MR. STRIS:  In our case, the first 15 months--          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, forget that.  Thelibrary, I'll give you.  What's the rest?          MR. STRIS:  After that, our client waseffectively on lockdown and had no access whatsoever tothe library.  Now, this presents the burden problem41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with doing any sort of independent determination.  TheAttorney General suggested, in the District Court, thatthere was a paging system in place whereby prisonerswho are on lockdown could get access to the library.There was never any suggestion in the District Court onthe part of the Attorney General that the lockdowndidn't exist.  And the Attorney General, and not myclient, would have access to those records.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- well, did your -- didyour client file an affidavit or something saying hedidn't have access to the library during the wholeperiod of 3 years?          MR. STRIS:  I wouldn't call it an affidavit,but it was -- he filed an opposition to the motion todismiss.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well --          MR. STRIS:  And --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is there anything in therecord that says, during the year after they said,"We'll change your job so you can get access to thelibrary," that he didn't have access to the library?          MR. STRIS:  Yes.  I -- well, I -- he didn'ttalk about not having access to the library.  It'simplicit, if you look at the Joint Appendix at --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right, so what's 42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 his reason for saying that, "Last year, I was not able2 to file a petition in California Supreme Court"?3 MR. STRIS: That he had had -- had access to4 nothing. In other words, he didn't say, "I didn't have5 access" --6 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what does it say? What7 does he say? Go ahead.8 MR. STRIS: Well, it would be on the Joint9 Appendix, pages 38 and 39, where he describes the10 lockdown. And, you know, I haven't looked at it11 recently, but my understanding is that he was12 suggesting that he had had access to nothing, including13 the prison library. And the Attorney General suggests14 that there was a paging system, but the documentary15 evidence that the Attorney General puts into the16 record, which is on pages 68 -- 67 -- no, pardon me,17 88 through 96 -- is a prison manual that's dated 2000.18 Now, it says it's amended. But my client takes the19 position that this wasn't in the place at his prison at20 that time, and that would require a --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --22 MR. STRIS: -- evidentiary hearing --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the burden --24 MR. STRIS: -- to determine --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for that one is on him.43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 I mean, if you say the burden is on the State to come2 up with a -- you know, showing that there was such a3 system, they came up with it. And you say, "The system4 may have been amended." Well, if it has been amended,5 there the 6789 10burden is on you.MR. STRIS:  Of course.  But --JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean --MR. STRIS:  -- the burden --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- well --MR. STRIS:  Pardon me.  The burden on him11 would be in the context of an evidentiary hearing,12 which never took place. The District Court in this13 case didn't reach that issue, because they found that14 statutory tolling --15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the --16 MR. STRIS: -- wasn't available.17 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the next thing, what he18 actually says here, is that the C facility where he was19 confined was put into lockdown clearly into February20 1997. And this is all after he got access. Then it21 remained quiet and lockdown free until August 11th,22 1997. So, that seems six months, on the most generous23 interpretation --24 MR. STRIS: But that --25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where he's not in44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 lockdown, 234and he has access to the library.MR. STRIS:  But that illustrates the very --JUSTICE BREYER:  About six months.MR. STRIS:  That's correct, Justice Breyer.5 And that illustrates the very problem with this case,6 which is that in cases where there is 90 days, 27 months, 4 months, the very difficult questions that a8 Federal Court would normally look to State law, if it9 was determinant, to apply, California is giving no10 guidance. And our case falls within that once you look11 to the particular explanations that our client put12 forward. And so, we would suggest that if there is a13 concern on the part of the Court about certain cases14 getting through and essentially allowing prisoners to15 abuse the writ, that this Court will use its equitable16 discretion to look at individual cases and to decide,17 "Hey, is this a situation where the behavior is18 dilatory? Is this a situation where the behavior is19 abusive?" And that would restrict the number of cases20 where Federal Courts would need to engage in a factual21 inquiry. The alternative is adopting a presumption,22 that the Attorney General suggested, that the23 California Courts have flatly rejected. That24 presumption has been adopted -- has been imported from25 the direct-appeal context. It has no significance in45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 California habeas law. In the direct-appeal context,2 prisoners have the right to counsel. In the habeas3 context, they don't, except in capital cases. And,4 unsurprisingly -- pardon me -- unsurprisingly, the5 California Supreme Court has adopted a presumption of6 90 days, in the capital context. So, in the -- in the7 noncapital cases, like my client's, where individuals8 have no incentive to delay -- my client has been up for9 parole twice already, he has no incentive to delay the10 habeas process -- and where people like Mr. Chavis11 think that they're, in good faith, complying -- and12 it's not just an issue of excuse -- and this goes back13 to a -- to a question that Justice O'Connor asked14 earlier -- there are specific policy reasons why the15 State of California has adopted the standard that it16 has. They've articulated --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt? I18 want to be sure that I get one thing straight. The 90-19 day presumption in capital cases, that is that if it's20 within 90 days, it's reasonable. Does it also presume21 that it's a -- more than 90 days, it's unreasonable?22 MR. STRIS: It presumes that if it's within23 90 days, it's timely.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.25 MR. STRIS: And then you engage in the46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425inquiry.  But that's significant, Justice Stevens,because these individuals are represented by counsel.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I understand.  But dothey adopt the converse?  If it's more than 90 days, isit presumed to be untimely?          MR. STRIS:  No, they do not.  And they'veflatly rejected that and found cases where there's --several years' delay, even in the capital context, tobe reasonable.  But --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I could see how theycould overcome a presumption that way, but there's noteven a presumption that over 90 days is unreasonable.          MR. STRIS:  That is correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There isn't.  You --          MR. STRIS:  There is not.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You mean if you go in andyou say, "I'm" -- you know, it's more than 90 days, andyou bring in no evidence whatever of any excuse forbeing over 90 days, you're telling me that CaliforniaSupreme Court would accept it?--MR. STRIS:  No, that's not true.  The --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then --MR. STRIS:  -- the --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- then it is a presumption47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. STRIS:  That's correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that if it's over 90days, unless you have a reason, it's untimely.          MR. STRIS:  The burden shifts the prisoner toproduce some evidence.  I didn't understand that to be--          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, here we have 180 days --180 days, twice 90 -- with no excuse at all presented.MR. STRIS: In the noncapital context. And it's very -- it's very different, because the California State Courts are articulating particularly - - particular policy reasons for noncapital prisoners to delay. One that they're articulated is a desire to avoid the piecemeal presentation of claims. And this is particular to California's original writ system.You can have a functional appeal, but, because it's also an original writ, you -- if you have an additional claim that's legitimate, you need to add it in that claim.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But once it's --          MR. STRIS:  And --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- in the Federal habeascontext, the AEDPA law suggests there's a great premiumpaid -- at stake for promptly resolving these things.What do we do about that?  This is in the Federal court48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 system now.2 MR. STRIS: If it were the case -- and3 there's no evidence on the record to suggest this --4 that a substantial number of cases were going to start5 coming through California with massive delays, and this6 Court was going to be forced to provide statutory7 tolling, that would be a problem. But there's no8 evidence to suggest that. And that ties back to --9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what would we do in10 that situation?11 MR. STRIS: If that --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If it's --13 MR. STRIS: -- started happening?14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- open to the Federal15 Courts.16 MR. STRIS: If that started happening, I17 think you, in this Court, would do nothing. I think18 that Congress would see what was going on, and they'd19 amend the statute, because that's clearly not what they20 intended. But that's not this case.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Amend just for California,22 when the system is working fine, all the other States23 that do have the timelines?24 MR. STRIS: I don't think they would do that,25 Justice Ginsburg. But there's a proposal that I'm49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 aware of, already, to change the specific language of2 2244(d)(2), and it was made by a congressman in3 California. It doesn't suggest changing it for4 California; it suggests changing the language. But5 that hasn't happened.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To do what? What would it7 say?8 MR. STRIS: I believe it replaces the word9 "pending" with some replacement. And so, it10 essentially changes the tolling provision to account11 for this problem. But that hasn't happened yet. Right12 now, we have a congressional statute that, on its face,13 does not require the Federal Courts --14 JUSTICE BREYER: What about this? You might15 lose under this, but it -- see, so you say -- look, in16 every other State, the time for appealing from an17 appeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them,18 is 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30. So, if the19 Ninth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than20 30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say "on the21 merits," whether they cite a case, whether they don't22 say anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth23 Circuit should assume that they've done is consider it24 untimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the25 California Courts might accept as an excuse. So, then50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 they'll look into that. And if California, in the2 future, wants something different -- which I'd be3 surprised -- they will say that their system means that4 a 3-year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely.5 But, in the absence of some reason to think that, why6 not use the words, which would give you a chance to go7 back, and you could say, "This is not a case of total8 lack of excuse. There is excuse of the kind that9 California would accept."10 MR. STRIS: Well, I think the problem with11 that sort of rule, Justice Breyer, is that it risks12 error, because California's standard is so13 indeterminate, and at very little -- it gets very14 little benefit. Because there's -- there is no real15 harm -- there's no real harm to the Federal interest16 here just because we have a conclusive presumption.17 The very nature of a conclusive presumption is that18 sometimes there will be cases that don't fit the19 presumption. But, on this record, and on anything I've20 seen from my review of California procedure, there's21 nothing to suggest that a -- the Federal interest in22 avoiding substantial delays is compromised by the23 specific rule that the Ninth Circuit has adopted. And24 the Ninth Circuit has adopted a --25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can you --51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 how can you say that? We do have a Federal rule and a2 limitation, and (d)(2) is an exception for time that3 it's pending before the State Courts. And if the State4 Courts aren't going to bother to tell us whether5 something's timely or not, or pending, giving them a6 blank check does undermine the Federal interest behind7 the 1-year limitation period.8 MR. STRIS: I would say two things about9 that, Mr. Chief Justice. The first thing is, I would10 strongly resist your characterization that the State11 Court is saying nothing. I think that, in most cases,12 they are saying something, and that, in the cases that13 involve postcard denials, many of them, the court is14 saying that they're timely, and, in others, those are15 the hard questions. So, I would restrict your16 characterization to the fact that California is not17 saying something in some cases.18 Now, because the Federal statute necessarily19 imports a State standard, that's the very problem with20 the statute. I can conceive of many instances where --21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you think the22 Federal statute necessarily imports a State standard?23 It says that the State postconviction proceeding must24 be pending. And California presents an unusual25 situation, but we interpret that pending is a question52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of Federal law. It's not a State standard.2 MR. STRIS: That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.3 But if you took that to its logical conclusion, then,4 when State Courts made errors -- they didn't see that a5 case was properly filed, they just missed it -- the6 Federal Court would go in and review. Or in a case7 where they did claim the reverse, the Federal Court8 could say, "No, there was clear error." But this Court9 has rejected that in Saffold. It's rejected it in10 Pace. And -- because that is informed by the very view11 that the tolling provision was included to encourage12 one round of State exhaustion free of Federal13 interference.14 JUSTICE BREYER: But we decided --15 I'd like you to suggest something to -- from16 yourself in the -- in an imaginary position.17 versus Saffold did have a dissent. And four18 joined it. And let's imagine that, when I read the19 dissent, I see the -- and then I look at this case -- I20 see imaginary words on the top of the dissent, which21 are, "We told you so."22 [Laughter.]23 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- now, therefore, think24 not of if you were arguing Carey v. Saffold afresh, but25 think of the words that are actually written there.53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005putting CareyJustices￼1 And now think of what happened here. And now propose2 something, please, that will, in fact, deal with the3 problem that this case seems to present.4 MR. STRIS: Well, I would be lying, Justice5 Breyer, if I didn't say that I haven't thought about6 that. And the problem is that the rule announced in7 Saffold isn't the right rule. It's trying to deal with8 a problem that's been created by the California State9 Courts. And so, the solution that the Ninth Circuit10 has adopted -- that's our proposal. We essentially11 think that it has a minimal harm to Federal interests,12 because maybe certain cases will get in that Congress13 didn't intend, but if you don't adopt it, there's no14 alternative. You can't certify the question. In15 California, you can't certify to the Court of Appeal.16 You can't certify from a District Court. So, if the17 California State Courts aren't going to change, it's18 not incumbent upon this Court to read the statute19 differently than the proper interpretation. And I20 concede the arguments that were made in the dissenting21 opinion in Saffold are very interesting, and they don't22 compel, in my opinion, a different interpretation of23 the statute; they recognize the difficulty that the24 statute presents. And it presents that difficulty25 because it does incorporate, in some measure, a State54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 standard, and because there's one State out there,2 California, that's doing something that's very3 difficult 45 questions6 discussing, with these long delays, primarily in the7 application the third range, the application of the8 California Supreme Court, as opposed to lower courts?9 MR. STRIS: Well, I wouldn't characterize itto deal with.JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this -- twoabout California?  Is the problem we're10 as a problem, because, like I said before, I don't11 think that --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is the condition, that13 there is the long delay, that primarily occurs in the -14 - in the application of State Supreme Court? Is it --15 MR. STRIS: I have no -- I've seen no16 specific evidence to be able to answer that with any17 citation, but my understanding, Justice Stevens, is18 that that makes sense, because it's the last process19 that the prisoner is going to be able to engage in,20 then they'll have to go to the Federal Circuit.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then my second question is,22 Have we decided, or is it a matter of common practice23 in California, that the application to the California24 Supreme Court is necessary in order to complete the25 exhaustion?55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. STRIS: It is -- it is necessary, in my2 opinion. I don't know if the State -- if this Court3 has ever --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: We've held it --5 MR. STRIS: -- decided that.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in cases where there's7 direct review, but this is a different sort of animal8 that you have in California.9 MR. STRIS: But once you start from the10 premise that these are functional appeals, which they11 are, I don't see how you could read AEDPA any other12 way. I mean, AEDPA says that if there's an available13 method to challenge and -- a petition, whether it be by14 review or original writ, to the California Supreme15 Court would be available. So, you could be sure that16 if prisoners --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: I think it is --18 MR. STRIS: -- didn't file --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- required.20 MR. STRIS: Yes. If they didn't file, they'd21 get kicked out of Federal Court.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's one aspect of23 Saffold that you haven't addressed. We not only said24 what we said about they're saying "on the merits," we25 actually cited a case that involved exactly the56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 situation here -- namely, Welch versus Newland, a CA92 case from 2001. And we cited that as an example of how3 the Ninth Circuit rule, quote, "risks the tolling of4 the Federal limitations period even when it is highly5 likely that the prisoner failed to seek timely review6 in the State appellate courts," close quote.7 MR. STRIS: I would say two things about8 that.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: How could the Ninth Circuit10 here simply have ignored that criticism of exactly what11 they did here?12 MR. STRIS: Well, I don't believe they13 ignored it, Justice Scalia. And if you look at the14 Welch case that you're referring to, on en banc15 rehearing the en banc panel reached a very different16 result. They didn't reach the issue of timeliness, for17 the reasons I described, but they determined that that18 was not a 192021functional appeal, because --JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we --MR. STRIS:  -- the claim --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- we didn't cite the en22 banc decision. We cited the panel decision --23 MR. STRIS: The en banc --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- didn't we?25 MR. STRIS: -- decision occurred after your -57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1- 2345 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA:  After.MR. STRIS:  -- case.JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the point is, wecriticized the panel decision in Welch, which didexactly what this panel did here.          MR. STRIS:  I don't agree with thatcharacterization, Justice Scalia.  I believe that casewas included to illustrate that this Court thought thatwas probably too long, and that not looking at all towhat's happening in the California system risks that.I don't think anything was at least necessary to theholding in Saffold --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We cited --          MR. STRIS:  -- because it --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it for the propositionthat it -- as an example of how the Ninth Circuit rule,quote, "risks the tolling of the Federal limitationsperiod even when it is highly likely that the prisonerfailed to seek timely review in the State appellatecourts."  That's what we cited.          MR. STRIS:  That is true.  And in the contextof a case like Saffold, where there's a reference tolack of diligence, that risk is too great.  I'm notgoing to get up here and suggest that there's no risk58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to a conclusive presumption that some cases are going2 to make it into Federal Court that Congress didn't3 intend. But it's a balancing that's inherent in the4 notion of federalism. There is a risk that, by not5 reviewing clear statements by the California State6 Court, that cases get in that shouldn't. A case could7 not have been properly filed, and the State Court8 didn't find it. But, in Saffold and in Pace, this9 Court announced the principle that once the State Court10 decides, that's the end of the matter.11 And I guess, in summation, what I suggest is12 that atmospherically this case presents a difficult13 problem. The Ninth Circuit is involved. There is a14 five-four decision in Saffold. We recognize those15 things. However, there is no easy solution. The Ninth16 Circuit has adopted a rule that balances the very17 interest in federalism that the tolling provision was18 intended to preserve, and there's no suggestion that19 some corresponding Federal interest is compromised.20 And, in fact, if the Federal Courts are required to21 review these cases, they'll be required to do it in 6022 days, in 70 days, in 80 days, and, if they make a23 mistake, and they find a case to be untimely that the24 California Court didn't, will deprive first Federal25 habeas, one Congress didn't intend. That's59Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425fundamentally contrary to the purpose of AEDPA.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you --          MR. STRIS:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- Mr. Stris.          Ms. Chatman, you have 4 minutes remaining.      REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE BAKER CHATMAN                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MS. CHATMAN:  Thank you.          Of course there's a Federal interest at stakehere.  It's the Federal interest in the Federal Courtsnot having to deal with stale habeas claims in FederalCourt.          One thing I'd like to address is the capital-case presumption, which is now -- excuse me -- 180days.  It's been changed from 90 days.  Thatpresumption is for  -- from the filing of the replybrief to filing an initial petition in CaliforniaCourt.  That is, your first habeas petition.  That --you only get presumed timely for 180 days.  Here, we'retalking about noncapital cases going just from --taking claims, that have already been presented in onepetition, to the next level.  So, in those --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, 180 days from what?          MS. CHATMAN:  From the filing of the -- thefinal due date of the filing of the reply brief --60Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, you file --          MS. CHATMAN:  -- in the direct appeal.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the reply brief in thelower court.  Maybe the judge will take 4 months todecide it.  What's the relation?  I don't understandthat. Ormaybe it'll take --MS. CHATMAN:  I --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- 2 days --MS. CHATMAN:  I think --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to decide.MS. CHATMAN:  I think they -- I think theydate it from the filing of the reply brief because --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  What would the theorybe?  I don't understand that.          MS. CHATMAN:  Because they like to see theseclaims presented along with the appeal to be -- so thatthey can possibly bring them together and decide habeasclaims in light of the record on appeal.  So, I thinkthat's why they date it from filing of the replybriefs.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, a judge -- you file it. On day -- what -- you file it on April 1st, and thenthe judge decides it in August.  Or September.  And nowit's only 3 days before the 6-months -- you have tofile your appeal, like, in 3 days.  That wouldn't make61Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 sense. And the converse would not --2 MS. CHATMAN: Well, you're not -- you're3 generally not supposed to be waiting. I mean, you were4 talking about claims such as --5 6 7 8 9JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't --MS. CHATMAN:  -- ineffective --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- file an --MS. CHATMAN:  -- assistance --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- appeal before -- oh,can in California.  You're going to file the10 maybe you11 appeal before the lower court decides it?12 MS. CHATMAN: Well, if we're talking about13 capital cases here, they are -- they are filing their14 appeals directly in the California Supreme Court;15 similarly, with their habeas petitions.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Even -- or even before they17 get a lower court decision.1819 decision. 202122232425MS. CHATMAN:  There would beno lower courtJUSTICE BREYER:  They don't,MS. CHATMAN:  No.JUSTICE BREYER:  In other --MS. CHATMAN:  No, no, no.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- they don't, at all.MS. CHATMAN:  No, they go --62Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005at all.￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh.2 MS. CHATMAN: -- straight to California3 Supreme Court. Which brings up one point, which is4 that the problem that we're looking at here in deciding5 timeliness will not arise in capital cases. We will6 not have that problem, because capital cases go7 straight to the California Supreme Court. There are8 not going to be intervals between the courts to deal9 with. So, that simplifies, I think, the problem a10 little bit.11 The other thing I'd like to address is the12 argument that a State Court is saying something with13 these summary orders. I strongly disagree with that.14 They are absolutely saying nothing. This Court said in15 Ylst that the essence of an unexplained order is that16 it says nothing. It does not say, "This is a timely17 petition."18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the ones that19 would cite a case that threw out the petition because20 it was untimely -- and we were told there were over a21 thousand of those every year -- that would be saying22 something, wouldn't it?23 MS. CHATMAN: That is -- in the California24 Supreme Court, you will find that sometimes, that they25 will indicate untimeliness by a case citation; hardly63Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 ever in the lower appellate court.2 And I would also disagree with the3 characterization of delay being a problem going from4 the lower appellate court to the California Supreme5 Court. We see it at both levels.6 And I would also disagree that this shouldn't7 be a problem because these Petitioners have no8 incentive to delay. That may be the case, that they9 don't have an incentive to delay, but they do, in fact,10 sleep on their rights, as --11 JUSTICE BREYER: How often --12 MS. CHATMAN: -- Mr. Chavis did.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you, as the Attorney14 General, what period of time after the District Courts15 made a decision, and now -- they've now filed their16 claim in the Court of Appeals -- how long is it before17 you say it's untimely?18 MS. CHATMAN: We would -- we would say19 anything over 60 days. Yes, Your Honor.20 I see my time is up. Thank you.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.22 Chatman.23 The case is submitted.24 [Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the25 above-entitled matter was submitted.]64Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
