New York.Ms. Schwarz.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. SCHWARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The Court held in Delaware v. Prouse that,in the absence of reasonable suspicion, it is an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment for police to stop a car for the purpose of checking the motorist's driving credentials.In Brown v. Texas, the Court similarly ruled that police may not stop a person without reasonable suspicion for the purpose of requiring the individual to identify him or herself. These cases are grounded in the principle that in this country we enjoy the right to go about our business free from government interference unless or until the police have just cause to detain us.Petitioner's motion to suppress alleged that the police acted exactly as they did in Prouse and Brown. They stopped the car without justification,3Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 elicited his name, and gained access to his DMV records,2 which otherwise would not have been discovered. Instead3 of suppressing the poisonous fruit of the illegal car4 stop, the DMV records, the New York Court of Appeals5 chose to create a new categorical rule that prevents6 application of the exclusionary rule whenever the police7 act in violation of Prouse.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was -- was the9 poisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous10 fruit the fact that this person who is contained in the11 records was the one driving the car? Why wasn't that12 the -- why wasn't that the fruit? I mean, the records13 were there anyway. What -- what -- what new information14 came from the stop was the fact that that is the person15 who was driving the car. Why -- why didn't -- why16 wasn't that what should have been suppressed?17 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Scalia, that is18 also a fruit of the poisonous tree. As -­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would agree with you on20 that fruit. Did -- did you ask for that to be21 suppressed?22 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes, that was asked for in the23 -- in the motion at the trial level. In addition -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what's25 before us here, right?4￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. SCHWARZ: That's right, and that's because the court below decided that -- in deciding the case only addressed the DMV record, and -- and indicated that the DMV records were not properly suppressible fruit.JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that the -­MS. SCHWARZ: And that's the issue.JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that -- that you hadwon at the trial level; the judge suppresses everything and dismisses the indictment; and Mr. Tolentino walks out of the courtroom and is observed by the officer that conducted the stop in this case. The officer sees him getting into a car and driving away, even though his license is still suspended. Now, could -- could he be arrested for that?MS. SCHWARZ: Yes, Justice Alito, he could.JUSTICE ALITO: Even though the officer would have no reason to know that this particular person has a suspended license were it not for the chain of events that followed from the initial allegedly illegal stop?MS. SCHWARZ: Well, although that initial stop provided the tainted information that he didn't have a license, the subsequent re- offense would certainly taint the -- the illegality of the first stop5Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 and make the second offense properly -­2 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Let me ask a3 related question. Suppose that after you filed your4 suppression motion the -- the State of New York became5 nervous about this issue and they checked all the6 surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the stop, and,7 lo and behold, they found a tape showing Mr. Tolentino8 driving the car shortly before the stop here. Could he9 be prosecuted for illegal -- for driving without a10 license, with a suspended license, using that evidence?11 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, that -- I believe that12 under those circumstances it would be entirely proper to13 prosecute the case. With that, that would be evidence14 that came from an independent source.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean, in light of16 those two answers, it does seem to me that your real17 problem here is not with the -- the DMV records. It's18 with the police officer's observation after the stop19 that Mr. Tolentino was driving the car.20 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Alito, again,21 all of -- there's lots of evidence that could be22 properly the fruit of the poisonous tree. There was a23 statement made here that the Petitioner said that he did24 not have a New York State license, there's the25 observations of the officer, and there's the DMV6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 records. They're all properly considered fruit, and in2 this case the DMV records are of important evidentiary3 significance.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any5 case in this Court where what was suppressed was6 information that was lawfully in the government's7 possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired8 originally through the search? Here we have the DMV9 records, they're public records. I don't know of any10 decision of this Court that deals with suppression of11 evidence that is already in the government's possession,12 and if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.13 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I14 don't believe there has been precedent on that issue.15 However, in the independent source doctrine cases, there16 -- they've always required that the possession -- or17 that they have knowledge of the information in order for18 it to defeat the exclusionary rule application. So in19 this case, although the government had the DMV records20 -- well, first of all, law enforcement didn't have the21 DMV records. It was only until the illegality and the22 exploitation of that illegality that they acquired the23 records from the Department of Motor Vehicles. So in24 that sense it was clearly a fruit of the poisonous tree.25 But even if you look at government as an7￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 integrated whole, the prior possession of the -- the2 records was meaningless, of no value to them, until the3 illegality when it acquired its meaning.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the police5 following Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license6 plate, and then got this information, not as a result of7 his driver's license, but from the plate on the car?8 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -­9 the -- the plates of the car would not indicate the -­10 the driver's license of the driver, and in this case Mr.11 Tolentino -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They might show him as13 the owner of the car.14 MS. SCHWARZ: The owner of the car. And I15 believe in Respondent's brief they indicated that -­16 that some of the police computers will even show17 descriptive features or maybe even a picture of the18 driver. But in this case Mr. Tolentino was not the19 registered owner of the vehicle, so that wouldn't have20 provided them with cause to pull the car over.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this goes back to22 a question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful23 way, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen24 under your view after this stop. They stop the person,25 they get the information that he's driving under a8￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 suspended license, and are they supposed to say, Oh, you2 know, we shouldn't have stopped you; I'm sorry, have a3 nice day, go ahead, and then he leaves? Is that what4 goes on?5 MS. SCHWARZ: No, Justice Kennedy, that's6 not what would happen. The State would impound the car.7 They would not allow a -- a person without a proper8 license to get back in the car and -- and drive on.9 That -- in order for the Petitioner to get the vehicle10 back, he would -- if it was his vehicle -­11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't impounding12 the car the fruit of the illegal search?13 MS. SCHWARZ: Because the -- the impoundment14 statutes are based on a public safety interest, and so15 it doesn't -­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why doesn't the public17 safety interest then permit us to use this evidence in18 order to protect the public safety further by punishing19 him for -- not driving? I don't see the difference.20 MS. SCHWARZ: Because in order to do that,21 it would be tantamount to sanctioning a -- a fishing22 expedition in this case, Justice Kennedy, because it23 would be allowing the police without reasonable24 suspicion -­259￼JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why wouldn't you sayAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the same thing about impounding the car?2 MS. SCHWARZ: Because the --3 interests are different and because it's4 removal of the Petitioner's right to get5 whoever the -- the rightful owner is. It's just making6 sure that the Petitioner can't get back in the car and7 continue driving. In order to get the vehicle back, at8 least in New York State, the -- if it was the9 Petitioner's, they would have to show proof that they10 had a valid license; and if it wasn't his vehicle, then11 the other -- the true owner would have to get -- provide12 proper credentials to establish that they could take the13 -- the vehicle into their possession; and also they14 would have to have proof that the Petitioner himself had15 cleared up his record or get some sort of a -- a release16 from the court or from the district attorney's office.17 So the whole purpose of that impoundment statute is for18 public safety.19 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand the20 answer you gave to Justice Alito. Maybe I mixed it up.21 The police stop the car without cause.22 MS. SCHWARZ: Uh-huh.the -- the not a forever the car,￼23 JUSTICE BREYER:24 say as a result of the stop25 things in the records, that10So illegal stop. And you they found out all these he had no license, right?Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. SCHWARZ: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: So that shouldn't be introduced into his trial for driving without a license.MS. SCHWARZ: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now the question I had heard put was, suppose after they got this information, they don't arrest him then, but he gets into the car again and starts driving. You said then they could arrest him?MS. SCHWARZ: Well -­JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Why? Why isn't -- why isn't that just as much the fruit of the poisonous tree? They found out he doesn't have a license by the record which came to them from an illegal stop. I just don't understand it. Did I get you right as to what you said?MS. SCHWARZ: Justice Breyer, what I -- what I meant to say is the attenuation doctrine would apply. Now, if the person was -- got back in his car immediately at that scene and started off driving, then I'm not sure that the attenuation doctrine would -­ would -- would kick in.JUSTICE BREYER: So therefore they couldn't arrest him. So what they do is they -- is that right?MS. SCHWARZ: Well, yes, but -­11Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company12 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- how13 they can impound the car.could they --­Official - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE BREYER: They see -- they see he -­2 they stopped him, they get the records, wrongly. They3 see he has no license. He says: How did you know?4 Because we just looked at your license. That was5 illegal; good-bye, gets into the car and drives off, and6 they can do nothing?7 MS. SCHWARZ: Except I just have to remind8 you that they -- they could -­9 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not? Is10 that right?11 MS. SCHWARZ: -- impound the car.￼MS. SCHWARZ: Impound theJUSTICE BREYER: Because?MS. SCHWARZ: So -­JUSTICE BREYER: Because?MS. SCHWARZ: Because of the statutory Court -- because they now know that he has14 15 16 17 1819 rights, the20 no license to drive, so either the car will -- if21 there's another person who can properly take possession22 of the vehicle, then that person can drive off with the23 car. But the Petitioner himself, who doesn't have a24 valid license, he can't get back in the car.25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Schwarz, suppose -­12Alderson Reporting Companycar.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. SCHWARZ: And -­JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.MS. SCHWARZ: Well, I'm done.JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Schwarz, suppose thepolice arrest the guy, find out who he is, don't -- stop the guy, find out who he is, don't arrest him, but then now they know that this is the kind of guy who drives without a license. And so they go to his house the next day and they see him getting back in the car. Could they arrest him then?MS. SCHWARZ: Justice Kagan, I think the answer would be yes, and the reason why is because if they see him on a subsequent occasion and they're seeing him re-offend, that would attenuate the taint of the first -­JUSTICE KAGAN: So the re-offense -- the re-offense just cuts off the original taint?MS. SCHWARZ: I believe so, yes. I mean, it would be attenuation analysis, but to me it would be pretty clear-cut that that's how it would resolve.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only way that the police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving in this situation is to take away his car? Impound the car, as you say?MS. SCHWARZ: Well -­13Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unless they want -­2 for any offense, you know, expired driver's license.3 Expired last week. They can't just give the guy -- they4 can't give the guy a ticket, right? All they can do is5 take away his car?6 Your answer to a number of the questions has7 been that -- that have tried to address the issue of8 what are they supposed to do, since they know they have9 somebody who is violating the law, is that, well, they10 can take away the car. And I just want to know if11 that's the only permissible response by the police when12 they know that the person driving has violated the law.13 MS. SCHWARZ: If the -- if the stop was -­14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Totally illegal.15 MS. SCHWARZ: -- Totally illegal -­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Totally, yes.17 MS. SCHWARZ: Then I don't think that -- if18 there were -- I don't think that they could prosecute19 that case. They could -- they couldn't charge him with20 --21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the only way to22 prevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound23 the car? Because if he gets into the car and drives,24 then -- or can the police arrest him right away?25 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, that would be14￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425attenuation analysis. But I think that the taint of the initial illegality would make that a much more difficult case. But in that situation, the police also could -­ again, if there was another person who had authority to take possession of the vehicle, that person could take the vehicle, the registered owner or someone with authority to do that. But the police would not be powerless to see the defendant get back in the -- in the car.I mean, it would -- that would be -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not? Why wouldn't they -­MS. SCHWARZ: Because of the impoundmentstatutes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that your answer, then: They've got to impound the car every time or let the guy just go?MS. SCHWARZ: Well, they -- they could drive the person home to his house or take him to the corner or tell him not to drive until he cleared up his license. They could do that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could tell him not to drive until he clears up his license?MS. SCHWARZ: I -- yes. I mean, that would be another alternative.15Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 But the scenario that you are talking about2 would be highly unlikely, and it would be almost in bad3 faith if the police stopped him illegally, found out4 that he had the suspended license, and then let him get5 back in right away. That wouldn't be the way that the6 police would normally do that, unless there was a way to7 properly maintain the safety of the road -­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much time do they9 have to wait? Justice Kagan brought up if the police go10 to his home the next day. You've brought up attenuation11 theory a number of times.12 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- I think now you14 have answered, he gets back into the car, drives it15 away, they can do nothing because it's too close to when16 they discovered his record of -- his suspended license.￼How much of an interval must there be? What by attenuation doctrine?MS. SCHWARZ: Well, that would be -­would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,1718 do you mean 1920 attenuation21 Justice Ginsburg, but I would think if, even an hour22 later, if the Petitioner brazenly drove by those same23 officers, you know, thumbing his nose at them, hi, that24 would be -- attenuation analysis would apply at that25 point.16Alderson Reporting Company10 he has11 in and12 faith.13a suspended license and then to let him get back immediately arrest him, it's sort of in badOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because you could say that2 if he got back in the car right after the stop, if the3 police for some reason did not impound the car and he4 got back in the car, that's another offense, and so by5 your theory, then they could properly arrest him and use6 all of this knowledge in a prosecution?7 MS. SCHWARZ: And a court very well -- very8 well may agree with you on that. My only qualm with9 that is that when the officers illegally find out thatJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what -- what is that 14 word, the "bad faith"? I take it your rule is identical￼15 if when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the16 records, the records say he has no license, and in17 addition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 318 triple axe murders. Again, you can't do anything about19 it?202122 do anything 232425MS. SCHWARZ: No. No, Justice Breyer. JUSTICE BREYER: What? Can you? You cannot about it or you can?MS. SCHWARZ: You can.JUSTICE BREYER: What? How?MS. SCHWARZ: Well, the -- the warrants are17Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425entirely different -­JUSTICE BREYER: Why?MS. SCHWARZ: -- because of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine. The warrants for -- for other cases are a method by which the court brings the body of the defendant to court. And so there is -­JUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact, a policeman stops a person without cause and learns as a result of that that there are many warrants outstanding against him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he introduce those warrants into court as evidence or whatever if it's relevant?MS. SCHWARZ: Absolutely, he can bring them in. But the warrants are not evidentiary.JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the way that the policeman stops the person and gets the information illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house, the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just think this case has lots of implications, and I'm looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of different situations.MS. SCHWARZ: Well, there's -- actually, I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure I follow.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say that if, in fact, he learns that this man from the public records is18Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 a triple axe murderer -­Official - Subject to Final ReviewMS. SCHWARZ: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: -- he can do nothing about2 34 it, I said?5 it. I just67 again, just8 warrant, is9 the -- Davis. That's not something that would be10 introduced in court. It's just a method for bringing11 the defendant into court. And so in that case, they12 would properly be allowed to arrest him. And if there13 was -­14 JUSTICE BREYER: It happens to be a15 description of the individual, not a warrant, he gets16 from the public record which is read off to him when he17 calls in, a description: A red tie. Can he use that18 and introduce it into evidence?19 I mean, is this case about -- what's it20 about, driving? Or does it have broader implications?21 I thought that the Court had held that any22 public record at all is immune. Is that right? Immune23 from the normal fruit of the poisonous tree rule.24 MS. SCHWARZ: The New York Court of Appeals25 rule categorically removes it, that's true.19And you said no, he can do something about wanted to know the distinction.MS. SCHWARZ: Okay. So there's different -­ to be clear, the warrant, the arrestnot of evidentiary value, according to￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and I was testing that. I want to know: Is that, in your opinion, a correct rule in all cases?MS. SCHWARZ: No. And in fact, one ofthe-­JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, not an incorrect rule, the opposite rule. No rule.MS. SCHWARZ: Well, it's -- the problem with that rule, the categorical rule, is that it will create a fresh incentive for police officers to make these kind of suspicionless stops, and so it will encourage police to violate the Fourth Amendment, and not only -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you allow the suppression of the policeman's identification of the individual driving the car. I mean, that -- nobody's contending that that can't be suppressed. So if you can't bring in the policeman to say, yes, this fellow Smith, whose record we have here, was the fellow driving the car. Once that's out, what incentive is there to make these suspicionless stops?MS. SCHWARZ: Because -­JUSTICE SCALIA: What I'm saying is, you're getting at it from the wrong end. What should have been suppressed was the policeman's identification of the person who was driving the car.20Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MS. SCHWARZ: Ah. Yes. And if -- and if2 this case -- if this case -- we prevail, and this case3 was returned to trial court, both of those issues would4 be at play and would be litigated. The observations of5 the defendant and the DMV records are both suppressible6 fruit and both of them would be subject to suppression.7 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's not the argument8 you seem to be making. You want to suppress the9 knowledge that the police derived from the stop that10 Mr. Tolentino's license is suspended, and you would11 allow an exception to that only if there was12 attenuation. But why isn't the simpler solution to a13 case like this that you can't suppress the knowledge of14 matters that are in a government record, however you can15 suppress observations by the police on the scene that16 flow directly from the illegal stop?17 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, our position is18 that both of those items are properly suppressible. And19 it's true in this circumstance that the observations20 would probably subsume the need for the DMV records.21 However, the observations may not be sufficient in22 certain circumstances. And in those cases, it would be23 more important -- it would be very important to have24 both of the items suppressible, and there's no reason,25 there's not -­21￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was some2 rule about not being able to suppress a person's3 identity? You've been asked a couple of times why are4 you going after the DMV record; you should go after the5 police identification of Joe Smith or whoever. I6 thought there was some rule that says the identity of7 the person is not suppressible. Am I wrong about that?8 MS. SCHWARZ: That -- that is a restatement9 of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine, that essentially says that10 a person cannot suppress himself, his body, in order to11 defeat the jurisdiction of the court.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so how does that fit13 with your earlier answers that his identity here could14 be suppressed? And then I'll ask a second question. If15 you say that you can suppress his identity from16 information they gained after the stop when they saw17 him, why couldn't they say, well, we saw this man before18 we stopped him?19 MS. SCHWARZ: There's -- there's a20 distinction between the identity and the elicitation of21 his name, and the elicitation of his name which led to22 the DMV records.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it gets you24 nowhere to say John Smith. You have to say John Smith25 was driving the car. It's the driving of the car that22￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 you want suppressed. That's not the identity. I mean,2 John Smith, fine, you can say John Smith, John Smith,3 John Smith all you like at court. It's -- it's not4 going to get a conviction.5 But when you say John Smith was driving the6 car, then you are eliciting testimony from the officer7 concerning information he would not have had but for the8 stop, that John Smith was driving the car, right?9 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, this Court has always10 defined evidentiary fruit as something that -- of11 evidentiary value which the public authorities have12 caused an arrested person to yield to them during an13 illegal detention, and that's from the Davis case. And14 the DMV records would fit that definition of evidentiary15 fruit.16 And in this case, because it is the classic17 situation where there's sufficient causal connection18 between the Fourth Amendment violation and the19 subsequent discovery of the evidence to justify20 suppression, there's no reason not to apply the21 exclusionary rule here, and in fact, it meets all the22 definition of the sort of case where there would be very23 high level of deterrence as a result of applying the24 exclusionary rule.25 I see that I have 5 minutes. I would like23￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to reserve the rest of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,Ms. Schwarz.Ms. Halligan.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGANON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:I would like to start with your question,Justice Breyer, about what the ruling below was and what's at stake in this case. What the court of appeals held was quite narrow. It said -- and I'm reading from page 105a of the appendix: "We merely hold that a defendant may not invoke the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine when the only link between improper police activity and the disputed evidence is that the police learned the defendant's name."So the court of appeals is focusing on the fact that all that was elicited here is the name of the defendant, and that's appropriate. Asking a name is fundamental to any encounter between police and citizens, and that's because the officer -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're suggesting that it's okay for the police to walk up to any citizen, anywhere, and say, you're under arrest until you give me24Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425your name?Official - Subject to Final ReviewMS. HALLIGAN: Absolutelynot, Your Honor. there's -- there's without suspicion. different fromJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, been no doubt here that it was a stop That's been presumed. So how is thatwhat I just asked you -­MS. HALLIGAN: Because -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they took a person randomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said give me your name. Are you suggesting that that's okay?MS. HALLIGAN: No, I'm not. The legality of the stop here has not been adjudicated. We arepresuming that the police acted illegally.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am presuming. I knowthat there's counter-arguments to that.MS. HALLIGAN: We are not at all challengingthis Court's decisions, certainly not Delaware v. Prouse or any others, which hold that the police may not stop someone without basis and may not certainly enforce the sort of statute that was at issue in Hiibel without some basis for asking for identification.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't the eliciting of the name as a result of an unlawful stop something that could be suppressed?MS. HALLIGAN: It should not be subject to25￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 suppression, and that's a distinct question from whether2 or not there was a constitutional violation that3 occurred in the stop and the asking of the name.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The name is different5 than the person, the body of the person, which has to do6 with the Court's jurisdiction. But why isn't the name7 any different than a wallet that's in somebody's pocket8 or a shirt or a hat, whatever is on the person? Why is9 a name not subject to suppression?10 Let's go past what happens here, because I11 understand the disconnect between the name, the DMV12 record, and seeing the person driving. How we tie those13 together are a different issue. But you made a bold14 statement when you started. You said that the police15 securing a name is never suppressible.16 MS. HALLIGAN: Because it has ae unique17 status, as this Court recognized in Hiibel, in the18 criminal justice system. Asking for a name is a routine19 and accepted part of any stop because the officer needs20 to know who he's dealing with. He faces an inordinate21 risk, as this Court noted in Mimms and most recently in22 Arizona v. Gant, of being shot when he approaches a car.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference24 between stopping a car and stopping a person on the25 street, as Justice Sotomayor asked? You can't stop26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 somebody on the street for no reason. The person looks2 to you suspicious, so you stop the person and say: Tell3 me your name. For a Terry stop, you have to have4 reasonable suspicion. So why isn't it the same for5 somebody who is driving a car?6 MS. HALLIGAN: I think it is the same in7 terms of what the Fourth Amendment requires, and8 Delaware v. Prouse holds that. We're not taking issue9 with that or asking this Court to retreat from that.10 What we are saying is that where all that is11 elicited is the name, it's not appropriate to apply the12 exclusionary rule, which is a very distinct question.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Ms. Halligan, suppose -­14 you're suggesting there should be an exception for15 knowledge of identity. Suppose there were a clearly16 illegal search and the government is looking for a head17 of some kind of criminal syndicate and knows this only18 by an alias, all right; and -- and finds out as a result19 of this illegal search -- pick your -- pick your alias,20 you know, John Smith -- finds out, you know -- finds out21 that this person whose house they're searching is John22 Smith, is the head of this criminal syndicate.23 Can the government then use that knowledge24 of identity, knowledge that this person goes under this25 alias, in order to build a case around this guy?27￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MS. HALLIGAN: In your hypothetical I'm not2 sure whether there would be any Fifth Amendment issues3 that would be at play, but -­4 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, they find out this5 person's alias as the result of the illegal search, and6 that allows them to build a substantial criminal case.7 MS. HALLIGAN: If all that is obtained is8 the name, then the exclusionary rule should not be9 applied. 10JUSTICE KAGAN: So there's a diary, and it John Smith. That's Keyser Soze. (Laughter.)JUSTICE KAGAN: I am Keyser Soze. That11 says: I am 121314 would not be suppressible?15 MS. HALLIGAN: The diary itself, the16 document would be suppressible. The knowledge that that17 person is the -- is Keyser Soze would not be subject to18 suppression, and knowledge should never be something￼19 that is subject to suppression, in any event.20 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that when -- when21 the police stopped this particular car, they saw that22 Mr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine23 or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody24 tied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car.25 Now, all of those things would clearly be the fruit -­28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 all those observations would clearly be the fruit2 allegedly illegal stop, right?of theMS. HALLIGAN: That's correct, and -­ JUSTICE ALITO: Even though they werethey would all be suppressed, right?MS. HALLIGAN: That's correct, Your Honor. JUSTICE ALITO: But you're saying that the that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the345 plain view, 678 observation9 car, that is not suppressed?10 MS. HALLIGAN: I would like to distinguish11 between the observation of the person driving the car,12 to the extent that you might have a case in which that13 observation is made after the stop as opposed to before14 the stop; that's a different and distinct question.15 It's not presented in the case that's before the Court16 right now -- from the question of whether the17 exclusionary rule should be applied when only the name18 is elicited.19 The observations, it may be as -- as Justice20 Ginsburg suggested that under Crews, because the21 physiognomy of a person -- five justices determined22 there the appearance is not something that's subject to23 suppression, the police officer's observation that it24 was in fact this individual who looks like this driving25 the car would not be subject to suppression, either.29in￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 But that's not presented. All that is at issue here is2 whether or not the elicitation of the name and3 records directly linked to that are subject to4 suppression.5theJUSTICE BREYER: He made a mistakethe car.MS. HALLIGAN: Pardon?JUSTICE BREYER: He made a mistake. He said6 I'm driving789 in court: I was driving the core -- car. He neversaid it. All right, now once he said it, he's driving the car.MS. HALLIGAN: Well -­JUSTICE BREYER: So now you're saying why14 does this case even come up? Because once you15 name, the second he said it in court you could16 looking his -- you could go look at his -- his17 anyway; you could find all these -- the facts about him18 which I guess could you bring in.19 MS. HALLIGAN: Well, that's right, and20 that's why part of why a name should not be -­21 JUSTICE BREYER: So this case shouldn't be a22 special rule, it should just be a case of -- what is it23 called? It's a doctrine, you would have found it24 anyway; inevitable discovery.25 MS. HALLIGAN: You could resolve the case on3010 should have11 now we know12 13and said:￼Alderson Reporting Companyhave his go up records1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the theory that by definition government records that are previously held -­JUSTICE BREYER: But they're only inevitably discovered if he makes a mistake of saying what his name is. No, no, not that -- the mistake of saying: I was driving the car. And then, as Justice Scalia pointed out, maybe you could suppress that, so it would -- it would -­MS. HALLIGAN: In this case the question of any observations of the defendant is waived. It was abandoned by operation of State law. You could have another case in which that at issue.JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. One -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to ask that. She said that -­JUSTICE BREYER: Why is -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- your -- your friend said that it was raised below. What -- what happened to it?MS. HALLIGAN: What happened is this: In the suppression motion initially, the defendant sought to suppress a number of things, including the observations of the police. The trial court judge did not rule specifically on that aspect of the suppression motion. The trial court judge said that there would be a suppression hearing on the statement that the31Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 defendant made, but there would not be a suppression2 hearing with regard to the DMV records because DMV3 records were not subject to suppression.4 At that point the defendant pled guilty, and5 so by operation of State law -- because first of all6 there was not a ruling specifically on the question of7 observations and the defendant failed to bring that to8 the trial court judge's attention, and because the9 guilty plea was taken, and you can only appeal when you10 plead guilty on a suppression motion where there's a11 final order, there's no final order on the observation.12 That's out of the case, that would be our position.13 You could have a subsequent case where that14 question would be presented if, in fact, an officer does15 not see a defendant until after he approaches the car,16 and in that case he would have to determine whether or17 not Crews and the five justices, which says the18 physiognomy of the defendant is not subject to19 suppression, controls and therefore allows the20 observations to come in; but it's not presented here.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- is your22 position that they can do anything in terms of the23 search of a name? Could they punch it into Google or24 something like that and find out a lot more than just25 what they have in their own possession?32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MS. HALLIGAN: I think that would be2 correct, Your Honor, but here you have records that not3 only are in the government's possession -- and this4 Court never has suggested -­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know -- I know it6 raises a different question, but you know, you keep7 saying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking8 about the name, but names are meaningless in the9 abstract. It's not just that the officer wants to know10 what to call him. It's what he wants to find out from11 the name.12 MS. HALLIGAN: The -­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And these days14 there's so many electronic databases, you can find out15 an awful lot just, you know, with the punch of a few -­16 a few buttons.17 MS. HALLIGAN: You could, and I think that18 that's why if the Court was concerned about the19 potential breadth of that holding, it could narrow it to20 the use of the name to link to government records. In21 the field, in particular, what an officer is going to22 look for is records that suggest danger, so for example23 what the officers have in New York State is they -­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but it's not25 limited to suggesting danger or whatever. It's -- it33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 can -- that may be what the officer on the scene is most2 interested in, of course, but once you get the guy's3 name you're 45 because you6 of investigation, and to suppress the knowledge of7 someone's identity would -- would blink reality.interested in a lot of things.MS. HALLIGAN: That's right, and that's are in the process of conducting some sort8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not9 suppressing the knowledge of somebody's identity. All10 that -- what's being suppressed is the evidence of11 criminal activity that you derive from that.12 MS. HALLIGAN: I think it's very different13 than when you have drugs in a car which could clearly be14 subject to suppression. All that you have here, first15 of all, that's elicited, is the name. The name itself16 is not subject to suppression, nor did the defendant17 seek to have it suppressed, as the court of appeals18 observed. And so that should be the end of the inquiry.19 If the antecedent piece of evidence is not subject to20 suppression then there's no poison that can flow from21 that to contaminate anything like the DMV record.22 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back and -­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think that that's not24 right, Ms. Halligan, because the search is the poisonous25 tree. Now, it might be that the name can't be34￼Alderson Reporting Company15 the product16 records are17 activity.18of the illegal government activity. These simply not the product of any governmentJUSTICE KAGAN: Why does it -­Official - Subject to Final Review1 suppressed, but it still might be that everything that's2 discovered as a result of knowing the name, which would3 never be discovered unless the search had taken place,4 could be suppressible.5 MS. HALLIGAN: Two points, Justice Kagan. I6 believe, first of all, that if the name is not7 suppressed and then something flows from the name, I8 don't think that you can skip that step and then9 suppress something that comes further down the road.10 But, secondly, the fact that these records were already11 in the government's possession is precisely what takes12 this outside the scope of the fruits doctrine. The13 fruits -- fruits doctrine has been held to apply14 repeatedly in cases where the evidence is in some sense￼JUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back and ask you20 to -- to explain what -- how you -- you think the -- the21 request for suppression of the police officer's22 observation was waived? That was raised in the motion23 to suppress, page 17A of the joint appendix.24 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.25 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, the -- the New York3519Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE ALITO:23 waives the issue unless the24 you missed -- you failed to-- and then the defendant defendant says by the way, address one of the arguments25 that I made?Official - Subject to Final Review1 Supreme Court apparently didn't understand that that2 issue was in the case and ruled only on suppression of3 the records and tangible evidence, is that right, 78A?4 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes.5 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- what is Mr.6 Tolentino supposed to do at that point to preserve the7 issue of the suppression of a police officer's8 observation?9 MS. HALLIGAN: To preserve the issue, Mr.10 Tolentino should have raised that fact to the judge,11 should have pointed it out pursuant to CPLR 71070,12 subsection (2). There's also case law explaining that13 when that happens, that is the obligation of the14 defendant and the defendant cannot raise the issue on15 appeal if it's not brought to the attention of the trial16 court judge at that point.JUSTICE ALITO: The defendant raises an18 issue before the trial judge, the trial judge ignores￼1719 that issue, 2021 guilty.22misses the issue -­MS. HALLIGAN: And then the defendant pleads36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MS. HALLIGAN: At the point at which the2 defendant pleads guilty, that is correct, Your Honor.3 The defendant pled guilty prior to seeking any ruling on4 that, specifically, or any clarification. None of this5 is -- is briefed before the Court, but the defendant6 also did not raise the issue of the observations in the7 brief to the intermediate State appellate court, the8 State court of appeals or this Court. So it has been9 deemed abandoned a long time ago. And in the oral10 argument before the New York Court of Appeals, the11 defendant seemed to concur in the fact that it had been12 abandoned.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you make the14 point that these records are already in the government's15 possession.16 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, isn't that18 true of everything that's available on any type of19 database? Everything in Google or whatever the other20 search engines are is in the government's possession in21 the sense that they've got it; all they've got to do is22 identify it in their search, and they've got it.23 MS. HALLIGAN: Well, this is in the24 government's possession in the literal sense of the25 word, and in fact to correct something that was said37￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 previously, although it's not in the record, the DMV2 records, along with other records, such as arrest3 warrants, are in fact in the NYPD's possession. They4 use a database that the State police generate which they5 download onto their server. So they have it in their6 actual possession, which is different from -­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it can't make8 a difference on whose server it is, does it?9 MS. HALLIGAN: No, I'm simply saying that it10 is in their possession.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is information12 that they can get if they have the correct way of13 searching it, which is here by name.14 MS. HALLIGAN: And -- and the fact that they15 are drawn to the records because they have stopped this16 individual and they have this name does not disqualify17 them from using those records. This Court has cited18 several times with approval to a case called Bynum in19 the D.C. circuit in which there were prints that were20 taken following an illegal detention, and those prints21 were suppressed. The prosecution knew that the22 defendant had committed the crime, because those prints23 had been taken and matched, and the defendant -- or the24 prosecution was allowed to use a set of prints that it25 already had in its files on retrial.38￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 The same thing happened in both Davis and2 Hayes. In fact, in both of those cases, there were3 convictions on remand, and the prosecution's attention4 was drawn5 activity.6 78 about theto the defendant only following some illegalI would like to -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you something practice in New York? I mean, there is an9 artificiality to this case because we are assuming that10 the stop was unlawful.11 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the police said it13 was lawful, because the radio was blasting so loud. Why14 did this issue even -- the issue of "suppose it was15 unlawful" even come up, instead of the city or the16 county saying what the police stopped him for was a17 traffic violation, was perfectly legal? Why get to the18 constitutional question when the prosecutor brought into19 play the argument that this was a lawful stop?20 MS. HALLIGAN: The prosecutor made two21 arguments on the -- in response to the suppression22 motion. One was that the DMV records were not subject￼23 to suppression as a category. The24 say, that the stop was legal. The25 ruled only on the first ground and39second was, as you trial court judge did not hold aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 hearing to adjudicate the facts of the stop, and so2 that's why it comes to you in this posture.3 JUSTICE ALITO: It does seem rather strange.4 That would have been, like, a 10-minute hearing. Why5 did you stop him? Well, he was playing the music too6 loud. Defendant testifies, I wasn't playing my music7 too loud. The trial judge says, Well, I believe you, or8 I believe you, and that's the end of the matter. It9 does seem really -- that's how things are done in trial10 court in New York City? You jump to these big11 constitutional issues and -­12 MS. HALLIGAN: I'm not sure that anyone13 realized that this case would -- would eventually come14 before this Court, but that is the way this particular15 case.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course we know it's too17 loud. It's always too loud.18 MS. HALLIGAN: There's actually a provision19 of the New York City Administrative Code, Your Honor,20 which is on point -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are these things22 public records? If I wanted to find out if you had23 been, you know, stopped for driving without a license,24 can I find that out?25 MS. HALLIGAN: Frankly, I think that's a40￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 difficult question, Your Honor. There are certain2 entities to which driving records can be disclosed3 pursuant to the Federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act,4 and there are also certain restrictions. So I think the5 answer to your question would depend on who was asking.6 But they are certainly the administrative adjudications7 that are made by a judge in traffic court, and in that8 sense, theyare every bit as valid a record as theany other court. There are simply certain with respect to DMV records specifically. JUSTICE KAGAN: Your government records9 decision of10 protections1112 argument, is it limited to New York City records or does13 it also apply to FBI records, to records of other cities14 and states which, presumably, would be available on a￼15 reciprocal basis?16 MS. HALLIGAN: I think it would apply to17 records available on a reciprocal basis, Your Honor.18 I would like to touch on the -­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you see no20 difference between Crews and Bynum, in the typical case21 where the evidence against the defendant is not22 developed as a result of an illegal stop -- it exists23 independent of that stop -- and one in which the stop24 itself creates the ground for arrest? Don't you see a25 difference between those two things?41Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. HALLIGAN: I guess I would say that what creates the grounds for arrest here is the fact that the individual was driving with a suspended license, and no-­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was no suspicion of that when that person was stopped. The suspicion to arrest arose not independent of the illegality, but as part of it.MS. HALLIGAN: But so, too, with Bynum. It was the match of the prints that caused the prosecutor to realize that this individual was guilty -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But all of the evidence at trial really had nothing to do with the fingerprint. It had to do with the victims and everyone else walking in and saying, That's the guy who did lie to me.MS. HALLIGAN: I believe in Bynum, Your Honor, the prints were critical, and here the only element -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the arrest.MS. HALLIGAN: No, in the adjudication itself. The appellate decision -- may I finish my answer? -- on remand in Bynum went back, suggests that the ability to locate those prior prints in the FBI file was essential to the conviction there.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,42Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Ms. Halligan.MS.

SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Petitioner seeks to suppress officialrecords that were lawfully in the State's possession before any Fourth Amendment violation occurred. That unprecedented request should be rejected for three reasons.One, the DMV records were accessed merely through use of Petitioner's name; two, those records were produced and possessed by the State long before the allegedly illegal stop at issue; and, three, deterrence does not outweigh the costs, the substantial costs of suppression under the circumstances present here.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is everything that the government has access to through any database considered in the government's possession?MR. SHAH: No, I don't -- I don't think I would go that far in terms of our government records argument. I think it would have to be information -­43Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review12 you phrased3 possession.45 government's possession I think would be the standard.6 So here I think we're talking, not about Google, but I7 think we're talking about governmental records.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's the9 difference? In either case, they need some search term,10 and then they will get the answers. I don't see why it11 makes a difference.12 MR. SHAH: I think for the governmental13 records part of our argument, that rationale is an14 independent rationale. The key part of it is that the15 information was actually in the government's possession16 before the Fourth Amendment violation occurred. I think17 it's fairer to say that governmental records that are18 produced and owned and possessed by the government19 qualify. I think it's a harder argument to make that20 something -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if -- I'm22 sorry, go ahead.23 MR. SHAH: That something might be -- that24 something that could be found by using Google was25 already in the government's possession before the44CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you said -- as it, I thought it was in the government'sMR.

Does that -­7 your argument apply to that?8 MR. SHAH: I think it could. I think it9 would depend on the arrangement. If it's a fully10 reciprocal arrangement that effectively allows the State11 full access to those records, then I think it may be12 tantamount to the State having effective possession.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: How about private databases14 that are going to be available to the government upon15 request?16 MR. SHAH: I think -- I think that's17 stretching it a little bit further. That's a little bit18 harder. Again, if it were the case that the State could19 be said to have effectively have possession of those20 records because, for example, a copy of them are sitting21 on their servers or they have such full access that even22 though they're prepared by a private database, the State23 has paid for them, so they're effectively State records,24 that may also fall within the scope.

Have you any doubt that that would be suppressible?MR. SHAH: I think the government could have an argument that the fruits would not be suppressible.JUSTICE BREYER: They're not suppressible simply because you get them through a name? You break into a house, get a name; as a result of the name, you know what criminal enterprise to go to; as a result of that criminal enterprise going to, you get every evidence under the sun, absolute direct connection. And you say that's not suppressible?MR. SHAH: A couple of responses, Your Honor. There is, first, already extensive deterrent value from -­JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. I just wanted to know the ultimate response.47Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. SHAH: Right.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Now assume it's the3 opposite response. If it's the opposite response, for4 state of argument, how is it any different whether he's5 showered with drugs or showered with government records?6 MR. SHAH: Okay. So I think my -- my7 response is that the fruits are not necessarily8 suppressible in your -- in your hypothetical.9 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. I wanted you to10 assume the opposite. I got -- you win if my11 hypothetical -- if it's not even drugs, it's not even12 government records. But if it is drugs, why isn't it13 government records? This won't hurt you very much,14 because often there will be an alternative source, but15 suppose there isn't. Why are government records16 different from drugs?17 MR. SHAH: Right. Because the government18 already possesses those records. Those records were19 within the government's possession before any Fourth20 Amendment violation occurred. It would be depriving the21 government of information it already had, and there is22 no precedent within this Court's Fourth Amendment23 jurisprudence that would -­24 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose they -- they -- they25 break into the house with an axe, and they find out the48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 name, they see this guy is Dagwood, and so they run that2 through their -- their database, and they find this is3 the guy we've been looking for, for the last 20 years.4 He is responsible for all the drugs that come into this5 country, he's committed numerous acts of terrorism, he's6 a -- he's a serial killer, he's killed 50 people, we've7 been chasing him forever, and so the -- the result would8 be all that knowledge, that this is Dagwood is the fruit9 of the poisonous tree and nothing can be done about10 Dagwood?11 MR. SHAH: No, no, Your Honor. I want to be12 very clear. My response is that that is not subject to13 suppression. And -- and -- and even my friend on the14 other side conceded that if it were an -- an outstanding15 arrest warrant such as in your hypothetical that would16 lead to of the name, even if the name were a fruit of an17 illegal stop or search, that that arrest warrant would18 still provide a basis to arrest the defendant and19 prosecute the defendant.20 Now, it may be that other fruits that are21 discovered in the home or statements taken from the22 defendant in the home would be suppressed, but certainly23 the prosecution could proceed under the Ker-Frisbie24 Rule, and any preexisting evidence that this person was25 an axe murderer or whatever else evidence that the49￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 government had would certainly still be admissible in2 the prosecution for whatever.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned some -­4 before you finish, you -- you said a name is not5 suppressible, and that's because this Court held -- we6 started out by saying the observation of the person that7 dropped out of this case, so we're talking only about8 records, but the extraction of a name, you say that's9 not suppressible, even though it was unlawfully10 extracted because there were no reasonable suspicions11 that this person did anything wrong?12 MR. SHAH: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, we would13 say that a name is different, that it's not14 suppressible, and we would rely on the language this15 Court used in Lopez-Mendoza, which says the respondent's16 body or identity is never suppressible, even if it's17 obtained as a result of an illegal search, seizure or18 interrogation.19 We think name is -- is part and parcel of a20 defendant's identity, and that it has a special status21 within -- within the criminal justice system.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, how would you23 think about this problem? Suppose the police start24 stopping people and rather than asking for your name,25 they take a blood sample, they prick your finger, and50￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 then they take that blood and they look in their very2 extensive DNA databases, and they discover, oh, this is3 a guy who, you know, did these various terrible things,4 and start building cases. Would that be all right?5 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think other types6 of biometric evidence that you suggest, for example, of7 blood evidence, might well implicate competing8 considerations that would dictate a different result.9 And let me suggest a couple of the competing10 considerations, why I think the Court doesn't need to11 reach so far and say all sorts of biometric information12 should be treated the same.13 For -- for one -- for one thing, things like14 a name or even a fingerprint, this Court has said is not15 a separate Fourth Amendment event to acquire that. For16 example, once someone is detained, it's not also a17 search to ask for their name or to take a fingerprint.18 However, in your example, pricking someone19 with a needle to obtain their blood would be a separate20 Fourth Amendment event, because that would be a separate21 invasion of their -- of their bodily integrity, privacy,22 and that might warrant different considerations, since23 there are two violations there. There might be a need24 for greater deterrent.25 I think the other sort of consideration that51￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 might be implicated in -- in that type of hypothetical2 is that evidence unlike a name or fingerprint, DNA3 evidence, for example, that you suggest, might provide4 competing considerations in the sense that it could lead5 to other types of information that not -- that may not6 be relevant to the criminal justice system, medical7 records, genetic information. It may pose a specter of8 other competing considerations that might require a9 different balance in the end.10 I think it would be premature for this Court11 to weigh in one way or another as to whether that would12 be appropriate. I think we would need a record and we13 would want time to -- to -- to -- we would want that to14 play out and see -- and see what the consequences were.15 So I don't think the Court has to go that far. I think16 the Court can limit it, as in this case, to name,17 fingerprints and other traditionally -- other18 information traditionally used to identify a defendant.19 Thank you.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah.21 Ms. Schwarz, you have 4 minutes remaining.22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZ23 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER24 MS. SCHWARZ: I would first just like to25 address Justice Breyer's concern about what the rule52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 should be, and -- excuse me. So long as there's2 sufficient causal relationship between the Fourth3 Amendment violation and the later discovery of evidence,4 this Court has expressed continued allegiance to this5 rule. So in this case the reason why the DMV records6 are suppressible fruit is it fits that classic7 definition.8 Why are the observations suppressible when9 the identity isn't? That's another issue that was10 raised. The observations are -- again, they fit the11 definition whereas the identity does -- does not fit12 that. The Ker-Frisbie rule prevents a person himself13 from being suppressible, but the elicitation of his name14 is something entirely separate. So in other word, in15 the Crews case a majority of the Court said that a -- a16 person could not suppress their person or their face17 from being in court; five of the justices said that; but18 five justices said that the in-court identification19 could under certain circumstances be suppressible. So20 they drew a distinction between the person's body being21 brought into court, which is not suppressible because of22 the Ker-Frisbie rule, and then the evidentiary use of23 the identity, the fact that the five of the justices24 said that in certain circumstances not applicable in25 that case, the in-court identification could be53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 suppressible shows the distinction. And that's the2 distinction that has been -- is confusing about this3 case, because the elicitation of his name is what led to4 the DMV records. But even if this Court found that the5 elicitation of the name was not sufficient or was6 somehow related to Ker-Frisbie and could not be7 suppressible, the DMV records directly flow from the8 Fourth Amendment violation here, from the Prouse9 violation. And so it really doesn't really matter.10 Especially in light of the decision in Whren11 to remove subjective motivations from the determinations12 of constitutional reasonableness in car stops, it's13 essential to enforce what remains of motorists' core14 Fourth Amendment rights; and the Whren standards just15 must be enforced; otherwise these core Fourth Amendment16 values will be undermined and police will be left free17 to stop people on the roads with no objective basis and18 check their ID and status and do fishing expeditions19 into this sea of data that will be linked to the police20 computers; and this would violate Prouse and Brown and21 Hiibel.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose would23 subject the police officers to liability, though, right?24 In civil actions?25 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, this is a classic54￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 case where there's a clear relationship, a causal2 relationship, so this is the sort of case where this3 Court has continued allegiance to application of the4 exclusionary rule where the exclusionary rule is very5 strong; and so why would the Court say that the second6 sister of the exclusionary rule, in this circumstance7 where there's sufficiently deliberate, that exclusion8 would be meaningful and sufficiently culpable, that the9 evidence would be -- that application of the rule would10 be worth the cost? In this situation there's no reason11 to abandon the exclusionary rule.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you13 agreeing with your adversary that you abandoned and are14 not entitled to raise the suppressibility of the15 observation?16 MS. SCHWARZ: No. Well -­17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if you're not, in18 what ways is it tied to the question presented about19 identity, which is the issue you sought cert on?20 MS. SCHWARZ: Right. I -- I have no qualms21 in my adversary explaining that the question presented22 was limited because of the procedure, of the way the23 trial court's decision was made. However if this Court24 remanded the case, the question of whether the25 observations were suppressible would be very much at55￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425play.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Because when he entered a guilty plea, you reserved only the question concerning the motor vehicle records; you didn't reserve any other questions.MS. SCHWARZ: Well, but at the suppression hearing, the -- the court would be free to consider all of the suppressible fruit, including the -- the statement that was made and the observations and also the DMV records.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
