DRAPER                ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF          MR. DRAPER:  Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, andmay it please the Court:          The parties are here on exceptions to the thirdreport in this case.  After the Court determined that theState of Colorado had violated the Arkansas River Compactin 1995, the case was returned to the Special Master forfurther proceedings.          Subsequently, the Special Master determined thatColorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact in everyyear from the inception of their compact to the date offiling of this case in 1985.  He further determined that,since the filing of the lawsuit, that Colorado hascontinued to violate the compact in every year through1996, except for 1987.  Colorado does not challenge those1011121314151617181920212223    determinations.24 25          Each of those determinations is in the unit ofacre feet.  Altogether, for the period 1950 through 1994,3         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    the period at issue here for the remedy, he determined2    that approximately 420,000 acre feet of water had been3    depleted from the Arkansas River by Colorado and its water4    users in violation of the compact.  That amount of water5    is about 125,000 times the size of this courtroom, or a6    column the size of this courtroom extending upward about7    1,000 miles.8              He has determined that the proper remedy for9    these losses, which are both past and future, because of10    the lingering effects of the violations by Colorado,11    should be compensated in money rather than in water.  At12    the end of trial, Kansas had determined that its losses13    were $62 million.  Colorado's corresponding number was $914    million.1516171819202122232425          The Special Master recognized losses that wecalculate to be approximately $57 million.  However, theSpecial Master was persuaded by Colorado not to accordKansas full compensation for its losses.  He reduced itfurther by denying part of the prejudgment interest thathad been quantified by Kansas at trial.          QUESTION:  Why should any prejudgment interestbe awarded as between States?  I mean, this is based on acompact, isn't it, this lawsuit?          MR. DRAPER:  This is based on the compact, yes,Your Honor.4ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  And is there any provision in thecompact for the provision of prejudgment interest?          MR. DRAPER:  No, there is no specific provisionon prejudgment interest, nor is there any provisionspecifically addressing the remedy, just as there was noprovision in the Pecos River Compact, which this Court --          QUESTION:  Well, the common law rule, I assume,is that you don't award prejudgment interest forunliquidated damages.          MR. DRAPER:  That is the traditional rule, YourHonor, but it is a largely discredited rule at this pointin history, and the Court has recognized that mostrecently --          QUESTION:  Oh, but as between State sovereigns,I mean, who is going to pay the bill in Colorado?  It'sthe taxpayers, isn't it?          MR. DRAPER:  It's the State of Colorado.  Theyare the signatory --          QUESTION:  The taxpayers of the State ofColorado will end up footing the bill, and it just seemsodd to me that we would all of a sudden craft some ruleallowing prejudgment interest against a sovereign State.I mean, the States presumably had ample opportunity tonegotiate at the time of the compact for the kinds ofthings that should go into a damages award in the event of5         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 a breach. 2              MR. DRAPER:  In almost every case, the compacts 3    that are in place now do not specify the precise remedy, 4    or in most cases any remedy that might be afforded by this5 Court. 6              QUESTION:  Did they just assume that, what, 7    normal contractual remedies would be applied? 8              MR. DRAPER:  I think that is the correct 9    analysis, Your Honor.  The Court has said in 1987, in the10    Texas v. New Mexico litigation, that the contract remedies11    should be looked to to determine the proper remedy for12    breach of a compact.13              QUESTION:  Was that the very first case in which14    damages, money damages were even awarded in one of these15    original jurisdiction cases?16              MR. DRAPER:  That is the first case, Your Honor,17    in which the prospect of money damages for violation of an18    interstate water compact were allowed.  There was not a19    specific amount at that time.  The Court returned the case20    to the Special Master, and it was settled before further21    determination was necessary.22              QUESTION:  The point wasn't even contested here,23    was it?  Both sides wanted to resolve the case with24    monetary payment instead of with water, so that's hardly,25    you know, solid precedent for the proposition that money6               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425damages are awarded.          MR. DRAPER:  In this case, Your Honor, if Iunderstood your point, Colorado took the positioninitially that compensation should be in water, withoutinterest.  The State of Kansas took the position that itshould be in money with interest.          QUESTION:  Right, and this is the first casewe've had where that conflict has been presented to us.One of the parties doesn't want to pay money damages.          MR. DRAPER:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  And if we didn't allow money damages,I presume it would -- and if one of the parties wouldprefer monetary damages, I presume they could negotiate itout and pay -- I mean, Colorado could negotiate it out andpay money instead of water.          MR. DRAPER:  That's correct, and Colorado is notchallenging the determination by the Special Master herethat the remedy should be in money.          QUESTION:  I know they're not, but --          QUESTION:  If money damages were not awarded,and some form of water relief, then you have a masterwho's there forever and administering the thing at greatcost, often, to the parties, so money damages have that torecommend them.          MR. DRAPER:  Money damages certainly has that to                             7         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    recommend them, Your Honor.  It's hard to tell whether 2    we're receiving the water.  You look at the river, and 3    Colorado says, that's your water coming down in payment 4    for our past violations.  I can tell when we get a check. 5    I'm not so sure when I'm looking at water in the river. 6              QUESTION:  It's -- the interest question was 7    never adjudicated before, but you're saying as well the 8    damages question was never adjudicated, because last time 9    around both parties said that's what they wanted.10              MR. DRAPER:  Last time around it was not clear11    that the parties were in agreement on the possibility of12    money damages, but this Court ruled that that was an13    option that should be considered by the Special Master.14              QUESTION:  If you want to get a check instead of15    water, you can always negotiate that out.  I mean --1617    check.1819    burden on us to try to figure out how you compute money20    damages for failure to deliver water.  I mean, that's one21    of the big issues in this case, I suppose, isn't it?22    You're going to get to that, whether we compute the losses23    to the farmers of Kansas from the failure to have more24    water delivered.25              MR. DRAPER:  Yes.  There's no dispute at this8               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR. DRAPER:  That's true, and we're asking for aQUESTION:  So I mean, and that wouldn't put the 1    point in the case, Your Honor, that the compensation 2    should be paid in money.  That, as Your Honor alludes to, 3    was quantified by Kansas in large part by assessing the 4    injuries suffered by the water users in Kansas, mostly 5    irrigating farmers. 6              The approach was taken to assess the losses in 7    value suffered by the water users in Kansas because we had 8    no ready market for water to which we could turn for the 9    value of an acre foot of water in 1950, 1951 and so on.10    If we had that, that would have been the most direct way11 to do it.12              QUESTION:  I take it your argument for interest13    here is that there were -- that the money -- I'm sorry,14    that the water you didn't get in the 45 years in which the15    violations went on is translatable into crop loss, crop16    loss is translatable into money and, in order to be made17    whole on the money, you should be made whole on the loss18    of use of the money.  I mean, that's your interest19    argument, isn't it?20              MR. DRAPER:  That's exactly right, Your Honor.21              QUESTION:  Okay.22              MR. DRAPER:  Yes.23              QUESTION:  Did you -- was there an inflationary24    factor added so that the damages, say for the early25    sixties were computed in 1995 or year 2000 dollars?9               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. DRAPER:  For the years that were denied 2    prejudgment interest treatment, 1950 through 1968, the 3    Special Master did adjust those, at the suggestion of 4    Colorado, not on the basis of principal, but simply 5    because Colorado was not objecting to that.  Those are 6    adjusted, which is only a fraction of the time value of 7    money that occurred from that period to the present. 8              QUESTION:  But the people who are paying are 9    really the present taxpayers, and they're paying for10    something that older generations of taxpayers maybe didn't11    do, and it could be horrendous amounts, if you have a12    violation that's 200 years old, as you could in a13    different case.14              Rather than getting into all that, why wouldn't15    we assume that the States didn't want to unless they said16    it specifically in the compact?17              MR. DRAPER:  Your Honor, there are limits to18    keep such amounts from --19              QUESTION:  Why?20              MR. DRAPER:  -- becoming too large.  The21    principle that was largely addressed in the last time that22    the case was before the Court, that is, laches, the23    question was, was there unreasonable delay in prosecuting24    Kansas' claim by Kansas?  That was contested --25              QUESTION:  No, no, I suppose it's nobody's10               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    fault, you know.  It just -- what I vision, and I want the 2    answer to this, and I'll exaggerate it, but hoards of 3    lawyers in State Attorneys Generals offices combing 4    through the files of ancient documents looking for 5    violations, primarily to receive for the State Treasury 6    vast amounts of money coming out of compound interest.  I 7    mean, you see, that's the horror. 8              Now, what prevents that from happening, once we 9    get into the habit of awarding prejudgment interest?10              MR. DRAPER:  The Court has stated that the11    determination of prejudgment interest is subject to the12    Court's discretion.  It is also subject to consideration,13    again, of the time that has passed, and we are looking14    here at not simply any claim that could be found in the15    cellar of a courthouse.16              This is the claim of the State of Colorado17    against the State of Kansas, or, I'm sorry, the State of18    Kansas against the State of Colorado, and it is Colorado,19    along with Kansas, who are the signatory parties to this20    compact, and the compact itself, in article 7(a), equates21    the State with its water users.22              If I could turn your attention to that23    particular provision.  It is in the topside brief, the24    blue brief, in the appendix at page A-11.  Beginning at25    the bottom of A-10, article 7(a) of the Arkansas River11               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    Compact says, each State shall be subject to the terms of 2    this compact.  Where the name of the State or the term, 3    State, is used in this compact, these shall be construed 4    to include any person or entity of any nature whatsoever 5    using, claiming, or in any manner asserting any right to 6    the use of the waters of the Arkansas River under the 7    authority of that State. 8              We believe that this equates the water users in 9    both States with the States themselves both in terms of10    the actions in Colorado by Colorado water users11    constituting the actual violation by the State of Colorado12    and, on the other side of the State line, the losses13    suffered by the individual farmers in Kansas, being the14    losses that the State of Kansas, as State, is entitled to15    claim for breach of the obligation that Colorado had to16    the State of Kansas.17              In further support of that point, I would point18    to a second provision of the compact.  It's in the same19    appendix at page A-5, and this is in the famous20    provision -- at least famous to those of us who have been21    working on this case -- 4(d).  This is the provision that22    makes explicit the obligation of Colorado, and it's the23    proviso in the last five lines of Article 4(d) that is24    important.25 It reads, provided that the waters of the                   12ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    Arkansas River, as defined in Article 3, shall not be 2    materially depleted in usable quantity or availability for 3    use to the water users in Colorado and Kansas under this 4    compact by future development or construction. 5              We believe that it is not the proper 6    characterization of this case that it is going to be -- 7    that is a problem for the individuals, either as taxpayers 8    in Colorado or the water users in Kansas, but that these 9    are State obligations, and they need to be settled between10    States on fair, compensatory rules that are normally11    applied in contract situations, because, as we know,12    compacts are contracts between the compacting States.13              QUESTION:  Is it the case that there is no14    market for an acre foot of water in Kansas?  Is there such15    a price today that could be paid if a farmer were to go16    out and buy water from another farmer who had some?  Would17    there be a price paid per acre foot?18              MR. DRAPER:  Your Honor, there is no specific19    evidence in the record on that, but from my knowledge the20    water tends to be transferred with the land, and it is21    used primarily for irrigation purposes.22              QUESTION:  Well, in today's world I think we all23    are aware that water can be severed from the land and24    sold, so much an acre foot, for application on a different25    piece of land.13               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. DRAPER:  That's correct, Your Honor.However, that information was not available to asufficient extent for the years 1950 and later to --          QUESTION:  Well, presumably you'd take thecurrent value and then adjust for values in earlier times.          MR. DRAPER:  Our experts sought to determinefrom specific data applicable to each year what the losseswere, what the crop prices were, what the appropriateinterest rates were for that year and each following year,to get a --          QUESTION:  It just seems like such acomplicated, not obvious measure of damages.  I was juststruck by how strange it was, really, to try to measuredamages here in dollars based on some estimated crop lossto individual farmers.          MR. DRAPER:  It is a daunting task at times,Your Honor, but we wanted to present to the Special Masterthe most specific data that we could possibly find.          QUESTION:  Does Kansas have the riparian systemof water rights, or the appropriated system?          MR. DRAPER:  Appropriated system, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  There's one thing on the question ofhow far the compound interest could compound that I don'tunderstand, and I was -- I want to ask the other side thesame question, but maybe you can explain it.14         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          As I understand, the Master decided that theinterest ought to run from 1969, which was the date uponwhich each side either knew or should have known that aviolation of the compact was taking place.          MR. DRAPER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  The Master also decided that therehad been no undue delay on the part of Kansas in notinstituting suit for another, what was it, 17 years,something like that?1011121314151617181920    delay.21              Now, all of this may be relevant if we determine22    that interest should run and try to come up with some          MR. DRAPER:  That's correct.  It was -- suit wasfiled at the end of 1985.          QUESTION: Indeed.  The two dates, or thefindings with respect to the two dates struck me as beingat least possibly in tension.  I'm not suggesting thatKansas would have been obligated to file suit, of course,in 1969, the year that it first knew or should have known,but it also seems the case that there was rather a longgap between that time and the time that Kansas actuallydid institute suit, and yet the Master found no undue23    determination about how to take the point at which it24    begins to run.  Is there some tension between the knew or25    should have known in '69, and the no undue delay for a15               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    lawsuit that wasn't filed for 17 years? 2              MR. DRAPER:  I believe there is some tension, 3    Your Honor.  We believe that the way that the Special 4    Master has applied the lack of knowledge in the two areas, 5    one area being where there was unreasonable delay, and the 6    other area being whether prejudgment interest should be 7    awarded, is inconsistent. 8              We suggest that it is impossible to find 9    unreasonable delay if the plaintiff was unaware of the10    claim.  That was essentially --11              QUESTION:  You mean, unaware in fact, even if12    the plaintiff should have been aware?13              MR. DRAPER:  That would go into the14    reasonableness of the delay.  Should -- knew or should15    have known would be the complete statement of that test.16              QUESTION:  Okay.17              QUESTION:  In response to my question, my18    concern that they would dig up old claims and then have19    horrendous interest, you said, well, there's a lot of20    discretion in the Master to prevent that from happening.21    That's what he did here.  He said, we're not going to give22    you the money between 1950 and 1968.  Now you're23    complaining about that, so if he doesn't have discretion,24    then why isn't my horrendous imaginary hypothetical a real25 problem?16               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. DRAPER:  Well, the cardinal rule, YourHonor, is complete compensation.          QUESTION:  Well, fine.  If it's completecompensation, then we're back to my problem, which isdigging up very old claims from 1780 or something, and wediscover that all of the taxpayers of Massachusetts aregoing to pay $5 billion to New Hampshire because theyfound a claim from 1782 and there's compound interest.          MR. DRAPER:  I would suggest only, Your Honor,that there are methods by which the Court has dealt withsignificant or unreasonable delay in its interstatecases --          QUESTION:  Yes, that's what I'm interested in,the cases where you can't say laches.  They dig up somegood claim, and now you previously said they have a lot ofdiscretion on the prejudgment interest part.  Now you'resaying they don't have discretion on the prejudgmentinterest part.          MR. DRAPER:  Well, I should clarify my position.I would say that there -- while there is discretion, it isa very limited scope, given the authorities of this Court,and that it is to be exercised according to a system ofprinciples that have been set out by this Court.          QUESTION:  Mr. Draper, why --          QUESTION:  Certainly somebody bringing a 200-17         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    year-old claim would find a formidable barrier in the 2    doctrine of laches, would they not? 3              MR. DRAPER:  Yes, Your Honor.  This Court in 4    1995 did not go so far as to decide that laches is 5    applicable, but found that in this case there was 6    unreasonable delay and that, either through the doctrine 7    of laches or acquiescence, there was the ability of the 8    Court to deal with stale claims. 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Draper, could I come back to10    Justice Souter's question?  I don't understand how it is11    that Kansas should not have known enough to bring the suit12    until 1987, but Colorado should have known that it was13    wrongfully taking too much water 17 years before that?  It14    seems to me the two should go hand in hand.15              MR. DRAPER:  We believe that the existence or16    nonexistence of knowledge on the part of Colorado is17    absolutely irrelevant as a matter of law, and we have18    taken no position on what the right date might be if --19              QUESTION:  Well, how can that be?  The whole20    purpose of the common law rule against prejudgment21    interest for unliquidated claims was because of lack of22    knowledge to the -- by the defendant.  That was the whole23    reason for the common law rule, and if that's the reason,24    then you're asking us to adopt a new rule here.  How could25    Colorado have known about prejudgment interest in an18               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    interstate compact dispute? 2              MR. DRAPER:  Your Honor, that whole line of 3    reasoning, we assert, has been discredited.  It is not 4    logical.  It has faced trenchant criticism, to use the 5    words of this Court, in the 1995 case, City of Milwaukee, 6    and we believe that this is, as the Court has pointed out, 7    essentially a contract dispute.  One must keep in mind 8    that it is sovereign States who are the contracting 9    parties, but the guiding principles --10              QUESTION:  So shouldn't that, Mr. Draper, mean11    that there should be some modification?  You say the12    common law rule has been abandoned in many States because13    it's illogical, the distinction between liquidated and14    unliquidated damages.15              On the other hand, as Justice O'Connor's16    starting questions indicated, we are dealing here with a17    peculiar animal, a suit between two States, so why do you18    insist that you take the, what would be the rule for an19    ordinary contract in the State that's abandoned the20    liquidated-nonliquidated and take that over, jot and21    tittle, to the interstate suit?22              MR. DRAPER:  Because, Your Honor, it would23    violate the principle that this Court set out in 1987 that24    a remedy would be provided by this Court for violation of25    an interstate compact.  If you do that, the Court is not19               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    providing a complete remedy.2              QUESTION:  Well, but that -- doesn't that sort3    of beg the question?  If we start with the assumption that4    there is some discretion over the matter of interest, why5    couldn't we resolve the tension between the findings with6    respect to those two dates with a rule like this, that7    interest will be awardable from the time at which the8    violation either was or should have been known, and from9    the time after that at which suit was instituted, to avoid10    the problem of allowing a State, as apparently Kansas did11    here, to sit on its rights from 1969 to whatever it was,12 1977? 13141516171819202122232425Honor --MR. DRAPER:  There are two answers to that, YourQUESTION:  '87.  '87, yes.          MR. DRAPER:  There are two answers.   One isthat this Court has already determined that there was notunreasonable delay in bringing this suit, and the SpecialMaster did not base in any way his decision to limitprejudgment interest on any delay other than thatconsidered in the laches analysis.          QUESTION:  Well, I know that, but why shouldn'the have?  I mean, it just seems odd whether the delay --call the delay undue or not, the fact is there was a 17 or18-year delay from the time at which Kansas could have20         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425brought this lawsuit.  Why should Kansas be rewarded withinterest for that delay, even if it was not undue?          MR. DRAPER:  It's not a reward.  It's simplycompensation.  There is no windfall.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr Draper.          Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR       ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR          MR. MINEAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The United States would like to address twoissues with respect to the Master's proposed remedy.First, the Master's calculation of damages here does notviolate the Eleventh Amendment and, second, this Courtshould allow prejudgment interest on a discretionary basisin interstate compact suits.          QUESTION:  When you get to the second point, andI don't mean to spoil your order, but will you sort oftake up where we left off on the problem that we -- someof us seem to be having in finding that there wasknowledge, or should have been knowledge in '69.  We don'thave a suit for a couple of decades, and interest ispiling up.  That's our problem, and I -- so will youaddress that when you get to point 2?          MR. MINEAR:  I'd be happy to address that now,                            21         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in fact, to preserve the continuity of the argument.          Your Honor, first of all, the Master's findingwith respect to knowledge here related to Colorado'sknowledge, and not Kansas' knowledge, and Colorado hadknowledge that there was the prospect of some violationbecause it had complaints within its own State borderswith respect to groundwater pumping depletion, depletingstream flow and, as you may recall, that is the basis forliability here, that Colorado had allowed its citizens topump groundwater which reduced the State line flow.          QUESTION:  No, I realize that.  Did he, did theMaster specifically find that Kansas was not under anobligation to have known in '69?          MR. MINEAR:  He found that Kansas did not knowat that time.          QUESTION:  Did not know in fact?          MR. MINEAR:  Did not know in fact.          QUESTION:  And I suppose Colorado did not knowin fact, but he found that Colorado should have known in'69.  Did he make a finding that it was not the case thatKansas should have known in '69?          MR. MINEAR:  I do not believe that he did.  Idon't believe that he specifically addressed that issue.          QUESTION:  It would seem the same would apply.I mean, people from Kansas never go to Colorado?  I mean,                            22         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what's --          MR. MINEAR:  Well, it's hard to say what thestate of knowledge was in 1968, and to the extent therewas some lack of proof here, I think the burden would fallon Kansas to have --          QUESTION:  I mean, why can't we just make theassumption that if one side knew or should have known, theother side knew or should have known?          MR. MINEAR:  I do think that we simply can'tassume that --          QUESTION:  Farmers know who's drilling wells,and so forth.          MR. MINEAR:  On the other hand, though, theColorado, for instance, had commissioned a study.  It haddone its own internal studies.  I believe in 1965 it hadbegun to license groundwater pumping, so it's not clearthat everything that was known to one sovereign wouldnecessarily be known to another sovereign.          QUESTION:  Let's assume, just -- and I thinkwe've got your point, but assume for the sake of argumentthat Kansas would have been under the same duty to knowthat Colorado was, and that '69 is the date.          The case as it comes to us, I take it, is a casein which there is no question about Kansas being thrownout of court for suing too late, but it may well be that,23         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    by waiting so long to sue, Kansas should not be entitled2    to the same running and compounding of interest that it3    would have been entitled to if it had sued more promptly4    after the 1969 date.  Why shouldn't we take that5    possibility into consideration in fashioning the rule as6    to when the interest starts to run?7              MR. MINEAR:  I think it's entirely fair to take8    that consideration into account.  The United States' view9    with regard to prejudgment interest is that it should be10    allowed in interstate compact suits, but on a11    discretionary basis, based on the facts of the individual12    case.13141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, one thing seems to havegotten lost in this discussion.  I thought that it was --when Colorado, or perhaps Kansas, knew that Kansas waterwas being depleted, and when you were able to prove incourt how much, wasn't there something in the record thatuntil there was computer modeling you couldn't estimatewith any degree of accuracy --MR. MINEAR:  That's --          QUESTION:  -- how much was involved, and thatwasn't until the eighties.          MR. MINEAR:  That's correct, Your Honor, thatalso there was difficulty in determining exactly how muchwater had been depleted.  It wasn't clear when that24ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    knowledge was available, but it certainly was after, we 2    believe, 1968. 3              QUESTION:  No, but couldn't they have brought a 4    suit in equity to stop depletion, and if they had done 5    that, the damages wouldn't be running, we wouldn't have 6    the interest question. 7              MR. MINEAR:  Well, I agree with that as well, 8    and again I think this focuses -- 9              QUESTION:  So the fact that they may not have10    been able to prove the precise predicate, which is the11    modeling predicate for the computation of money damages12    now, doesn't prove that they shouldn't have sued earlier.13              MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I agree with all of the14    points that are being made here, and the United States15    wishes to emphasize the principle that a rigid rule one16    way or another with regard to prejudgment interest is what17    ought to be avoided here.  We do think these factors are18    relevant in considering what is the appropriate level of19    prejudgment interest.20              QUESTION:  Well, why not do the simplest thing?21    They're States.  They can say what they want in the22    compact.  Just say, the traditional common law, no23    interest on, no prejudgment interest on unliquidated24    damages, or whatever, applies, we assume it in the25    contract, compact, unless they work it out and say to the25               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 contrary. 2              MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, because I think that 3    doesn't adequately address the common law rule, which I 4    think we should look to the Restatement of Contracts in 5    stating the rule in a compact case. 6              That's the closest analogy to the contract 7    situation, and in the Restatement of Contracts, since 1932 8    the rule has been that, where damages are a fixed sum of 9    money, or a performance that has a fixed value,10    prejudgment interest does apply, but in those cases, in11    all other cases prejudgment interest is applied under a12    rule of reasonableness, based on the aspects, the13    circumstances of the particular case.14              So our position really simply suggests that the15    Restatement rule is what ought to be applied here.  Both16    States would have been on knowledge of that principle as a17    background principle in this case.18              I would like to address the Eleventh Amendment19    issue, because I think that also merits this Court's20    concern.  The Master properly determined, in accordance21    with this Court's decision in Texas v. New Mexico, that22    Kansas is entitled to money damages as a basis for23    Colorado's compact violations, as a remedy for the compact24    violations, and he calculated those damages by determining25    the value of the water that Kansas was entitled to but did26               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not receive and, in making that determination, heevaluated the cost to Kansas farmers, which was reflectedin two matters, increased groundwater pumping costs, andalso lost crop production.          Colorado has challenged that aspect of the awardon the basis that it violates the Eleventh Amendment, andwe disagree.  Our view is, the Master's determination ofdamages here was simply by reference to what the water wasworth to the Kansas users, not to provide any sort ofcompensation for the Kansas users themselves.          QUESTION:  Well, you mean Colorado can't turnaround and give it to the Kansas users who had beendeprived of it, if they're still around?          MR. MINEAR:  You mean, could Kansas turn aroundand give the money --          QUESTION:  Right.  Right.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  Yes, I believe that Kansascould do that if they wished.          QUESTION:  So what's the difference between thatand these users just suing Colorado themselves?          MR. MINEAR:  Well, it's not clear that the usersindividually have a claim against Colorado.  Kansas doeshave its own claim predicated on the compact.          QUESTION:  Let's assume they don't.  Let'sassume they don't.  Let's assume it would violate the27         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    Eleventh Amendment for these farmers who are deprived of 2    the water to sue Colorado.  Why does it make any sense to 3    allow Kansas to sue on their behalf, and then turn around 4    and give them the money? 5              MR. MINEAR:  Because Kansas is not suing on 6    their behalf.  Kansas is suing for the performance that 7    was due to it under the compact.  Kansas is asserting, in 8    essence, its own claim, which was for delivery of a usable 9    quantity of water, usable water at the State line, and --10              QUESTION:  Why shouldn't the measure of damages,11    then, relate to what Kansas as a State lost?  It did, in12    part, lost income taxes and that kind of thing.  I mean,13    why would the measure be specifically what each farmer14    would have lost in terms of dollars?15              MR. MINEAR:  The Master did include State income16    taxes and secondary taxes.17              QUESTION:  I can understand that, but it's hard18    to know why the measure of money damages should be based19    strictly on, or in part on what the individual farmer20    would have lost if the State doesn't plan to turn around21    and give it to the farmer.22              MR. MINEAR:  Well, Your Honor, the reason why23    is, we have to determine what was the value of the water24    at the State line, and as you pointed out before, there is25    no market for the water like there would be a market for28               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    responsibilities. 9              QUESTION:  Why is that?  Where does that10    interest stem from?11              MR. MINEAR:  We are parties to these suits12    frequently, most likely in issues revolving, involving13    liability.  We are a party to this suit because of our14    operation of the upstream reservoirs.15              QUESTION:  But does the award of damages from16    Colorado to Kansas in any way affect the Government's17    operation of those upstream reservoirs?18              MR. MINEAR:  It would affect them if it were19    repayment in water.  Here, money is being used as a20    substitute for water, and we thought it appropriate to21    weigh in on that question with respect to the position22    that the Master has taken, and our position is very23    simply, simply that we have to look to what the value of24    the water was at the State line.25              QUESTION:  Well, my problem is, if you do it in29               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOso many bushels of wheat.          QUESTION:  Why does the United States have anyposition or interest as to what kind of damages Coloradopays Kansas, or the Eleventh Amendment, for that matter?          MR. MINEAR:  Well, Your Honor, we have a generalinterest in these original actions to make sure thatthere's a fair allocation of damages and rights and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this kind of suit, which is under a compact, I presume youwould have to do the same thing in a parens patriae suitby a State against another State, wouldn't you?  Wouldn'tyou apply the same rule?          MR. MINEAR:  Not necessarily Your Honor, becausethe compact situation involves a situation where there isa clear claim by the State under the -- an agreement thatis entered into by the States.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear.          Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. ROBBINS                ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT          MR. ROBBINS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I would like to turn initially to theprejudgment interest issue, since that seemed to draw theCourt's attention early on.  I would ask you to look atArticle 4(d) that Mr. Draper drew your attention to,because he only asked you to read the second half ofArticle 4(d).          QUESTION:  What page is that on?          MR. ROBBINS:  That's on page A-5 of the Kansasopening brief.          Article 4(d) describes for the parties and forthe Court what the parties actually intended, and that was30         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    not to impede or limit development of water within the 2    Arkansas Basin, subject only to the proviso, both States 3    understood that there would be additional development 4    within the basin, and both States understood that there 5    would be a risk that that development might cause material 6    depletion to usable flow. 7              QUESTION:  Are you now summarizing article, 8    section (d), Mr. Robbins? 9              MR. ROBBINS:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  I did not10    take the time to read the entire article, Your Honor.11              The -- later in the compact, in the enforcement12    provision, the two States address the manner in which they13    are going to determine when usable flows might be depleted14    by setting up an interstate agency called the Arkansas15    River Compact Administration, and the Arkansas River16    Compact Administration is charged with investigating17    concerns about material depletions to usable flow.18              There was no contemplation in this compact that19    Colorado -- I want to draw a distinction between other20    compacts that States have entered into, the Colorado River21    Compact, where the obligation to deliver water is set out22    at 75 million acre feet over 10 years by the Upper Basin,23    the Rio Grande Compact, where there is a table of24    relationship located right in the compact, where each25    signatory understands what it must do each year to comply31               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    with the compact. 2              In the case of the Arkansas River Compact, there 3    was no obligation on the part of Colorado to deliver a 4    particular quantum of water in any year.  Rather, both 5    States sought to have the opportunity to continue to 6    develop unused waters, and both States agreed that they 7    would be vigilant, working through the interstate agency, 8    to investigate when and if a violation or an under 9    delivery was occurring.10              Now, no investigation was requested.  Under the11    compact, under Article 7(h) -- 8(h), I'm sorry, until12    1985.  Prior to that time, both States cooperated together13    and worked together on the operation of the river.14    Neither State expressed an understanding that there was15    any way in which the river was being depleted by16    activities in Colorado or in Kansas.17              Remember, if you look again at Article 4(d), it18    applies to both States, not just Colorado, so what we need19    to do here is understand what the deal was, and the deal20    wasn't that Colorado was automatically guaranteeing that21    it was going to deliver a certain amount of water every22    year, which would be what would be assumed by the argument23    which Kansas has made, and therefore failing to deliver24    some amount over a 40-year period, we automatically should25    owe them significant damages, when, in fact, the concept32               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    here was that both States would work to allow full 2    development of the system, and both States would be 3    responsible to ensure that if overdevelopment occurred in 4    one or the other State that affected usable flows, an 5    investigation would be undertaken and appropriate 6    enforcement undertaken. 7              So in our view, at a minimum, on prejudgment 8    interest, until 1985 Colorado knew no more than Kansas. 9    There is nothing in the record to suggest that Colorado10    did.  The Master --11              QUESTION:  But they had a report done, which12    Kansas didn't.  Didn't they have a report done?13              MR. ROBBINS:  Absolutely.  We -- Justice Scalia,14    we certainly did.  That report did not deal with the issue15    of material depletion to usable flow.  It was looking,16    rather, at the general hydrology in the basin.  It did not17    look at other impacts that were affecting the flows of18 the --19              QUESTION:  Well, I mean, it was clear from that20    study that flow would be affected, wasn't it?  I mean, you21    didn't have to be a water expert to understand that the22    inevitable consequence of that study was that you were23    taking water from the river.24              MR. ROBBINS:  There is no question about that.25    Your point is exactly well-taken, but remember, we were33               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    entitled to take additional water from the river under 2    Article 4(d), subject only to the constraint that we not 3    deplete usable flows materially. 4              QUESTION:  Okay, but you've also got a finding 5    which you seem to -- I think you want to ignore here, that 6    you should have known in '69.  What do we do with that? 7              MR. ROBBINS:  Justice Souter, the finding that 8    the Master made, in our opinion, is contrary to this 9    Court's 1995 ruling.  We argued in 1995, the two States,10    about the very Wheeler report upon which the Master11    relied.  We argued that that report should have given the12    States notice of the existence of a potential problem13    under the compact, and this Court found, different than14    the master's first report to you, that the evidence was15    vague and conflicting.16              It is our view that in fairness, if it was too17    vague and conflicting to find that Kansas should have18    known in 1969 and brought suit at that time if it was19    concerned, or, better, referred it to the compact20    administration, that in fairness Colorado should be held21    to no higher standard of knowing that it was in fact22    depleting usable flows.23              QUESTION:  Well --24              MR. ROBBINS:  You're asking us to actually know25    there were depletions occurring when you did not find that34               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    Kansas was even charged --23 here? 45 6    that far, but I will assume it does. 7              MR. ROBBINS:  So it is our view that prejudgment 8    interest ought not be -- if you are to consider it as a 9    remedy in this case, it ought not be held against Colorado10    at a minimum until 1985, the time at which there was11    official notice that, in fact, Kansas was asserting that12    there were depletions material depletions --13              QUESTION:  And what's your position after 1985?14              MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I --15              QUESTION:  Suppose the shoe were on the other16    foot, and Colorado was suing some other State?17              MR. ROBBINS:  I do not believe, Justice18    O'Connor, that prejudgment interest is appropriate in this19    context until damages are liquidated.  There was no20    contemplation between the States that there would even be21    a monetary consequence in these compacts.  There might be22    injunctive relief.  You have to think that in 1949, that23    the law was such that the common law was generally24    accepted to be damages only suffered, prejudgment interest25    on liquidated damages.35               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOQUESTION:  Okay, but is that properly before usMR. ROBBINS:  I believe it is, yes.QUESTION:  I hadn't realized your claim went 1              The parties never discussed anything to do with 2    damages in this case.  The parties contemplated only that 3    they would work together through this interstate agency, 4    the compact administration, and would seek to ensure that 5    depletions to usable flow didn't occur. 6              QUESTION:  When I suggested that, the Government 7    said -- it sounded sensible.  They said, well, the 8    prejudgment interest rule has always been the common law, 9    just part of the common law, and why should we -- and you10    ought to just stick to that.11              MR. ROBBINS:  I agree completely with that, and12    I think the cases cited by my loyal opposition are not --13    do not stand for the proposition.  I do not believe the14    City of Milwaukee v. National Gypsum stands for the15    proposition that prejudgment interest is applicable in16    every dispute that involves some form of a contract.17              In fact, I believe that stands for the18    proposition that if you are in an admiralty circumstance,19    and if you know or should have known that, in fact, damage20    had occurred, and in that case there was a Great Lakes21    carrier sitting at the bottom of the harbor, and the good22    faith was about who put it there, not the good faith that23    Colorado's talking about here today, which was, we didn't24    have a clue, I don't think it's appropriate.25              QUESTION:  So your basic -- one part of your36               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    basic rule is, if the plaintiff isn't barred by laches,2    then the defendant shouldn't be hit with prejudgment3 interest. 45 6 7 8 9          MR. ROBBINS:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right.          MR. ROBBINS:  If we don't have a tolling --          QUESTION:  But that can't be the whole rule.What's the principle that you think we should adopt in      respect to prejudgment interest in a suit between two10    States?          MR. ROBBINS:  In my view, until a damage, thedamages are liquidated, there should not be prejudgmentinterest in this case, and I think that's --          QUESTION:  Well, in other words --          QUESTION:  Unless it's specifically mentioned inthe compact.          MR. ROBBINS:  Unless it's described in thecompact, that's correct.          QUESTION:  You say until damages are liquidated.Until there's a judgment, then.          MR. ROBBINS:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  There would be no prejudgment          MR. ROBBINS:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  I just want to get clear on the point37         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO11121314151617181920212223    interest.24251    that you and I discussed a minute ago on your exception to2    the Master's finding that you should have known in '69.3    Which one of the four Colorado exceptions raises that in4    your judgment?  Three seems to be the closest to it.5              MR. ROBBINS:  Well, I --6              QUESTION:  Your number 3.7              MR.

ROBBINS:  We're not here to argue to youthat you do not have discretion in these interstateoriginal proceeding actions.  You do.  You have discretion 1    to formulate what you believe to be is the appropriate 2    remedy.  I think you made that very clear in Texas v. New 3    Mexico in response to the Texas claim that you were barred 4    from awarding post judgment interest unless there was a 5    statute or other authority to grant it, so I -- we don't 6    dispute that, no, Your Honor. 7              QUESTION:  You want us to say that we should 8    apply the common law rule? 9              MR. ROBBINS:  That's correct.10              QUESTION:  Why is -- should that be different11    from what we held in the Milwaukee case for admiralty?12              MR. ROBBINS:  Well, the circumstances are very13    different.  In the Milwaukee case the factual circumstance14    is different.  There was knowledge on behalf of Milwaukee.15    Their good faith that they didn't know something was --16              QUESTION:  Well, but why should admiralty as a17    general classification be treated differently than the18    common law?  Of course, the cases will always differ.19              MR. ROBBINS:  Well --20              QUESTION:  Have varying facts.21              MR.

ROBBINS:  They didn't tie the ship up right,and the argument was whether the wharfinger had failed toprovide an adequate berth, or whether the owner of theship had allowed it to --          QUESTION:  Well, but if you say the facts ofMilwaukee are different than this, I -- that doesn'tanswer why admiralty and common law should go on twodifferent paths.          MR.

ROBBINS:  For over --          QUESTION:  Is it sophistication of the partiesor something?          MR. ROBBINS:  For over 150 years, prejudgmentinterest has been a part of admiralty judgments.          QUESTION:  Well, but we now have Milwaukee, thatconfirms that.          MR.

ROBBINS:  You're asking me a very hardphilosophical question.  I can only respond, Justice                            41         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7    damages. 8              QUESTION:  What about the provision of the 9    Restatement, which came out, I guess, in 1932?  I mean,10    that is supposed to be a summary of common law, is it not?11              MR. ROBBINS:  There were certainly -- there have12    certainly been cases that have described the fact that13    there was no rational basis in a commercial transaction14    between awarding prejudgment interest on liquidated15    damages, but not doing so on unliquidated damages if the16    intention of the litigation was to restore the plaintiff17    fully to the position it would have been in.18              QUESTION:  I mean --19              MR. ROBBINS:  In this circumstance, however,20    that doesn't really work very well, because, as was21    described by counsel for Kansas, the damages which Kansas22    seeks run to individuals, and Kansas seeks the money from23    the general Treasury of the State of Colorado.24              Our view is that that, in and of itself, works a25    problem because, as we understand it, the Eleventh42               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOKennedy, that historically --          QUESTION:  We have a hard philosophical questionbefore us in distinguishing Milwaukee.  That's the point.          MR. ROBBINS:  I can say that in my judgment thestates did not contemplate that prejudgment interest wasto be considered.  In fact, they didn't even discuss 1    Amendment was intended to protect State Treasuries from 2    enormous damage -- 3              QUESTION:  Oh, I don't know about the Eleventh 4    Amendment.  I mean, the -- but the -- my thought was, and 5    this might be totally wrong, that it isn't that the -- you 6    know, the fact that something was done in the Middle Ages 7    is not, whoever Holmes said, a reason for following it, so 8    let's start with the Restatement rule.  Why shouldn't that 9    be the rule? I think it should be the rule in normal civil10 cases.11              If there's something different about this one,12    it must stem from the fact that in a very old case what13    we're talking about are two groups of taxpayers, neither14    of whom was around at the time, shifting money between15    each other and stirring up a lot of trouble between their16 States.17              Now, is there a basis for distinguishing that18    and if so, what, and why?19              MR. ROBBINS:  In my view, the distinction is20    that the agreement that was reached between the two States21    was, 1) that contemplated the States would work together22    to ensure that additional usable flows did not --23    depletions to usable flow did not occur, and that there24    was no contemplation that there would be exchanges of25    money between the two States as a result of the compact.43               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              There's nothing to suggest that either State 2    contemplated or discussed the fact that there would be a 3    monetary consequence.  Colorado acknowledges this Court's 4    decision in Texas v. New Mexico that damages can be, under 5    certain circumstances, awarded in order to -- 6              QUESTION:  Are you going to discuss that, the 7    proper measure of damages? 8              MR. ROBBINS:  I would -- 9              QUESTION:  Your time's flying away here, and you10    haven't said a word about it.  What do you think the11    proper measure of damages should be?12              MR. ROBBINS:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.  I do13    not believe that Texas v. New Mexico addressed the14    standard of damages.  You merely made the statement in15    that case, this Court, that damages would be appropriate,16    and would be appropriate in certain circumstances in17    interstate litigation.18              The proper measure of damages in our view are19    those damages which represent damages to the sovereign and20    quasi sovereign damages which would be damages to the21    general economy.  We do not agree, and strongly disagree,22    that summing the individual damages -- and I want to make23    a point here.  We disagree with the United States.  What24    the Master did was not use damages to farmers as a measure25    of the value of water.   You will see in his report that44               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    he specifically found that he was relying upon the 2    specific damages to those farmers. 3              QUESTION:  But you say the general economy.  You 4    just have all sorts of causation problems there, if you 5    try to prove damage to the general economy, don't you? 6              MR. ROBBINS:  The reason that Colorado engaged 7    in the evidentiary proceeding to determine what the 8    damages were to farmers and to the farm community was to 9    permit the assessment of general damages, and the Master10    made a finding about general damage to the Kansas economy11    which is called secondary damages, and it was, in fact --12    that number was derived and is contained in his report.13    We do not disagree that damages to the general economy are14    part of the sovereign and quasi sovereign damages that the15    State of Kansas suffered.16              In addition, he identified and found the amount17    of lost tax revenues that the State suffered, which in our18    view is also an appropriate damage.19              QUESTION:  Why aren't the farmers' losses part20    of the loss to the general economy?  I gather what you're21    considering loss to the general economy is the farmers had22    less money, and therefore didn't buy as many luxury goods23    at the grocery stores.  I don't know why you should take24    into account the latter, the secondary effect of this25    taking of water, and not take into account the former, the                                  45               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    more immediate effect of it. 2              MR. ROBBINS:  The problem that we have is this. 3    In North Dakota v. Minnesota, you set out a fairly bright 4    line between what a State could, in fact, recover in the 5    way of damages and what it could not. 6              In this case, as the record, as the briefs made 7    clear, if you calculate the specific amount of damage that 8    each individual suffered, and if you award prejudgment 9    interest on the rate at that, that that individual would10    have enjoyed or paid if he had had the money, or obtained11    if he'd had the money, and you add all that up, and simply12    say, that is the amount of money that the State of Kansas13    is entitled to, and then, reading Texas v. New Mexico, you14    say a State can decide in the public interest, which is15    the term used in Texas v. New Mexico, they can return that16    money to the individuals, you have simply permitted, in17    the context of trying to determine damages, a back door to18    avoid North Dakota v. Minnesota.19              QUESTION:  But you leave one thing out in your20    argument, at least I think you do, and that is in this21    case the compacts -- the compact was entered into22    specifically for the purpose of protecting the individual23    water users as well as for protecting whatever the24    sovereign interest of the State as such was, so that25    the -- I think the reading that you're trying to give it46               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO123456 to -- 7ignores the object of the compact in, frankly inprotecting the farmers.          MR. ROBBINS:  Justice Souter, I have a differenttake on Article 7(a) of the compact.                QUESTION:  That's -- and that's what I want10    Ditch.  All compacts tie the interest of the State and the11    interest of the water users together.  There was no more12    an argument within this country whether or not water users13    could say, my interest is independent of the State's14    interest, because that was the whole issue in the15    Hinderlider case.16              What -- 10 years later, when this compact was17    entered into, the history was that the States had been18    before you several times.  The last time it involved water19    users in Kansas suing water users in Colorado, Colorado20    petitioning for this Court's protection to stop the21    inter -- the fight between the individual ditch companies22    and individuals in the two States.23              I believe Article 7(a) was placed in the compact24    for the purpose of making certain that all of the people25    in the Arkansas basin who were going to be bound by it47               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO               MR. ROBBINS:  And the reason I do is this.  All8    compacts, after your decision in Hinderlider, the Court's9    decision in Hinderlider v. La Plata and Cherry Creek 1    understood on the face of the compact that they would be 2    bound thereby, if for no other reason -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, but if they are bound by it, I 4    don't see why, by a parity of reasoning, their interest 5    may not be considered in valuing the violation.  In other 6    words, if they're bound by it I suppose either they get a 7    benefit or the State may legitimately measure a benefit by 8    reference to their interests. 9              You want to have it one -- you don't want to10    have it -- you want to have the benefits but not the11 burden.12              MR. ROBBINS:  We understand that we have the13    burden.  We understand, the State of Colorado understands14    that it has to deliver water to the State of Kansas, and15    has endeavored to do so.16              What we do not want to do is see damages paid to17    the State of Kansas that represent individual damages18    impermissible under the Eleventh Amendment from being19    brought against the State, summed up, and paid to the20    State of Kansas.21              In my view, the way in which this case has22    unfolded, there is a significant risk, if one assumes that23    allowing a State to distribute any damages it receives in24    the public interest, that a State can simply, by clever25    pleading, fail to announce that it is seeking the damages48               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    of the individuals.  That was not --2              QUESTION:  Mr. Robbins, I was thinking when you3    were making the argument in your brief, of what you would4    say the Eleventh Amendment means in the kind of claim you5    say that the Secretary of Labor would bring against a6    State for violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act where7    the recovery would go directly into the pocket of the8    affected worker.  Are those suits impermissible under the9    Eleventh Amendment?10              MR. ROBBINS:  That is pursuant to Federal11    statute, and that's a topic that I know this Court has had12    a significant amount of debate about.13              QUESTION:  Well, why isn't the compact on the14    same level as a Federal statute?  Congress had to approve15    it.1617181920212223242549               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR.

ROBBINS:  That's correct, and it has beendescribed as a Federal statute, but it is a --          QUESTION:  Well, of course, the United States 1    can, but what you're saying here is, it's not the State. 2    You're not questioning that one State can sue another 3    without an Eleventh Amendment barrier, but you say what 4    makes it no good is that it's for the benefit of the 5    farmers, so similarly, in the Fair Labor Standards Act, 6    the United States is suing, but if you apply your 7    reasoning, the workers are the same as the farmers. 8              MR. ROBBINS:  Justice Ginsburg, I am arguing 9    North Dakota v. Minnesota to you, which -- in which case a10    lawsuit was filed by the State of North Dakota against11    Minnesota.  They claimed -- they asked for three things.12    They asked specifically for an injunction, which the Court13    found was appropriate.14              They asked for proprietary damages, or damages15    to the State itself, which the Court found was16    appropriate, and they asked specifically for specific17    damages to individual farmers who were injured by the18    actions of Minnesota, and the Court found that was19    inappropriate, because North Dakota was trying to stand in20    the shoes --21              QUESTION:  Yes but in this case there is not a22    claim comparable to your third example.  In this case --23              MR. ROBBINS:  That is absolutely correct, and24    that's why I say it becomes a matter of pleading.
