Woodall.      Ms. Lenz.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN R. LENZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. LENZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This Court has repeatedly held that a Stateprisoner cannot obtain habeas relief under AEDPA, unlessState court contravenes or unreasonably applies clearlyestablished Federal law.      In this case, there was no clearlyestablished Federal law.  Under any interpretation ofCarter, Estelle, and Mitchell, this Court has neverextended Carter to the selection phase of a capitalsentencing trial.  Because there is no clearlyestablished Federal law, the Kentucky Supreme Court waswell within its authority to resolve this unresolvedquestion in favor of affirming the sentence.JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Lenz, could I ask you about what you just said? You said Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell; those are the three. So Carter says the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 a no­adverse­inference jury instruction when requested2 by a defendant. And that was, of course, not a3 sentencing case.4 Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to5 distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of6 Respondent's capital murder trial, so far as the7 protection of the Fifth Amendment, so a kind of general8 view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the9 two.10 And then Mitchell holds ­­ it basically11 repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the12 privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of13 any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial14 phase.15 So when you put those together, Carter with16 Estelle, Mitchell, how ­­ why do you think that there's17 a gap?18 MS. LENZ: Well, there's ­­ there is a gap19 between Mitchell and Carter. First of all, Mitchell was20 not a jury instruction case. In Mitchell, while the21 defendant did plead guilty, she did not plead guilty to22 all of the conduct, so there were still factors that23 were being contested.24 In this case, Mr. Woodall pled guilty to all25 of the crimes and aggravating circumstances. Mitchell4Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and Estelle were both concerned with protecting thedefendant from the prosecution shifting its burden ofproof to the defendant.      In this case, there was no ­­ there was noburden shifting because Robert Keith Woodall had alreadypleaded guilty to the facts, which the prosecutor wasrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, to renderMr. Woodall eligible for the death penalty.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think it would have been okay for the trial court to instruct the jury that they could use the defendant's silence against him? Would the affirmative statement have been constitutional and not a violation of the Fifth Amendment?MS. LENZ: I do not think it would have been proper. Under Kentucky law, the attorney could not refer to ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Kentucky law.  Do you thinkthe judge to have said, useMS. LENZ: No.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: him because he's just a bad MS. LENZ: I ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:      JUSTICE SCALIA:5    No, I didn't ask aboutthe Fifth Amendment permitssilence?    Use silence to punishperson.I don't think so.    I mean, that doesn't ­­ Under Federal law, youOfficial￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 don't think the judge could say, ladies and gentlemen of2 the jury, this defendant has already pleaded guilty to a3 horrible crime. This is a punishment hearing. He has4 chosen not to ­­ not to testify in this ­­ in this5 hearing.6 You ­­ you are ­­ if you wish, you may take7 his failure to testify as an indication that he does not8 have remorse, that he is not sorry. He could have come9 before you said and, said I am terribly sorry, I wish I10 had never done it, I will never do it again. He has11 chosen not to testify. You may, if you wish, take that12 into account in determining whether ­­ whether there is13 remorse. You can't say that.14 MS. LENZ: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.15 JUSTICE SCALIA:16 should have been otherwise.17 MS. LENZ: Well,18 Justice Sotomayor's question19 because she wasn't referring20 or to some type of evidence,21 the ­­ the question about whether silence bears on the22 determination of a lack of remorse.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.24 MS. LENZ: And Mitchell specifically left25 that open. In fact, Mitchell ­­6Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, then, your answerI guess I interpreteda little bit differentto facts in evidence or ­­but your question asksOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 factual dispute as to how much the witness ­­ the victim3 had suffered. How about a statement about that?4 MS. LENZ: Well, I don't think there was5 actually a dispute about how much the victim suffered.6 There, I think, you’re referring to the testimony of7 the blood spatter expert where ­­ wherein he was talking8 about how the blood was splattered around,and it indicated9 that there had been quite a struggle when the victim's10 throat was slashed.11 And trial counsel ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But take the ­­ take the13 hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose ­­ you know, the14 prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our15 expert that ­­ the blood spattering expert, that the16 victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look,17 the defendant didn't take the stand. Why didn't he take18 the stand to deny that? All right?19 So could the prosecutor have said that at20 the sentencing hearing?21 MS. LENZ: Yes, Justice Kagan. The22 prosecutor could have said that because that is a23 selection factor. That ­­ the fact of whether the24 victim struggled is not a fact that makes the defendant25 eligible for the death penalty, so because the ­­ the7Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, there was aOfficial￼1 prosecutor had no burden of2 wasn't in ­­ in jeopardy of3 him.4 JUSTICE KAGAN:5 what we haven't decided, if6 remorse question of ­­ that7 in ­­ not Mitchell, but ­­ is it Mitchell?8 MS. LENZ: Mitchell, yes.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: It goes beyond the remorse10 question. And you're saying that really, in the11 sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to12 do with ­­ with anything that happens there essentially,13 because once ­­ once the person has been found eligible14 for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can ­­15 can draw whatever inferences they want.16 MS. LENZ: I think that the core purpose of17 the Fifth Amendment has ­­ has been protected. Yes, I18 do.19 JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do about ­­ I20 mean, I think the relevant pages are ­­ it's at 526 U.S.21 328 to 330, probably read those 17 times. All right.22 When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirm Estelle.23 As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies24 with full force. Estelle says, "The court could discern25 no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty8Alderson Reporting Companyproof on that, the defendanthaving the burden shifted toSo you're suggesting thatyou will, goes beyond thewe ­­ that we talked aboutOfficial￼1 phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the2 protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is3 concerned."4 I marked five separate statements in those5 two pages that came to the same thing. I looked at6 Estelle. Estelle has to do with the right to note ­­7 note the comment that he wanted in respect to a8 sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide;9 namely, future dangerousness. Nothing to do with a fact10 about the crime, a sentencing fact.11 So then I said, well, what favors you here?12 What favors you is the last sentence of the first13 paragraph on 330, which says, "Whether silence bears14 upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon15 acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the16 downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing17 Guidelines is a separate question. It is not before us18 and we express no view on it."19 Right. It's, one, not just a sentencing20 fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of21 remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three,22 it is a decision for a judge, not the jury. If it isn't23 confined, as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules24 Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing. Here, we have25 sentencing facts, facts about his childhood.9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 He wanted the Estelle instruction. The2 judge wouldn't give it. That's the argument against3 you, I think. And I would like to hear your specific4 response.5 MS. LENZ: Well, in Estelle, that sentencing6 Factor is future dangerousness, and the prosecution had to7 prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to make8 Mr. Smith eligible for the death penalty. That's a very9 different fact than a factor of what you're speaking10 about, which would be a selection factor and the11 prosecution has ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought the13 facts ­­ what was at issue here, he has put on witnesses14 that show that he had a bad childhood, and he didn't15 himself testify about his bad childhood. And in that16 context, he asked for the no silence/silence17 instruction. The government did not object. The judge18 then refused to give the instruction.19 All right. Now, what's the difference20 between the facts about how his parents raised him and21 the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle?22 MS. LENZ: The difference is the burden of23 proof. How his parents raised him is a mitigating24 circumstance. Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof on25 mitigating circumstances. The jury was instructed they10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 had to consider the mitigating circumstances. So2 whether Mr. Woodall testified or not, we assume that the3 jury followed the instructions and considered the4 mitigating circumstances.5 JUSTICE ALITO: Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the6 instruction that was requested but not given was as7 follows, quote, "A defendant is not compelled to testify8 and the fact that the defendant did not testify should9 not prejudice him in any way." That was the10 instruction?11 MS. LENZ: Yes, sir.12 JUSTICE ALITO: So suppose that the ­­ you13 put on evidence of ­­ to show that he was qualified for14 the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating15 factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation16 evidence. The instruction would say, would it not, that17 the fact that the defendant did not testify should not18 prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to19 put on any mitigation evidence at all; is that correct?20 MS. LENZ: That's exactly right, Your Honor.21 That's exactly right. So, in essence, it really shifts22 the burden of proof ­­ Mr. Woodall's burden of proof23 back to the prosecution.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: In this case, of course,25 the question is even narrower. That instruction would11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 forbid the jury from even taking into account his2 failure to testify on ­­ on the one factor of remorse ­­3 the one psychological factor of remorse.4 And if you say that you're not entitled to5 such an instruction on that, that alone would have ­­6 would have been enough to deny the requested7 instruction.8 MS. LENZ: That's exactly right. That's9 exactly right. And I think the judge indicates ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you call him, to11 ask him if he feels sorry?12 If he has no Fifth Amendment right, could13 you call him to the stand and ask him, are you sorry?14 MS. LENZ: No, Justice Sotomayor, because15 there are two rulings in Mitchell, and the first ruling16 in Mitchell says that ­­ said that Mitchell still had17 the Fifth Amendment right in the sentencing proceeding18 after the guilty plea. That's the first ruling in19 Mitchell.20 But the second ruling in Mitchell then21 limits that. It doesn't say there are no adverses ­­ no22 adverse inferences whatsoever that cannot be inferred. It23 says no adverse inferences can be inferred on facts and24 circumstances that the prosecutor is required to prove25 which increase the penalty range.12Alderson Reporting Companyacceptablesentencingthe burdentestimony,inference?and workable rule to say that, in ahearing, on any point where the defendant hasof proof the government is entitled tothat silence can be the basis for an adverseOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425So there's a difference. So ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your position, basically, that this is in the nature of a ­­ an affirmative defense and that defendant carries the burden on remorse ­­ and what was the other one that Mitchell saved out? Acceptance of responsibility?MS. LENZ: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if defendant says nothing, then he hasn't ­­ he hasn't proved a mitigator. MS. LENZ: That's right, and ­­ and he bearsthe burden of proof on that, and he bears theconsequences from failing to meet his burden on that.The prosecution has absolutely no burden with regard tomitigating circumstances.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So would it have been anMS. LENZ: Could you repeat the question?JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be an acceptable, workable rule to say that in a sentencing hearing, on any issue where the defendant has the burden of proof the prosecution is entitled to an instruction that13Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425silence can be the basis for an inference against thedefendant on those issues?(Pause.)JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you have to either say yes or no. If ­­ if you say no, then I ask why remorse is different? If you say yes, then remorse is included within that.MS. LENZ: Well, I think no, and remorse is different because, again, that's a mitigatingOfficial￼circumstance upon which WoodallJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What did youjust say?JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand whyyou're not entitled to the instruction on all issues asto which the defendant has the burden of proof ­­MS. LENZ:      JUSTICE KENNEDY:hearing.      MS. LENZ:purpose of the no­adverse­inference instruction is toprotect the defendant from the prosecution shifting itsburden of proof, in other words, using his silence toprove one of the elements that the prosecution isrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.JUSTICE KENNEDY:The ­­ the assumption inhas the burden of proof.Well, it makes sense ­­       ­­ in a sentencingIt makes sense to not ­­ the14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 my question is that the defendant has the burden of2 proof on a certain number of issues in the sentencing3 hearing. As to all of those issues, it seems to me it4 has to be your position that the government is entitled5 to the instruction that I described.6 Or you're just going to stand up and say,7 well, remorse is different, but I ­­ we need to know8 what ­­ what your argument is.9 MS. LENZ: You need to know why remorse is10 different, is that what you're asking?11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's one way of12 asking it, yes.13 MS. LENZ: Yes. Well, I think it would be14 the same answer. It's just that remorse is a mitigating15 circumstance, and the prosecution has no burden of proof16 on mitigating circumstances. That's the defendant's17 choice as to whether he wants to place evidence in the18 record regarding any mitigating circumstances19 whatsoever.20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, when a party has the21 burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the22 customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury23 that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence24 to show this, rather than to ­­ to talk about inferences25 that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's15Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425failure to produce evidence.MS. LENZ: Well, in this case, the jury wasnot instructed that Mr. Woodall had the burden of proofon the mitigating circumstances.  They were instructedto consider the mitigating circumstances.JUSTICE SCALIA: They also weren't instructed to draw any inferences, were they?MS. LENZ: No, they were not.JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the ­­ the issue here is whether you must instruct them not to draw inferences, not ­­ not whether ­­ whether ­­ anyway.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the jury was instructed, "You shall consider such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances as have been presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be true."      Now, I suppose they could have been ­­ themitigating evidence could have been put in by theprosecution, but for the most part, they're going to beput in by the defense.  So when the judge says you canconsider whatever mitigating evidence has been presentedto you, isn't that tantamount to saying that thedefendant has the burden of producing evidence ofmitigation, if the defendant wants to do that?MS. LENZ: I don't think it speaks to who16Official￼Alderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE GINSBURG:or would you distinguish them?Are all those the same,Official￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425has the burden.  It just speaks to the fact that they'rerequired to consider ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought we ­­ it wasn't controversial that, on mitigating factors, the defendant does have the burden.MS. LENZ: He does. He does. That's correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So is ­­ is there a difference between the prosecutor saying, judge, I want you to charge this jury that they can use defendant's silence against him, or a judge, on his own, telling the jury that, or the judge, as here, simply refusing to say you can't take it into account?MS. LENZ: Well, I do think ­­      MS. LENZ: I do, I think there ­­ there is adifference between the prosecution and the court nottelling the jury that, that they can take thedefendant's silence into consideration, I do.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, where does that difference come from? Because I thought that, every time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an adverse inference, we've also required a requested jury instruction. I don't know of a ­­ of a case or any17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 principle that would suggest that we can tear those two2 things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference3 is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction.4 MS. LENZ: Well, the ­­ the only situation5 that I'm aware of that the Court has ­­ that it has6 extended Griffin with this Carter instruction is in the7 guilt phase, where the prosecution is still required8 to prove guilt.9 JUSTICE KAGAN:10 different question. Do you11 that those two things don't12 my ­­ my sort of reading of13 do. Any time we've said an14 prohibited, we've also said15 is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences16 if he requests it.17 MS. LENZ: Well, you said that, in every18 case, but one, I suppose, except for Mitchell, and19 that's the most important case here. The Court in20 Mitchell said that the jury couldn't infer anything21 negative from the facts and circumstances of the crime22 upon which the prosecutor ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see that in24 Mitchell. But let ­­ let me go back, just elaborating25 on that, to Justice Alito's first question. I want to18Alderson Reporting CompanyI guess I'm asking ahave any case that suggestsgo hand and hand?  Becauseour case law is that theyadverse inference isthe defendant is titled ­­Official￼1 see if this issue is still in the case. You looked at2 the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad3 instruction. It says no adverse inference may be drawn4 from anything. All right.5 So there seemed to be some objection you had6 to the breadth of that instruction, so I looked at the7 instruction. The instruction does say exactly what8 Justice Alito said and you have said. It says the ­­9 the instruction is ­­ "The defendant is not compelled to10 testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as11 inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any12 way," with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications.13 All right?14 The instruction I just read you is not from15 this case. It's from the Carter case. In the Carter16 case, the court said that instruction must be given. It17 must be given at the sentencing phase. So what they did18 was copy the instruction out of the case, the very19 instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth20 Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase.21 And that was a noncapital case.22 So what's the objection to the instruction,23 on its breadth? Not only is it the same, but the24 government never objected that it was too broad, and the25 only issues in the case were factual. They were about19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 what happened to him in his childhood, namely,2 sentencing facts.3 And the instruction that you did read about4 what they should consider referred to facts and5 circumstances. And where, in Estelle, does it say that6 matters at sentencing related to facts and7 circumstances, you don't have to give the very8 instruction that Carter and Estelle required?9 MS. LENZ: All right. I have several things10 to say. First of all, I disagree with two things,11 respectfully, that you said about Carter. The12 instruction in Carter was different. The instruction in13 Carter was about guilt, and actually ­­ and Mr. Woodall14 concedes ­­ they left that part out of this instruction.15 This instruction says no negative inferences about16 anything whatsoever. That's not what Carter said.17 JUSTICE BREYER: I see.18 MS. LENZ: Carter is talking about guilt,19 and it's limited. And also, the Carter instruction had20 to do with the guilt phase, rather than the sentencing21 phase. And Estelle was not a jury instruction case and22 didn't say anything about Carter whatsoever. So Estelle23 didn't extend Carter at all.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But Mitchell did,25 though, the sentencing aspect.20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. LENZ: I'm sorry?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mitchell was about sentencing.MS. LENZ: Yes, Mitchell was about sentencing. And Mitchell is the case which answersthe ­­ the last part of your question, Justice Breyer. You said where does it say facts and circumstances of the crime? That language is in Mitchell.      Mitchell clearly says that no adverseinferences may be made on facts and circumstances of thecrime upon which the prosecution has the burden of proofand ­­ and upon which will increase ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:overrule Estelle?MS. LENZ:      JUSTICE BREYER:Estelle talks about ­­ you apply the same rule to factsand circumstances of the sentence, in a capital caseanyway.MS. LENZ: Well, I don't think Mitchell says that. It's not that broad.JUSTICE BREYER: No, Mitchell doesn't.MS. LENZ: Or excuse me. Estelle doesn't say that. Estelle's not that broad. It doesn't speak about a jury instruction, and even Mitchell doesn't21Does it overrule ­­ does itDoes Mitchell overrule Estelle?      Yes.  Does Mitchell ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 say ­­ it ­­ it says something very broad, the Fifth2 Amendment applies during the penalty phase, but it3 doesn't make a distinction between the eligibility part4 of the penalty phase and the selection part of the5 penalty phase.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But in not making that7 distinction, I mean, it does speak very broadly, and it8 says ­­ you know, I'm reading another quotation from it.9 "The rule against negative inferences at a criminal10 trial apply with equal force at sentencing."11 Now, it does have this exception for remorse12 or a possible exception for remorse. But with that13 exception, otherwise, it says the rule against adverse14 inferences applies, doesn't it?15 MS. LENZ: Well, the rule against adverse16 inferences from Carter is all about incrimination and17 guilt. And in this case, Mr. Woodall's pled guilty to18 all of the crimes and aggravating circumstances. So his19 eligibility for the death penalty was already met before20 the penalty phase even began.21 And I'm sorry. What was your question?22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think my question was just23 the breadth of these statements about everything that24 applies at trial with respect to adverse inferences also25 applies at the sentencing phase, with the possible22Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425exception of adverse inferences about remorse.  That'sthe way I read the cases.MS. LENZ: Well, I'm not sure I agree with your reading of the cases, but even if ­­ even if that is the correct reading of the case and that adverse inferences apply to everything, but factors such as lack of remorse or downward adjustment in the sentencing guidelines, that leaves a huge hole in Mitchell.      You could drive a truck through that holebecause, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent inMitchell, the bulk of what sentencing is about are theseother factors, the other factors, what kind of childhoodhe had, mitigation and all of that sort of thing.  Sothere's still a lot of room.      If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainderof my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Komp.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE E. KOMP,       APPOINTED BY THIS COURT,       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. KOMP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      In Estelle, this Court held that there areno ­­ there's no basis to distinguish between guilt and23Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 penalty phases in a capital trial. Mitchell did not2 disturb that ruling ­­ did not overrule that ruling.3 As ­­ as this Court indicated, the key components of the4 Mitchell opinion that have been discussed today are from5 pages 328 to 330. And on ­­ those pages are littered6 with the discussion of what the clear principles of this7 Court's authority are.8 For instance, on page 329, "Our holding9 today is a product of existing precedent, not only10 Griffin, but also by Estelle v. Smith, in which the11 Court could discern no basis to distinguish between the12 guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder13 trial, so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment14 privilege is concerned."15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the courts in those16 cases had a specific issue before it. Its attention17 wasn't called to what I suggested is in the nature of an18 affirmative defense. The defendant has the burden to19 persuade the jury on mitigators.20 MR. KOMP: Your Honor, if I may, and just21 to ­­ to ­­ under Kentucky law, there is ­­ I think22 Justice Alito sort of spoke to this ­­ or I forget which23 Justice. There's a difference between a burden of24 production and a burden of proof. And absolutely, a ­­25 a defendant in ­­ in a sentencing hearing has the burden24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of production, as a proponent of what is going to be2 their mitigation theory.3 That's much different than a burden of4 proof. In this case, Instruction 6, which is found at5 Joint Appendix Page 44, the burden of proof was on the6 government to establish that the aggravating7 circumstances, both the statutory aggravating8 circumstances and the nonstatutory aggravating9 circumstances, had to outweigh the mitigating evidence.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me ­­ let me give you11 this example. Let me pretend to be a juror in a ­­ in a12 Kentucky capital case. And the ­­ and let's assume in13 this case the prosecution puts on evidence to show14 eligibility and some evidence of aggravating factors.15 The defense puts on no evidence of mitigation.16 Now, the judge tells me you shall consider17 such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances18 as have been presented to you in the evidence, and you19 believe to be true. Okay? That's Instruction Number 4.20 I assume that you don't have an objection to that.21 And then the judge gives the instruction22 that you requested, a defendant is not compelled to23 testify, and the fact that the defendant did not testify24 should not prejudice him in any way.25 So, now, I'm back in the jury room, and I25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 say, well, now I have to consider mitigating evidence.2 And ­­ you know, there are a lot of things that could be3 mitigating in a capital case. I'd like to know about4 the defendant's childhood. I'd like to know whether the5 defendant was ­­ was abused. I'd like to know whether6 the defendant was remorseful.7 And I haven't heard anything about this.8 And I don't know what to do because the judge told me I9 should consider the mitigating evidence that's been10 presented to me. On the other hand, the judge told me11 that the failure ­­ the fact that the defendant didn't12 put on any mitigating evidence can't prejudice him in13 any way. So what am I supposed to do?14 MR. KOMP: Well, in that case, again, if ­­15 if there's no mitigating evidence presented, you don't16 know if it's what Instruction 4 will look ­­ look like.17 But taking your hypothetical, and you're in that jury18 room, if you're given the Carter instruction ­­ again,19 it wasn't given in this case. So if you're given that20 Carter instruction, all that prohibits is ­­ is raising21 a negative inference against the defendant for the22 failure to exercise his right to testify.23 JUSTICE ALITO: No, it doesn't really. It24 says the fact that he didn't testify, and he could have25 testified about child ­­ about his childhood or about26Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425remorse or any of these other things, that shouldn'tprejudice him in any way.MR. KOMP: And that's right ­­ that's the ­­ that's straight out of the Carter ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just tell me what I'm supposed to do as a juror. The judge says consider the evidence that's put before you, but the fact that the defendant didn't put this evidence before you in the form of his testimony shouldn't prejudice him in any way. I'm ­­ I'm pulled in two different directions. I don't know what to do.MR. KOMP: Well ­­ but he can't ­­ again, I think, in your hypothetical, that he's presented nothing. And so he can't be penalized, again, for presenting nothing. And you can't allow ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Nothing ­­ zero equals zero.MR. KOMP: Correct. And so ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the zero just can't be added onto or taken away from. Zero is zero, not a positive, not a negative.MR. KOMP: Right. And ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you can't take away from the zero, create evidence from his silence, just as you can't from his silence outweigh the aggravating27Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 circumstances; correct?2 MR. KOMP: Correct.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that still doesn't4 answer Justice Alito's dilemma. You say he can't be5 penalized for doing nothing, but the juror in Justice6 Alito's hypothetical says, what am I supposed to do when7 he didn't present anything, and I'm concerned about8 that? I don't think you've answered the question.9 MR. KOMP: In ­­ in that circumstance,10 again, he ­­ he can't ­­ they can't ­­ for instance,11 Kentucky is a nonweighing State, so that means that they12 can ­­ that nonstatutory aggravation is on the table,13 anything they want to consider.14 And what this Carter instruction would15 prohibit is ­­ is preventing his failure to testify, his16 failure to offer a lack of remorse, to say, I'm sorry,17 which are the natural inclinations of what jurors ­­18 natural inclinations, but constitutionally impermissible19 inclinations, from adding that onto the death side of20 the scale. And you’re right ­­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any other ­­22 defendant didn't say, I'm sorry. Was there ­­ was there23 anything else? Did the defendant produce anything else24 in the way of remorse?25 MR. KOMP: In this ­­ in this case, no.28Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Remorse was not a mitigation theory that was presentedby defense counsel.JUSTICE BREYER: A low IQ and a personality disorder, I take it, were the mitigating factors?MR. KOMP: Correct.JUSTICE BREYER: So in a case where there are witnesses who says there are two mitigating factors, he has a very low IQ and he has a personality disorder, he says nothing. The jurors go in the room. They have to decide does he have a low IQ and personality disorder and what weight should we give that as mitigators?This instruction says, jurors, do it. Just, when you do it, don't take account of the fact that he, himself, did not testify.MR. KOMP: Correct.JUSTICE BREYER: Is that ­­ that ­­ so that jurors are perfectly clear, I would think. What I think is difficult for you is just what your friend raised.It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt. You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut out "guilt" because this has nothing to do with guilt, right.      Estelle says, I would think, that you have aright to a Carter instruction in respect to somesentencing factors, namely future dangerousness.  The29Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 last sentence on the page of Mitchell says, we are not2 deciding whether you're entitled to that instruction in3 respect to other sentencing factors, namely,4 remorse.5 So the question for you is why does that6 thing ­­ that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why7 isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is8 entitled to that instruction here?9 And your response to that is what?10 MR. KOMP: My ­­ my response to that is ­­11 is twofold. One, as ­­ in ­­ as this Court was walking12 through in the opening presentation, Mitchell was not13 overruled ­­ or, I'm sorry, Estelle was not overruled by14 Mitchell. It relied on Estelle and the Griffin line of15 cases as the ­­ as the clearly existing authority.16 When you get to that ­­17 JUSTICE KAGAN:18 been overruled, but there's19 in, and it's a caveat about20 might be different.21 And the question is why doesn't that caveat22 suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that23 you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this24 Court has decided because the instruction that you asked25 for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that30Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, Estelle might not havea caveat that Mitchell putsremorse and that remorseOfficial￼1 were going to come before the jury at the sentencing2 phase.3 So at the very least, it seems that4 instruction sort of blows by the question that we have5 reserved.6 MR. KOMP: Two points, and one is, when this7 instruction was requested, Mitchell had not been8 decided. So the slate was Griffin, Carter, Estelle, and9 Mitchell came out prior to the Kentucky Supreme Court's10 ruling. So this instruction was based on ­­ you know,11 without the reservation that exists.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then the13 reservation certainly suggests that, at the time the14 instruction was requested, it wasn't beyond any15 fair­minded dispute, which is the standard. No one's16 talked about the standard yet. The standard is that ­­17 which you're complaining about ­­ that the error has to18 be so well understood and comprehended in existing law19 to be beyond any possibility of fair­minded20 disagreement.21 And it seems to me if, shortly after the22 instruction was requested, the court itself said, oh,23 that's different, we're not talking about that, it24 certainly suggests that it was a subject of fair­minded25 disagreement.31Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KOMP: I think you have ­­ we have to examine what Mitchell ­­ Mitchell, again, was framed as a Federal sentencing guidelines case, and that passage I read earlier from Mitchell, the next sentence is, "And although Estelle was a capital case, its reasoning applies with full force here, where the government seeks to use Petitioner's silence to infer commission of disputed acts."      And what ­­ what this Court was doing wasextending Estelle into the Federal sentencing guidelinescase, and it wasn't at the same time cutting back onEstelle the Fifth ­­ the recognition that the FifthAmendment applies at the capital sentencing.      Our read of that exception ­­ the language,is that whether silence bears upon the determination oflack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility forpurposes of the downward adjustment provided in thesentencing guidelines is a separate question.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not only that. Your position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond fair­minded disagreement.MR. KOMP: It's clear that that relates to fair ­­ to Federal sentencing guidelines cases.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.MR. KOMP: Or possibly noncapital cases,32Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 because this Court didn't simultaneously accept Estelle2 as the clearly existing law and then cut it.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you're4 saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable5 disagreement, to say that, when the court says lack of6 remorse in a sentencing guideline case, it still thinks7 there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a8 selection case such as this.9 MR. KOMP: But I think the answer is found10 within Estelle because Estelle was based on the future11 dangerousness, and the psychiatrist that ­­ or, pardon12 me, psychologist that testified in Estelle, his finding13 of future dangerousness, which is a selection question14 which has nothing to do with eligibility, his finding of15 future dangerousness was based on lack of remorse.16 Estelle isn't just a compulsion case. There’s a17 component of silence.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your19 friend told us that future dangerousness was an20 eligibility factor, rather than a mere selection21 criteria.22 MR. KOMP: Under this Court's ­­ the then23 Texas statute, as defined by this Court in Jurek, that24 special circumstances question at that time was a25 selection factor. It was not an eligibility factor.33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Eligibility had already been determined. And that's2 based on this Court's authority of Jurek. And we ­­ and3 we cited to State v. Beathard in the Red Brief, which is4 Texas's description of their ­­ of those special5 circumstances questions at the time.6 So this Court has applied this Fifth7 Amendment prohibition in a pure sentencing selection8 occasion, and Estelle deals with ­­ there's a component9 of silence to it because the psychologist that testified10 as to the future dangerousness factor relied on the11 silence of the individual, his failure specifically to12 say, I'm sorry, and express remorse about the actions13 that he did. And this Court cited that component as14 part of what the psychologist relied on in making the15 future dangerousness assessment.16 So Estelle is not totally ­­ it obviously17 has a compulsion component, and it's driven by the18 Miranda violation, but there is a component of Estelle19 which relies specifically on silence and how the silence20 was used to penalize the individual in becoming a factor21 in favor of death in the selection process.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm curious about one23 facet of this case. This instruction was sought by the24 defendant. The prosecutor had no objection to it. The25 judge said, I'm sorry, I am not going to use that34Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425instruction.      Is that common in Kentucky, that bothparties agree that an instruction should be given, andthe judge says, I'm not going to give it?MR. KOMP: I ­­ I can't speak ­­ I don't want to speak too broadly for what happens, but it's ­­ I think when both parties usually agree, the instruction is given, but I don't want to stretch it too far and say that on every occasion.      And I ­­ I think it's important because thiswas a ­­ the fact that the government didn'tobject ­­ you know, demonstrates that ­­ that theinstruction should have been given.  If he ­­ if he feltthat this instruction shouldn't have been given, orthere was no legal basis for the instruction ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't demonstrate anything of the sort. It just means that he didn't object.MR. KOMP: Well, I ­­ I think ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe he was a very bad lawyer. Who knows? We're ­­ we're going to determine our law on the basis of whether a government lawyer made an objection or not?MR. KOMP: I ­­ JUSTICE SCALIA:35At most, it shows that heOfficial￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425didn't think that there was anything wrong with it.Does that mean we have to think there was nothing wrongwith it?MR. KOMP:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. KOMP:JUSTICE ALITO:Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor.      Okay.Absolutely not.  And ­­     Well, what it may show isOfficial￼that the prosecutor didn't think that it was going tomake a difference, and so why raise an objection thatcould create everything that's happened since then, oversomething that isn't going to make a difference in acase where you have an incredibly heinous crime?      The prosecutor may have thought, this juryis going to return theif this instruction isMR.

KOMP:if you ­­ your ­­ the basis of your objection or yourfailure to object is based on what you believe is ­­ islegally required, especially when you're a prosecutor,and ­­ and you have that added burden of not seeking aconviction or not seeking the death sentence ­­JUSTICE BREYER:What I say ­­ what we saidverdict that I want anyway, evengiven.I think that ­­     You don't think that's aI ­­ I think as a ­­ as a lawyer,36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 here, what I've gathered from the record, as best we've2 been able to see it, is in that sentencing hearing ­­3 you were there?4 MR. KOMP:I was not.      But you know it pretty5 JUSTICE BREYER:6 well.7 MR. KOMP:8 JUSTICE BREYER:9 matters at issue. He had a low IQ, a personality10 disorder, the child of a troubled home, he had grown11 up in poverty, he had been sexually abused. All right.12 All of those things are basically factual matters about13 his background.14 Now, in that context, this instruction,15 which was the Carter instruction without the word16 "guilt," referring to his failure to testify is ­­17 doesn't mention those five things specifically. It18 doesn't say testify about those five things.19 But in context, was there anything else in20 that hearing that the jury could have thought failure to21 testify referred to?22 MR. KOMP: The ­­ in ­­ in ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else any24 juror might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about25 this other thing, too?

That's why I ask you.  Wasthere something else in that hearing that the jury mighthave thought, oh, he didn't testify about it?JUSTICE SCALIA: He's trying to help you, counsel.JUSTICE BREYER: He's got the point. But you have to answer, in terms of what the facts are at the hearing.MR. KOMP: In this ­­ in this ­­ pardon me.

If remorse is an25 issue at the hearing, remorse is the very thing that, in39      What about remorse?  Wasn'tRemorse wasn't put at issue by ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, whatever.  I mean,Official￼1 Mitchell, we said we have not decided. And then you2 have no clearly established law to rely on.3 And I appreciate that this was before4 Mitchell, rather than after Mitchell; but it suggests5 that there was always a question about whether Estelle6 applied to remorse.7 MR. KOMP: Estelle dealt with that in the8 capital context. Again, the ­­ the distinction that9 we're drawing from Mitchell is that ­­ that Mitchell did10 not modify Estelle. It expanded Estelle into a Federal11 sentencing or other criminal case ­­ cases. It did not12 touch ­­ it remained intact the prohibition of ­­ of13 using silence.14 Again, Estelle dealt with silence, and15 silence that was used to support a lack of remorse,16 which was used to support the ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. It left18 in ­­ Estelle left intact what?19 MR. KOMP: I'm ­­ pardon me. Mitchell left20 intact Estelle's application at the capital sentencing21 proceeding.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we read Estelle as23 saying that, on the issue of remorse, it is an open24 question whether or not the self­incrimination privilege25 is applicable. Suppose we read it that way. And40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 suppose we think that, in your case, remorse was an2 issue at the penalty phase. Does that not mean that3 this issue was not clearly decided? That's ­­ it has a4 bearing on this case?5 MS. KOMP: Could you ­­ could you please6 repeat the ­­ the first part? I ­­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we read Mitchell8 as saying that on the ­­ where remorse is at issue, it9 is not settled whether or not there is a Fifth Amendment10 self­incrimination right; and it is not settled that the11 defendant is entitled to an instruction about silence,12 number one.13 Number two, suppose we think, as I think to14 be the case, that remorse was an issue in this trial in15 the penalty phase. Does that not mean that the rule is16 unclear and you're not clearly entitled to an17 instruction on that issue?18 MR. KOMP: I ­­ I disagree because these ­­19 these capital sentencing proceedings are not just about20 remorse or lack of remorse. And what ­­ what would21 happen in that circumstance is ­­ is, right now, you22 have a bright line. And if ­­ if we accept remorse out23 of this in the capital sentencing context, there's two24 problems with that.25 One, we would have hybrid Carter41Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425instructions, and there would be ­­ we'd have to figureout, all right, which instruction would fit if welooked ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we could ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your ­­ your answer is what the law should be. My question is whether or not at least the law is not open on that point, unsettled.MR. KOMP: I believe that Estelle settled this, and Mitchell did not cut back on Estelle in the capital sentencing context and that Estelle imported the no­adverse instruction that's required by Carter.JUSTICE SCALIA: It is, but you have to go beyond saying I believe that. What you have to say to prevail here is, not only do I believe it, but no reasonable juror ­­ no reasonable jurist could possibly believe otherwise. Now, do you want to say that?MR. KOMP: I ­­ pardon me. If you ­­ if we look at Mitchell, and we look at the discussion of the no­adverse­inference instruction ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: No reasonable jurors could say otherwise?MR. KOMP: One, I don't think this Court in Williams said that ­­ that ­­ or not ­­ that AEDPA is not a subjective juror/judge contest. And if you read Mitchell and it talks about this is a product of our42Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 existing precedent, this is a rule of proven utility,2 this is an essential feature of our justice system,3 the ­­ the rule was ­­ was absolutely clear that ­­ that4 these no ­­ no­adverse­inferences could be raised. And5 that was a ­­ a rule of proven utility.6 And all that Mitchell did in that one7 sentence is reserve a question that ­­ that may or may8 not be applicable in Federal sentencing or noncapital9 sentencing. It did not cut back on Estelle, which said10 for ­­ that there is no basis to distinguish between the11 guilt and penalty phases of capital cases.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so your13 argument is when Mitchell said ­­ whether it applies to14 lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the15 sentencing guidelines, that's a separate question. We16 don't have any view on it. But at the same time, the17 Court said well, of course, it applies in ­­ in the18 other ­­ other context.19 MR. KOMP: Right, this Court ­­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's perfectly21 clear. I mean, if you were arguing the other way, you22 would say, well, the question is whether it's clearly if23 there's a clear difference between lack of remorse in24 the sentencing guideline case and lack of remorse in a25 capital case, and everybody knew that, so that when43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Mitchell just said it doesn't apply to lack of remorse2 in the sentencing guidelines, nobody would think that3 meant that there was an open issue on the capital4 context.5 MR. KOMP: I ­­ no, we would think it's an6 open issue because if you ­­ if you go through the ­­7 the Mitchell opinion and how it builds on the no8 adverse ­­ no adverse inference and talks about Griffin9 and Estelle, and then the ­­ the key language is at ­­10 at 329. "Although Estelle was a capital case, its11 reasoning applies with full force here."12 So this was a pushing forward of Estelle.13 It wasn't a cutting back on Estelle.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could this be ­­15 let's assume that you're right, that there was error.16 How could it be harmful, given the ­­ that the17 mitigators ­­ that the aggravators were not in dispute,18 he had entered a guilty plea? So how was the defendant19 harmed by the failure to give this instruction?20 MR. KOMP: I think in two manners. One is21 when you're ­­ relates to using the right to silence as22 a penalty, which is the natural inclination of ­­ of the23 jurors. So they're going to hold his ­­ his failure to24 testify against him. And they'll do it twofold.25 They'll actually put it on the scale. He didn't say44Alderson Reporting Company2 so we're going to consider that3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:4 that?5 MR. KOMP: No. No.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:as not ­­Did the prosecutor argueSo how would they haveOfficial￼1 that he was sorry, he didn't personally offer remorse,7 put that on the scale?8 MR. KOMP: Well, they ­­ that's the natural,9 what this Court recognizes ­­ the natural inclinations10 of what jurors do. And this prosecutor ­­ and it's laid11 out in our Red Brief ­­ although he technically said,12 "I'm not going to argue lack of remorse, but I'm going13 to do everything, but that." So that was clearly14 where ­­ where he was pointing.15 The other ­­ what ­­ the other impact it has16 is this was a case that there was strong mitigation.17 This is somebody who's borderline mentally retarded, has18 a personality disorder, which doesn't allow him to19 function in society, but there's also a strong element20 of Skipper evidence.21 So when you're asking for a life without22 parole and you have expert testimony saying this23 individual is not going to be a danger to correction24 officers, and you have a jailer that testifies that he's25 well­mannered and well­behaved and is not a problem at45Alderson Reporting Company1 all, and you have the background that he has, this ­­2 that's a strong mitigation narrative.3 And if the defendant doesn't testify in4 support of that, that undermines that mitigation 910111213141516171819202122232425Official￼5 narrative. So the failure to testify and the failure to6 offer this instruction has ­­ has sort of two ­­ two7 harms.

They had heard all of your mitigating evidence.      And you think what ­­ what tipped thebalance ­­ or at least we think it plausibly could havetipped the balance, is ­­ is this failure to give theno­adverse inference instruction?MR. KOMP:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. KOMP:Absolutely.      Really?                       Absolutely.  And this Courtconsiders the death penalty case ­­ all death ­­ anydeath penalty case has horrible facts.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Komp, did the SixthCircuit apply the wrong harmlessness standard here?  It46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 seemed to a apply the standard that would be applicable2 on direct review, rather than on habeas review; is that3 correct?4 MR. KOMP: I believe that they cited Brecht,5 and they cited O'Neal appropriately.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because it seems to rely7 primarily on Carter. And Carter applies the Chapman8 standard, which is, of course, the direct review9 standard.10 MR. KOMP: I think the reference to Carter11 was to talk about ­­ we're talking about assessing the12 harmfulness of this error or the harmlessness of this13 error in the context of an instruction that wasn't14 given, where the instruction that's not given prevents15 negative inferences.16 So the reference to Carter was to talk about17 what ­­ what the natural inclination for the failure to18 give the instruction is. It was sort of a framework of19 what's going on. So I don't think it was used in that20 circumstance.21 Where ­­ and when they ultimately came to22 their conclusion, they relied, again, on citing,23 expressly, the O'Neal standard.24 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you think is the25 worse adverse inference they might have drawn?47Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

I think there's ­­ there's so many things that ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your ­­MR. KOMP: ­­ that a juror wants to hear ­­ naturally wants to hear. And that's what ­­ the basis that this Court held in Carter is this ­­ why this instruction is appropriate.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Lenz, you have 5 minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN R. LENZ       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. LENZ: Thank you.      I would just like to point out, at thebeginning of his responsive argument, my colleague wastalking about the selection factors in Estelle.  Andwhether they're called selection factors or whateverthey're called, the prosecutor had to prove futuredangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt in order torender the defendant in that case death eligible.      There were three things that the prosecutionhad to prove, and that was one of them.  So those48Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 selection factors, or whatever you want to call them,2 operated as aggravating circumstances for the death3 penalty, so I just wanted to make sure that the Court is4 clear on that.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend says6 Jurek reads to the contrary.7 MS. LENZ: No, Jurek does not read to the8 contrary, no. I mean, I ­­ perhaps he's saying that9 because of the reference to calling them selection10 factors. When one speaks of selection factors, one11 usually doesn't think of death­eligibility factors.12 So my only point is, regardless of13 nomenclature, they operated as aggravating14 circumstances, the prosecution has burden of proof.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the only criteria to16 determine harmlessness is the gruesome ­­ gruesome17 nature of the crime, it appears to me that, in almost18 every death­eligible case I've come across, gruesomeness19 is inherent. By your argument, there's never a case in20 which a defendant can prove a harmful sentencing error.21 MS. LENZ: That's not true, Justice22 Sotomayor, because it would depend on what the violation23 is ­­ what the error is. I think, in this case, when24 you consider the absence of this prophylactic25 instruction in comparison with the heinousness of the49Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425crimes, the guilty plea, the overwhelming evidence, hisprior convictions for sexual abuse, his post­crimeconduct, all of it, when you consider that together ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the mitigation was very close to Wiggins.MS. LENZ: The mitigation was?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was very close to the Wiggins case.MS. LENZ: I'm sorry?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The mitigation evidence offered here was very close to the Wiggins case ­­ similar mitigation.MS. LENZ: I think ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there, we held there was harmful error.MS. LENZ: I think the mitigation was ­­ was negligible in comparison to ­­ to the rest of the crimes.      And the other point that I would just liketo make is that there was not clearly established law inthis case, and the Kentucky Supremenot an error beyond any possibilitydisagreement.      Thank you.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:50Court's decision wasfor fair­mindedThank you,
