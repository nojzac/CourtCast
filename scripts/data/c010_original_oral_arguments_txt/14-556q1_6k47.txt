Hodges and the consolidated cases.Ms. Bonauto.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. BONAUTO    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1MS. BONAUTO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The intimate and committed relationships ofsame­sex couples, just like those of heterosexualcouples, provide mutual support and are the foundationof family life in our society.  If a legal commitment,responsibility and protection that is marriage is offlimits to gay people as a class, the stain ofunworthiness that follows on individuals and familiescontravenes the basic constitutional commitment to equaldignity.      Indeed, the abiding purpose of theFourteenth Amendment is to preclude relegating classesof persons to second­tier status.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the Windsor case where the court stressed the Federal government's historic deference to States when it comesAlderson Reporting Company1 to matters of domestic relations?Official2 MS. BONAUTO:3 domestic relations except4 the constitutional rights5 couldn't have been clearer about that. And here we have6 a whole class of people who are denied the equal right7 to be able to join in this very extensive government8 institution that provides protection for families.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say join10 in the institution. The argument on the other side is11 that they're seeking to redefine the institution. Every12 definition that I looked up, prior to about a dozen13 years ago, defined marriage as unity between a man and a14 woman as husband and wife. Obviously, if you succeed,15 that core definition will no longer be operable.16 MS. BONAUTO: I hope not, Your Honor,17 because of what we're really talking about here is a18 class of people who are, by State laws, excluded from19 being able to participate in this institution. And if20 Your Honor's question is about does this really draw a21 sexual orientation line ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. My question is23 you're not seeking to join the institution, you're24 seeking to change what the institution is. The25 fundamental core of the institution is the opposite­sexStates do have primacy overthat their laws must respectof persons, and WindsorAlderson Reporting Company5￼Official1 relationship and you want to introduce into it a2 same­sex relationship.3 MS. BONAUTO: Two points on that, Your4 Honor. To the extent that if you're talking about the5 fundamental right to marry as a core male­female6 institution, I think when we look at the Fourteenth7 Amendment, we know that it provides enduring guarantees8 in that what we once viewed as the role of women, or9 even the role of gay people, is something that has10 changed in our society. So in a sense, just as the11 Lawrence court called out the Bowers court for not12 appreciating the extent of the liberty at stake, in the13 same vein here, the question is whether gay people share14 that same liberty to be ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY:16 MR. BURSCH:17 relationships.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY:19 is when you think about these cases you think about20 words or cases, and ­­ and the word that keeps coming21 back to me in this case is ­­ is millennia, plus time.22 First of all, there has not been really time, so the23 Respondents say, for the Federal system to engage in24 this debate, the separate States. But on a larger25 scale, it's been ­­ it was about ­­ about the same time     The problem ­­­­ able to form familyAlderson Reporting CompanyOne ­­ one of the problems6￼Official7￼1 between Brown and Loving as between Lawrence and this2 case. It's about 10 years.3 And so there's time for the scholars and the4 commentators and ­­ and the bar and the public to ­­ to5 engage in it. But still, 10 years is ­­ I don't even6 know how to count the decimals when we talk about7 millennia. This definition has been with us for8 millennia. And it ­­ it's very difficult for the Court9 to say, oh, well, we ­­ we know better.10 MS. BONAUTO: Well, I don't think this is a11 question of the Court knowing better. When we think12 about the debate, the place of gay people in our civic13 society is something that has been contested for more14 than a century. And in this ­­ in the last century,15 immigration exclusions, the place of gay people in16 public employment and Federal service, these are all17 things that have been contested and ­­ and you can ­­18 you can say 10 years of marriage for Massachusetts, but19 it's also in the 1970s that the Baker case from20 Minnesota reached this Court, and that's over 40 years21 ago.22 And it was over 20 years ago that the Hawaii23 Supreme Court seemed to indicate that it would rule in24 favor of marriage, and the American people have been25 debating and discussing this. It has been exhaustivelyAlderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE ALITO:your brief that the primarydemean gay people?And did ­­ did you say inpurpose of that was toOfficialMS.

BONAUTO: Well, if we're talking about the States that have constitutional amendments, many of them are similar. There are a few States that have just statutes and didn't have amendments, and there's some, of course, that had none of the above.      But even if there's not a purpose to demean,Alderson Reporting Company8￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425aired, and the bottom line is that gay and lesbianfamilies live in communities as neighbors throughoutthis whole country.  And people  have seen this ­­JUSTICE ALITO: You argue in your ­­ you argue in your brief that the primary purpose of the Michigan law limiting marriage to a man and a woman was to demean gay people; is that correct?MS. BONAUTO: The Michigan ­­ the Michigan statute and amendment certainly went out of their way to say that gay people were in some sense antithetical to the good of society. They wrote that ­­Official9￼1 I think the common commonality among all of the2 statutes, whether they were enacted long ago or more3 recently, is that they encompass moral judgments and4 stereotypes about gay people. Even if you think about5 something 100 years ago, gay people were not worthy of6 the concern of the government and the ­­ and ­­ and7 moral judgments about ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do you account for9 the fact that, as far as I'm aware, until the end of the10 20th century, there never was a nation or a culture that11 recognized marriage between two people of the same sex?12 Now, can we infer from that that those nations and those13 cultures all thought that there was some rational,14 practical purpose for defining marriage in that way or15 is it your argument that they were all operating16 independently based solely on irrational stereotypes and17 prejudice?18 MS. BONAUTO: Your Honor, my position is19 that times can blind. And if you think about the20 example of sex discrimination and what it ­­ again, I21 assume it was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but22 it took over 100 years for this Court to recognize that23 a sex classification contravened the Constitution.24 But then, in short order, between Reed and25 Craig v. Boren, we went from a rational­basis approachAlderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE GINSBURG:      JUSTICE ALITO:answered my question.MS.

BONAUTO: Isocieties assumed, but I doand it takes time to see stereotypes and to see the common humanity of people who had once been ignored or excluded. And I do believe ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you wouldn't be asking for this relief if the law of marriage was what it was a millennium ago. I mean, it wasn't possible. Same­sex unions would not have opted into the pattern of marriage, which was a relationship, a dominant and a subordinate relationship. Yes, it was marriage between a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled; it was her obligation to follow him.      There was a change in the institution ofAlderson Reporting Company10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to ­­ to heightened scrutiny, acknowledging that thiskind of discrimination is invidious.  And in the samevein here, we have a foundation of Romer, of Lawrence,of Windsor ­­Official11￼1 marriage to make it egalitarian when it wasn't2 egalitarian. And same­sex unions wouldn't ­­ wouldn't3 fit into what marriage was once.4 MS. BONAUTO: That's correct. I mean, for5 centuries we had ­­ we had and ­­ and Europe had this6 coverture system where a woman's legal identity was7 absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had8 different prescribed legal roles. And again, because of9 equality and changing social circumstances, all of those10 gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of11 the married pair have been eliminated. And that, of12 course, is a system in which committed, same­sex couples13 fit quite well.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Coverture was not ­­16 coverture was not a universal aspect of marriage17 around ­­ around the world. And there again, if you18 look at the basic definition, it is between a man and a19 woman. It does not always say between a man and a woman20 in which the woman is subordinate in legal respects. So21 I'm not sure it's still again a fair analogy to your22 situation.23 MS. BONAUTO: Well, Your ­­ Your Honor, the24 thing about marriage is that it's controlled and25 regulated by the States. The States create theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 definition of civil marriage and certainly are2 accountable for those definitions and any exclusions3 which follow. And, of course, we all know there were4 exclusions in cases like Loving and Zablocki and Turner5 where in each case with prisoners, the people behind on6 their child support payments, with a mixed­race couple7 who wanted to be able to join this institution, and even8 though some of those exclusions were quite traditional,9 they could not ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was ­­ not all11 societies banned mixed­race marriages. In fact, not12 even all States in this country banned. But I don't13 know of any ­­ do you know of any society, prior to the14 Netherlands in 2001, that permitted same­sex marriage?15 MS.

BONAUTO: Yes, and we ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're ­­ you're asking us to ­­ to decide it for this society when no other society until 2001 ever had it. And how many States have ­­ have voted to have same­sex marriage or their legislature or ­­ or by referendum? I think it's 11, isn't it?MS. BONAUTO: Yes. But I would also count the State courts that interpret their Constitutions.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes, that ­­ the State courts will agree with you. But once again, that's not the people deciding it. It's ­­ it's judges deciding it.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, counselor, in ­­ in terms of this millennium, what's been the status or the view of gay people in most of those countries? Have they been subject to the kinds of discrimination that they were subject to here? Were they welcomed into the worldwide community? Was it free of discrimination?MS. BONAUTO: Well, if you're speaking of the world, not every legal system around the world hasAlderson Reporting Company13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the kind of system with its explicit constitutionalguarantees for all persons of liberty and equality, andthat immediately sets the United States off from so manyother countries.  And of course there are now, I don'tknow if it's 17 or 18 countries that actually doauthorize marriage for same­sex couples in Europe, inSouth America, New Zealand.OfficialJUSTICE ALITO: But there have been cultures that did not frown on homosexuality. That is not a universal opinion throughout history and across all cultures. Ancient Greece is an example. It was ­­ it was well accepted within certain bounds.

JUSTICE ALITO: Same­sex ­­ wroteapprovingly of same­sex relationships, did he not?MS. BONAUTO: I believe so, Your Honor. JUSTICE ALITO: So their limiting marriageto couples of the opposite sex was not based onprejudice against gay people, was it?MS. BONAUTO: I can't speak to what was happening with the ancient philosophers. What I feel like ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's ­­ you ­­ you said that, well, marriage is different because it's controlled by the government. But from a historical ­­ from anthropological standpoint, Justice Scalia was very careful to talk about societies. Justice Alito talked about cultures. If you read the ­­ about the Kalahari people or ­­ or ancient peoples, they didn't have a government like this. They made it themselves and it was man and a woman.MS. BONAUTO: There were certainly priorto ­­ there were marriages prior to the United States forming and we recognize that. But when our nation did form into this union in 1787 and then when it affirmed the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, that's when we made ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 our nation collectively made2 liberty and equality.3 JUSTICE BREYER:4 doing that, but I would like5 to the question you've been asked several times.6 MS. BONAUTO: Okay.7 JUSTICE BREYER: And to me, it takes the8 form, the opposite view has been the law everywhere for9 thousands of years among people who were not10 discriminating even against gay people, and suddenly you11 want nine people outside the ballot box to require12 States that don't want to do it to change what you've13 heard is change what marriage is to include gay people.14 Why cannot those States at least wait and see whether in15 fact doing so in the other States is or is not harmful16 to marriage?17 Now, that same question has been put in18 many, many ways in the briefs on our subject. You've19 received it in three or four different ways. I would20 like to know, so I can hear and understand it, just what21 your response is.22 MS. BONAUTO: Okay. And I apologize if I23 haven't.24 In our system, you know, with the Fourteenth25 Amendment, which again is ­­ sets forth principles thatAlderson Reporting Companya commitment to individualWell, what ­­ maybe you'reto hear the precise answer16￼Official1 we all are governed by and govern our lives, and you2 look at examples like coverture. Okay? Even if it was3 not universal, it was still something that was wide ­­4 widespread in this nation for a very, very long time,5 and that change in marriage was deeply unsettling to6 people.7 Likewise, even if race was not used as a8 basis for discriminating in every single State as a9 matter of law by criminal law and constitutional law, it10 was incredibly pervasive. And again, changing that, as11 Virginia resisted in the Loving case, resisted and said12 please, wait and see, 80 percent of the American public13 was with Virginia on that. But again, it was the14 question of the individual liberty of the person to do15 something that was considered a profound change in its16 time.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose we rule in your18 favor in this case and then after that, a group19 consisting of two men and two women apply for a marriage20 license. Would there be any ground for denying them a21 license?22 MS. BONAUTO:23 JUSTICE ALITO:24 MS.

I hope you will come back to mine. If you want to go back to the earlier one ­­MS. BONAUTO:JUSTICE ALITO:No, no.  ­­ then you can come back toOfficial19￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: What would be the ground2 under ­­ under the logic of the decision you would like3 us to hand down in this case? What would be the logic4 of denying them the same right?5 MS. BONAUTO: Number one, I assume the6 States would rush in and say that when you're talking7 about multiple people joining into a relationship, that8 that is not the same thing that we've had in marriage,9 which is on the mutual support and consent of two10 people. Setting that aside, even assuming it is within11 the fundamental right ­­12 JUSTICE ALITO: But ­­ well, I don't know13 what kind of a distinction that is because a marriage14 between two people of the same sex is not something that15 we have had before, recognizing that is a substantial16 break. Maybe it's a good one. So this is no ­­ why is17 that a greater break?18 MS. BONAUTO: The question is one of ­­19 again, assuming it's within the fundamental right, the20 question then becomes one of justification. And I21 assume that the States would come in and they would say22 that there are concerns about consent and coercion. If23 there's a divorce from the second wife, does that mean24 the fourth wife has access to the child of the second25 wife? There are issues around who is it that makes theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial20￼1 medical decisions, you know, in the time of crisis.2 I assume there'd be lots of family3 disruption issues, setting aside issues of coercion and4 consent and so on that just don't apply here, when we're5 talking about two consenting adults who want to make6 that mutual commitment for as long as they shall be. So7 that's my answer on that.8 And just if I may turn for a moment to the9 wait and see for a moment. Wait and see by itself has10 never been considered a legitimate justification, a11 freestanding justification under the Fourteenth12 Amendment. And what we're talking about here with13 waiting and seeing is we're talking about ­­ we're14 talking about the Petitioners being denied marriage.15 And we're talking about a second class status being16 tried as a matter of the Constitution ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, part of wait and18 see, I suppose, is to ascertain whether the social19 science, the new studies are accurate. But that ­­ it20 seems to me, then, that we should not consult at all the21 social science on this, because it's too new. You think22 ­­ you say we don't need to wait for changes. So it23 seems to me that if we're not going to wait, then it's24 only fair for us to say, well, we're not going to25 consult social science.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial211 MS. BONAUTO: Well, two points on that, if I2 may. In terms of waiting, I do think the effect of3 waiting is not neutral, it does consign same­sex couples4 to this outlier status, and there will be profound5 consequences that follow from that.6 But then setting that aside vis­à­vis the7 social science, there have been trials, of course in the8 Michigan case, in Arkansas, in Florida about adoption9 bans. These issues have been aired repeatedly, and10 there is, as you all have heard, a social science11 consensus that there's nothing about the sex or sexual12 orientation of the parent that is going to affect13 child outcomes. And this isn't just research about gay14 people. It's research about, you know, again, what is15 the effect of gender, it goes for 50 years.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're ­­ you're17 quite right that the consequences of waiting are not18 neutral. On the other hand, one of the things that's19 truly extraordinary about this whole issue is how20 quickly has been the acceptance of your position across21 broad elements of society. I don't know what the latest22 opinion polls show.23 The situation in Maine, I think, is ­­ is24 characteristic. In 2009, I guess it was by referendum,25 or whatever, they banned gay marriage. In 2012, they￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial22￼1 enacted it as law. I mean, that sort of quick change2 has been a characteristic of this debate, but if you3 prevail here, there will be no more debate. I mean,4 closing the debate can close minds, and ­­ and it will5 have a consequence on how this new institution is ­­ is6 accepted. People feel very differently about something7 if they have a chance to vote on it than if it's imposed8 on them by ­­ by the courts.9 MS. BONAUTO: Well, there's a few points10 there, and I hope I get them all. With respect to11 Maine, one thing that separates Maine from the States12 that we're talking about here is that there wasn't a13 constitutional amendment in place that really largely14 shuts down the process. It is extraordinarily difficult15 to amend the Constitution, and an opinion poll is not a16 measure in any way of what a legislature is going to do17 in terms of approving an amendment to go out to the18 voters. So there ­­ there are some serious structural19 problems that did not apply in a place like Maine.20 And in terms of acceptance, when I think21 about acceptance, I think about the nation as a whole,22 and the ­­ and there are places where, again, there are23 no protections, virtually no protections for gay and24 lesbian people in employment, in parenting. You know,25 the Michigan Petitioners, for example, are not allowedAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial231 to be parents of their own children, the children that2 the State of Michigan has placed with them and approved3 of their adoptions.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Miss ­­ Miss Bonauto,5 I'm ­­ I'm concerned about the wisdom of this Court6 imposing through the Constitution a ­­ a requirement of7 action which is unpalatable to many of our citizens for8 religious reasons. They are not likely to change their9 view about what marriage consists of. And were ­­ were10 the States to adopt it by law, they could make11 exceptions to what ­­ what is required for same­sex12 marriage, who has to honor it and so forth.13 But once it's ­­ it's made a matter of14 constitutional law, those exceptions ­­ for example, is15 it ­­ is it conceivable that a minister who is16 authorized by the State to conduct marriage can decline17 to marry two men if indeed this Court holds that they18 have a constitutional right to marry? Is it conceivable19 that that would be allowed?20 MS.

I don't see how you couldpossibly allow that minister to say, I will only marry aman and a woman.  I will not marry two men.  Which meansyou ­­ you would ­­ you could ­­ you could haveministers who ­­ who conduct real marriages that ­­ thatare civilly enforceable at the National Cathedral, butnot at St. Matthews downtown, because that ministerrefuses to marry two men, and therefore, cannot be giventhe State power to make a real State marriage.

You can't do that5 once it is a constitutional proscription.6 MS.

If it's a State law, you canmake those exceptions.  But if it's a constitutionalrequirement, I don't see how you can.  And every Stateallows ministers to marry people, and their marriagesare effective under State law.  That will not be thecase if, indeed, we hold, as a constitutional matter,that the State must marry two men.JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Bonauto, maybe I'm just not understanding Justice Scalia's question, but for example, there are many rabbis that will not conduct marriages between Jews and non­Jews, notwithstanding that we have a constitutional prohibition against religious discrimination.

VERRILLI, JR.   ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,     SUPPORTING PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The opportunity to marry is integral tohuman dignity.  Excluding gay and lesbian couples frommarriage demeans the dignity of these couples.  It diddemeans their children, and it denies the ­­ both thecouples and their children the stabilizing structurethat marriage affords.      Now, the Respondents' principal argument,and what we've been discussing this morning so far, iswhether this issue of ­­ whether this discriminationshould persist is something that should be left to thepolitical process or whether it should be somethingdecided by the Court.  And I'd like to make three pointsabout that, if I could.Alderson Reporting Company28￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Actually, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court isready.Official29￼1 First, the ­­ I think it's important to2 understand that if this Court concludes that this issue3 should be left to the political process, what the Court4 will be saying is that the demeaning, second­class5 status that gay and lesbian couples now inhabit in ­­ in6 States that do not provide for marriage is consistent7 with the equal protection of the laws. That is not a8 wait­and­see. That is a validation.9 And second, to the extent that the thought10 is that this can be left to the political process11 because this issue will take care of itself over time,12 because attitudes are changing, what I respectfully13 submit to the Court is that although no one can see the14 future perfectly, of course, that it seems much more15 likely to me that the outcome that we're going to end up16 with is something that will approximate the nation as a17 house divided that we had with de jure racial18 segregation. You may have many States, perhaps most19 States, in which gay couples can live with equal dignity20 and status, but you will have a minority of States in21 which gay couples will be relegated to demeaning,22 second­class status, and I don't know why we would want23 to repeat that history.24 And third ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, General, I ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 I'm sorry. Go ahead.2 GENERAL VERRILLI:3 expand on what Ms. Bonauto said, that ­­ that ­­ and I4 think you, Mr. Chief Justice, you did recognize this,5 that the decision to leave this to the political process6 is going to impose enormous costs that this Court7 thought were costs of constitutional stature in Windsor.8 Thousands and thousands of people are going to live out9 their lives and go to their deaths without their States10 ever recognizing the equal dignity of their11 relationships.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could have said13 the same thing 10 years ago or so when we had Lawrence.14 Haven't we learned a tremendous amount since ­­ well,15 since Lawrence, just in the last 10 years?16 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. And, Your Honor, I17 actually think that's quite a critical point that goes18 to the questions that Your Honor was asking earlier. I19 do think Lawrence was an important catalyst that has20 brought us to where we are today. And I think what21 Lawrence did was provide an assurance that gay and22 lesbian couples could live openly in society as free23 people and start families and raise families and24 participate fully in their communities without fear.25 And there are ­­ two things flow from that,Alderson Reporting CompanyAnd third, I want to30￼Official311 I think. One is that has brought us to the point where2 we understand now, in a way even that we did not fully3 understand in Lawrence, that gay and lesbian people and4 gay and lesbian couples are full and equal members of5 the community. And what we once thought of as necessary6 and proper reasons for ostracizing and marginalizing gay7 people, we now understand do not justify that kind of8 impression.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The difference, of10 course, is Lawrence, the whole argument is the State11 cannot intrude on that personal relationship. This, it12 seems to me, is ­­ is different in that what the13 argument is is the State must sanction. It must approve14 that relationship. They're two different questions.15 GENERAL VERRILLI: It is different, I agree.16 And I ­­ and it leads to the second thing I think that17 the ­­ that the Lawrence catalyzed for our society, was18 it put gay and lesbian couples, gay and lesbian people,19 in a position for the first time in our history to be20 able to lay claim to the abiding promise of the21 Fourteenth Amendment in a way that was just impossible22 when they were marginalized and ostracized.23 And you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, this is24 about equal participation, participation on equal terms25 in a State­conferred ­­ a State­conferred status, a￼Alderson Reporting Company19 JUSTICE ALITO:20 GENERAL VERRILLI:21 JUSTICE ALITO:22 elements of marriage as it exists today?23 GENERAL VERRILLI:24 essential elements of marriage25 that ­­ the ­­ the obligationsWell, I think theare the ones thatof mutual supportare ­­ andOfficial321 State institution. That is different than Lawrence, but2 I do think that what Lawrence has allowed us to see is3 that the justifications for excluding gay and lesbian4 couples from equal participation in this institution5 just hold up.6 And I do think ­­ and the Court has raised7 this question about whether what we are talking about8 here is a ­­ is a fundamental change in the nature of9 marriage. And I think the answer to that question is10 that this case can be decided by thinking about marriage11 in exactly the way the States ­­ the Respondent States12 and other States have defined marriage now.13 And I think it's important to think about it14 this way. Heterosexual couples can enter marriage, and15 they can have families through biological procreation.16 They can have families through assisted reproduction.￼17 They can have families through adoption, or they18 have families at all.can notAlderson Reporting CompanyWhat do you think ­­   And I ­­­­ are the essentialOfficial33￼1 responsibility and the benefits surrounding marriage2 that State law provides to ensure that there is an3 enduring bond, that enduring bond that continues over4 time and lasts, hopefully, till death do us part,5 through the end of life. And that ­­ and with ­­ and ­­6 and, certainly, childrearing is bound up in that.7 But what I would suggest, Justice Alito, is8 the way in which childbearing ­­ bearing is bound up9 in that is quite different than what my friends on the10 other side are suggesting .11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's ­­ let's think12 about two groups of two people. The first is the13 same­sex couple who have been together for 25 years, and14 they get married either as a result of a change in State15 law or as a result of a Court decision. The second two16 people are unmarried siblings. They've lived together17 for 25 years. Their financial relationship is the same18 as the ­­ the same­sex couple. They share household19 expenses and household chores in the same way. They20 care for each other in the same way.21 Is there any reason why the law should treat22 the two groups differently?23 MS. BONAUTO: Well, I'm not sure that the24 law would ­­ the ­­ the law allows 100 percent of25 heterosexual people to enter into a marriage that'sAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial341 consistent with their sexual orientation, and in these2 States, it forbids 100 percent of gay and lesbian people3 from entering into a marriage that's consistent with4 their sexual orientation ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO:￼6 GENERAL VERRILLI:7 difference.8 JUSTICE ALITO:9 benefits that Federal law confers on married people,10 such as in Windsor, the effect on estate taxes, what11 would be the reason for treating those two groups12 differently?13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I ­­ I ­­ I'm not14 entirely sure there would be, but, of course, marriage15 is something more fundamental than that. It is an16 enduring bond between two people.17 And to get back to the point about18 childrearing, I do think this is quite important. I19 mean, I ­­ I understand, and in part of their20 wait­and­see and caution argument, that Respondents21 are ­­ that what Respondents are saying here is that22 they ­­ that they want to exercise an attitude of23 caution because of concern about the welfare of children24 raised in same­sex married households.25 But there's a quite significant problem withAlderson Reporting CompanyWell, as far as ­­   ­­ and justifies thatAs far as the ­­ theOfficial1 that rationale, and it's this: Right now, today,2 hundreds of thousands of children are being raised in3 same­sex households. That number is only going to grow.4 All of the evidence so far shows you that there isn't a5 problem, and what the ­­ and the States' argument really6 is quite ironic in this respect that it's going to deny7 marriage, the State ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That ­­ that's quite a9 statement. All of the evidence shows there is no10 problem.11 GENERAL VERRILLI:12 JUSTICE SCALIA:13 there's not a problem.14 GENERAL VERRILLI:15 leading organizations that have filed briefs have said16 to you that there is a consensus in that, and ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think some of18 the ­­ some of the briefs contradicted that.19 GENERAL VERRILLI: But ­­ but even beyond20 that, I think the more fundamental point, and the point21 I'm trying to drive at here, is that you have hundreds22 of thousands of children raised in same­sex households23 now. And what Respondents' position and Respondents'24 caution argument leads you to is the conclusion that25 those hundreds of thousands of children don't get theAlderson Reporting Company  Well, I ­­All of the evidence showsI ­­ I think all of the35￼Official36￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425stabilizing structure and the many benefits of marriage. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'd like tofollow up in a line of questioning that Justice Scaliastarted.      We have a concession from your friend thatclergy will not be required to perform same­sexmarriage, but there are going to be harder questions.Would a religious school that has married housing berequired to afford such housing to same­sex couples?GENERAL VERRILLI: I guess what I'd ­­ I'd like to make three points about that, if I could,Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the first part ­­GENERAL VERRILLI: And I will ­­ and I'll go right at the question you asked.      The first one is, of course, this Court'sruling addresses what the States must do under theFourteenth Amendment.      And the ­­ and the second point is that whenyou get to a question like the one Your Honor asked,that is going to depend on how States work out thebalance between their civil rights laws, whether theydecide that there's going to be civil rights enforcementof discrimination based on sexual orientation or not,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial37￼1 and how they decide what kinds of accommodations they2 are going to allow under State law.3 And they could well ­­ you know, different4 states could strike different balances.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about6 Federal ­­ it's a Federal question if we make it a7 matter of constitutional law.8 GENERAL VERRILLI: But the question of9 what ­­ how States use their enforcement power is up to10 the States.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have12 enforcement power, too.13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. And ­­14 and ­­ well, that's certainly true, but there is no15 Federal law now generally banning discrimination based16 on sexual orientation, and that's where those issues are17 going to have to be worked out.18 And I guess the third point I would make,19 Your Honor, is that these issues are going to arise no20 matter which way you decide this case, because these21 questions of accommodation are going to arise in22 situations in States where there is no same­sex23 marriage, where there are ­­ and, in fact, they have24 arisen many times. There ­­ there are these commitment25 ceremonies.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial38￼1 For example, in the New Mexico case in which2 this Court denied cert just a few months back, that did3 not arise out of a marriage. That arose out of a4 commitment ceremony, and the ­­ and these, you know,5 commitment ceremonies are going to need florists and6 caterers.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in the Bob Jones case,8 the Court held that a college was not entitled to9 tax­exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or10 interracial dating. So would the same apply to a11 university or a college if it opposed same­sex marriage?12 GENERAL VERRILLI: You know, I ­­ I don't13 think I can answer that question without knowing more14 specifics, but it's certainly going to be an issue.15 I ­­ I don't deny that. I don't deny that, Justice16 Alito. It is ­­ it is going to be an issue.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask you ­­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one question.19 I see your time is going out. I'm interested in your20 comments on Glucksberg, which says what we should have21 to define a fundamental right in its narrowest terms.22 A lot of the questions that we're ­­ we're23 asking your colleague in the earlier part of the24 argument were ­­ had ­­ had that in mind, I think.25 What ­­ what do we do with the language of GlucksbergAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial39￼1 that says we have to define it in a narrow way?2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Justice Kennedy, forgive3 me for answering the question this way.4 We do recognize that there's a profound5 connection between liberty and equality, but the United6 States has advanced only an equal protection argument.7 We haven't made the fundamental rights argument under8 Glucksberg. And therefore, I'm not sure it would be9 appropriate for me not having briefed it to comment on10 that.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can you tell me why12 you didn't make the fundamental argument?13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, because we think ­­14 well, because we think while we do see that there is, of15 course, this profound connection, we do think that for16 reasons like the ones implicit in the Chief Justice's17 question, that this issue really sounds in equal18 protection, as we understand it, because the question is19 equal participation in a State conferred status and20 institution. And that's why we think of it in equal21 protection terms.22 And if I could just in the ­­ in the little23 time that I have left, I'd like to suggest this, that24 what the Respondents are ultimately saying to the Court25 is that with respect to marriage, they are not readyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial401 yet. And yes, gay and lesbian couples can live openly2 in society, and yes, they can raise children. Yes, they3 can participate fully as members of their community.4 Marriage, though, not yet. Leave that to be worked out5 later. But the Petitioners ­­ the Petitioners, these6 gay and lesbian couples are ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or not. Or not. I mean,8 that's not what they are saying. They are saying leave9 it to the people. It will be worked out later or not.10 GENERAL VERRILLI: But what these gay and11 lesbian couples are doing is laying claim to the promise12 of the Fourteenth Amendment now. And it is emphatically13 the duty of this Court, in this case, as it was in14 Lawrence, to decide what the Fourteenth Amendment15 requires.16 And what I would suggest is that in a world17 in which gay and lesbian couples live openly as our18 neighbors, they raise their children side by side with19 the rest of us, they contribute fully as members of the20 community, that it is simply untenable ­­ untenable to21 suggest that they can be denied the right of equal22 participation in an institution of marriage, or that23 they can be required to wait until the majority decides24 that it is ready to treat gay and lesbian people as25 equals. Gay and lesbian people are equal. They deserve￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the equal protection of the laws, and they deserve it 2 now.

BURSCHON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS ON QUESTION 1MR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      Respondents are not saying we're not readyyet.  Respondents are really echoing the questionsthat ­­ that Justice Breyer was asking.      This case isn't about how to definemarriage.  It's about who gets to decide that question.Is it the people acting through the democratic process,or is it the Federal courts?  And we're asking you toaffirm every individual's fundamental liberty interestin deciding the meaning of marriage.  And I think thiswhole case really turns on the questions that JusticeScalia asked.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Nobody is taking that away from anybody. Every single individual in this society chooses, if they can, their sexual orientation or who to marry or not marry. I suspect even with us giving gays rights to marry that there's some gay people who will choose not to. Just as there'sAlderson Reporting Company41￼Official421 some heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. So2 we're not taking anybody's liberty away.3 MR. BURSCH: But we're talking about the4 fundamental liberty interest in deciding the question of5 what marriage means, and to get that ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know that7 that's ­­ I mean, leaving that to the side, I thought8 that I heard the answer to the question being given in9 respect to tradition of 2000 years, and to the10 democratic ballot box and so forth was quite simple.11 What I heard was, one, marriage is fundamental. I mean,12 certainly that's true for 10,000 years. And marriage,13 as the States administer it, is open to vast numbers of14 people who both have children, adopt children, don't15 have children, all over the place.16 But there is one group of people whom they17 won't open marriage to. So they have no possibility to18 participate in that fundamental liberty. That is people19 of the same sex who wish to marry. And so we ask, why?20 And the answer we get is, well, people have always done21 it. You know, you could have answered that one the same22 way we talk about racial segregation.23 Or two, because certain religious groups do24 think it's a sin, and I believe they sincerely think it.25 There's no question about their sincerity, but is a￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial43￼1 purely religious reason on the part of some people2 sufficient?3 And then when I look for reasons three, four4 and five, I don't find them. What are they? So ­­ so5 therefore, I'm asking ­­ there I put a long question,6 but it gives you an opening to say what all of those7 reasons are.8 MR. BURSCH: Justice Breyer, those answers9 one and two are not our answers.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Good.11 MR. BURSCH: Our answer number one is that12 the marriage institution did not develop to deny dignity13 or to give second class status to anyone. It developed14 to serve purposes that, by their nature, arise from15 biology.16 Now, imagine a world today where we had no17 marriage at all. Men and women would still be getting18 together and creating children, but they wouldn't be19 attached to each other in any social institution.20 Now, the ­­ the marriage view on the other21 side here is that marriage is all about love and22 commitment. And as a society, we can agree that that's23 important, but the State doesn't have any interest in24 that. If we're trying to solve that social problem I25 just described, where there's no marriage, we wouldn'tAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial441 solve it by saying, well, let's have people identify who2 they are emotionally committed to and recognize those3 relationships.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bursch, I ­­ I5 understand that argument. It's the principal argument6 that you make in ­­ in your briefs, that same­sex7 marriage doesn't advance this State interest in8 regulating procreation.9 Let's just assume for the moment that that's10 so. Obviously, same­sex partners cannot procreate11 themselves. But is there ­­ in addition to that, are12 you saying that recognizing same­sex marriage will13 impinge upon that State interest, will harm that State14 interest in regulating procreation through marriage?15 MR. BURSCH: We are saying that, Your Honor.16 Now, obviously, under a rational basis,17 that's not a question that you need to decide, but ­­18 but even leaving that aside ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could that ­­ how20 could that be, because all of the incentives, all of the21 benefits that marriage affords would still be available.22 So you're not taking away anything from heterosexual23 couples. They would have the very same incentive to24 marry, all the benefits that come with marriage that25 they do now.￼Alderson Reporting Company10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:11 MR. BURSCH:12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:13 MR. BURSCH:       You don't do that.If I could ­­       That's the problem.If ­­ if I could ­­Official14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:15 on any level. How many married couples do fathers with16 the benefits or the requirements of marriage walk away17 from their children?18 MR. BURSCH: Justice ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not that the20 institution alone does it and that without it that21 father is going to stay in the marriage. He made a22 choice.23 MR. BURSCH: Justice ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would say that it25 could ­­ I could ­­ it should be gender­neutral. SomeAlderson Reporting CompanyMarriage doesn't do that45￼1 MR. BURSCH: Justice Kagan and Justice2 Ginsburg, it has to do with the societal understanding3 of what marriage means. This is a much bigger idea than4 any particular couple and what a marriage might mean to5 them or to their children. And when you change the6 definition of marriage to delink the idea that we're7 binding children with their biological mom and dad, that8 has consequences.

Has8 black­and­white marriage been treated fundamentally?9 The issue was starting from the proposition of, is the10 right to marry fundamental?

I'm simply pointing out that under this Court's19 long­established precedent in the fundamental rights20 area, which is designed to create a balance where21 Federal courts aren't always interfering with the State22 democratic process, that in Windsor, you already23 answered that question. It doesn't matter how broadly24 or narrowly we define it. What's been fundamentally25 understood as a limitation is the opposite sex nature ofAlderson Reporting Company                      61I ­­ I ­­ you know, the￼Official62￼1 marriage.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm ­­ I'm3 not sure it's necessary to get into sexual orientation4 to resolve the case. I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom5 loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can't. And the6 difference is based upon their different sex. Why isn't7 that a straightforward question of sexual8 discrimination?9 MR. BURSCH: Two reasons. All of this10 Court's landmark precedents in this area in sexual11 discrimination law have always involved treating classes12 of men and women differently. And that's not what we13 have here.14 But ­­ but even more fundamentally than15 that, this Court has recognized in Nguyen v. INS that16 it's appropriate to draw lines based on sex if it's17 related to biology. And if you'll indulge me just for a18 minute, the Nguyen case really is important here.19 You'll recall that's the case where you had a law that20 determined citizenship of children born to divorced21 or ­­ or unmarried individuals overseas. And the law22 said if it was the child of a citizen mother, then they23 automatically had citizenship, but if it was the father,24 then the father had to, one, prove paternity and, two,25 make child support payments up to age 18. And that's anAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial63￼1 obvious sex discrimination. And the Court said ­­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the Court ­­ the ­­3 the Court ­­ the Court's rationale for that was we know4 who the mother is. We're fearful that the father is5 claiming to be the father for some benefits that he's6 going to get from that status, but we can't be sure he7 is the father.8 MR. BURSCH: Right. Justice Ginsburg, that9 was the justification for the prove the parenthood. But10 I would like to ­­ to quote from the opinion about the11 second interest, the ­­ the child support.12 The Court said that the government had an13 important interest in ensuring an opportunity to have a14 meaningful parent­child relationship between that15 biological father and a child. And the law16 substantially advanced that interest, and this is why,17 and I'm going to quote.18 "It is almost axiomatic that a policy which19 seeks to foster the opportunity for meaningful20 parent­child bonds to develop has a close and21 substantial bearing on the governmental interest in the22 actual formation of that bond."23 And that is the exact same interest that the24 Respondents are advancing here when they talk about the25 definition of marriage, which from ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 Nguyen case, the father could get the status of a3 parent. He just had to do some things that the mother4 didn't have to do. It wasn't difficult.5 Here it's a total exclusion. And in the6 Nguyen case, the ­­ the father was complaining that he7 shouldn't have to do anything other than what a mother8 did, and the Court said, yeah, you do have to do9 something. It's not much.10 MR. BURSCH: But ­­ but the gist of the11 Court's opinion, Justice Ginsburg, was that the State12 had an interest in the biological father­child bond, not13 only improving it, but also ensuring that it’s sustained.14 It advanced the exact same interest that the States have15 when they try to inextricably bind kids to their16 biological moms and dads. And ­­ and if you change that17 meaning, over the long haul, it has consequences. You18 know, I ­­ I started to say a few minutes ago that the19 out­of­wedlock birth rate in this country has gone from20 10 percent to 40 percent from 1970 to today.21 And I think everybody would agree that that's not a good22 result for children. And to the extent that you're23 changing the meaning of marriage ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that wasn't changed25 because of the recent gay marriages.Alderson Reporting Company64 It's not ­­ it ­­ in the￼Official65 1 MR.

But as several Justices7 have noted, you know, that's a very short time frame.8 The whole idea of same­sex marriage ­­910 that 111213JUSTICE KENNEDY: But ­­ but you're the one brought the statistic up, and under ­­MR. BURSCH: Right. But listen ­­ (Laughter.)JUSTICE KENNEDY: And ­­ and under your14 view, it would be very difficult for same­sex couples to15 adopt some of these children. I ­­ I think the argument16 cuts quite against you.17 MR. BURSCH: Well, what ­­ what I'm18 talking ­­19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And ­­ and it goes back to20 the basic point where you began where you had some21 premise that only opposite­sex couples can have a22 bonding with the child. That's ­­ that was very23 interesting, but it's just a wrong premise.24 MR. BURSCH: No. That's not my premise.25 The premise is that we want to encourage children to beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial661 bonded to their biological mother and father. We don't2 deny at all ­­ disagree at all that same­sex couples can3 be bonded to their children. We hope that's the case.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you see, this is what5 I think is ­­ is difficult for some people with your6 argument, is that it's hard to see how permitting7 same­sex marriage discourages people from being bonded8 with their biological children. So if you would explain9 that to me.10 MR. BURSCH: Because if you're changing the11 meaning of marriage from one where it's based on that12 biological bond to one where it's based on emotional13 commitment, then adults could think, rightly, that this14 relationship is more about adults and not about the15 kids. Not the case with the Plaintiffs in this case.16 We all agree that they are bonded to their kids and have17 their best interest at heart.18 But when we're talking about, Justice19 Kennedy, over decades, when laws change, when societal20 views on marriage change, there are consequences to21 that. And ­­ and what this comes down to is whether22 you ­­ not whether you agree or disagree with me or a23 reasonable voter on whether that could happen. It's24 whether, in drawing these policy lines ­­ you know,25 every marriage definition excludes and includes some￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial671 people. You know, the possible harm is when you change2 that definition, is that something ­­3 JUSTICE BREYER: It's the same point. What4 directly is your response to the fact that if we assume5 a basic purpose of marriage is to encourage an emotional6 and rearing bond between parents and children, that7 allowing gay people to marry will weaken it? After all,8 some non­gay couples have children, many, and some9 don't. And some gay people married have children, and￼10 some11 what1213 simple.

The more that link is8 separated, the more likely it is that when you've got an9 opposite­sex couple, that link will not be maintained,10 because it's more adult­centric, and it's less11 child­centric.12 You've got more kids being raised without13 their biological mom and dad. You have more kids being14 raised without both parents, you know, typically,15 without a father, though that's not always the case.16 And it's not unreasonable for the people in thinking17 about the possible consequences of changing a18 definition, which has existed, as Justice Kennedy said,19 for millennia, might have real consequences.

BURSCH: Justice Sotomayor, as you're13 well aware, this Court actually decided two prisoner14 cases. One was Taylor, the one I think you were15 referring to; the other is Butler. This Court in Taylor16 said even someone in prison who has an expectation of17 getting out someday has a right to consummate their18 marriage. In Butler, you said when someone's serving a19 life sentence, it's appropriate for the State to deny20 them the opportunity to marry because they never had21 that opportunity.

And when you8 change those, you also change the balance between the9 Federal courts and the people voting in the democratic10 process.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: See, to me it seems as12 though you are doing something very different that we've13 never done before, which is you are defining14 constitutional rights in terms of the kinds of people15 that can exercise them. And I don't think we've really16 ever done that. Where we've seen a constitutional17 right, we have not defined it by these people can18 exercise it, but these people can't, especially in a19 case where the claims are both rights­based and20 equality­based.21 I mean, it would be like saying in Lawrence,22 well, there's only a right to intimate activity for23 heterosexual people and not a right to intimate sexual24 activity for gays and lesbians.

BURSCH: Absolutely. But that's theState's whole point, is that we're not drawing distinctions based on the identity, the orientation, or the choices of anyone.

BONAUTO   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 1MS. BONAUTO: First, I just want to say that the idea that the ideas of marriage will change is a false dichotomy. Right now, different­sex couples can choose to marry and rear children. They can choose to marry at 70 or 90 because of their commitment to one other. We honor both marriages. It is only same­sex couples who are foreclosed from marrying under either vision.Second, we agree that these restrictionsare, in fact, linked to gender. There's official classification here, and they are sex linked in an additional way, and that is ideas about what is a proper relationship for a man to have, a real man or a real woman, and that is obviously not with a person of the same sex.     I hear that Michigan loves adoption, and, inAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial861 fact, Michigan has placed intensely vulnerable children2 with these petitioners who have nurtured them to a3 healthy childhood. Does Michigan deny the marriage4 because they didn't conceive those children together,5 when Michigan would let other adoptive parents who are a6 different­sex couple marry? No. Michigan is drawing a7 line because it does not approve of the adult8 relationship, no matter what the protestations they9 follow.10 Next, we hear a line it's not disrespectful11 because it's drawn based on biology. I have to say one12 casualty of the marriage litigation is an impoverished13 view of what is marriage and what is the role of14 biological procreation. The State's entire premise here15 is that if same­sex couples marry, then different­sex16 couples won't and have their children in a marriage.17 Those two could not be further apart. People make their18 own decisions. It is beyond attenuated.19 And the idea also that there are other20 people who raise children ­­ and good for them, it's21 something, of course, that I hope policymakers would22 support. But it's adult relationships that we're23 talking about at the foundation here are different adult24 relationships, and telling same­sex couples who have25 made that commitment to one another and have committed￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial87￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to raising children that they can't is what isstigmatizing.And then, if I may, my ­­ my last point isthat the only way I can really understand Michigan's points about procreation and biology and so on is when I look, for example, at page 31 of their brief. And they say that what they care about is people who have children together staying together and providing a long­term, stable situation for their children.     That interest applies full force in thiscontext, because by denying marriage to same­sexcouples, you are denying not only the protection for theadults, which is independently important, you aredenying those protections and that security that wouldcome from having married parents.So with that, thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
