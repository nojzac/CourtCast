OLSON                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          Kansas imposes a tax on the distributors ofmotor fuel.  The legal incidence of that tax isexplicitly, by statute, imposed on the distributor of thefirst receipt of the fuel.  The tax is, thus, imposed andcollected off-reservation from non-Indians.  The who,when, and where of the tax is all off-reservation and non-Indian.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Olson, may I ask you to goone step beyond that on an issue of fact that I just don'tunderstand from reading the briefs?  Let me give you threequick quotations.          First, the court of appeals opinion containsthis statement, "An expert on behalf of the tribe reportedthat basic economic theory teaches that the nation'sstation cannot charge prices high enough to allowcollection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 taxes."2 The red brief says, on page 8, "It is undisputed3 that enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to4 the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel5 tax."6 Finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, "By7 selling its fuel at market prices, respondent" -- the8 tribe -- "is making both a profit and collecting a tax."9 My question is, Do we know, from the record,10 whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in11 fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic12 effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the13 State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at14 market prices?15 MR. OLSON: I had -- I had the same question,16 Justice Souter, as I was looking at this yesterday. And I17 investigated it. And it is my understanding, but I did18 not find this completely in the record, that the19 distributor is, indeed, paying the tax, and that the tribe20 is also collecting a tax. Now, I don't quite understand21 how you reconcile those two points that you've just22 raised. If it's -- if it's something that is economically23 not possible, how can it -- how is it that it's being24 done. Despite the fact that the tenth circuit held the25 tax impermissible, it's my understanding that the4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 distributor is still paying the tax. Now, I --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Make it up on volume, I think.3 MR. OLSON: Maybe they make it up on volume.4 Maybe people that are at the casino are willing to pay5 more of the tax. There is a differential between the6 amount of7 couple of8 point --910 you -- if11 selling their gas, then there's no -- then the tribe12 cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing13 authority14 argument,15 they want16is being compromised or threatened.  And thebasically, would boil down to the argument thatto make a bigger profit.MR. OLSON:  Well, I agree with that.  And I alsothe State tax and the tribe tax.  It's only acents, as I understand it.  But I think theJUSTICE SOUTER:  But if -- if I may interruptit's getting passed through, and they're still17 would point out --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or want to19 MR. OLSON: Pardon me?20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or want to21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.22 MR. OLSON: Yes.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.24 MR. OLSON: Yeah. And what25 -- what this boils down to -- and I'm5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOimpose a higher tax.impose a higher tax.-- I think that whatskipping ahead ofWashington, DC 20005￼1 myself -- is that the tribe would like to be able to2 market a product without having to pay the burdens of3 taxation all the way upstream. There are taxes on the4 distributors' property, there's taxes that are imposed5 when the fuel comes out of the ground and at the refinery6 stage. So, the tribe would like to market a product7 unburdened by any upstream taxation, the cost of doing8 business --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but aren't they going to10 tell us that -- as a practical matter, that the tax is11 really being collected for the retailers? It's just being12 passed on to the retailers, but paid by the -- I take it13 that the distributor -- the way this works -- I, again,14 had problems with effect -- I take it the distributor15 sends out a truck. And if he sends out the truck to the16 tribe, then the distributor just pays the tax, and the17 tribe would want that tax to be -- that fuel to be18 distributed, less the cost of the tax.19 MR. OLSON: Yes.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if the tribe view21 prevails, then the distributor still sends the truck to22 the stations that are in the State and passes on the tax23 for those --24 MR. OLSON: It's --25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- distributors only. I take6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 it that's 23 explained4 3410 -- I5 statutes,6 distributor pays a -- pays a tax as a result of taking the7 fuel down from what they call the rack, and then taking it8 to various service stations ----MR. OLSON: It's my understanding -- and this is -- the details of this are explained in Section can't give you a citation to the record, but the I'm presuming, are available -- that the910 you will, 111213 -- is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas? Is14 it when it is delivered to the distributor?15 MR. OLSON: It's --16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or is it later?17 MR. OLSON: The statute explicitly says, Justice18 O'Connor -- this is on page 2 of the petition -- the19 incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the20 first receipt of the motor fuel. And then Section --21 that's Section 3408(c) -- Section 3410 then describes, in22 a little bit more detail, the physical operation of the23 reports that the distributor has to make, and the24 distributor has to pay the tax.25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, the distributor gets the7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what event triggers, if the incidence of the tax on the distributor? MR. OLSON: It's --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it -- is it the obligation￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425fuel and incurs the obligation at that point, whether ornot it's resold.          MR. OLSON:  That's correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But doesn't incur it, or getsa credit or get it back, if it sells to the United Statesor if it sells out-of-State.  In other words, it's notjust the receipt.MR. OLSON: It's -- Justice Ginsburg, it is the receipt that triggers the liability for the tax. There is a -- an exemption that may be taken in connection with sales to the United States, and that's a part of a massive quid pro quo operation, where fuel is sold to the United States, and the United States pays the State back substantially all of the tax that --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And out-of-State or abroad --MR. OLSON: And out-of-State, there is a deduction for fuel sold out-of-State. That's logical, because the purpose for the tax is to pay for the roads in Kansas, and it's --JUSTICE BREYER: Then that's the problem, right there, because I thought -- first, there is a tax -- you get a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody. So, I don't think it's quite -- if you just sit there with --MR. OLSON: I don't -- JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe not --8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. OLSON: I think -- I would disagree with2 you, Justice Breyer.3 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't? All right.4 MR. OLSON: I think it's my understanding that5 if you sat on that fuel for the next year --6 JUSTICE BREYER: You'd still have to pay tax.7 MR. OLSON: -- you'd still have to pay --8 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.9 MR. OLSON: -- the tax.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, on --11 MR. OLSON: That's my understanding. Now --12 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.13 MR. OLSON: -- with respect to the out-of-State14 distribution --15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.16 MR. OLSON: -- that's because --17 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.18 MR. OLSON: -- that fuel is not going to be used19 on --20 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.21 MR. OLSON: -- Kansas highways, presumably.22 JUSTICE BREYER: You are Kansas. You sell --23 the retailer in Kansas sells it to Nebraska. Nebraska is,24 in a sense, a foreign and independent State. And I guess,25 at some level, the tribes are arguing, "Well, you sell to9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425us, our local retailer. We, too, are a foreign and independent State, even more so. So, if you're going to treat them this way -- give the people in Nebraska a credit so they don't have to pay -- why don't you treat us that way? We drive on Kansas roads sometimes. So do the Nebraskans" --MR. OLSON: Well, sometimes.JUSTICE BREYER: -- -- "sometimes."MR. OLSON: The vast --JUSTICE BREYER: So, they say -- get intointerest balancing.MR. OLSON: Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what -- now you have thewhole argument that I'm thinking of.  What do you respond?MR. OLSON:  Well, one of my responses is thatis located entirely within the State.  Theclear that most of the fuel purchased at thatthe triberecord isstation is used on highways paid for by Kansas.  Anoverwhelming majority of the fuel is not used on areservation road; its used on the highways of the State ofKansas to get to the casino or to leave the casino.  Theroad that's at issue in this case is 1.5 miles long.  Therest of the driving, according to the record, is on thehighways of Kansas.  So, there's a clear difference there.When you sell -- when the distributors market 10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 fuel in Nebraska --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Olson, would it make3 any difference if all of the driving was inside the4 reservation? Would it --5 MR. OLSON: No, we would --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- make any difference?7 MR. OLSON: -- we would argue that it would not8 make any difference, Justice Stevens, because this is a9 tax on distributors. It is -- the Legislature of10 followed the specific advice of this Court in its11 unanimous opinion in the Chickasaw Nation that if12 an issue with respect to the tax being imposed on13 arguably burdening the tribe, the State can change the14 legal incidence of the tax. That's a --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- that has been16 what's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court,17 in Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence18 on the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further.19 That's what it said. When the State levies a tax directly20 on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no21 balancing. But then it also said that if the incidence22 rests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here,23 then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in.24 So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule,25 is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005Kansasthere is --￼1 tribe.2 MR. OLSON: I -- that's correct, Justice3 Ginsburg. But the answer is that this is an entirely off-4 reservation tax on non-Indians. We're -- we submit that5 there's no balancing necessary in this case unless you're6 going to involve an -- require States to submit to7 litigation and engage in balancing every time an off-8 reservation tax on non-Indians has some downstream9 economic effect. But what about the tax on the car that10 brings the casino patron to the reservation? What about11 the tax on the cigarettes or the alcohol or the gambling12 machinery?13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Olson, the14 Solicitor General tells us that -- and here we have -- you15 have the statute, but they have the Kaul case that16 suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.17 MR. OLSON: But the Kaul case, in the context of18 deciding whether other retailers there had standing,19 basically said that there was an economic impact that20 affected the retailers. The Kaul case specifically21 referred, Mr. Chief Justice, to the fact that the22 legislature had -- and this is on page 67 of the Pacific23 2nd cite of the Kaul opinion -- the legislature amended24 the statute -- this is at the bottom of the second column25 -- or the first column -- to clarify the question where12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the incidence of taxation falls. The legislature provided2 that, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax3 falls on the distributor. Then, Mr. Chief Justice, the4 court went on to evaluate the standing question and5 allowed the distributors the -- to raise the issue,6 because the economic burden did come through the7 distributors.8 It's important, in that context, to note that9 the ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling10 on the retailer, it's falling on the consumer. It's11 falling on the consumer of the gasoline. The consumer12 puts the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven13 overwhelmingly -- the facts are unquestionable in this14 case -- overwhelmingly on the highways of the State of15 Kansas. So that the burden -- ultimately, the burden --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but, again, that would17 still be true if the incidence -- the tax was on the18 retailer rather than the wholesaler.19 MR. OLSON: It still would be true. And -- but20 the fact is, in this case you have a -- off-reservation21 tax, on the -- all distributors --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which the statute contemplates23 will be collected when the gas is sold to the -- by the24 retailer.25MR. OLSON: It -- what the statute specifically 13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 says -- this is Section 3409 -- it says that the2 distributor may pass on -- "may" -- it's a permissive3 provision -- may pass on the cost of the taxation as a4 part of the cost of doing business. And, of course, the5 distributor does that with respect to the cost of its6 vehicles, the cost of other taxes it pays. It may include7 those provisions.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what a strange provision.9 I mean, who would have thought that he couldn't? Why did10 --11 MR. OLSON: I --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they ever put that provision13 in, unless it means something different from --14 MR. OLSON: I think what it means -- I15 understand, Justice Scalia, and I -- because I've had the16 same reaction, "Well, of course he could. Why does he17 need a statute to do that? It is a cost of doing18 business." I think that provision is a part of the effort19 to make clear one of the factors that distinguishes this20 case from the Chickasaw Nation case, where the court found21 that it was significant that the distributor was required22 to pass on the tax, act as a collection agent for the23 retailer, and took a 1.5 percent commission. So, this24 court thought that might be significant. Kansas, in part,25 I think, want to make -- wanted to make it very clear that14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the -- what was happening in the economic chain is cost of2 production of gasoline, including tax paid by the3 distributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of4 business to the retailer.5 Now, of course its cost -- it passed on, also,6 to the consumer. The question --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, what does it8 mean when they say, in law, the "incidence of the taxes on9 the distributor"? Does that mean anything other than that10 he has to 1112 decisions13 least it was unclear to me as I was looking through the14 court's decisions. But I think it's a combination of the15 liability for the tax, the responsibility to pay the tax,16 the fact that -- in this case, the retailer has nopay it?MR. OLSON:  It is unclear from this court'sprecisely what "legal incidence" means.  At17 liability for the tax. The only liability for the tax is18 on the distributor. The relationship is between the State19 of Kansas and the distributor. And all of those factors20 together make it clear to me, from this court's previous21 decisions, that "legal incidence" is a term of art,22 especially in the field of taxation. And, as the court23 pointed out in the Chickasaw Nation case, it's important24 to have a --25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the reason15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 for my question is, they look back at the court's2 decisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of3 the tax is. And so, there's some bright lawyer in Kansas4 who said, "All we have to do is pass a law saying the5 incidence is -- of the tax is on the distributor, and6 we're going to win."789 shouldn'tMR. OLSON: Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it suggests that we give too much weight to that.MR. OLSON: Well, the bright lawyer in Kansas1011 who may have done that was the Kansas Legislature,12 following the unanimous decision of this court in13 Chickasaw Nation, saying, "If you want to avoid the14 potential problems that would exist, change" -- and it's15 not just the incidence of the tax, it's the legal16 incidence of the tax, it's -- of course, the economic17 burden of taxation is spread out throughout the chain of18 distribution. The legal incidence of the tax, as I read19 this court's opinions, are -- is, it is exactly what it is20 here, the distributor must pay for the tax, the21 distributor must account for the tax, the distributor is22 liable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid.23 Nobody else is liable for it. The distributor has to pay24 the tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline.25 Here, not only the language is as clear as it16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 could be -- I mean, the legislature specifically says it2 -- but the operation of the statute -- and the two -- the3 -- twice, the tenth circuit considered this -- the tenth4 circuit decided the legal incidence of the tax was on the5 distributor. The two district courts that decided it6 before those two tenth circuit decisions, decided that the7 legal incidence was on the distributor. The facts support8 that the legal incidence is on the distributor. And9 respondents, on page 16 of the respondent's brief, it10 seems to me, acknowledge precisely that. They, in their11 effort to distinguish the Central Machinery case, which is12 the Indian taxation statutes -- and we're not --13 specifically said there, referring to Central Machinery,14 "The State tax was imposed on the sale of merchandise.15 The legal incidence of the tax there, as here, fell on the16 non-Indian seller." So, the respondents have even said17 that, on page 16 of their own brief.1819 nuance on20 mentioned21 payable until, in fact, the gasoline was distributed to22 the retailer. Is that correct?23 MR. OLSON: That's not my understanding. I may24 be wrong. But, as I read Section 3410, the distributor25 must file monthly reports with the State describing the17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I go back to one factualthat?  Apart from legal incidence, somebodyearlier that the tax would not necessarily be￼1 amount of tax it's drawn down at the rack when it takes2 the -- unloads fuel into its trucks. And it's responsible3 monthly --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that a surrogate for5 sale to the -- well, I guess what I'm getting at, the tax6 apparently is not payable when the distributor receives7 the fuel, but only when the distributor transfers the fuel8 to a retailer.9MR. OLSON: No. I --JUSTICE SOUTER: No?MR. OLSON: That's not my understanding. The -- -- the incidence -- or the occasion for the10 1112 it is not13 payment of the tax isn't a sale to a retailer. You'd have14 -- I can imagine the practicalities of that would drive15 everybody crazy. The distributor --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why would he be drawing17 it down, except to sell --18 MR. OLSON: Well, of course -- of course, the19 distributor is drawing it down to sell fuel to gasoline20 stations.21 2223 involved,24 that the distributor files a25 much fuel is -- it receives.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah.MR. OLSON:  It maythere may be other-- there may be some storageoccasions.  But the fact ismonthly report describing how￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, in terms of the2 text of the statute that is -- the incidence is on the3 distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this4 language -- and it appears in a few places -- "the tax is5 hereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery." What does6 -- what does that mean, that the tax is imposed on the7 use, sale, or delivery?"8 MR. OLSON: Well, this is -- this is an effort9 by the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be10 used in Kansas, by and large -- there's always going to be11 exceptions -- fuel that is used, by and large, in Kansas12 on the roads of Kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that13 those roads can be built and maintained. Now, how shall14 we, mechanically, impose and collect that tax? We will do15 it on the first receipt by the distributor.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean, Mr. Olson,17 that the tax that the -- the fuel, rather, that's sold to18 the United States Government, later, out-of-State, when is19 the credit for the sales out-of-State made? Is that made20 at the time of the initial delivery, or is -- do they ask21 for a refund a month later?22 MR. OLSON: I don't23 JUSTICE STEVENS: I24 MR. OLSON: I don't25 Justice --19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005know the answer. couldn't tell from the -- know the answer to that,￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that might be a2 way of identifying whether the term "legal incidence"3 really has any significance.4 MR. OLSON: Well, I would say that the -- that5 if the -- this Court's prior decisions have any consistent6 meaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the7 tax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like8 we all do when we file our tax returns, the legal9 incidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers. The taxpayer10 here is the distributor. The statute says so. The way11 the statute works --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: I, sort of, take "legal13 incidence" to mean the duty to pay the tax. And I'm just14 wondering whether -- when fuel is sold to a distributor15 that the -- I mean, the distributor knows the fuel is16 going to be resold to the United States -- does he have an17 exemption from the tax, because he knows what's going to18 happen to it, or does he have to pay the tax, or accept19 the obligation to pay the tax, and then --20 MR. OLSON: I think --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- subtract, later on?22 MR. OLSON: -- I think, but I can't represent to23 you know that I know for sure, that that is an accounting24 process that takes place. Because these are transactions25 -- thousands of transactions that are taking place all of20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the time. Kansas also has a practical reason for imposing2 this tax on the distributors. There are X number of3 distributors. You can imagine how many times X there4 might be retailers and how many different disputes and so5 forth.6 The point -- one of the points that this Court7 has repeated made in connection with tax cases, and inter-8 sovereign immunity issues with respect to tax cases, is9 vitally important that there be certainty, predictability,10 and some understanding of fixed events with respect to11 taxation. States can't be engaged in litigation12 constantly, depending upon how many casino customers were13 here, how many people bought this gasoline, how many14 people bought that gasoline the next month, and how much15 did the tribe charge for the gasoline on its reservation.16 That kind of balancing process makes no sense whatsoever,17 and it -- and it sentences the States to litigation, and18 this Court to repeated decisions, based upon specific19 facts. That's why, we submit, that although the balancing20 is overwhelmingly in favor of the State, because it's a21 tax for gas that will enable someone to drive on roads22 that the State has to pay for, that, in this situation,23 one balancing test makes little sense. It simply invites24 litigation --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, you mentioned 21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Section 3410. Where does that appear on --2 MR. OLSON: Well --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't find it4 MR. OLSON: -- I was not able to5 either, in the briefs. It's -- the Kansas6 it's in the Kansas statutes, of course, but I couldn't7 find it set out verbatim in the -- in the briefs. I8 suspect it's in there someplace, but I couldn't find it9 when I was looking.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I couldn't either.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- could we go back --13 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- excuse me.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to the question that15 Justice Souter raised at the outset? Because I'm really16 puzzled. This is the picture I have of the case. And17 please tell me where it's wrong.18 Two jurisdictions, both with authority to impose19 a tax, the State and the tribe. So, if the other weren't20 taxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can21 tax and the State can tax. But the two can't coexist,22 because the consumer's not going to pay the price. So,23 only one can. And the issue is, which one dominates, and24 which is one is subordinate? But you have unquestionable25 authority to tax in both. And I thought it was clear that22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005in anybody's -- find it,-- it's the --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the two taxes did -- this is not a case where the tribecan impose a tax, the State can im- -- oppose.  I read thebriefs to accept that the tribe tax -- couldn't put itstax on top of the State tax.MR. OLSON: The -- it's a matter of economics, Justice Ginsburg, just as your question suggests. The tribe would not -- would like to be able to market tax- free fuel at its non-regulated casino. It would -- probably would like -- and if this case is decided against the State, it would probably not like to pay the tax on the -- on the car that brings the patron --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But not tax-free.  I mean,the -- a big thing that was made in this case was that,unlike the cigarette sales in the smoke shops, the tribeis not trying to market a tax exemption.  It is putting onits own tax, which will cost the customer, in the end, thesame as if there had been a State tax.MR. OLSON: Well, it wouldn't have to use a tax to do that. It owns the station. It would --itself?--JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who is it taxing?  Is it taxingMR. OLSON: It's --JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the tribe sells the gasMR. OLSON: That's -- 23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- doesn't it?          MR. OLSON:  -- precisely the point, that thetribe would probably not like to pay the taxes that arepaid by the distributor or the refiner or the person thatbrings the fuel -- the petroleum product out of theground.  What it -- what it simply means is, the marginbetween the cost and the sale, that's what the tribe wouldlike.  It's perfectly understandable.  But it would liketo have that and -- that tax -- and I'd like to save thebalance of my time for rebuttal -- but that tax isoverwhelmingly used on the roads of Kansas -- overwhelmingused on the roads of Kansas -- which are paid for, built,and maintained with the revenue produced by that taxation.That's what it's for.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Olson.          Mr. Gershengorn.ORAL ARGUMENT OF       ON BEHALFMR. GERSHENGORN:IAN HEATH GERSHENGORNOF RESPONDENT Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In the tribe's view, the State's defense of itstax today depends on a tax that does not exist.  Twodistinct sovereigns have imposed fuel taxes here.  ThePrairie Band Potawatomi Nation has imposed a tribal tax ona tribal station operating on tribal trust land.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it collecting that tax? MR. GERSHENGORN: It is, Your Honor. The -- JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what's its gripe? Itwants a bigger profit? It wants to increase -- MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor --               JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- the taxation?MR. GERSHENGORN: -- the record is clear that the two taxes cannot coexist in the long run, because it would price the --JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if --MR. GERSHENGORN: -- price the --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if the tribe is collecting     -- it's assuming that -- if the tribe is collecting its     tax, and it does not have a claim to greater taxation or     greater profit, then how is its sovereign right as a     taxing authority being interfered with?               MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, the tribe is being     forced right now to subsidize the sales at the station at     a loss, which it's doing for the balance of this     litigation.JUSTICE SOUTER: Loss of profit --MR. GERSHENGORN: But the --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- as an entrepreneur.MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the tribe -- thetribe is --25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, isn't -- I mean, isn'tthat necessarily the case?  If it's collecting all of itstax, then what it's complaining about is that it's gettingless profit as the -- as the retailer.MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, that's correct, at the moment --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Then is that anissue that we should consider on a question of preemptionwhich arises from the tribe's assertion of sovereignty?MR. GERSHENGORN: I think it is, Your Honor, because the tribe should not be put to the choice, as a sovereign, where it's running a tribal business, of choosing between -- of generating revenues by the tax versus generating revenues by the profit. There is no --JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in other words --MR. GERSHENGORN: -- suggestion, Your Honor -- JUSTICE SOUTER: -- should we, in effect, saythere is no distinction between the tribe's position assovereign and the tribe's position as retail gasoline-seller.MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think, in that situation, that the two are very similar, in the same way when a State sells at a State liquor store --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, they're similar, becauseit -- ultimately, it's all going into the same pocket.  We26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 realize that. But, unless there is a claim that its2 taxing authority, as such, is being threatened or3 interfered with, I don't quite see why a preemption theory4 that rests upon tribal sovereignty has any place in the5 analysis.6 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because, Your Honor, the -- it7 is exactly the tribal taxing authority that interfered.8 It's a -- it's quite a strange form of taxing authority9 that says you can tax the -- you can tax the station, but10 then -- but then essentially have to operate the station11 at a loss. That's not --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not operating at a13 loss.14 JUSTICE BREYER: What's strange about it? I15 mean, every upstream tax, as Mr. Olson said, raises the16 price of goods and services. And it's harder to retail17 them, because they cost more. So, that's true of every18 single good sold on the reservation. So I take it your19202122 claim must -- and, of course, it may or may not be true 2324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40027Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005￼1 that the tribe can put a tax on that.

GERSHENGORN: Your Honor --JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't that so?MR. GERSHENGORN: Because that does not describethe tax that's at issue here. The tax at issue here is imposed on the sale or delivery of fuel to the tribe on the reservation, and that is plain --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, isn't it -- but they say no, that it's imposed on the delivery to the distributor --MR. GERSHENGORN: And --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of fuel.MR. GERSHENGORN: -- and that, Your Honor, isnot correct.  What they have done is conflate twoconcepts,the incidence of the tax --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it's what the --MR. GERSHENGORN: -- and the --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- statute says.MR. GERSHENGORN: I -- with respect, Your Honor,29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 I don't think it is what the statute says. The statute2 says, in 3408, "a tax per gallon is hereby imposed on the3 use, sale, or delivery of fuel." It does not say "the4 receipt of fuel." "The distributor" is defined as5 somebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers fuel.6 All of the critical exemptions in the statutes are based7 on the distributor's subsequent sale or delivery of fuel8 to the United States, out-of-State, the Federal contract9 --10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's just a11 subsequent deduction. I mean, if we get income, we're12 taxed on it. If we make a charitable contribution, we get13 a deduction. But that doesn't mean we don't have to pay14 and are subject to the income tax.15 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, this would be a16 very different case if the State had -- if the legislature17 had passed a tax that said, "This is a tax on receipt,"18 and we were trying to argue that these -- that somehow19 these exemptions made it not a tax on receipt. But the20 legislature has said it is a tax on the "use, sale, or21 delivery." And if I could point to two provisions that I22 think make this crystal clear, that it is not a tax on23 receipt, but on the subsequent use, sale, or delivery.24 The first is 3417, which provides --25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is --30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- and that is --2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where is it?3 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- at 10(a) in the appendix,45 has received the fuel, if he subsequently loses the fuel6 -- has it lost or burned -- gets a refund of the tax, if7 it's -- if that happens before he uses, sells, or8 delivers.9CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that --MR. GERSHENGORN: The other thing that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- works with the income10 1112 tax, too.13 It turns out you were subject to the tax, but you don't14 have to pay it, because you get a deduction. But that15 doesn't mean you're not subject to it in the first place.16 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, there are -- there17 is literally nothing in the statute except for the18 incidence provision, which is what the State relies on,19 that makes this a tax on receipt. And, if I could, in20 Central --21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we ought to know, because22 they've been -- haven't they had this for a while? So,23 there must be a dealer somewhere who's not on the24 reservation -- he's a distributor -- somebody delivered to25 him a thousand gallons, and it's sitting there in his31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005You have casualty losses and things like that.￼1 tank. Doe he have to pay the tax, or doesn't he?2 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I don't -- I think3 that you're -- that he would pay the tax in that instance4 --5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if he would --6 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- but I don't think --7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- pay the tax, then it8 --9 MR. GERSHENGORN: I don't think so --10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- on his --11 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- Your Honor.12 JUSTICE BREYER: -- redistribution.13 MR. GERSHENGORN: I don't think so, Your14 JUSTICE BREYER: He is -- sorry -- if --15 like to ask the question.16 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.17 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- and you can say why this18 is wrong -- if he gets a thousand gallons from whoever --19 Exxon or somebody -- and he puts it in the tank, and he20 hasn't sold it, and he has to pay the tax, then it would21 seem to me to be a sale on the distribution to him, not22 the sale on his distribution to somebody else. Now, why23 is that wrong?24 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because -- two reasons, Your25 Honor -- in the real world, what happens is the32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005is notHonor. I'd￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425distributor picks up the fuel at the rack and delivers it to the retailer. If the -- if the distributor takes the fuel and holds it, he's not a distributor under the statute. A distributor is somebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers. That's in -- on page 2(a) of the red brief, Your Honor. So that --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, now you're telling mesomething different from what I understood.  I thought yousaid it probably has happened in the history of this tax--MR. GERSHENGORN: I --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that a distributor picked upa gallon of fuel, held it, and has not yet redistributedit.  So, you're saying that's never happened.MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I'm not aware of that happening. But what I would say -- the point that I would like to --          JUSTICE BREYER:  If I'm certain about what thetax is on, what should we do?  Dismiss the case or send itto the -- ask a question, or what?          MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think that thisCourt can decide this question based on what the face ofthe statute is -- itself says.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we can -- MR. GERSHENGORN: No court --33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think we can decide it on2 the basis that we know that when the distributor puts --3 delivers gas to the gas station, it's not instantly sold.4 I mean, even we know that.5 MR. GERSHENGORN: No, Your Honor -- that's6 correct, Your Honor. But the statute provides that the7 tax is on the sale by the distributor to the tribe on its8 reservation. It is exactly like what happened in Central9 Machinery. In Central Machinery, the incidence of the tax10 was indisputably on the off-reservation seller. This11 Court, nevertheless, said, correctly, that the taxable12 event, the thing that was being taxed, was the sale of13 tractors to the tribe on the reservation --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the statute says15 --16 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- that was, therefore,17 preempted.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the statute says it's19 a tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the20 first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and21 that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.22 MR. GERSHENGORN: With respect, Your Honor, what23 part (c) says, which is what you're reading from, it says,24 "the incidence of the tax is imposed on the distributor of25 first receipt." That is the "who." That is not the34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 "what." The "what" is in -- is in 79-3408(a), and it is2 clearly imposed on the use, sale, or delivery of the fuel.3 If I could, another provision of the statute4 that also --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But nobody -- but it's6 not sold -- it's not taxed twice. If it's sold to a7 distributor, that distributor has to pay the tax. The8 distributor then sells it to someone else. That someone9 else doesn't have to pay the tax.10 MR. GERSHENGORN: That's right, Your Honor. But11 the question is, What exactly is the State purporting to12 tax? This is a situation in which the State is not being13 unambiguous -- is being unambiguous about what it's14 taxing.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what -- perhaps the16 State expresses it that way just to cover some people who17 get their gas illegally, and they would say the tax is18 still due, even if you haven't gotten your gas from a19 distributor who has paid the State tax. Wouldn't that20 suffice for why the court imposes the tax on the use,21 sale, or delivery? Use, sale, or delivery.22 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think the term23 "use" is the distributor's use. The scheme that Kansas24 has set up is a sensible one. It is, the distributor gets25 the tax and then has three choices. It can use it, sell35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 it, or deliver it. And if the distributor -- if the2 distributor is -- hasn't done one of those things, then3 it's -- then it -- then the distributor can be made liable4 for any tax increases that have -- that happen while the5 distributor is holding the tax. And so, in our view, and6 in every court that we're aware of's view -- tenth circuit7 didn't decide this case on the assumption that this was a8 tax on receipt of fuel off the reservation. What the9 tenth circuit said was that Kansas is now attempting to10 collect its tax for the first time, a tax on motor fuel11 distributed to Indian lands. It is, again, the same thing12 --13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose you're14 right. Can you answer my first question? Can you even15 remember it? I'll summarize. On your assumption. Look,16 the Indians, if there is a tax -- they have a retail shop17 or they have things on the reservation, they go buy them18 -- Kansas can't impose a tax on what goes on, on the19 reservation. We go through the balance. But they20 certainly could impose a tax on the department store in21 Kansas City, couldn't they?22 MR. GERSHENGORN: That's right.23 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, the Indian then goes to24 the department store and buys it. He has to pay the tax,25 doesn't he?36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GERSHENGORN:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now what he does, hesays, "Call up and" -- he says, "Please deliver it."  Nowhe doesn't have to pay the tax?          MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, the answer is:that's correct, and that's exactly what happens in thecommerce clause when a person from Virginia buys somethingfrom Illinois and has it delivered to himself in Virginia.They don't pay the sales tax.JUSTICE BREYER: Is the commerce constitutionally --          MR. GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor, underinterstate sales tax.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well --MR. GERSHENGORN: It's the same situation -- JUSTICE BREYER: -- we're now talking Federalrules.  Go ahead.          MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry.  It was -- it's thesame situation there.  The question is, Where does therelevant sale take place?  And it takes place -- in theVirginia/Illinois situation, the sale takes place inVirginia, which is why you don't pay Illinois sales tax,though you may pay Virginia use tax.  It would be the samething in the tribal situation.  The sale in that place,just like the sale in Central Machinery, takes place on37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the reservation. And what this Court said, in Central2 Machinery, is that a sale to a tribe of goods on the3 reservation is -- cannot be taxed by the State. And,4 indeed, because this tax is on the sale on the5 reservation, the broader balancing principles apply. The6 tribe here has imposed the -- its tax on a tribal station,7 on a tribal land, right where this Court has said its8 tribal taxing authority is strongest, and has dedicated9 those revenues to improving the miles of dirt and gravel10 road on the reservation.11 12 13 1415 about the16 available17 distributor, or does he have to, in effect, claim a credit18 later on?JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it relevant --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you what the -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the balancing test -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask you a question Federal exemption? In your view, is that made at the time of the initial purchase by the19 MR. GERSHENGORN: It -- that way it works, in20 practice, Your Honor, is -- and their form is in the back21 of the red brief -- is that the distributor writes down22 the number of gallons received, and writes down the number23 of gallons sold to the United States,24 pays the tax on the net, so that it's25 done at the -- at the same time.38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOnets that out, and-- it's essentiallyWashington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that he -- his obligation2 to sell the gas is -- arises at the same time as his3 purchase.4 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm not sure his obligation to5 do so, but the form is due on the 25th of the month -- of6 the next month. And so --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it shows both what they8 resell to the United States and what they acquired.9 MR. GERSHENGORN: Correct, Your Honor. It shows10 gallons received, gallons exported, gallons sold to the11 United States.1213 question,14 exemption15 States is1617 to that is yes, under our theory of the case, but no,18 under their theory of the case. The exemption to the19 United States --20212223 isn't it? 2425JUSTICE STEVENS:  And let me ask you thistoo, on that subject.  Do you think that thethat the State allows for resales to the Unitedconstitutionally compelled?MR. GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I think the answerJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's no under our -- MR. GERSHENGORN: -- is constitutionally -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- our precedent, I think,MR. GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry?JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's no, under our precedent.39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GERSHENGORN: Well, it depends, Your Honor,2 on whether the legal incidence is on the United States or3 whether the incidence is on the seller. Under this --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, on that --5 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- Court's precedence --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- on the legal incidence of7 the tax, we suggested, in the Chickasaw Nation case, that8 a tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence9 would be dispositive. So, why don't we read the statute10 and say the incidence is on the distributor, and that's11 the end of it?12 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because, Your Honor, I don't13 think that's what this Court's cases say. I think what14 this Court's --15161718 Chickasaw 192021 was imposed on the tribe, we would take the State at its22 word. It said it's taxing the tribe. If the State put23 the tax on a non-Indian, then there would be balancing.24 And that's what Chickasaw --25 MR. GERSHENGORN: That's my understanding, as40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I thought that's -- MR. GERSHENGORN: -- cases say --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- what we suggested in Nation.MR. GERSHENGORN: I think --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Chickasaw said when the tax￼1 well. And this Court has always held it's a Federal2 question where legal incidence lies, and has not deferred3 -- has given --4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if balancing --5 MR. GERSHENGORN: But if I --6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then how do you come out?7 Because what they're saying is, "Okay, balance. Fine.8 You want to balance? Here's how you balance."9 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor?10 JUSTICE BREYER: On the one hand, the Indians11 have to pay the tax. Okay, that's true. And it's harder12 for them to impose their own tax. That's true of every13 upstream tax. And it goes for roads that they use all the14 time. And they just have a one-and-a-half mile -- and why15 shouldn't they be treated every -- like everybody else,16 when they're going to use the roads the tax pays for? So,17 the balancing works in their favor. Now, what's your18 response?19 MR. GERSHENGORN: That the -- Your Honor, we20 disagree with that at every level. This -- the tribal tax21 is addressed to a specific road -- road problem that the22 Federal Government has identified and addressed in the23 Reservation Road Program. The reservation roads are in24 abysmal shape, as the Federal Government has recognized.25 More than 70 percent are in poor shape, poor condition.41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The fatality rate is four times the national average. And2 the tribe is using those revenues to fix -- advance that3 particular Federal interest, which is reflected in Federal4 statutes and in the Federal regulatory scheme.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should all of that make a6 difference? You make a big point in the briefing, "Well,7 you're not marketing the exemption, you're taxing, you're8 using" -- if the -- if the tribe does have the sovereign9 right to tax or not to tax, why can't it use it not to tax10 at all and say, "We're giving" -- why is there a11 presumption in favor of imposing taxes? Why can't the12 tribe say, "We're not going to tax you if you come to the13 reservation. Come on in and buy our gas. No tax"?14 MR. GERSHENGORN: This --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't -- why isn't that16 part of the tribal sovereign right?17 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because18 in Colville -- and we don't dispute19 tribe is marketing an exemption, it20 there are no Federal and tribal interests implicated. And21 we're not challenging that here. What this Court has said22 is that when a tribe is generating real value on the23 reservation so that it has created a market, as this tribe24 has, to draw people onto the reservation and can sell its25 fuel at market value, it has a sovereign right and42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005this Court has held, here -- that when the has no -- it has no --￼1 interest in taxing that -- in imposing a tax that the2 State can't interfere with. And the State here has3 accommodated --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Who is -- who is the tribe5 taxing? Is the tribe taxing the purchaser of the gas?

Pennsylvania imposes a tax on23 State-sold liquor. North Carolina does it. All the24 State-run liquor stores are subject to a State-imposed25 tax. But --43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, did Iunderstand your earlier discussion, about the departmentstore, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck,and they picked up the fuel and then brought it back,that, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, eventhough the economic incidence and effect is going to bethe same?MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, at that point, Central Machinery wouldn't apply. I think that would be a closer case for the balancing, in that situation. The -- so, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't concede that. But, in this case, it's much stronger, because the tax is on the reservation.          If I could also just point to one thing thatJustice Breyer raised about the -- about the exemptionsfor other States.  What this -- what Kansas has done isprovide an exemption for every other sovereign that'simplicated -- for other States, for other countries, for--JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it --MR. GERSHENGORN: -- the United States -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- constitutionally compelledto do so?          MR. GERSHENGORN:  It's -- it is, Your Honor, inthis sense. It comes in, in two situations. First, it is 44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- the Constitution and the Federal preemption doctrine2 prohibit discrimination. And so, it is, in that sense.3 But it also goes to the strength of the State interest4 here. The State has not only -- has accommodated the out-5 of-State interest, it has also accommodated the in-State6 Government interests, other than the tribe. It gives 307 to 40 percent of the fuel revenues to counties and to8 cities for roads. Every other sovereign is accommodated9 here except for the tribe, and we think that's exactly10 what Federal law prohibits and why the strength of the11 tribal interest here, and the tribe's interest in imposing12 the tax to fix reservation roads, to advance that Federal13 interest, 141516is exactly what deserves protection. JUSTICE SCALIA: Cities and counties -- JUSTICE STEVENS: But your --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- aren't sovereign. JUSTICE STEVENS: -- your claim wouldn't if they decided to tax all these other1718 disappear19 sovereigns.20 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your claim, as a tribe, would22 not disappear if they decided to become nondiscriminatory23 and tax all of the sales.24 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, it wouldn't25 disappear, but it might alter the -- it would alter the45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 balance. If the -- what is troubling here is that the2 State has asserted a right in predictability, but the3 State's right in predictability is only coming at the4 expense of a refusal to accommodate the tribal interests5 in the say way it accommodates every other sovereign. And6 so, we do think that that goes to the strength of the7 State's interest here, and to the State -- the strength of8 the -- of the State's assertion of its tax.9 JUSTICE SOUTER: And your view10 that it was -- that it was indicative of11 MR. GERSHENGORN: I think it --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I thought13 stronger argument, because the -- you're14 the State has only the most trivial interest in the amount15 of taxation it would get here." That would be equally16 true whether it forgives taxes that -- on fuel that goes17 to the United States or not. But the discrimination18 point, if it's a fair one, would be the same.19 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think -- that's20 correct, and we've made both arguments, that it's a --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it would matter.22 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- that the discrimination is23 a freestanding reason that, even under an express24 preemption test like the State has articulated, we would25 prevail and that --46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005generally wasdiscrimination.that was thesaying, "Look,￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: All the other sovereigns you2 mentioned do not consume the gas -- or the gas sold to3 them is not consumed primarily on the roads of this State,4 except for cities and counties, which aren't sovereigns.5 I mean, they simply aren't sovereign. That's the State,6 itself. They're subdivisions of the State. So, it's7 making exemptions for its own -- its own State, plus8 exemptions for sovereigns, where the gas sold to those9 sovereigns probably will not be used primarily on the10 roads of this State.111213 don't see 14151617181920 please the Court:21 The tribe here has imposed a tribal tax on sales22 at a tribal business on the tribe's own reservation on23 tribal land.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.Mr. Kneedler.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF KNEEDLER    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATESMR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is it being interfered with?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And, as to that question, Iwould point the Court to page 142 of the joint appendix,or page 12 of the petition appendix, in which the Courtdiscusses the expert opinion that the tribe introducedinto the record.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, that expert opinion isthat, as an economic matter, you can't collect both.MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, he says --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  You can't impose both.  But thetribe is still imposing its tax, and it's getting everypenny that it -- that it purports to impose.MR. KNEEDLER: But it is operating at a loss. As I understand it, the tribe has chosen to subsidize --JUSTICE SOUTER: Is --MR. KNEEDLER: -- out of --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- is that --MR. KNEEDLER: -- revenues.JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in the record?MR. KNEEDLER: That is my understanding ofwhat's happening. That's not in the record. What is in the record --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let's assume -- let's assumethat is true.  What difference does that make to ananalysis based on a preemption theory which is supposed to48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 take account of tribal sovereignty? The sovereign act is2 not selling gas, it's taxing. They are taxing. They're3 getting everything they want under their tax statute.4 Where, then, is there a basis for a preemption --5 MR. KNEEDLER: I think, for example, in this6 Court's decision in Colville, where the Court stressed7 there that the Court was marketing an exemption from State8 taxation; that portion of the analysis of the Court there9 did not turn on whether the tribe was imposing its own10 tax. It turned --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I mean, it was --12 MR. KNEEDLER: -- it turned on economic --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- an entirely separate -- an14 entirely separate rationale. It was saying the tribe is15 getting this tremendous advantage by -- or wants this16 tremendous advantage -- by marketing the exemption.17 MR. KNEEDLER: But the flip side of that in18 Colville was that if the -- if the tribe, in that case,19 had been selling to people who would have been on the20 reservation anyway -- in other words had not come onto the21 reservation to take -- just to take advantage of an22 exemption from State taxation -- but would have been on23 the reservation anyway, the Court specifically24 contemplated, in that situation, that the tax might well25 be preempted, because it would be interfering --49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe -- maybe it2 contemplated that, and maybe it simply contemplated that3 that particular -- that particular argument against it --4 i.e., that it was simply selling a tax exemption -- would5 not have been an argument against it. But it doesn't6 follow, from that, that the tribe would necessarily have7 had a winning argument on a preemption theory.8 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but we -- but we believe it9 is a winning argument. I think the fair reading of10 Colville is that the Court would have seen that as quite11 different.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's a winning -- of13 course it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in14 fact, it's an interference -- look, every upstream tax15 raises the price of goods and services. Every upstream16 tax -- indeed, every tax in the world -- makes it harder17 to sell the product. So, every tax makes it harder for18 the tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody19 else. Now, if that's the basis for saying it's an20 interference, then every tax is an interference. And I21 don't see how that could be.22 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. This is -- this is not23 just any upstream tax, and it -- and the theory here is24 not based on economic impact.25 JUSTICE BREYER: But, so far, your theory is 50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425based on economics, as I've heard it. MR. KNEEDLER: No --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But if it isn't, I would liketo know what it is.MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Under the -- first of all, in our -- it is our position that, under the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in Kaul, which should get deference in terms of understanding operative incidence of the State tax. The incidence of the tax is, in fact, on the retailer. And the court there found it critical --JUSTICE BREYER: The incidence of the tax --MR. KNEEDLER: The legal incidence --JUSTICE BREYER: Oh.MR. KNEEDLER: -- was -- is on the retail -- JUSTICE BREYER: That's very surprising. When Iread the statute, it doesn't have one word about the retailer being obliged to pay --MR. KNEEDLER: And --JUSTICE BREYER: -- anything.MR. KNEEDLER: As we read the Kansas SupremeCourt's decision, it's not without ambiguity, but we believe the better reading of that -- of that decision is that, as a matter of legislative intent, the incidence of the tax, who is ultimately going to pay the tax --JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's -- 51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: -- is on the retailer.2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the legal incidence of the3 tax, I would think their side would win, in my mind. Now4 suppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not5 on that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.6 MR. KNEEDLER: That would tell -- that would7 tell you -- I'm sorry --8 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, and if we get9 into balancing, which I don't know, what is to be said in10 favor of the Indian side? It sounded to me as if it's11 harder for them to tax. So, I'm thinking, well, that's12 true of every tax. And then, put it on something else.13 Put it on the tires. Put it on anything else, if you can.14 It'll be harder for them to tax non-Indians. But I didn't15 know they had a Federal right to tax the non-Indians.16 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, they do. And, again, this17 is the situation contemplated in Colville. It's analogous18 to what this Court said in Cabazon with respect to the19 gambling facility, where the tribe has introduced on-20 reservation value. And in Colville, the court21 contemplated if the tribe puts a service station and sells22 to people who would be there anyway, that is on-23 reservation value; they are not simply marketing a tax24 exemption and drawing people in by virtue of a tax25 exemption.52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 But, beyond that, just because -- if the Court2 concludes that the incidence of the tax is on the3 distributor, notwithstanding the Kansas Supreme Court's4 decision, the subject matter of the tax, the "what is5 being taxed," is the sale or distribution, and that is a6 sale between the distributor and the retailer. That is7 clearly --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't it the9 sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and10 the distributor?11 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- because if you look in -- it12 becomes particularly clear if you look at the form that is13 at the back of the respondent's brief, but we also believe14 it's clear from the -- from the provisions of the statute15 that are on page 8(a) of the brief. One that hasn't been16 discussed, for example, is exemption D5 -- excuse me --17 the exception for deliveries to other distributors. In18 that -- in that situation, there is no tax. And, in fact,19 the form, on page 19(a), makes it clear that any sales by20 one distributor to another are automatically exempted and21 not counted in the computation at all.22 So, distributor-to-distributor taxes are23 exempted. And this Court, in the Chickasaw case, said24 that's very instructive, that the incidence of the tax is25 on the retailer. Whether or not the incidence is there,53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the transaction --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me exempting3 distributor-to-distributor taxes just means that only one4 distributor has to pay.5 MR. KNEEDLER: Only one distributor has to pay,6 but it means that a sale between the first distributor and7 the second distributor, for example, is not taxed.89 was a taxJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's because there on the first sale to the first distributor. And this? Supposing --MR. KNEEDLER: Actually, there is not. The tax last distributor, with respect to his sale to the retailer.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but that's because when a10 may I ask 1112 is on the13 the -- to1415 distributor sells to another distributor, he is not16 acting, for purposes of that sale, as a distributor.17 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you sell to another19 distributor, you're not being --20 MR. KNEEDLER: That makes -- that makes my21 point, that the -- that the statute, in applying to any22 use, delivery, or sale, the sale at issue is the sale that23 ultimately comes from a distributor to a retailer. And,24 under this Court's decisions in Central Arizona Machinery25 and the Bracker case, a sale by a -- by someone residing54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 off the reservation, but where the sale takes place on the2 reservation, as this one clearly does -- the gasoline3 that's delivered there -- that is absolutely preempted4 under Central Arizona Machinery and the Indian Trader5 Statutes, because you --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But none of this -- none7 of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it? I8 mean, they didn't care where the incidence was. They just9 went right into the balancing, right?10 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, that's true. And if --11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think that was12 wrong.13 MR. KNEEDLER: We think the court was wrong to14 conclude that the incidence was on the -- was on the15 distributor. And if the Court has a question about that,16 it could remand to certify that question to the Kansas17 Supreme Court to clear it up, any ambiguity after Kaul.18 But, even on the tenth circuit's own way of approaching19 it, we believe that it was then correct, because it20 properly applied this Court's approach of looking at the21 particular context of the Federal, State, and tribal22 interests. And here, there are very powerful tribal23 interests in maintaining --24 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the one other -- the25 interest other than the interest on being able to tax an55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425item that an upstream tax prevents you from doing becauseof the economics?MR. KNEEDLER: It is the very same --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that the only one, or arethere other ones?MR. KNEEDLER: -- it's the very same interest that the State is asserting, which is the interest to impose a fuel tax in order to --JUSTICE BREYER: I've got the -- --MR.

KNEEDLER: We don't think it does. Under10 the Colville's decision, if the State is not just -- or11 the tribe is not just marketing an exemption from State12 taxation, we think that the tribe -- that the State tax is13 preempted there, as well.

But here, the tribe is asserting both a commercial interest -- selling at profit; and also a sovereign interest -- in taxing. And where you have a tribe asserting both --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why isn't that sovereigninterest in not taxing?          MR. KNEEDLER:  It could.

OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the Supreme Court's characterization of this as being --MR. OLSON: The Kaul --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.MR. OLSON: -- Kaul case? I read -- I don'tthink the Kansas Supreme Court could have been any moreclear.  It said the legislature amended the legislation toclarify where the incidence of taxation falls.  Itprovided that the incidence of the tax falls on the58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 distributor. Then, in Victa, in connection with the2 standing issue, because economic burden fell on the3 retailers, it found that the retailers and -- those other4 retailers had standing.5 Kansas could not have been more clear. In6 Section 3401(f)(3), it defines a "distributor" as someone7 who receives the product. In 3408(c), it's -- taxes the8 distributor on the first receipt of the tax. In 3410, it9 again says it's on the distributor. Two district courts10 and two courts of appeals found that the legal incidence11 of the tax was on the distributor. The Kansas Supreme12 Court said the same thing, the distributor is liable for13 the tax, pays the tax. The retailer has no liability for14 the tax. What in the world can Kansas do to make it15 clearer?16 Now, the Central Machinery case that's -- that17 my opponents have been speaking about is a case that was18 decided under the Indian Trader Statutes with respect to19 the trading with the Indians, with respect to Central20 Machinery case, was -- over tractors sold on the21 reservation for use on the reservation. It fell within22 the scope of the Indian Trader Statute. But this Court23 has made clear, in a number of cases, the Indian Trader24 Statutes would not remotely apply.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it Kansas has not59Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 indicted the distributor for failing to register under the2 Indian Trading Statute.34 mentioned5 until the6 Government decided to discuss that point.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there usually two8 incidents?

That is what the statute says.14 It is as plain --15 16 1718 lightning19 retailer,2021 -- one of22 loss or something that -- but it's limited. The23 liability, nonetheless, exists on the distributor.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any incidents in25 which the distributor would pay the tax if he was not ableJUSTICE STEVENS: But if the fuel --MR. OLSON: -- as it could be.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- were destroyed by flood or or something like -- before it was resold to the there would be no tax --MR. OLSON: There's an exemption for losses like the Court's questions with respect to a casualty60Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to resell it to somebody else?2 MR. OLSON: I think that -- I think the reading3 of the statute is plain. If the distributor took the4 fuel, kept it, decided to warehouse it because the costs5 are going up or something like that, it would still have6 to pay the tax, because the tax is on the receipt by the7 distributor.8 In answer to your question, Justice Stevens,9 Would those other exemptions, the United States Government10 be required by the Constitution, or the other States? No,11 not under this Court's decision in the Blaze case, which,12 as I understood it, was unanimous. The Fresno case, U.S.13 vs. New Mexico, it's not a tax on the United States. It's14 -- or an agency of the United States. So they wouldn't be15 required. But they make sense, because the sales to other16 States are for people that drive on other States'17 highways. The sales to the United States Government is an18 exchange for almost the same amount of money that comes19 back. So, there's a rational purpose. It's not20 discrimination.21 The tribe makes the point that it's generating22 real value and reservation value. This is fuel that's23 used in cars that are -- drive all over the State of24 Kansas. The casino is there, so people come to the25 casino. And, under Cabazon, there might be some value 61Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 added by the casino, which, by the way, is an exempt value2 created by an exemption from regulation. But the value3 for someone who puts fuel in their car is so that that car4 will then drive. And that -- cars that drive, in this5 case, drive on Kansas highways.6 This, ultimately is --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Olson.8 MR.
