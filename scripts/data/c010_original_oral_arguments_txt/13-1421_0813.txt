Caulkett, and the consolidated case.      Ms. Spinelli.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLION BEHALF OF PETITIONERMS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Respondents' position is that Section 506(d)of the Bankruptcy Code allows Chapter 7 debtors to keeptheir houses, strip their underwater mortgages, andprevent their lenders from accessing any laterappreciation in a house's value.  In Dewsnup, this Courtrejected that position with respect to partiallyunderwater mortgages and that reasoning applies withequal force to completely underwater mortgages.      Dewsnup held that Section 506(d) voids onlyliens securing disallowed claims.  It does not voidliens based on the current value of the collateral.That logic applies whether the current value of thecollateral is a million dollars, $1 or zero, asvirtually every court to address the question has held,and even the Eleventh Circuit below all but admitted.3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Outside bankruptcy, the bank would be2 entitled to have its lien stay with the property until3 foreclosure or payment in full.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the value of ­­5 of an ­­ an under ­­ completely underwater second6 mortgage? How likely is it that it will ever ­­ that7 the property will ever appreciate to the extent that it8 will have real value?9 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Ginsburg, it's quite10 likely. In these two particular cases, to be sure, the11 second liens are deeply underwater. That's not true in12 every case and there's no reason to think it's true in13 the typical case.14 We have ­­ Bank of America has many cases15 pending right now in the Eleventh Circuit. We have16 cases in which the value of the house would need to rise17 only by $4,000, where it would need to rise only by18 $5,000, and given that we're in the middle of a market19 upswing, it's very plausible and very likely that many20 of these mortgages will regain equity.21 We quote statistics in our opening brief22 that show that between 2012 and 2014, the number of23 underwater junior mortgages was cut in half from24 4.2 million to 2.1 million. So houses are coming above25 water every day.4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And what Dewsnup held is that the2 lienholder, according to the basic nonbankruptcy3 bargain, is entitled to keep its lien until payment in4 full or until a lender decides to foreclose.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do the holders of the6 second, assuming the second is partially or fully7 underwater, ever participate in negotiations with the8 property owner and with the holder of the first lien and9 say, well, if you keep the property, we'll reduce our10 junior lead ­­ lien by 50 percent? Is ­­ is there a11 negotiation dynamic that the rule that you propose would12 further?13 MS. SPINELLI: Let me be clear about this,14 Justice Kennedy, because I think this is important. In15 Chapter 7 bankruptcies, there are no such negotiations.16 Chapter 7 is very simple; the debtor turns over his17 assets. To the extent there are any nonexempt,18 non­encumbered assets, which there typically are not,19 the trustee will sell those assets, distribute the20 proceeds to creditors. The debtor then receives a21 discharge of all prepetition debt.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's just talk23 about Chapter 7 because that's what I had in mind.24 Suppose it's a close case and they're thinking of maybe25 insisting on ­­ on sale.5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Can the junior lienholder say what if ­­ I'mnot going to prevail in the sale, but I'll ­­ if youdon't sell, then I'll cut my ­­ my lien in half on thechance that it may go up?  I mean, you ­­ so youcouldn't ever have this negotiated in ­­ in a Chapter 7?MS. SPINELLI: In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy those negotiations simply don't occur. If there's nonexempt equity in the house, the trustee has to sell the house ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MS. SPINELLI:proceeds.      JUSTICE SCALIA:care, I mean, right?  I mean, his job is done once ­­once the bankruptcy is over.  If ­­ if it goes up, it'sthe homeowner who ­­ who would care.MS. SPINELLI: That's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: And he's not part of the negotiation. He's out of it.MS. SPINELLI: That's ­­ that's correct. Now, if ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. How doesthis work?

SPINELLI: The way it works, Justice Sotomayor, is that if there is non­exempt equity in the house which, of course, was not true in these two cases, the trustee will sell the house; out of those proceeds, the trustee will first satisfy the claim of the senior secured lender. If there's anything left over, it will go to the junior secured lender. If there's not, the junior lender receives nothing, and the junior lien is extinguished.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:the ­­ the finished ­­ the wrapping­up of the plan;right?MS. SPINELLI: In Chapter 7 there is no plan.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. This is before the bankruptcy is terminated.MS. SPINELLI: I think it's important to understand that Chapter 7 bankruptcies happen very quickly. A no­asset bankruptcy like this one will usually be wrapped up in 30 to 45 days. Whereas here,7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 there's no equity in the property to be distributed to2 creditors, and there are no other non­exempt assets,3 there's really not very much for the trustee to do. The4 trustee will file a notice that the case is5 administered, and at that point, a house that's in a6 situation of these two houses, in which there is no7 non­exempt, non­encumbered value, will be abandoned to8 the debtor.9 At that point, the debtor's rights in the10 property are precisely what they were before bankruptcy.11 If the debtor is in default on his mortgage, then the12 lenders can foreclose. If the ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let me follow up to14 something Justice Kennedy ­­ many of ­­ your adversary15 plus many others, amici, have argued that if we rule in16 the way that you seek, that wholly underwater junior17 liens are going to be a holdup, and you are going to use18 it as hostage value, and they point to various19 situations in which that has occurred.20 That, to me, is a concerning policy issue,21 so explain why that's not true.22 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Sotomayor, my answer23 to that would be that's not a bankruptcy problem. There24 are not negotiations that take place in Chapter 7 as to25 which the junior lienholder could exercise any holdup8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 value.2 It's – it’s certainly may be the case that3 later on the debtor may want to negotiate a modification4 with its senior lender. That happens all the time to5 people who have been through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and6 people who have not. And to the extent there's a7 housing policy issue, I don't think that's properly8 addressed through interpretation of the bankruptcy code.9 One of the amici ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the bankruptcy11 code ­­ code wants to give debtors a fresh start.12 MS. SPINELLI: That is true.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And to the extent that14 Chapter 7 is an attempt to do that, if you're able to15 hold up that fresh start, that is the concern16 they're ­­ they're pointing to.17 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Sotomayor, the fresh18 start that's given to debtors in Chapter 7 has a19 particular nature. The nature of the fresh start in20 Chapter 7 is that the debtor surrenders all of his or21 her assets and in return gets a discharge of all22 pre­petition debt. It's never been the case that the23 Chapter 7 fresh start has encompassed an ability to24 retain property and also strip off liens on that25 property.9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 If the debtor wanted ­­ and this ­­ this2 doesn't force the debtor to stay in a house that he or3 she can't afford. If the debtor ­­ if the debtor wanted4 to, say, cure a default on his mortgage and keep the5 house, Chapter 13 is open to the debtor which permits6 curing a default on a mortgage and maintaining payments7 during the course of the plan.8 Under Chapter 7, a debtor can, if the debtor9 is in the situation of these debtors and the house has10 been abandoned back to the debtor ­­ if the debtor is11 in ­­ is current on its loans can keep the house, pay12 its mortgage going forward, and be in the same situation13 that he was prior to bankruptcy. The one thing that14 Chapter 7 gives a debtor in that situation is that it15 discharges the debtor of any personal liability for the16 mortgage debt, so the lender cannot come after the17 debtor personally. If the debtor decides that the house18 is too expensive for him to stay in, he can stop paying19 the mortgage and the only recourse that the lender then20 has is to foreclose.21 So there ­­ there certainly is an ability22 for debtors to walk away from houses that they simply23 can't afford, and there is also an ability through24 Chapter 13 to cure existing defaults and reach an25 arrangement for which the debtor can keep the house.10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Spinelli, I ­­ I2 dissented in Dewsnup, and I continue to believe that3 dissent was correct. Why should I not limit Dewsnup to 4   the facts that it involved, which is a partially 5   underwater mortgage?6 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Scalia, I don't think 7   that can be done coherently given the reasoning of 8   the Court in Dewsnup.  But what the Court held in 9   Dewsnup is that Section 506(d) ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that, but11   I think the reasoning was wrong, and ­­ and very often,12   we ­­ we adhere to a prior decision that ­­ that, on the13   facts of that case ­­ and Dewsnup did ­­ did say, you know,14   we're just limiting it to the facts of this case, and15   we're not saying what these terms mean elsewhere in the16   Bankruptcy Act.  So let's take Dewsnup at its word and17   just limit it to what it involved, which was a partially18   under ­­ underwater mortgage.  Now, why shouldn't I do19202122232425that?MS. SPINELLI: I don't believe that'slogically possible even if Dewsnup was wrongly decidedbecause Dewsnup interpreted a specific phrase in aspecific place in the code.JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. But we often limit prior decisions to their facts and don't11Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425follow their logic.MS. SPINELLI: Yes, Justice Scalia ­­ JUSTICE SCALIA: If we followed their logic,we would ­­ we would never be able to do what I'msuggesting.

SPINELLI: In this situation, we're talking about an interpretation of language in a specific place in a statute, and to do that would be to read the exact same language in the exact same place in the statute to mean different things ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, I'm just not getting through to you.

But inaddition ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is ­­ what is Hart ­­ what is the case that you just cited?MS. SPINELLI: I apologize, Justice Ginsburg.

If you have2 found any way of drawing that line, I ­­ I don't think3 there is a way ­­4 MS.

I'm saying subsist as far as partially11 underwater mortgages are concerned. The issue before us12 is whether we should extend it to totally underwater.13 Now, I thought you were going to tell me,14 you know, I feel strongly that ­­ that Dewsnup was15 wrong, but I'm not going to upset expectations. I mean,16 if banks have been, you know, lending money for second17 mortgages on the assumption that they would not be18 stripped, I mean, that's what I thought you were going19 to tell me. Oh, you know, many expectations that have20 been rested upon this ­­ this misbegotten opinion of21 Dewsnup.22 MS. SPINELLI: It's ­­ it's certainly been23 the case that since Dewsnup was decided until this24 decision by the Eleventh Circuit in 2012, it was ­­ it25 was well­established that Dewsnup applied equally to14Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE SCALIA:Yes.Official￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425completely underwater.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Spinelli­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And – and are you saying,then, that there have been substantial reliance on theDewsnup interpretation that you are supporting here bybanks that have given second mortgages all over thecountry, huge reliance that would be upset.MS.

SPINELLI: I believe that there has been reliance. I actually don't think that's the most compelling argument as to why the Court shouldn't depart from Dewsnup.      The language in Dewsnup simply can't be readto distinguish between completely and partially ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but if we could go back ­­ I mean, I kind of agree with you that it's not a very compelling argument, this reliance argument, because I find myself in the same position as Justice Scalia. I read the two Dewsnup opinions, and it seems to me that Justice Scalia clearly has the better of the argument. And then ­­15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 (Laughter.)2 JUSTICE KAGAN: And then the question is,3 what do we do about that and where do we go from there.4 And it does strike me that if ­­ you know, these are the5 most sophisticated parties that can possibly be6 imagined, Bank of America and other banks, and it seems7 to me that they would be making essentially a bet on ­­8 and they would, you know, think about all the things ­­9 what is the probability that Dewsnup will be extended to10 completely underwater mortgages.11 And presumably, they discounted all their12 various calculations in order to take into account the13 probability that another court would say, you know,14 Dewsnup is not very persuasive, and we're just not15 willing to extend it any further. And I think that's16 probably what Bank of America and other banks did, is17 they said, you know, we think there is X percent chance18 that Dewsnup will be extended and Y percent chance that19 it won't, and they made their cost and pricing20 calculations based on that calculation.21 So if that's the case, why should we worry22 about reliance?23 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Kagan, I do believe24 that banks have relied on the Dewsnup decision. As to25 whether they specifically made calculations about when16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 it would apply ­­ whether it would apply in these2 circumstances, I don't know. But I think I would go3 back to the premise of your question, which is that this4 would be extending Dewsnup. It – it wouldn't be5 extending Dewsnup. It would simply be applying Dewsnup6 to a set of facts in which the interpretation the Court7 gave in Dewsnup is equally applicable.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though Dewsnup9 itself said no, we're deciding this case only, and not10 any other. I think in ­­ in your brief, you did make11 the point that Dewsnup is now how many years old?12 MS. SPINELLI: It's almost 25 years old,13 Justice Ginsburg.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Congress could have15 changed it if it didn't like it, and Congress has16 amended the code.17 MS. SPINELLI: That's ­­ that's correct. I18 mean, Congress has amended the code substantially both19 in 1994 and in 2005. In 1994, Congress overruled or20 modified a couple of these courts' bankruptcy decisions.21 It overruled Rake v. Wade. It modified the statute in22 response to this Court's decision in Nobelman.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that proves, at most,24 that Congress liked Dewsnup as applied to partially25 underwater mortgages; isn't that right? I mean, that's17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 all it proves. They let it ­­ they let it stand. They2 did not overrule Dewsnup as far as partially underwater3 mortgages. It doesn't say anything about how they feel4 about totally underwater mortgages.5 MS. SPINELLI: Justice Scalia, there is6 simply no distinction that can be drawn between7 partially and completely underwater liens in this8 situation. Dewsnup held that a secured claim is a claim9 secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying10 collateral. That is equally applicable here.11 Likewise, I mean, the text of Section 50612 certainly draws no such distinction, so it wouldbe an theto hurt17 (Laughter.)18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:19 the notion and agree with it20 a decision that's wrong, you21 But there are factual distinctions and there are factual22 distinctions. I mean, Dewsnup may have been decided on23 a Tuesday, and this case could be decided on a Thursday,24 but you would not say, you know, we're not extending it25 ­­ you know, we're simply not going to extend it to1813 odd thing to do to vindicate14 proposition that Respondents15 JUSTICE SCALIA:16 a fellow, don't you?textualism to adoptare advancing here.You really know howAlderson Reporting Company       I mean, I understandcompletely that if you havedon't extend it in any way.JUSTICE BREYER:Is this ­­ is this right?Official￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425other cases.MS. SPINELLI: Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in thisparticular instance, I assume the difference betweenunderwater and ­­ and totally ­­ partially underwaterand totally underwater is a completely ­­ a completelyfluid one in the sense that at the start of ­­ the startof the bankruptcy ­­ I didn't think of that one.(Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was totally unintended.(Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But ­­ but the idea is that, you know, throughout a bankruptcy, you could have a mortgage that is ­­ a lien that's underwater, then totally underwater, then partially underwater. And the idea that you'd latch onto that as a distinction seems to me to be a difficult proposition .MS. SPINELLI: That's exactly right. I mean, the nonbankruptcy right of a lienholder is to retain its lien until payment in full or until foreclosure, which means that the lienholder is entitled to access any equity that may develop in the future due to appreciation of the property to secure its lien.19Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE BREYER:MS.

Under Dewsnup, the last25 years, lenders and others in the bankruptcy communityhave understand ­­ understood the way it works is thefollowing:  If you have a lien and the house is worth500,000 and your ­­ your lien is secured and it's wortha million, and they're in Chapter 7, you have a securedinterest and they're counted as a secured creditor onlyto 500,000.  As to the remaining 500,000, you're countedas an unsecured creditor, but you keep the lien.MS. SPINELLI: Right. Well, but ­­JUSTICE BREYER: And so therefore, if when they're out of bankruptcy someday or the house goes up, or whatever it is, you still have your lien. Is that right?MS. SPINELLI: That's right. And let me explain that, Justice Breyer.                             I just wanted to be sure itwas right, but if you'd like to explain it further, do.MS. SPINELLI: It ­­ it is right, and I ­­ and I would, if I might. Section 506(a) bifurcates under secured claims into a secured portion and an unsecured portion, and that determines the distribution that a creditor can get from the estate.20Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Now, I want to be clear that nothing in theway this Court reads 506(d) will affect that.  That isgoing to be true no matter what.  What Dewsnup said isthat Section 506(d) does not refer back to thatbifurcation in 506(a).  Rather, it uses the word"secured" in the ordinary English and ordinary legalmeaning of secured by a lien with recourse to theunderlying collateral.  And in that situation, giventhat reading, 506(d) only strips liens securingdisallowed claims.

SPINELLI: Correct.JUSTICE KENNEDY: When ­­ when do trustees decide that they're not sure of the value of the home and that they're going to sell it to find out what it's worth?MS. SPINELLI: Typically, the value's not disputed. If it’s ­­ it's usually quite clear whether21Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 there is or is not nonexempt, nonencumbered value in a2 house, and the trustee will sell the house only if there3 is nonexempt, nonencumbered value.4 The ­­ you know, it's possible that in a5 situation in which it's not clear, the trustee might go6 ahead and sell the house and see how much is realized7 for it, because that sell ­­ sale price would then by8 definition establish the amount of the secured claim.9 Typically, in ­­ you know, typically, in no10 asset cases like this, there's simply no issue and11 there's no question that the trustee is not going to be12 selling the asset.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just ­­ just getting back14 to the reliance point or really, from your argument, the15 non­reliance point, the ­­ your ­­ your brief talked16 about the millions of loans and so forth that have been17 made, but you ­­ you seem to walk away from any reliance18 argument.19 MS.

That5 is true.6 What I was responding to is the notion that7 banks may have relied on, you know, whether this Court8 would apply Dewsnup to completely underwater mortgages.9 I think that's a little bit less strong, although it's10 true that in the 25 years since Dewsnup, it's ­­ until11 this decision by the Eleventh Circuit, it's been well12 established that Dewsnup does apply to completely13 underwater liens.21 please the Court:22 A claim unsupported by any value is a23 completely unsecured claim under Section 506(a). An24 unsecured claim cannot be an allowed secured claim, and25 its associated lien is void under Section 506(d).23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Claims with some value remain secured. Claims with no2 value don't. They would be wiped out in foreclosure,3 and bankruptcy treats them no better than foreclosure4 would.5 But before I get to text or holdup value or6 Dewsnup, let me seize on the striking concession of my7 adversary. Justices Scalia and Kagan pressed my8 adversary who conceded that she couldn't demonstrate9 reliance here. There were bankruptcy courts and10 district courts that foreshadowed the ruling below, and11 they pointed to no evidence of reliance. There is ­­ we12 challenged in our brief to show that in the Eleventh13 Circuit lending markets were being affected. No14 evidence. There are eight circuits in which lien15 voiding is allowed in Chapter 13. No evidence. We16 should clear the table of a reliance argument that my17 adversary all but concedes.18 JUSTICE BREYER: How ­­ how ­­ she didn't19 concede it, and ­­ and it just seems ­­ you know, it's20 not just homeowners. You can cure me of this21 misapprehension, but probably in the last 25 years or22 30 years, there have been trillions of dollars that have23 been loaned to businesses. I mean, think of Lehman24 Brothers, and ­­ and they go bankrupt, and suddenly at25 stake are ­­ are hundreds of billions of dollars. And a24Alderson Reporting Company25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:I ­­Official￼1 person who has made a mortgage, at least a lawyer would2 say, okay, you can lend the money; if things go badly,3 we can keep the lien. We won't collect because he is4 bankrupt, but markets go up and down. Keep ­­ keep ­­5 keep the secured interest, they might go back up, you6 might get it some day.7 Now, that's perfectly obvious advice, it8 seems to me, from what I know so far.9 So ­­ so when you do that, the mortgage10 lender has to decide what the interest rate is, how ­­11 what the terms are, and it's pretty hard to believe12 there isn't some effect on the brain of the ­­ of the13 person who is making the mortgage from the simple fact14 that he gets to keep that lien, it passes through15 bankruptcy, and eventually the market may go back up.16 MR. BIBAS: In addition to Justice Kagan's17 answer, which is the banks are well advised and can18 forecast, they can read the text of the statute and19 Dewsnup's express ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: We have ­­ we have had21 25 years or 30 years ­­ 23 years to be exact, and I ­­22 and ­­ and the ­­ the fact is that, sure, they go to23 their lawyer ­­ they don't ­­ the lawyers, and the24 lawyers would read and the lawyers would say.25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. BIBAS: Well, I direct the Court to the2 Levitin amicus brief. There are two empirical studies3 that found natural experiments. One of them involved4 differences in circuits before Nobelman in Chapter 135 lien voiding which found a very slight effect, 0.12 to6 0.18 percent, on first mortgages. The other, an7 empirical study by Philadelphia Federal Reserve8 economists, likewise found no substantial effect on9 markets even when different circuits adopted ­­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It ­­ it ­­ it's hard ­­11 it's hard for me to think that a decision in your favor12 wouldn't, in a sense, hurt borrowers because the market13 for a second is going to dry up or become much more14 expensive. I ­­ I'll read the briefs and you can tell15 me about why that theory, economic theory, might be16 wrong, but it seems to me just common sense.17 MR. BIBAS: Justice Kennedy, the18 amicus brief explains in greater detail, but19 problem in the mortgage market in that first20 and debtors often want to work out mutually beneficial21 resolutions. As my adversary concedes, no negotiation22 goes on in bankruptcy. The second can prevent this from23 happening, and we've cited multiple studies that show24 that the second lenders may wind up forcing homes into25 foreclosure.26Alderson Reporting CompanyLevitinthere is amortgageesOfficial￼1 The other point that the Levitin brief makes2 is that this is primarily a problem with the housing3 bubble. This is a problem of very high loan­to­value,4 piggyback second mortgages.

On the other hand, it does seem to me that12 there is room in close cases for a three­way compromise.13 I'm ­­ I'm advised that that just doesn't happen in14 Chapter 7. I find that hard to believe, but especially15 in major bankruptcies, not homeowner bankruptcy.16 MR. BIBAS: Two responses, Justice Kennedy.17 The first part of your question was, well, what is the18 effect on mortgage lending? Even if there were an19 effect on second mortgage lending, one has to balance20 that against maximizing the value of first mortgages,21 which are purchase money mortgages which are helped by22 unclogging the housing market. The chief economist at23 Moody's Analytics said that resolving subordinate liens24 was the biggest obstacle to the housing recovery.25 Then your second question is, well, what27Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 about loan modifications and bargaining. My answer2 there is this administration had a number or programs in3 place after the housing bubble; HAMP and HARP were these4 mortgage ­­ mortgage modification programs. The take­up5 rate on those were very disappointing, much lower than6 the administration expected because of this holdup power7 that ­­8 JUSTICE BREYER:9 housing? Why isn't it about10 expecting an answer. Why ­­11 housing? Why isn't it about12 about it about businesses? Why isn't it about13 commercial property?14 MR. BIBAS: Because currently, in Chapter 1115 in ­­ in cramdown reorganizations and the like, similar16 lien voiding already happens when there is no value to17 be ­­ to secure it.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:19 MR. BIBAS:20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:21 statute in 11 or 13 did Congress ever use the word22 voiding a lien as opposed to stripping down a lien?23 MR. BIBAS: It ­­ it doesn't use the phrase24 stripping down. It doesn't use the phrase void,25 Justice Sotomayor. And this is very important. The28Alderson Reporting CompanyWhy is this all about­­ maybe it is.  I'm ­­ I'mwhy is it just aboutLehman Brothers?  Why isn't        That's statutorily.Right, statutorily is ­­Now, where in anyOfficial￼1 NACBA brief goes into this. There are references to2 retaining liens, to satisfying liens, to modifying3 liens. But as NACBA explains, those provisions all4 piggyback on 506, which values a claim. It goes over5 for adjudication in Chapter 11, the different classes of6 creditors, and then back to 506(d) which is the7 provision that says that it voids liens. And NACBA's8 fear is that if this Court does not allow Section 506(d)9 to do what it's supposed to do, it could impair not only10 housing mortgage modifications, but business11 bankruptcy ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, but no.

But assume a big2 business in Chapter 7.3 MR. BIBAS: Yes. Businesses under Chapter 74 do not receive a discharge, and so typically the5 business is filing under Chapter 11. If there is a6 liquidation, you are right, though, that the same logic7 could apply there. And whether it a business bankruptcy8 or it's a mortgage, a home bankruptcy, there is still9 the need for the bankruptcy code's policies of finality10 and a fresh start.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I ­­ I'm not12 familiar with the widespread practice of giving ­­ of13 taking a second mortgage on a business loan unless it's14 your father­in­law. It's ­­ it's a very common practice15 for ­­ for purchases of homes. I ­­ I ­­ I'm not aware16 that it's a common practice in businesses, getting ­­17 getting second mortgages. I ­­ it seems to me quite18 rare.19 MR. BIBAS: But there are different tranches20 of debt sometimes, senior and junior debt obligations,21 that would be analogous. But you're right.22 Numerically, this is going to be a huge issue in ­­ in23 the housing market.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bibas, I'm – I’m really25 not a poor loser and ­­ and, you know ­­30Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 (Laughter.)2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 Dewsnup. What I am concerned about is the ­­ what4 should I say ­­ the ridiculousness of saying if under5 Dewsnup ­­ and you haven't asked us to overrule Dewsnup6 ­­ under Dewsnup, if ­­ if there's $1 worth of value,7 okay, you don't lose your lien. But if there is zero8 value, $1 less and it's stripped entirely, it seems to9 me a ­­ a very strange ­­ strange outcome. Why would10 any intelligent system want to produce an outcome like11 that?12 MR. BIBAS: I'll talk about that doctrinally13 and then as a policy matter. Doctrinally, the code has14 dozens of provisions that turn on a dollar difference in15 eligibility for Chapter 7 or presumptions of abuse of a16 like. Congress draws these lines. Section 1111(b) for17 business bankruptcies and reorganizations talks about18 inconsequential value. You keep your lien if it has19 some value. If it doesn't ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think this is a line21 that Congress drew, right?22 MR. BIBAS: Well, Congress drew the23 other provisions.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Congress intentionally25 wanted Dewsnup for partially underwater and really31Alderson Reporting Company­­ I've ­­ I've lost in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425doesn't want Dewsnup for totally underwater.  Come on.MR. BIBAS:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. BIBAS:I didn't say that, Your Honor.     All right.Official￼                        I ­­ I'd remind Your Honor of ­­of your opinion in Green v. Bock Laundry.  If it'snecessary to deviate from the text, which Dewsnupadmitted it was deviating from the text, pick thedeviation that does the least violence to the text, thatminimizes the amount of the deviation.  We preserve alink and Dewsnup did not completely sever thelink between 506(a)'s requirement ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may take the leastviolence from the text, but it leaves, as Justice Scaliasuggested, absolutely draconian arbitrary results.      MR. BIBAS:Justice Kennedy ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:that you do that.      MR. BIBAS:it's draconian.  If a property is $1 above water, okay,it is preserved under this reading of Dewsnup.  But we’veexplained in our brief that foreclosure sale at deepdiscounts, there are high transaction costs.  So a housemight have to rise by half or more in value beforethere's any additional money on the table.  So if32Okay.  As a policy matter,      And his opinion didn't sayNo.  Your Honor, I don't believeAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 anything, allowing preservation of a lien that has $1 in2 nominal value is being somewhat overprotective, erring3 on the side of being generous and protective when there4 would be no money left in foreclosure. What it does is5 it clears out the liens that are nowhere close to having6 value in foreclosure.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't the question8 complicated by the fact that whether it's $1 above or $19 below is a matter of a fairly subjective valuation by10 the court?11 MR. BIBAS: On the contrary, Your Honor,12 Section 506(a) expressly provides for judicial13 valuation. Nobelman recognized it would be judicial14 valuation. The house reports recognized it would be15 judicial.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, I know it's17 judicial valuation, but that's ­­ that's the problem.18 If you're cutting a fine line and saying it's up to the19 judge who can look ahead and say, well, this is going to20 happen in the bankruptcy, and I'm worried about that.21 No one's going to say a valuation at $50,001 is22 accurate, but 49,999 is not. But that is in control of23 the judge who's doing the valuation.24 MR. BIBAS: Yes. But it's far more accurate25 than the realistic alternative of foreclosure. There33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 are many more safeguards. One can ­­ the creditor can2 submit a proposed valuation. A creditor submits3 appraisals, expert testimony, there is a hearing. And4 that is far more protected than foreclosures which have5 to have ­­ be rushed sales, poor notice, poorly6 advertised, they require cash sales, that leave the7 creditor much less protection.8 The realistic alternative here is throwing9 the house into foreclosure, and ­­ and outside a10 bankruptcy and then, in fact, the creditor winds up11 worse off. Not just the second, who has nothing to gain12 and nothing to lose, holds it up, the first mortgagee13 winds up losing value.14 If I might now take the Court back to the15 text of the statute.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bibas, before you do,17 could I go back to something that the Chief asked18 about ­­ that the Chief Justice asked about earlier,19 which is this question of whether a distinction between20 fully underwater and partially underwater is coherent at21 all.22 Here's what Dewsnup said. Dewsnup on the23 one hand said, we're deciding this case and this case24 only. But it also said this, this is how it framed its25 holding. "We hold that 506(d) does not allow petitioner34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to strip down respondent's lien because respondent's2 lien" ­­ excuse me ­­ "because respondent's claim is3 secured by a lien and has been fully allowed pursuant to4 502."5 So this claim, too, is secured by a lien and6 has been fully allowed pursuant to 502. It seems to7 come within this statement of the holding. And I guess8 the question is, you know, how ­­ how is it that we can9 say that this is a sensical distinction at all given10 that holding?11 MR. BIBAS: Two ways. Let me focus on that12 sentence and then things elsewhere in the opinion and13 then Nobelman.14 That sentence was careful, unusually15 careful, to phrase the holding in terms of the16 particular parties. That respondent had value in the17 mortgage. That's why the Court said respondent's claim,18 not claims in general. Then it used the verb "stripped19 down." That's bankruptcy jargon for a partially secured20 mortgage and reducing the amount, scaling down the21 indebtedness, the court said two days later.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I hear you, but it23 seems as though it's the second half of the sentence24 that is key here. Why are we doing this? Why are we25 holding this? Because the claim is secured by a lien35Alderson Reporting Company25 JUSTICE ALITO:Well, why haven't you arguedOfficial￼1 and because the claim has been fully allowed. And both2 of those things also apply here.3 MR. BIBAS: Respondent's claim also had some4 value that made it unquestionable that it was still5 secured. But you're ­­ you're correct. I think,6 though, that the use of the verb "stripped down" and the7 use of the respondent particular limits to that8 situation.9 It's very important, though, to go back10 three sentences before that to see what the court11 hedged. The court specifically reserved hypothetical12 applications advanced at oral argument. Petitioner13 advanced two hypotheticals at oral argument. One of14 those was of the completely underwater junior mortgage.15 The court said that those hypotheticals illustrate the16 difficulty of the broad creditors in government's rule,17 the same rule that Ms. Spinelli says that the court18 embraces. The same rule she quoted during her argument19 as if it were the court's holding, about, well, there's20 some collateral, therefore, it's secured.21 The court declined to rule on all possible22 fact situations, in light of that hypothetical, and it23 said we, therefore, focus on the case before us and24 allow other facts to await their legal resolution.36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that we should overrule Dewsnup? Is it because of2 reliance, because you think that there has been a great3 deal of reliance on Dewsnup as applied to a partially4 underwater mortgage, but not reliance as applied to5 totally underwater?6 MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, it's quite right7 that those are two different categories. It's not our8 burden to take on steri decisis because we win under9 Dewsnup. Either way, the Court can do what it wants,10 but we have not advocated it. We've been faithful to11 Dewsnup's holding and its reasoning, including the12 express limitations it put on its reasoning. Its13 reasoning was limited to a case with some value.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the law would be much15 more coherent if either Dewsnup applies to the totally16 underwater as well as partially underwater, or Dewsnup17 is overruled.18 MR. BIBAS: I don't believe that's the19 case ­­ in terms of ­­ while the Court could consider20 overruling Dewsnup, we haven't advocated for that.21 Because even ­­ our reading of the statute is still more22 faithful to the text than Petitioner's.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, you're giving25 the same ­­ exactly the same phrase in the statute two37Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425different meanings, depending on whether one'sunderwater or not, completely or partially.MR. BIBAS:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:distinction in 506?No, Your Honor.        Where do you find that      MR. BIBAS:what an allowed secured claim is.Official￼Okay.  Section 506(a) definesJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. But that's the argument that Justice Scalia made that was rejected. You're giving the same phrase two different meanings.      How do you apply the meaning in Dewsnup tothis case?MR. BIBAS: On ­­ on 506(d). Dewsnup was interpreting a claim that was a ­­ it was a hybrid. It was ­­ it had a secured claim component and an unsecured claim component. The secured claim component had some value. That value was sufficient under 506(a) that there was a partial­­ partial secured claim.      Dewsnup must be read in light of Nobelman ayear later.  Nobelman said there's a secured ­­ it's aChapter 13 case, but it interprets 506 which appliesacross the code.  Nobelman said there's a secured claimcomponent, there's an unsecured claim component.  Thecreditors in Nobelman advanced the same argument, thesame argument that my adversary advances, which is 50638Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 is just about priority and distribution. That it has2 nothing to do with lien voiding, Dewsnup resolved this3 issue, every claim that is secured by a lien is secured4 by a ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But Nobelman was not6 about 506. It was about 1322. And 1322 talks about the7 bankruptcy court's power to modify the rights of any8 creditor, whether it's secured or unsecured. That's how9 it's been read by the courts.10 MR. BIBAS: Yes. But 1322's operative11 phrase is "modifying the rights of holders of secured12 claims." In order to be a holder of secured claim, one13 must have a secured claim. And so in Nobelman, this14 Court stressed petitioners were correct in looking to15 Section 506(a) for a judicial valuation of the16 collateral to determine the status of the bank's secured17 claim, whether there was a secured claim or not. There18 was a secured claim component, and so the Court said the19 bank is still the holder of a secured claim because20 Petitioner's home retains $23,500 of collateral.21 So the issue in Nobelman, as in Dewsnup,22 was, okay, we have a secured claim component under Rumph23 here ­­ we have an unsecured claim component. Do we24 split the baby? Do we chop them in half? And Nobelman25 said, no, in part, because it's a difficult thing to ­­39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to change the amortization, the loan term, the payments,2 et cetera. There is some value here that supports this.3 So we're going to leave it as indivisible hold. This4 Court could easily understand allowed secured claim in5 506(d) if it wished to preserve Dewsnup's holding just6 as a binary term. If there's some ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: If you can do that,8 linguistically, I can see a difference. The part that9 I'm having a hard time with is if this earlier case10 survives. Let's imagine a commercial loan. And I put11 it in a commercial context, because the numbers ­­ a12 mortgage ­­ a lender lends $5 million ­­ the senior13 lender ­­ to a commercial building, which then goes into14 the Chapter 7. The junior lender lends 2 million, so15 now he has 7 million. The property ends up being worth16 a million. So the senior lender under Dewsnup comes in17 and says, okay, I have a secured interest for a million,18 but I can keep the ­­ the mortgage here for 4 million,19 you know, in case things change ten years from now.20 Isn't that under Dewsnup? The senior guy can, that's21 partly ­­22 MR. BIBAS: Well, in the corporate23 bankruptcy, this doesn't apply ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then I'll say ­­ I25 just want some numbers. The senior ­­ the senior person40Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425says ­­ put it on whatever you want.  The senior personsays, oh, I get to keep my $4 million mortgage.  Maybethings will change, you know, and eventually I may beable to collect some.  Right?  That's Dewsnup.MR. BIBAS:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. BIBAS:Except ­­     Except what?second mortgage that the individual ­­Official￼                        The ­­ the difficulty there ­­so you're saying that there's a completely unsecured      JUSTICE BREYER:example yet.MR. BIBAS:      JUSTICE BREYER:right so far.(Laughter.)      JUSTICE BREYER:mortgage.  It's $5 million.  The property is worth one.MR. BIBAS: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: And so what happens to ­­ to bank X is he gets maybe, as a secured creditor, the million, if he wants, but if he doesn't want to collect it now, he doesn't have to, and he keeps $5 million. He keeps that mortgage going as long as he wants.MR. BIBAS: Yes. JUSTICE BREYER:41Yes.  Okay.  So junior     No.  No.  I haven't made myAll right.     I just want to know if I'mAlderson Reporting CompanyThere's ­­ there's oneOfficial￼1 comes in, and junior says, hey, he got to keep 4 million2 just in case. I have my mortgage for two. Why can't I?3 Now ­­ now, I can ­­ I can think of some words here that4 might say, well, there's the difference, is what you are5 pointing to. I just want to know, in terms of6 commercial practice or anything else, what's the answer7 to his point? He got to keep four on the hope it will8 go up eventually. Why can't I keep my two? My9 documents are just as good as his. My mortgage is just10 as good as his. I mean, why can't I?11 MR. BIBAS: So there is a functional answer,12 and a historical answer. I take it you're interested13 more in the functional answer.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.15 MR. BIBAS: I'll start there. There is a16 big difference between a single creditor, single debtor17 situation. In Dewsnup, the debtor was just trying to18 stop a foreclosure, so the debtor could get a better19 deal. Here we have a multi­creditor situation. The20 creditor ­­ this junior creditor is seeking a better21 outcome than it would get in state law foreclosure.22 That better outcome comes in part from hold23 up or hostage value that can limit the ability of the24 senior lender and the property holder to negotiate a25 loan modification, a work out, that makes everybody42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 better off, makes assets more freely transferable, and2 improves the ­­ the market. And that does come at the3 price of a junior lender, but that's what happens in a4 cram down as well. In a cram down, junior interests are5 squeezed out so that the senior people can ­­ can6 maximize the value of the assets and deal with them7 freely.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you say the same9 thing about only one lender? He doesn't have to keep10 that four, you know. He could say, give me 30 cents11 extra. I will foreclose today, and ­­ and there you12 are, free, never having this hanging over your head.13 And I'll do it for an extra 30 cents, you find it. Now,14 that's called ­­ the same thing you say ­­ it's15 called ­­ what did you call it? Whatever it is. You16 see, people with mortgages can do that.17 MR. BIBAS: Right. But there's not the same18 multi­creditor ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: No. There is one rather20 than two, and maybe two would be better than three, or21 three would be better than four.22 MR. BIBAS: Since you are asking23 specifically in functional terms ­­ and I will get to24 the bankruptcy history later ­­ it's ­­ there is a25 coordination problem when ­­ a coordination problem can43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 be a game of chicken. Each of them holding out for more2 money and then people ­­ two people can drive over a3 cliff in a game of chicken.4 Now, on to the bankruptcy history. Why is5 this relevant to the law? There's a steady trajectory6 in bankruptcy law of increasing lien voiding power.7 Under ­­ in 1934, section 77(b) authorized lien voiding8 in business or organizations. In 1938, the Chandler9 Act, Chapter 12, extended that to individual10 organizations. In 1952, the amendments broadened it.11 They rejected the absolute priority rule for individual12 debtors, so the debtor can hang on to the assets, and13 the liens can still be voided.14 Then in 1978, the modern code enacted15 Section 506, which applies across the code, Chapter 7,16 11, 12, and 13. So this is part of an increasing17 recognition over time that it's necessary to solve these18 hold up problems. And the – the realistic alternative ­­19 my ­­ my friend, Ms. Spinelli, in her reply brief says,20 well, if we hang on to this lien, ten years from now,21 first, we will keep getting paid down, and then our22 second will come into the money. Right?23 Well, that is not realistically what happens24 in these cases. In borderline cases, 105, 110 percent25 of loan­to­value, people stay in the houses. They keep44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 paying. It's too much cost to pick up the kids and move2 to a different home. When you get to 130 percent of3 loan­to­value, the median home that's underwater with a4 second that is underwater is 135 percent loan­to­value.5 When you get to 150 percent of6 loan­to­value, at those ranges, lots of people are in7 default. They qualify for bankruptcy because they've8 lost a job, or they are ill. They can't make the9 payments and pay into a black hole of negative equity.10 They walk away. The home is thrown into foreclosure11 anyway, and the senior creditor is worse off. And the12 junior doesn't care because the junior doesn't get13 anything either way.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bibas, can I take you15 back to Justice Alito's question, which was about stare16 decisis, and why you haven't argued it? Because I tell17 you that my sort of reaction to this case is that these18 distinctions that you are drawing between partially19 underwater and fully underwater are not terribly20 persuasive. But the only thing that may be less21 persuasive is Dewsnup itself.22 (Laughter.)23 JUSTICE KAGAN: And so the ­­ so the24 question, to me, is ­­ or at least one question is25 whether we should bite the bullet and overturn Dewsnup,45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 and maybe you are right, that that's for us to decide.2 And you ­­ but if ­­ if you do have something relevant3 to say about that matter, here's your chance to say it.4 MR. BIBAS: I think it's worth ­­ if5 the Court wishes to consider that, and, again, that's6 not been the position we've advocated, because we don't7 need it to win. It's worth starting with Justice8 Thomas's concurring opinion in 203 North LaSalle, which9 pointed out the massive confusion that has been sewn in10 the Court's trying to grapple with this ruling, which11 Judge Gorsuch's ruling Woolsey that says that Dewsnup12 has lost every away game it's played, that it doesn't13 fit with the other provisions of the code. There is a14 lot of confusion there.15 It has almost uniform criticism in scholarly16 commentary. My colleague can't point to reliance17 interest in the markets. And the empirical studies18 discussed in the Levitin brief suggest that there isn't19 substantial reliance on this, in part, because you20 benefit from first mortgagees who manage to maximize21 their value by voiding some of these junior ones. And22 so the reliance interest that my friend has walked away23 from and the uniform criticism of Dewsnup might interest24 this Court in considering revisiting it, but it's not25 necessary, because Dewsnup itself reserved the46Alderson Reporting Company      MR.

It wasunder 1322(b)(2).  It was a Chapter 13 case, but it wasfundamentally about interpreting 506(a).  Is it just adistribution provision, as my client argued ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. What ­­ whatthe Court said ­­ I don't understand that argument. It said there's ­­ yes, you ­­ you divide it up to secured and unsecured, but you treat it all the same.                        You decline to cut it intopieces, and one of the reasons that you decline to cutit into pieces is because the claim secured by a lienencompasses both secured ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So once ­­ oncethe Court has the power, what it was saying under 1322,47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to modify that, then the Court could change both the2 secured or ­­ and I'm ­­ the whole lien is what it was3 talking about.4 MR. BIBAS: But the last part of the opinion5 pointed out that if you modify the unsecured portion you6 have a ripple effects upon the secured portion. You7 wind up changing things like the ­­ the interest rate or8 the amortization or the fees. And so you might be9 viewed as ­­ as sabotaging or undermining what deserves10 to remain a secured component. In this situation, there11 is no ­­ no such problem.12 So all ­­ it is worth noting, by the way, my13 friend also says, well, this lien, it can sit out there,14 maybe it retains value sometime in the future; isn't15 that enough value. And I think Justice Breyer was16 gesturing towards that. All eight circuits after17 Nobelman have understood that Nobelman drew a line18 between some value and no value. All eight circuits19 that confront lien voiding in Chapter 13 allow it20 because they recognize that the completely underwater21 junior qualifies as no value within the meaning of the22 code.23 Present economic value is what this Court's24 cases have consistently focused on. The value of the25 claim is equal to the value of the collateral, this48Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court has said, and that's the present value of thecollateral.  The statute uses the present tense inSection 506, whether it is or is not.  It's not aboutforecasting or speculating into the future.  That wouldbe unworkable.  But judicial valuations are workable.The Bankruptcy Rules, Rule 3012 and 7001 provide for it.And there is abundant case law that shows it to be bothworkable and fairer to creditors than the alternativewhich is a foreclosure.The judgment below should be affirmed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Spinelli, you have 4 minutes left.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. SPINELLI: Thank you. Just a couple of points.Completely underwater liens are notvalueless.  Their value stems from the potential forappreciation in the collateral.      Indeed, a lien that's completely underwaterby a dollar might have more value than a lien that issupported by a dollar of equity, depending on thepotential for appreciation.      The value if the houses were sold today issimply irrelevant because the situation only arises49Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 where the debtor is keeping the house. And one could2 have said in Dewsnup, look, the current value of the3 collateral is less than the amount of your loan. It's4 fair to give you the current value of ­­ of the5 collateral.6 Dewsnup held to the contrary, and that's7 precisely the same here. There is no distinction that8 supports drawing a line at completely underwater liens,9 given that the secured creditor has the same10 nonbankruptcy right to have its lien stay with the11 collateral until foreclosure and payment in full and to12 realize any appreciation in the value of that13 collateral.14 This ­­ this doesn't give a junior15 lienholder a better deal than it would receive under16 State law. It gives it the same deal it would receive17 under State law.18 To respond to a point that I think19 Justice Sotomayor made, the fact that there are specific20 provisions in Chapters 11 and 13 that do permit21 stripping down liens in certain circumstances supports22 the Dewsnup Court's view of 506(d). It certainly23 doesn't undermine it. 506(d) is not the provision that24 strips down liens in Chapters 11 and 13. Rather, there25 are specific provisions which are in the addendum to our50Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 brief in Section 1325 for Chapter 13, and actually this2 is not in the addendum, 1129(b) for Chapter 11.3 Those provisions would make no sense if4 506(d) were itself a lien­stripping provision. And just5 to take one example, if one looks at Section6 1325(a)(5) which appears on page 6A of the blue brief,7 that sets out the terms under which a Chapter 13 debtor8 can strip down liens, and it says that with respect to9 each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan, the10 plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the11 lien, securing such claim until the earlier of the12 payment of the underlying debt determined under13 nonbankruptcy law or discharge.14 Now, it would make no sense to permit the15 lender to keep its lien until payment of the full debt16 if the lien had already automatically been stripped down17 under 506(d) to the value of the collateral, and that's18 just one example.19 We discussed some others in our briefs,20 including Section 722, and we also discuss in our briefs21 the ­­ the textual indications in Section 506 that22 support the Dewsnup's Court's holding. So ­­ and those23 are all reasons why Dewsnup was correctly decided in the24 first instance and shouldn't be overruled.25 But to respond to Justice Kagan's question,51Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425beyond that, the rule of law simply doesn't allow thisCourt in the typical situation to overrule a statutoryinterpretation decision in a case like this whereCongress, over the past 25 years, has acquiesced in thatdecision.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
