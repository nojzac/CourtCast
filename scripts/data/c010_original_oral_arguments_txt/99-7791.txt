The INS andJohn Ashcroft v. Kim  Ho Ma.  Mr. Barnard.          MR. STANSELL:  I'm sorry --          Oh, I'm sorry.  Mr. Stansell.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY W. STANSELL              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MA          MR. STANSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I'd first like to start  by emphasizing threepoints to the Court, first that the Government'sinterpretation -- the Government s - construction of thestatute in this case is extreme.  It allows the INS tolock somebody up, potentially for life, just simplybecause their country of origin will not take them back.          Secondly, our clients are in no way challengingtheir orders of deportation, or the Government's plenarypower to create categories to deport them, and to deportthem.  They are simply asserting their Fifth Amendmentright to liberty, which they retain until they aredeported from this country.          And third, the Government has other alternativesin this case, in these cases.  They are not left4         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    unprotected.  The INS retains a substantial statutory and 2    regulatory authority to supervise Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas 3    and those similarly situated. 4              In stark contrast to the Government's statutory 5    construction, the circuit court suggested a reasonable 6    construction of this statute that allows for the detention 7    beyond the removal period for a reasonable time period. 8    This interpretation, this construction is consistent with 9    the silence of the statute, which, as explained by the10    circuit court, invites the question of what time period11    are we talking about.  The Government would seek a time12    period of "indefinitely", that word to be read into the13 statute.          QUESTION:  We're talking about the language,"may be detained beyond the removal period"?          MR. STANSELL:  That's correct, Your Honor, andwhat Congress has not done is specify how long beyondthe -- how long, following that, Mr. Chief Justice, theywould intend to detain.          QUESTION:  Well, do you think that somereasonable period of time is permitted under that141516171819202122    language?2324 25          MR. STANSELL:  Yes, I do, Your Honor.  I thinkthe Court's -- or the circuit court's construction isentirely consistent with the historical treatment.5         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Which circuit court?          MR. STANSELL:  I'm --          QUESTION:  Are you talking about the Fifth orthe Ninth?          MR. STANSELL:  I'm sorry, I'm talking about theNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.  I'm referringspecifically to the Ninth Circuit's decision dealingpurely with the statutory construction issue and putting areasonable construction on the statute that avoids theconstitutional issue.          QUESTION:  What about the construction that theINS has put on it?  Isn't that entitled to some deferenceunder our Chevron rules?          MR. STANSELL:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, theChevron deference simply doesn't apply when you'reapplying the constitutional avoidance doctrine, because Ibelieve that agencies are not -- while they may haveexpertise at interpreting their own statute, they don'tnecessarily have expertise in interpreting theConstitution, and even most recently this past term thisCourt in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County didnot grant Chevron deference when there was aconstitutional problem indicated.          QUESTION:  Mr. Stansell, what do you mean by areasonable time?  Do you mean there's an absolute time6         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    limit?  I guess the Government here would say that they're 2    not holding them beyond a reasonable time, that the time 3    that is reasonable is the time that is necessary to 4    protect the public from depredations by these people, who 5    are deportable because they've committed crimes. 6              MR. STANSELL:  Well, Your Honor, the circuit 7    court did not specifically define what is a reasonable 8    time period.  I think our position would be -- 9              QUESTION:  You mean an absolute time limit at10    some point, don't you?11              MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, our position would be12    if it's not reasonably perceivable, if deportation is not13    perceivable, there's not some objective fact that they can14    point to that this individual is going to be deported,15    then holding that person beyond that period would not be a16    reasonable time.17              QUESTION:  So even if you're talking about, you18    know, a real life Hannibal what's-his-name, you know, a19    really wicked, evil person who is going to harm people,20    there's every reason to believe that this person who's21    been deported because of serial murders, if you can't find22    a country to send him to, you have to let that person out?23              MR. STANSELL:  That's correct, Your Honor, and24    that's what we do with any other person, and that's the25    appropriate term here, any other person who has finished7               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    their prison time and -- 2              QUESTION:  Well, any other person is entitled to 3    be in the United States.  Would it be unconstitutional for 4    the law on its face, when aliens are admitted, to say that 5    you are admitted to this country only on the condition of 6    good behavior, and that that permission will be terminated 7    if you commit a felony, and upon its termination, it is up 8    to you to find a country to get sent back to.  The burden 9    is not on us, and if you can't find a country, you're not10    going to be allowed into the public in this country, where11    you have not been given any permission to be?  Why is that12    unreasonable?13              MR. STANSELL:  Well, Your Honor, the first part14    of your hypothetical I think is essentially what the law15    is.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  I know.  I'm just spelling it outmore explicitly, that the condition of your admission isthis:  should you commit a felony, your permission to beamong the general public in the United States isterminated and --          MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, I --          QUESTION:  And we will send you back to whatevercountry you can find that will take you, but if no countrywill take you, you will not be allowed into the generalpopulace. That permission has not been given, period.8         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, I think because theConstitution has the paramount -- is the paramountauthority under which all statutes have to be gauged, Ithink that the last portion of your hypothetical would beunconstitutional.  Everyone retains the right to libertyonce they've entered our shores, once they pass throughour gates.          QUESTION:  Well, the Government says here thatMr. Kestutis is in the same position as someone, as anentering alien, who we've said has virtually noconstitutional rights.          MR. STANSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, the -- I thinkyou're referring to the Mezei decision and --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. STANSELL:  -- the Mezei decision is a uniqueand very distinguishable case on its facts.  It involvedan individual coming to the border, seeking entry, notbringing any constitutional rights, and it involved anindividual who was also ordered excluded on public safetyor national security grounds, and it also came at a timeprior to the Court's development of its jurisprudence onsome sort of due process in the civil detention scheme.          QUESTION:  Well, I -- we've never overruled theMezei case.          MR. STANSELL:  That -                             9         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1              QUESTION:  We've never questioned it so far as I2    know.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. STANSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, that'sentirely correct, but what's important is that on theother hand Mezei never questioned the general rule that itwas setting out the narrow delineated exception for --          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. STANSELL:  -- and that general rule is thatonce an alien has passed through our gates, and it is moreor less a direct quote, has passed through our gates, evenillegally, they're entitled to the protections of theFifth Amendment.          QUESTION:  You're saying, then, that even thoughan alien obtains admission to this country illegally, thathe's fully protected by our Constitution?          MR. STANSELL:  Yes, I am, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, but protected in what sense?          MR. STANSELL:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, he'sprotected -- certainly protected as to his libertyinterests, his interest in being free from bodilyrestraint is protected coequal with --          QUESTION:  You mean, he couldn't be picked up bythe immigration authorities and detained because he'sthere illegally?          MR. STANSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, that is a                            10         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    distinct form of detention that's separate from what -- 2    the indefinite post final order detention that we are 3    talking about. 4              QUESTION:  Yes, but will you -- answer my 5    question, if you will. 6              MR. STANSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think, you 7    know, I perhaps misspoke, that, of course, the Government 8    has countervailing interests that they can detain any 9    individual for a number of reasons.  It's been recognized10    by this Court that detention pending deportation11    proceedings is one of those circumstances, and this12    Court's decision in Carlson supports that.13              What this Court has never done is taken this a14    step further and essentially condoned what could be15    lifetime detention for individuals who have in hand their16    full Fifth Amendment protections, and I would want to17    emphasize that Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas today are18    substantially constrained.  Their liberty interests are19    not the same currently.  They're both out in the world.20              QUESTION:  They're both out, aren't they, and21    under certain terms and conditions?  What's the situation?22              MR. STANSELL:  That's exactly correct.  There23    are broad statutory and regulatory provisions that INS can24    impose on them in terms of travel restrictions, in terms25    of whether or not they're going to be allowed to work, in11               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    terms of having to submit to psychiatric and medical 2    evaluations and just, you know -- and just contact with 3    the INS.  They could be required to report every day to4 the INS. 5              QUESTION:  There are new, proposed regulations 6    dealing with this subject.  Is that correct? 7              MR. STANSELL:  That is correct, Your Honor. 8              QUESTION:  And is there some opportunity for 9    judicial review after a period of time under the proposed10    new regulations, do you know?11              MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, I believe the12    judicial review -- there's nothing inherent in the13    regulations themselves that allow for judicial review.  I14    think if there were --15              QUESTION:  Nothing expressed?16              MR. STANSELL:  That's correct.  That's my17    understanding of the regulations.18              I think if somebody were --19              QUESTION:  And both these cases are here on20 habeas --21              MR. STANSELL:  That's correct.22              QUESTION:   -- proceedings?23              MR. STANSELL:  2241 is the jurisdiction here.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Stansell, what if -- these people25    are deportable because of committing felonies, right?12               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    What if the punishment for the felony were life in prison? 2    That, I assume, would not be unconstitutional? 3              MR. STANSELL:  That's correct, Your Honor. 4              QUESTION:  Then why is it unconstitutional to 5    say to an immigrant, if you commit a felony, we're not 6    going to put you in prison for life, but we are simply not 7    going to let you back into the general populace, and we 8    will deport you if you can find a place to be deported to, 9    but otherwise you will be held under house arrest, not10    punitive, but you will not be allowed into the general11    population?12              Why is that lesser punishment, if you consider13    it that, although it really isn't punishment, it's -- you14    know, that was the deal.  Why is that lesser sanction15    unconstitutional, whereas sending the felon to jail for16    life and punitive treatment for life would not be17    unconstitutional?18              MR. STANSELL:  Well, Your Honor, it -- the19    hypothetical you lay out would allow somebody through the20    administrative action of an administrative agency to be21    put in -- to be incarcerated for life, and this Court has22    never condoned such an extreme civil detention process.23              QUESTION:  Well, would you change the24    hypothetical, then, slightly and say that there is a25    provision of the United States Code that anyone who is13               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    convicted of a -- anyone in the immigrant status who is 2    convicted of a felony in the United States will be 3    punished by imprisonment up to life, and the sentence in 4    fact can be terminated upon deportation, if deportation is 5    possible?  No administrative imposition here.  The 6    imposition would be by a court at sentencing. 7              MR. STANSELL:  That would be a different case, 8    Your Honor, and I'm not sure -- 9              QUESTION:  Would that be constitutional?10              MR. STANSELL:  -- what the constitutional rule11 would be.12              What's at issue here is whether the detention is13    excessive in relationship to the legitimate Government14    interest, and the legitimate Government interest --15              QUESTION:  Well, but that would be the -- I16    presume that would be the issue under the hypothetical17    that I've raised, so would -- on my variation of the hypo,18    would it be unconstitutional for the Government to19    imprison?202122232425          MR. STANSELL:  If it was with a judge and a juryand the right to indictment and the grand jury --          QUESTION:  Determination of immigrant status ismade by a jury.  All the facts are found as a jury needsto find them.QUESTION:  In your view, would it make any                  14ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    difference whether such a law was passed before or after 2    the alien entered the country? 3              MR. STANSELL:  I'm not sure what I would -- how 4    I'd answer that, Your Honor. 5              QUESTION:  You don't think they'd be entitled to 6    notice that that was the consequence of coming into the 7    United States? 8              MR. STANSELL:  Well, you know, I think it raises 9    a number of different issues, but what's at the heart of10    this is the fact that Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas, when they11    entered the country, they were cloaked with the12    Constitution, and this Court has delineated a very narrow13    exception in Mezei, an exception that recognized the14    general rule set out in Wong Wing in 1896 that has15    stood -- that withstood, has withstood this test of time16    and has been cited by this Court in modern cases.17              That general rule remains, and all they are18    asking for in this case, and the substantive due process19    claim here, is simply to ask INS to take into20    consideration the fundamental aspect that is really21    driving these cases, the fact that people are locked up22    for life.  If they considered that and weighed that and23    balanced that against the other interests, then it would24    be -- it would pass --25              QUESTION:  Okay -15               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  That's not the Ninth Circuit rule, 2    though.  The Ninth Circuit rule was, if you can't, within 3    the reasonably foreseeable future, deport this person 4    because no one will have him -- 5              MR. STANSELL:  That's correct, Your Honor. 6              QUESTION:  -- then you must -- that's the Ninth 7    Circuit rule.  I think what you were saying, urging just 8    now, is something different from that rule. 9              MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, I was speaking to the10    constitutional test that we think is driven by this11    Court's civil detention cases.12              QUESTION:  Okay, but let's apply it.  I mean,13    would you go back to Justice Scalia's hypothetical with my14    variation and Justice Stevens' gloss --15              (Laughter.)16              QUESTION:  -- and let's assume that the statute17    providing for the -- for potential life imprisonment18    subject to deportation was in place at the time that a19    given immigrant was admitted.  On that assumption, would20    it be -- would the sentencing scheme be constitutional?21              MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, if somebody came into22    this country and they were told that if you commit an23    offense as an alien you'll be sentenced to potentially for24    life -- and currently I think the Government does have the25    power to allow, or to move people out of the country,16               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    deport them prior to the completion of their sentence.  If 2    it were a criminal -- 3              QUESTION:  Sure, but we're -- the problem is, 4    maybe the Government isn't able to deport.  Maybe the 5    current situation occurs in the instance of the 6    hypothetical with its glosses.  In that circumstance, in 7    your view, is it constitutional for the Government to 8    imprison up to life? 9              MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, if it's just a10    straight imposition of a life sentence, I think that would11    implicate --12              QUESTION:  No, it's the imposition of the13    sentence that I described.14              MR. STANSELL:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm15    missing the connection.16              QUESTION:  The sentencing scheme which is in17    place when the immigrant is admitted provides that in the18    case of conviction for a felony by such an immigrant, the19    immigrant may be imprisonment -- may be imprisoned for a20    period up to life, provided that that term may be reduced21    if it is possible for the Government to extradite, and22    does -- not extradite, deport, and does successfully2523 deport. 24          Would that scheme, if in place when theimmigrant comes in, be constitutionally enforceable?17ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. STANSELL:  Your Honor, I'm not sure.  It 2    strikes me that that raises other issues that aren't 3    raised in this case, and all we are saying in this case is 4    that where no consideration is given to the foreseeability 5    of deportation, and it's not a criminal charge and a 6    criminal sentence that any of these people are serving, 7    it's unconstitutional, and that's what's informing -- 8              QUESTION:  Would you say there's something -- 9    that it might be something different, is that a little bit10    like Plyler, that you would take one category of people11    who commit the same offense and subject them to much12    harsher punishment than another class?13              MR. STANSELL:  I think that might be.  I think14    there might be an equal protection issue that's raised,15    and quite frankly I hadn't thought about that question.16              QUESTION:  Well the -- but the Government's -- I17    mean, if it comes to justification, the Government's18    justification is going to be essentially what we have19    heard here, and that is that it is demonstrably more20    difficult to keep track of such individuals so that they21    may be deported if, in fact, it is possible to deport22    them, and number 2, the recidivism rate by such23    individuals is distinctly higher than the recidivism rate24    in the generally released criminal population, so those25    would be the two justifications for the disparate18               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    treatment. 2              Would those justifications be constitutionally 3    adequate? 4 5    I think that the surveys that the Government relies upon 6    had a much broader sweep to them.  I don't think these 7    individuals that we've represented, who are in custody by 8    INS, seeming like they're in custody for life, and they 9    get a district court order to release, are doing quite10    well, by and large, because they think that their next11    mishap will put them in custody for life.12              There's no indication that Mr. Zadvydas or Mr.13    Ma at this point are doing anything other than staying in14    touch and responding, complying with all of the conditions15    of their supervision.16              QUESTION:  Don't appeal to the sanction that17    you're challenging here.  I mean, you're saying they're18    doing well because they know if they go back in they're19    going to be there for life.  You want to eliminate that20    sanction, so I mean --21              (Laughter.)22              MR. STANSELL:  That's correct.23              QUESTION:  Well --24              MR. STANSELL:  There's no doubt about that.25              QUESTION:  It's not fair to rely on it, then.19               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR.

STANSELL:  That's correct.  If we were --dealing with the hypothetical we've been talking about,Your Honor?  Yes.  You know, all of these people are onnotice that they need to comply with the immigration laws,and they have no doubt, and they are not challenging inany way the Government's power to deport them, or thecircumstances under which they can be deported.          What they are just asking for is their right tobe free from bodily restraint pending that deportation.          May it please the Court, I'd like to reserve theremainder of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Stansell.          Mr. Barnard, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. BARNARD           ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER ZADVYDAS          MR. BARNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:20         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              Four-and-a-half decades ago Mr. Zadvydas came to 2    this country as a stateless person.  He's stateless today, 3    and in all probability he will remain that way for the 4    rest of his life.  Because of this, the Government was 5    unable to deport him. 6              QUESTION:  Are there no ongoing negotiations -- 7    I got the impression from the briefs that there had been 8    efforts both to Lithuania and some other country, and 9    neither of them had presently admitted him, but that it10    was not regarded as completely hopeless.11              MR. BARNARD:  Your Honor, as a factual matter,12    the only thing that has happened in the last 2 years that13    I know of is that Mr. Zadvydas wrote a letter to the14    consulate in Chicago seeking some citizenship papers, or15    granting him citizenship, and other than that nothing has16    happened in the last 2 years.17              At issue in this case, the constitutional issue18    in this case, is that people who enter this country are19    regarded as persons under the Constitution once they20    enter.  That is the rule that pertains.  The exception to21    that rule is a very narrow exception which is called the22    entry fiction, which is applied to people who are detained23    or interdicted at the border, and what the Government is24    proposing here is to have the exception swallow the rule.25              They go even a step further by relying on the21               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mezei case, which is even more unique than the way theentry fiction is usually employed.  In Mezei -          QUESTION:  Excuse me.  They -- are they reallygoing that far?  I don't think they are.  I think they'reacknowledging that these individuals have to be releasedif there's no threat to the general public from them andif there's no doubt that they can be -- that they won'tflee, and they can be found and deported if and when acountry can be found to send them to.          The Government acknowledges all of that, andunder Mezei you wouldn't have to let these people out atall, even if you knew that they wouldn't flee, and even ifyou knew that they might possibly pose a threat to thepublic, isn't that right?  That's how I understand Mezei.          MR. BARNARD:  Well --          QUESTION:  So they're not going as far asextending Mezei to these people entirely.          MR. BARNARD:  Well, I think they are, but as faras the constitutional deprivation that's being imposedhere, they're confining people indefinitely, potentiallyfor life, based on a finding of dangerousness and/or afinding of a flight risk, and --          QUESTION:  There have to be those findings, andin Mezei there don't have to be those findings.          MR. BARNARD:  But all other persons in this                            22         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    country can be released if the detention is based solely 2    on dangerousness, and so they're treating -- 3              QUESTION:  They're treating them differently -- 4              MR. BARNARD:  Differently than the rest of the 5    people in this country -- 6              QUESTION:  Right. 7              MR. BARNARD:  -- which is why they are extending8 Mezei - 9              QUESTION:  I understand --10              MR. BARNARD:  -- and Mezei is --11              QUESTION:  They're extending it, but I think it12    goes too far to say that the exception has swallowed the13    rule and that they're just covering everybody with the14    Mezei rule.  I think this rule is a good deal more limited15    than Mezei.16              MR. BARNARD:  This Court in Plasencia had17    someone who was much more analogous to the person in18    Mezei.  Mezei left the country, tried to return.  In19    Plasencia, the lady involved in that case left and tried20    to return, and this Court did not see a need to extend21    Mezei in that situation, in fact, accorded Ms. Plasencia22    her due process rights, and that's essentially all that23    we're asking here for --2425 felony. QUESTION:  Yes, but she hadn't committed any23ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. BARNARD:  She was in the process of 2    committing a crime when she entered the country, Your 3    Honor. 4              QUESTION:  Well, but your clients have committed 5    independent felonies. 6              MR. BARNARD:  Yes, and I would get back to the 7    point I made a moment ago, which is that they're being 8    treated differently than any other class of persons under 9    the Constitution in this country.  We're now not according10    them the same degree of constitutional rights we would11 some else.12              QUESTION:  Well, but I don't think the13    Constitution requires you to treat people who have done14    particular things the same way as people who have not done15    those things.16              MR. BARNARD:  But what we're saying, Your Honor,17    is, if you take another person in this country who has a18    felony conviction, and he's determined to be dangerous,19    but only dangerous and not some other element, not the20    other element that we find in Kansas v. Hendricks, a21    mental abnormality, simply dangerous like the individual22    in Foucha, that person would be entitled to release.23              QUESTION:  But that person is not an alien, and24    the Government has much more power over aliens than it25    does over citizens.24               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1              MR. BARNARD:  Which is another reason, perhaps,2    that release would be more called for in this instance,3    because the Court -- the Government is not without4    recourse with aliens if they violate their terms of5    supervision.6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          We're not asking for Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas tohave the same freedom that a citizen would have.  Theywould be under supervision. If they violated the terms ofthat supervision they could be punished for up to 1 yearfor failing to abide by the terms of the supervision, andthey could be punished up to 10 years if that misbehaviorwas seen as obstructing the actual deportation process.          QUESTION:  Can they be detained, under yourview, for a reasonable time after the 90-day period?          MR. BARNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe thetest, the civil and regulatory detention test had aweighing analysis built into them.          QUESTION:  All right.  In determining thereasonableness of the more lengthy detention period, do wetake into account the fact that there are reviewprocedures, and that the Government under its regulationshas to give periodic review?          MR. BARNARD:  Yes, I believe you would take thatinto the consideration.          QUESTION:  That's part of the reasonableness --                            25         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. BARNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- calculation.          MR. BARNARD:  But --          QUESTION:  Well, are not those periodic reviewprocedures in place now because of the regulations?          MR. BARNARD:  Well, they're in place, but allthey're really considering are dangerousness and flightrisk.  The Government contended in its brief that thenewest regulation which is now in effect --          QUESTION:  Well, but that's the basis -- that'sthe rationale for the detention.          MR. BARNARD:  I understand that, Your Honor,but -- and that's the position of Mr. Ma and Mr. Zadvydas,is that the way the regulation is constructed, it violatesa basic -- the basic right to substantive due process.          QUESTION:  So you say they can be held for areasonable period of time, but that an element of thedetention is not the fact that they're a danger to the10111213141516171819    community.202122232425          MR. BARNARD:  Well, that's one of the elements,Your Honor, but          QUESTION:  It is or is not one of the elements?          MR. BARNARD:  It is one of the elements to beconsidered, but --          QUESTION:  Well, if it's one of the elements to                            26         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    be considered, and there's a periodic review, then why2    isn't that reasonable under the definition we're3    discussing?4              MR. BARNARD:  Because it doesn't consider the5    likelihood of deportation or the duration of detention,6    Your Honor.  People are being detained solely because7    either they're a flight risk and/or they're a danger,8 so -- 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  So you could detain a person for,say, 6 extra months because he's dangerous, but not afterthat, or a year?          MR. BARNARD:  Well, you could detain him for areasonable period.  I don't have an exact time period orbright line test.          QUESTION:  If the reason for the detentioncontinues, I don't understand the basis on which you saythat you're entitled to release.          MR. BARNARD:  Well --          QUESTION:  Either they can't detain him for anyperiod at all because he's dangerous, or they can detainhim during the period that he's dangerous, it seems to me,and you're somehow splitting the difference.  I don'tunderstand how you do that.          MR. BARNARD:  What we're saying is, Your Honor,that if you found someone to be dangerous -- and the Ninth27         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    Circuit says in its opinion that it would depend on the 2    circumstances of each case. 3              If someone had a shoplifting conviction and they 4    were detained for 90 days, or 120 days, and it wasn't 5    reasonably foreseeable they'd be deported, perhaps that 6    would be a reasonable period to release them, but if 7    someone had a more serious conviction, I believe a 8    district court could hold them somewhat longer. 9              But if you're asking for a time period, I would10    suggest that the traditional time periods when the statute11    was silent -- the 1970 statute, it was 2 to 4 months, the12    statute in the fifties was 6 months -- and that would be a13    guidepost, but at some point you could not detain them14    beyond that, because the person is being held merely based15    on the fact that he's dangerous, and he's being treated in16    a manner that is different than any other person in this17    country.  We don't have one set of constitutional rules18    for citizens and another set for --19              QUESTION:  Under your view, it seems to me that20    you cannot detain him for even 1 day on the grounds that21    he's a danger to the community, after the 90-day period --2223              MR. BARNARD:  Well, I believe the --24              QUESTION:  -- and I just don't think you've25    explained that.28               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. BARNARD:  Well, I believe the Ninth Circuit 2    said it would depend on the circumstances of each case, 3    and the example I would give is the one I just did,4 that -- 5              QUESTION:  Mr. Barnard -- 6              QUESTION:  If you're appealing to the 7    proposition that you just said you were appealing to, that 8    you can't treat aliens any different from American 9    citizens in this regard, then you -- Justice Kennedy has10    to be right.  You shouldn't be able to hold him for any11    period just because you're worried that he'll commit12    another crime.  I mean, surely that's the way we treat13    citizens.  You can't hold a citizen in jail because you're14    worried he's going to commit a crime.15              MR. BARNARD:  Well, Your Honor --16              QUESTION:  So you have to be appealing to17    something a little less than the proposition that you have18    to treat aliens like citizens.19              MR. BARNARD:  Well, Your Honor, we would submit20    that the Government is not without recourse in these21    situations.  If you have someone that is truly more22    dangerous, someone like a Hendricks in Kansas v.23    Hendricks, there would be nothing preventing the24    Government from having the State they're located in25    instituting civil --29               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Barnard, may I just interrupt you 2    there, because I think that you are now departing from 3    what you said you were adhering to.  I think the Ninth 4    Circuit said there are two factors here, and one of them 5    is, can this person be deported within a reasonably 6    foreseeable time?  Once you're sure that the answer to 7    that question is no, that's the end of the inquiry. 8               I don't think that they were making any 9    determination based on -- what they said is, people serve10    their time, we let them out.  We don't take into account11    how dangerous they are in any other setting.  Therefore,12    the only legitimate consideration is, does the Government13    have a reasonable expectation that they would be able to14    find a place to accept this person.15              Once it's clear that that's not in the cards,16    then it isn't -- at least the Ninth Circuit view is, it17    doesn't depend upon how dangerous this person is.  Am I18    right in understanding that?19              MR. BARNARD:  All that I can say in answer to20    your question, Your Honor, is that the Ninth Circuit did21    say that there could be a period after that, depending on22    the circumstances of the case, and that's my recollection.23              QUESTION:  I thought one part of the opinion24    said, if you know that there is no hope of finding25    somebody to take him, you have to let him out at the end30               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    of the 90-day  period. 2              MR. BARNARD:  I think the opinion is somewhat 3    self-contradictory, but I do recall there was language in 4    there that you could hold them for some period after that5 time. 6              QUESTION:  For what purpose, and the purpose7 was -- 8              MR. BARNARD:  To determine if it would -- if9 there was --1011 him. 1213    that they would be removed, and I think your question14    comes down to what is reasonable, or what is reasonably15    foreseeable, and it may vary a little bit from someone who16    is extremely dangerous to someone who is a shoplifter, but17    it would not be a lengthy period of time.18              QUESTION:  Mr. Barnard, wouldn't the19    foreseeability be considerably affected by the rule that20    you're urging upon us?  If I were the minister of21    interior, whoever is responsible for making these22    determinations in the Federal Republic of Germany, let us23    say, and the United States wants to send back the person24    that they say is a German citizen, who is obviously a bad25    actor and he's committed a lot of crimes, and that fits31               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOQUESTION:  If there's somebody that could takeMR. BARNARD:  If it was reasonably foreseeable 1    the description of at least one of the two here, I would 2    not be very much inclined to say, oh yes, he is a German 3    citizen, send him back. 4              Now, I might be inclined to do that if I knew 5    that the poor devil is not going to be allowed into the 6    general population, that his choice is to be kept in 7    detention in the United States. You're loading the dice 8    against anybody being willing to take back bad actors. 9    Why should they do it?  The consequence of not taking them10    back is, they'll just be released in the general public in11    the United States instead of in the Federal Republic of12 Germany.13              MR. BARNARD:  Well, Your Honor, I believe the14    statute has some other provisions which were noted in the15    briefs where we can withhold visas, or take actions of16    that nature.17              QUESTION:  I'm talking about the impact upon the18    foreign countries that we are trying to extradite these19    people to, or deport these people to.  It has to have an20    effect upon them if they know that the effect of their21    saying no is really not very much hardship on the22    individual that's involved.23              MR. BARNARD:  Well, Your Honor, I would just24    point out that in every immigration case there's another25    country involved, but we don't go to the extent of32               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    violating a person's rights to further the immigration -- 2    and the two examples would be Wong Wing and Witkovich. 3    There were other countries involved in those cases, and 4    not only did this Court reach the constitutional issue, 5    but resolved it in the alien's favor. 6              So if there were some attenuated foreign policy 7    interest there, I would say that this Court in previous 8    cases has not allowed that -- 9              QUESTION:  I also assume that one of the things10    that induces these foreign countries to take them back is11    lobbying and pressure from the individual himself and from12    his family, and they have a great incentive to do that if13    the consequence of Germany's not taking him back is that14    he's going to remain under restriction, as here, but if15    that is not the case, what incentive in the world would16    they have to induce the Federal Republic of Germany to17    take him back?  If they don't take him back, he will have18    achieved exactly what he wants, which is to stay in the19    United States.20              MR. BARNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.  Again, this21    Court just has not allowed the attenuated interest to22    determine the constitutional question in cases where --23    it's always going to be present in the case with an24    immigrant, because there's always going to be another25    country, even --33               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  May I ask, just as a matter ofclarification, if this -- if your client were a Germancitizen, would Germany have the option to take him or lethim stay here, or would they not be obligated to take him?          MR. BARNARD:  I think under the reductionconvention they do not have to take him back, but I'm --obviously --          QUESTION:  Yes.  So really the question whetherhe gets back or not depends on whether he's a citizen ofthe country that they want to deport him to.          MR. BARNARD:  If he's stateless, which my clientis, there's a special --          QUESTION:  They can define him to be a citizenor not to be a citizen.  I mean, that's a judgment to bemade by the authorities in Germany.          MR. BARNARD:  Well, if they find him not to be acitizen, if they find him to be stateless they don't haveto take him back.          QUESTION:  Well, you're not assuming that theGermans just do this willy nilly, and they don't haverules that decide whether these people are citizens or          MR. BARNARD:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  I assume he either is or he isn't,under the law of that country.34         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO10111213141516171819202122    not.2324 25 1              MR. BARNARD:  Well, I -- 2              QUESTION:  If he is with a country with whom we 3    have an expatriation treaty, then there isn't any 4    discretion on that country's side, any  more than there 5    would be on our side in the reverse situation, so you're 6    talking about countries with which we have no agreement. 7              MR. BARNARD:  Or the person's status is -- 8              QUESTION:  Is stateless. 9              MR. BARNARD:  Stateless, yes.10              QUESTION:  Mr. Barnard --11              QUESTION:  But status depends upon a lot of12    facts that require to be determined and which may be13    disputed, which is the case in at least one of these two14    cases, the facts of how long he was in that country, or15    what his ancestry was, and so forth.  There are always16    those disputes, or there are often those disputes.17              MR. BARNARD:  Well, it gets back to what is18    reasonable and I would just suggest to the Court that the19    Government at this point is somewhat less than sanguine20    that he's going to be taken anywhere, because the only21    effort that's been made in the last 2 years is to have him22    send a letter, so he is now, the State Department23    negotiating with countries.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Barnard, would you be making your25    same argument and seeking release if the Government were35               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425holding someone like your client in a detention center asopposed to a prison facility, or were ordered to remain inhis own house and not leave it?          MR. BARNARD:  I would not be making the sameargument if it was a house, if there was electronicmonitoring, if it was a half-way house.          QUESTION:  How about a detention center of somekind, as opposed to a prison?          MR. BARNARD: I think that would turn on thecondition --          QUESTION:  Where it's not a criminal facility.          MR. BARNARD:  Well, I think it would turn on theconditions of detention centers, and being a criminallawyer --          QUESTION:  But that would be a very differentquestion --          MR. BARNARD:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- conditions.          MR. BARNARD:  Well, being a criminal lawyer,I've never seen one that looked particularly appealing tothe average person, so I just can't imagine that thatwould be the case.          Getting back to some other aspects of Mezei,which I did want to bring the Court's attention -- I seemy time is almost up.  I would point out that the36         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    Government's theory in this case is that once the 2    deportation order becomes final, the individuals are 3    stripped of their constitutional rights. 4              Both in Wong Wing and Witkovich deportation 5    orders were final and the individuals were not stripped of 6    their constitutional rights.  In fact, this Court reached 7    those issues and decided in favor of the alien. 8              I would also point out that Mezei really should 9    be limited to its unique set of facts.  I mean, there were10    all kinds of national security concerns at play in that11    case, which are not at all determinative in either Mr.12    Ma's and Mr. Zadvydas --13              QUESTION:  Well, aren't national security14    concerns always at stake when we're talking about15    immigration policy?16              MR. BARNARD:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I17    don't think in Wong Wing national security was at issue.18    He was just being removed because he was here illegally.19              QUESTION:  Well, but the whole idea of control20    of the borders is based on national security.21              MR. BARNARD:  No, that's national sovereignty I22    think you're referring to, Your Honor.  I'm referring to23    the fact that Mr. Mezei conducted himself in such a way to24    raise suspicion, as if he were, say, a spy for the Soviet25    Union.  That's the national security issue that I'm37               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425referring to.          If there are no further questions, I think I'llreserve time for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Barnard.          Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF              RESPONDENTS IN NO. 99-7791 AND                 PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-38          MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Congress in the exercise of its plenaryauthority over immigration enacted section 1231(a)(6) in196 -- 1996 to afford the Attorney General the authorityto detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the 90-dayremoval period if they cannot be removed to theircountries of nationality or to some other country duringthat 90-day period.          That enactment was the culmination of measuresbeginning in 1988 by which Congress sought to address whathad become the serious problem of criminal aliens withinthe United States.  It was enacted against a background ofinformation in 1996 in particular, about both the highrate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as thevery high rate of flight among aliens who are released.          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, may I ask just one                            38         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- on that point?  Does your case,your submission depend on an assumption that these peopleare more dangerous than citizens who have committedprecisely the same crime?          MR. KNEEDLER:  It does not, no, but what I --the important element, though, is that futuredangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detainsomeone.  Under this Court's civil commitment cases, andthis does not remotely resemble civil commitment becauseit's an exercise of Congress' plenary power overimmigration, but one of the bases on which someone may becivilly committed is their potential dangerousness.  Now,the Court --          QUESTION:  That is not a --          QUESTION:  There's always a plus.  I mean, thiscase is different from that, because now you're relying onfuture dangerousness, period.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  That's --          QUESTION:  Not mental abnormality, not a shorttime until trial.  This is really a first, and I don'tthink you mean to walk away from that, so it's not likeSalerno, and it's not like Hendricks.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it is in this important                            39         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425respect, and I think this is a critical factor tounderstanding this case.  What the Court said inHendricks, for example, is that in the civil commitmentcases the Court has said it's dangerousness plus someother factor, such as mental illness.          Here we have a critical other factor, inaddition to dangerousness, and that is that both Mr. Maand Mr. Zadvydas in this case had had their right toremain in this country extinguished.          QUESTION:  That's the question.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Pardon me?          QUESTION:  That's the question.  We agree it's acivil statute.  How many days after the 90 in these twocases would you say that there is a factor involved of notknowing whether you could find a country for them?          MR. KNEEDLER:  In our submission the detentionof the aliens is reasonably related to the basis fordetention, as long as there is a basis for concern aboutthreat to the community and removal.          QUESTION:  No, no, I'm just trying to figureout, though -- I'm trying to figure out what the issue isin this case, and I'm having some trouble, because I wantto know -- to separate out the problem that you're justtalking about, risk of crime --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.                            40         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:   -- I'd like to know -- think of 90as beginning --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.          QUESTION:  And how many extra days before itbecame clear that no country will take them?          MR. KNEEDLER:  It is not clear now.          QUESTION:  If it's not clear now, then what isit that we're supposed to be deciding?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --          QUESTION:  Because at that moment, if it's notclear now, there is involved in both of these cases thequestion of whether it would be reasonable to maintainthem simply to be sure they're around if you find a1011121314    country.1516171819202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  That, and in addition, because ofthe potential for dangerousness to the community.          QUESTION:  What I'm trying to figure out is, isthat question in front of us?  Do you deny the following,that this statute does not give authority to hold an alienbeyond a reasonable time?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --          QUESTION:  You think it does?  Do you think --in other words, are you saying, is it the Government'sposition that the statute gives the authority to put analien, after 90 days -- to hold him beyond a reasonable41         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 time? 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  I'd like to answer that in tworespects.  I do not believe there is any reasonable timelimitation within the statute.  On the other hand, itdepends what you mean, what could be comprehended withinthe determination of reasonableness.  I mean, forexample --          QUESTION:  All right, so take your secondanswer, because that has two parts, your first saying wewon't hold him beyond a reasonable time, but what do welook at in deciding reasonableness?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, in this case theattorney --          QUESTION:  Is that -- am I right?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  All right.          MR. KNEEDLER:  The Attorney General hasimplemented this statute in a way -- maybe the AttorneyGeneral had broader authority to detain someonepermanently without ever releasing someone, but theconstitutional question before the court, and thestatutory question for that matter, has to be analyzed interms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise ofhis discretion in establishing a review procedure underwhich the alien is subject to periodic review to determine42         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight.          QUESTION:  Are you satisfied with this holding:on the merits, this statute means no one should be heldbeyond a reasonable time.  Reasonable time is related towhether there's another country available, but inaddition, where that's unclear the court can take accountof the risk that he poses to the community?          MR. KNEEDLER:  I do not agree with it in thisrespect.  We do not believe it is for the courts todetermine whether, at least in the first instance andwithout a high degree of deference to the Attorney Generalas to whether there is another country to whom the alienmight conceivably be returned in the future.          QUESTION:  Well, but are you conceding that thatis relevant to the --          MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm not.  I"m not.          QUESTION:  I assume you're saying that ifanother country can't be found, and even once it's certainthat another country can't be found, the Attorney Generalcan still refuse to release this person into the generalpopulation as long as there is a threat of flight or of --          MR. KNEEDLER:  That is our position, but I wouldlike to say something about the two aliens in this case,just to show that we're not even near that position.          Contrary to Mr. Zadvydas's counsel's position                            43         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    that nothing has been done with respect to him recently, 2    we point out at page 48, footnote 22 of our brief, facts 3    have happened after the letter that he referred to that 4    Mr. Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate. 5              As we point out in that brief, the INS twice 6    last summer called Mr. Zadvydas in for an appointment, 7    after he asked that that appointment be postponed, so it 8    could be explained to him what information the INS had 9    obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what10    information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for11    citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his12 parents.13              On both instances, he did not show up for the14    appointment, so he is not cooperating with the known15    procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has16    identified as germane to the question of whether he would17    be granted citizenship.18              QUESTION:  That would be separately19    sanctionable, would it not?  Somebody who -- if you just20    had the portion of the statute that says you can hold this21    person under supervision, and that person in supervision22    did not do what he was told to do, that's independently23    sanctionable, is it -- would it not be?24              MR. KNEEDLER:  It is, but the important purpose25    of the detention here is to protect the community as a44               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    prophylactic matter, not simply to take measures against 2    someone after the fact. 3              Now, having said that, under the regulations 4    that I've described, even before the formal regulations 5    went in place in December, up to 50 percent of the people 6    who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were 7    in place were released during that period of time, so 8    these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity -- 9              QUESTION:  How many of those 50 percent had10    previously been determined to be dangerous to the11    community?12              MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm not -- well, all of them, or13    almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted14    of a crime.  Most of the people detained in this category15    have a criminal history, maybe a few who do not, but the16    two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a17    crime in which they had all of the procedures to which18    they were entitled in determining that, and this Court has19 said --2021    presumably.22              MR. KNEEDLER:  They have, but as this Court23    pointed out in the Jones case, which was discussed in24    Foucha, it is permissible for a State to presume25    continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime,45               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOQUESTION:  And they had served their sentences, 1    and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence 2    does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness. 3              QUESTION:  What case of ours do you think best 4    supports your position of the validity of this scheme? 5              MR. KNEEDLER:  Oh, I think there are several.  I 6    think the Mezei case does. 7              QUESTION:  But didn't that involve more aliens 8    who can be rejected on entry? 9              MR. KNEEDLER:  But it is our submission that10    once an alien has been ordered removed from the country,11    as both of the aliens here have been -- not only have they12    had a criminal conviction, with all the protection that13    affords, but they have -- are subject to final orders of14    removal under an administrative process in which that had15    be proven by clear and convincing evidence.16              The procedures are unquestioned in this case.17    The consequence of the final order of removal --18              QUESTION:  But Mr. Kneedler, isn't there a vast19    difference between saying, if a person -- partly20    fictional -- has never been in the country at all, he has21    never acquired the protection of the Constitution, isn't22    that quite different from saying that a person who has23    acquired that protection, simply because an order of24    deportation has been entered, he totally loses the25    protection?  Isn't there a difference between the two?46               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. KNEEDLER:  There's not, and if I may explain 2    why, there is no difference from the point of view of the 3    status or the interests of the alien, there is no 4    difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the 5    United States, and there is no difference -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, there's a big difference in 7    being, say, in Seattle, Washington, and Ellis Island, 8    never being able to get off the island. 9              MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm speaking of the legal status10    of the alien, and the third is with respect to the11    interests of the United States.12              With respect to the status of the alien, it's13    important to consider the consequences of a final order of14    removal.  It is not simply an order of removal.  It also15    terminates the person's status as a lawful, permanent16 resident.17              QUESTION:  Well, may I go back to that question18    Mr. Kneedler, because there's an issue that's come up.  I19    think it's inherent in Justice Stevens' question, and I20    think it was raised by your response to Justice Ginsburg's21    Hendricks question, and I think it's focused by one of the22    green briefs, amicus briefs filed by, I think it was a23    group of law professors, and they said, what's wrong with24    the Government's argument that the order of deportation25    converts the individual back to the status of someone who47               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    has not yet been admitted is this: The status, the 2    constitutional status of the individual who has never been 3    admitted rests upon a patent fiction, and the patent 4    fiction is that the individual is not in the United 5    States, when we all know that the individual is in the 6    United States.  Illegally, yes, but in the United States, 7    and the Fourteenth Amendment does not distinguish between 8    citizens and others in this respect. 9              It may very well be that that legal fiction is a10    very justifiable fiction, because otherwise the United11    States is defenseless against Mariel boat lifts and things12    like that, but it's another thing, as Justice Stevens'13    question suggests, to extend that legal fiction and say14    that the legal fiction takes you one step more, and that15    is, we're going to now assume that an entire further class16    of individuals, in fact, is not in the United States and17    is not subject to whatever the territorial claim that the18    Fourteenth Amendment seems to respect.19              What is your answer to the problem of extending20    legal fictions, because, what's in back of my mind is, in21    the back of my mind is, if legal fictions can support this22    restriction back on whatever the rights of persons are,23    then I suppose other legal fictions could accomplish the24    same purpose for other classes, so what is your response25    to the problem of legal fictions?48               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. KNEEDLER:  If I may, this does not rest on alegal fiction.          The first thing I would like to point out is,just to finish the -- because this is important toanswering the question -- to finish the consequences of afinal order of removal, the first thing it does, as Imentioned, is, it terminates the status of an alienlawfully admitted for permanent residence --          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- which is defined as aprivilege of being lawfully admitted, such status nothaving changed, and as we point out in our brief --          QUESTION:  Well, but that's a statutory1011121314    definition.1516171819202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right,  but then the furtherconsequence is, under 1182(a)(9) of the act, the alien isinadmissible for 10 years, or, in the case of anaggravated felon like these, for 20 years, so that --          QUESTION:  Fine, but --          MR. KNEEDLER:  So that person is --          QUESTION:  Inadmissible, but nonetheless hasbeen admitted.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But what I -- the point I'mtrying to make is, in terms of his legal status he is inexactly the same legal status under the laws Congress has49         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    passed to protect this Nation as someone who is at the 2    border, someone who has no rights -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, that may very -- I don't doubt 4    that that is true so far as legal definitions are 5    concerned, but that doesn't drive the constitutional 6    inquiry.  The constitutional inquiry in effect says, yes, 7    we'll accept the legal fiction that the person who has 8    never been admitted is, in fact, not in the United States, 9    but now you want that same process -- and there may be a10    justification for it.  We might have found a more candid11    way of doing it, but I can see the justification.  You now12    want to extend that fiction to somebody who has been in13    the United States for quite sometime and is still here,14    and the fact that the statute may by definition say,15    they're the same, obviously doesn't control the16    constitutional inquiry.17              MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it does not, but the18    important thing about -- the important thing to consider19    if you look at someone like Mezei, who was here for 2520    years, and went abroad for I think 19 months before he21    came back in, the Court said that he was an arriving22    alien, even though he had a long time in this country, but23    the important point is that Mezei was about procedure, and24    what the Court was relying on in the so-called entry25    fiction there was the fact that it was the Court sustained50               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    the authority of the Attorney General to keep him excluded 2    on the basis of classified evidence that was never shown 3    to the alien. 4              Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei 5    rejected the notion that there was a substantive due 6    process problem with detaining Mezei -- 7              QUESTION:  Well, whether there is or is not a 8    substantive due process problem, it seems to be the case 9    that you still want to respond to the substantive due10    process argument by saying that the people who have been11    admitted ordered deported are exactly in the same status12    for constitutional purposes as those who have never been13 admitted.                MR. KNEEDLER:  And here --14151617181920212223    removal.2425          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, we often determine whatprocedures are due on the basis of legal status, don't we?51         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  If one is a fiction, the second is agreater one.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No -- and the other part ofMezei, that was the part of Mezei that depended on theentry fiction, but the other part of Mezei is, he had noliberty interest to be at large in the United States, andour point is that that liberty interest to be at large inthe United States was extinguished by the final order of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425You're saying legal status here is the same because thelaw changes.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  Citizens have a different legalstatus from aliens, and they are entitled to greaterconstitutional protections, right?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Absolutely --          QUESTION:  I agree there are --          QUESTION:  Resident aliens have different legalstatus from nonresident aliens, and so forth, so there'snothing extraordinary --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Not at all.  I --          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, I don't follow this atall, frankly, because I thought the so-called entryfiction, there was a benign aspect of that.          In other words, this person has no right to setfoot on U.S. land, but we're going to be kind to thatperson and not dump them in the sea.  We could say, you'reexcludable, so -- but as the kind of price for saying, oh,we're going to let you set foot on land and not drown inthe sea or starve to death, but we're going to treat youas though you never came in, and that's a fiction, butit's a benign fiction, because the alternative is, we dumpyou in the sea.          It's quite different when you're talking about                            52         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    someone who was here, who was part of the community, and 2    who has, as you say -- in your brief I think you say, yes, 3    they are persons, and the Constitution says, nor shall any 4    person be denied due process, so it's quite different. 5              QUESTION:  We're not dumping them in the sea,6 are we? 7              MR. KNEEDLER:  That was exactly the point I was 8    going to make.  One could make the same point here with 9    respect to the removal of an alien who was previously10    here, and whose right to remain here has been11    extinguished.12              The United States would not do this, but one way13    to remove the alien from the United States would be to put14    him on a boat, or to insist that he find a county and,15    unless he finds a country he will be detained here.16              QUESTION:  I take it what we're arguing about17    now, or discussing, is whether the Attorney General has18    the right to put this person in custody for his entire19    life solely on the basis of risk, and I'm not sure that20    this case really raises that, but if it does, so be it,21    and my question to you would be simply this.22              Is there any precedent at all, where the23    Constitution, which says no person shall be deprived of24    liberty without due process of law, justifies putting a25    sane human being in the United States, depriving him of53               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425his liberty forever on the basis of an administrativeorder, no judge, no jury, no judicial process?          I just can't think of an instance, and I wouldbe surprised if other countries with similar systems dosuch a thing, depriving a person of his liberty forever,on the basis simply of an administrative order, so what isthe precedent?          MR. KNEEDLER:  There's not a precedent, putthis -- put that way, but if I may respond, the basis forthe removal order in this case were criminal convictions,in which the aliens' criminal trials --          QUESTION:  I have no doubt you could do that asa criminal punishment.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But --          QUESTION:  Is that what we're talking about?That's a judicial process.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but you said where the basisfor the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial.Here, there was a criminal trial.          QUESTION:  No, no, my problem is the problemthat judicial due process, normally means judicial processwhere you are depriving a person of liberty.  I can't --it's very hard to think of instances -- well, I'd berepeating my question, but I mean, I have no problem,because if you're talking about the criminal process, it's54         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112    detention.13              This was something that the Court found to be a14    permissible factor in both Foucha and in -- and15    particularly in Jones, where the Court said that there16    could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject17    to rebuttal by the individual, which is exactly what we18 have here.19              QUESTION:  Yes, but we're trying to explore what20    precedent of this Court comes closest to saying that,21    based on the prior conviction of someone who was lawfully22    here at the time of that conviction, can the Government,23    by administrative order, detain the person indefinitely24    because of dangerousness.  What case do you rely on?25              QUESTION:  Other than Mezei.55               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOa criminal punishment administered by a judge and a jury,so if you're saying that's what's at issue here, I'm rightwith you.here --My problem is that that's not what's at issueMR.

KNEEDLER:  Okay.          QUESTION:  I know there are lots of questions,but I want you to answer this one --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Okay.          QUESTION:  -- if you would.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Several.  The first is Fong YueTing, which says --          QUESTION:  Pardon me?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Fong, F-o-n-g, Yue, I think itis, Y-u-e, Ting, T-i-n-g, which says that Congress' powerover -- power to expel aliens, in other words to deportthem, is the same and is as absolute as Congress' power toexclude aliens, and we've set out the relevant quote inour brief in the Zadvydas case, which I believe is atpages 37 and 38.10111213141516171819202122    Mezei.23              The next line of cases that I would point to are24    cases, in particular, that -- civil commitment cases,          So I think that is an important constitutionalbasis for the point I was making earlier, that oncesomeone's right to remain here is extinguished, and he'sput back in that status, it is proper to equate them to25    where the Court has, I think, contemplated that there                                  56               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425could be subsequent determinations following on apresumption coming out of a criminal conviction ofcontinuing dangerousness.          QUESTION:  Yes, but were any of thosepresumptions operative on purely administrativedeterminations?  I would have thought not.  I mean, that'sJustice O'Connor's question.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but it seems to me anotherimportant point that the Court has said with respect toaliens, and this, I can't remember the case in particular,but the Court has said on a number of occasions thatCongress can commit the determination of immigrationmatters to the executive branch, and have determinationsmade --          QUESTION:  These cases involve deportation.  Ithink my question was precedent in respect to putting  aperson in prison --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I --          QUESTION:  -- and Fong Yue Ting, if I'm right,was a case where the Court was considering a law that saidyou had to have a credible, white witness for a Chineseperson to remain in the United States, is that right?          MR. KNEEDLER:  I believe that's correct.          QUESTION:  All right, so I'm not sure about thestrength of that precedent.57         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)          MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but with respect to itsfundamental point that the Congress --          QUESTION:  For deportation, I'll take that as --we're not considering --          QUESTION:  I think the case is in point, becauseas I understand your argument the basis for theGovernment's holding these people, to which you'reappealing, is not that the Government has the power tohold people who are dangerous.          MR. KNEEDLER: Precisely.          QUESTION:  What you're appealing to is theGovernment's power to keep out of the United States peoplewho have no right to be in the United States --          MR. KNEEDLER:  That is exactly --          QUESTION:  -- period.          MR. KNEEDLER:  That is --          QUESTION:  And it is your position, I assume,that even if they weren't dangerous, the United Stateswould not have to allow people who have no right to behere to wander at will throughout the United States.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, and the point is that1231(a)(6), enacted pursuant to Congress' plenary power,vests the release authority in the discretion of theAttorney General, and so it would be odd in that --58         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1              QUESTION:  And there's no provision for judicial2    review.3 4    We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held 5    subject to the Attorney General's authority under the 6    statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the 7    constitutionality of the detention, so if there is an8 argument -- 9              QUESTION:  But your argument here is, then you10    lose that.  Once you lose it here, there isn't -- in other11    words, if you're correct, there are these new regulations12    that you point to, but that's all in-house.  It would be13    no -- if you are successful today, in any one of these14    situations, be it a shoplifter, be it someone who15    overstayed a visa and encountered a nasty INS person, that16    person could be locked up forever without any access to a17    judge, because the only thing is whatever process the18    administrator has chosen to give.19              MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if there is  constitutional20    review of the individualized determination, it would only21    be along the lines of what the Supreme -- of what this22    Court said in Carlson and reiterated in Flores, which23    would be whether the Attorney General's determination was24    arbitrary.25 QUESTION:  Well, isn't there judicial review of                   59ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPOMR. KNEEDLER:  There is habeas corpus review. 1    the essential determination that you say gives the 2    Attorney General the power here, and that is the 3    determination that this person has no right to be in the 4    United States? 5              MR. KNEEDLER:  That is correct. 6              QUESTION:  There is full judicial review. 7              MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, and those -- 8              QUESTION:  And that's the source of your power. 9              MR. KNEEDLER:  That is right, so -- and the10    important point is for these purposes --11              QUESTION:  So you are saying, once that12    determination -- no right to be in the United States, and13    the reason is that you committed a felony, served your14    time.  You are saying, yes, after that there is no access.15              MR. KNEEDLER:  We're certainly not saying there16    is no access to habeas corpus, to challenge the17    constitutionality of the detention.18              QUESTION:  Because that's what this19    proceeding --20              MR. KNEEDLER:  I think you are correct the alien21    will, under our submission, lose at least, or in the22    exceptional case, in that circumstance, but that's because23    Congress has vested in the Attorney General the delicate24    question of deciding when an alien should be released and25 not.60               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              This -- in this area, like in so many areas of 2    immigration, this is intimately tied up with foreign 3    relations.  As we point in our briefs, with respect to Mr. 4    Ma, for example, we are engaged in negotiations with 5    Southeast Asian countries -- 6              QUESTION:  Is there any APA review of the 7    exercise of the Attorney General's discretion? 8              MR. KNEEDLER:  We believe there is not, that 9    under 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) of title VIII it bars judicial10    review of anything, any determinations that are committed11    to the discretion of the Attorney General.12              QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler --13              QUESTION:  Can I just focus on one thing that14    you were just pointing out?  I'll tell you exactly what my15    problem is.16              I agree with you that these former cases that17    you cited do give Congress tremendous power over18    deportation, whatever their facts, but to my mind, putting19    a person in jail, or in confinement for the rest of his20    life, however bad deportation is, this is a lot worse, and21    I can't find precedent to answer it, and I think you now22    agree there isn't precedent, and so aren't we left with23    just deciding, that seems so much worse, must there be24    judicial process, or is administrative process good25 enough?61               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. KNEEDLER:  Administrative process is goodenough, and the first and basic point is the one thatJustice Scalia said, which is that the most importantingredient of liberty interests at stake here wasextinguished, the right to be at large in the UnitedStates was extinguished in the administrative deportationproceeding --          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler --          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- subject to judicial review ifthe alien chose it, and the aliens in this case did notseek to challenge the extinguishment of their liberty101112    interests.13              QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, I would like to ask you14    a question right on the liberty interest point.  Do you15    read Mezei as merely holding that the person at the border16    has no liberty interest in roaming around, or is it rather17    that he is not a person within the meaning of the Fifth18    Amendment?19202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  I take it to be that there's noliberty interest, is my --          QUESTION:  What in the opinion -- and there'snothing in the opinion that talks in those terms.  He'sjust a person who has no right to be here.  He is not aperson protected by the Fifth Amendment --          MR. KNEEDLER:  But that I think cannot --                            62         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  -- because he's never got in the 2    United States. 3              MR. KNEEDLER:  That, I think, cannot be correct, 4    at least if one looks at Wong Wing, which prohibited the 5    service -- imprisonment and hard labor for someone who was 6    in the United States. 7              It is no part of our submission that an alien 8    who is illegally present, or who has been paroled into the 9    United States in a case like Mezei, is not a person for10    purposes of protection independent of the immigration11    laws, but it's quite a different matter to say that the12    Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress'13    plenary power to protect the United States, and the safety14    of the United States.15              One other point that I'd like to make, because16    it's important to bear in mind, protecting the safety of17    the citizens of the United States and the community is not18    ancillary to, or simply incidental to an immigration19    consequence.  It is part of the whole point of removal of20    the aliens in this situation, that they were, as Justice21    Scalia pointed out, essentially in this country22    conditioned upon their compliance with our laws.   They23    broke our laws, they committed crimes, and they -- and24    committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a25    danger to the community.63               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, you were explaining 2    something before and then got distracted from it.  You 3    said, it affects our negotiations with Cambodia, and I was 4    trying to think, how would it affect the negotiations 5    knowing -- how would the difference between putting 6    someone into prison and putting someone under close 7    supervision, how that would affect the relation, the 8    negotiating relationship of -- if the object is to keep 9    this person from doing harm, I understand that's one10    thing.  The other thing is our negotiating some kind of11    expatriation arrangement with Cambodia.  What is the12    relevant difference between holding that person in prison13    and holding them under close supervision?14              MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it is very likely to factor15    in to another country's calculus of how willing they will16    be to take someone back whether that person is in custody17    or not, because -- the Court pointed out in Mezei that18    Congress could reasonably conclude that when an alien such19    as Mezei arrives at our borders, that person is no more20    our problem than the other country s.21              With respect to an alien and his own country of22    nationality, his liberty is that country's responsibility,23    not ours, rather than ours.24              QUESTION:  But why would that country care -- I25    just don't see the clog in the negotiation.64               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- 2              QUESTION:  I see your point about a dictator who 3    dumps people on this country, that's the excludable class. 4              MR. KNEEDLER:  It goes beyond the excludable 5    class, because if a foreign dictator realized that he 6    could cause the release into this country at large of 7    nationals of that country simply by refusing to take 8    people back -- 9              QUESTION:  But of course, it's not involved with10    people in Ma's situation.  These are people who were11    lawfully admitted as resident aliens.12              MR. KNEEDLER:  But that status has been13    extinguished, and they have no right to remain here, and14    they do have a right under international law to --15              QUESTION:  Well, whatever you say about that, it16    doesn't -- these people, people in their category do not17    present the problem of dictators dumping people in the18    United States.  These people have been lawfully admitted19    into the United States.20              MR. KNEEDLER:  Maybe not dumping in the first21    instance, but what the refusal to take someone back -- and22    we -- for example, with respect to Cuba we have a number23    of people who have come to Cuba and are here lawfully who24    we want to remove from our midst, not simply those who25    were foisted upon us under the Mariel boat lift, and if we65               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    have a foreign dictator -- 2              QUESTION:  I'm just thinking in terms of your 3    foreign policy concerns that you put forward.  Speaking 4    with one voice to a dictator and saying, we're not going 5    to let you do this to us is quite different from saying, 6    yes, we welcomed this person in our midst, but that person 7    committed a crime, we don't want them any more. 8              MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it's we don't want them any 9    more, and it is your responsibility to take him back, and10    the pressures on that other country, not simply from the11    United States Government but from the alien himself, from12    human rights groups, from his family, are much greater for13    that other country to take him back when he's in14    detention.1516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  That's certainly true.  With thealien himself, it seems to me he has no incentivewhatever --          MR. KNEEDLER:  That's --          QUESTION:  -- to put any pressure on the foreignGovernment to take him back, or even to provide thedocuments necessary for that --          MR. KNEEDLER:  That is correct, as we've seen --          QUESTION:  -- if meanwhile he's wandering atlarge in the population.          MR.

KNEEDLER:  Pardon me?QUESTION:  I mean, that's -- you use thatexpression in your brief.  In fact, it's not wandering atlarge.  It's under close supervision, is the alternative.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it depends on -- a lot ofthe aliens here are not released.  I mean, they hadpreviously to report --          QUESTION:  That, certainly the Attorney Generalwould have discretion under the part of the statute --          MR. KNEEDLER:  The Attorney General -- first ofall, questions such as this we think are committed to thediscretion of the Attorney General.          As we point out in our brief, the AttorneyGeneral in issuing the final regulations in Decemberpointed out that INS had commissioned a study of othermethods for supervision of aliens who might safely bereleased to see if there's some middle ground, half-wayhouses and things like that, and the notice points outthat the INS is going to be expanding that program to seewhether there are alternatives, but --          QUESTION:  What is the issue in this case?  Ithought the issue in this case was whether he has to be67         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    released into the general population.  That's not the 2    case? Are we talking about only whether you could put him 3    under house arrest and -- 4              MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  The aliens in this case are 5    certainly not seeking house arrest.  They are seeking 6    being released under some degree of supervision, but they7 are -- 8              QUESTION:  What authority does that (a)(3) part 9    of the statute give the Attorney General, the part that's10    not being challenged, whatever?  I thought under11    supervision could be rather tight supervision.12              MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  We certainly think it would13    give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the14    person be released into a program, a half-way house or a15    drug treatment program, and that also is pointed out in16    the preamble to the new regulations, but we don't17 believe --18              QUESTION:  So that's certainly not, as Justice19    Scalia just described, at large, at liberty.  That is --20    could be a half-way house.21              MR. KNEEDLER:  It could be, but the questions of22    exactly what form of custody to keep an alien in, are23    mixed up with the broader responsibilities of the Attorney24    General under laws passed by Congress to administer the25    immigration laws in terms of what facilities someone68               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9111213141516171819202122232425should be kept in while they're being detained.          QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, what are the conditionsof the releases of the two litigants in this case now?          MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm not sure of all of them, butthere are periodic reporting requirements and not leavingthe jurisdiction.          QUESTION:  Is there any reason why those veryconditions that are in place now would not be adequate as      a general rule, subject to severe punishment if they were10    violated?          MR. KNEEDLER:  What the Attorney General hasconcluded is, for people who do not pose a threat to thecommunity -- reporting requirements are not going to stopsomeone from being a threat to the community.  They mayguard against flight, but they are a far more inadequateprotection against danger to the community.          QUESTION:  But insofar as you rely on threat tothe community, it's the same threat for the citizen whohad the same criminal history.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but the important -- thebalance of interest is completely different with respectto a citizen and an alien who not only --          QUESTION:  Why is the balance different ifyou're just relying on future dangerousness?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Because under Salerno, for                            69         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    example, the Court said that an individual's interest in2    liberty can be outweighed by important governmental3 interests.4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          There is a compelling interest in protecting thesafety of the community, but where the liberty interestthat is going to be --          QUESTION:  But you conceded earlier it's nostronger than it is for the average citizen.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But the countervailing libertyinterest is far, far less, to the extent the alien has anyremaining liberty interest, because his right to be atlarge in the United States has been extinguished.          QUESTION:  But in Salerno and in Hendricks andin these other situations where people are being held anddetained, there has been judicial review of that detentionorder, and there is no such provision here, is there?          MR. KNEEDLER:  There is not.  As we say, we'renot challenging --          QUESTION:  I think that is one difficulty withyour position.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, as we say, we're notchallenging the ability for habeas corpus review.  If thatwas an issue, the proper disposition would be to allow --          QUESTION:  No, but under your view, that has toautomatically be denied.  There simply is no opportunity70         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    here for judicial review of the determination of the 2    discretion of the Attorney General in reviewing the 3    conditions under which someone might be released with4 safety. 5              MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if there was going to be 6    judicial review, it would be along the lines of Carlson, 7    which is whether the Attorney General has exercised that 8    power arbitrarily.  We think there probably  might be a 9    constitutional component to that to the extent the Court10    concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at11    all.  That would be the proper way to address this, not to12    attack as a substantive due process matter, which is all13    that's here.14              QUESTION:  Well, if the regulations provide for15    periodic review --16              MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.17              QUESTION:  -- would Carlson allow judicial18    review of those periodic determinations?19              MR. KNEEDLER:  Under Carlson --20              QUESTION:  Did Carlson approach --21              MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I think under Carlson there22    was review of those individualized custody determinations.23              QUESTION:  Your questions presented don't raise24    the issue of judicial review one way or the other.25              MR. KNEEDLER:  No, that is absolutely correct,71               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    but the -- again, coming back to the central issue in this 2    case, all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney 3    General's detention pursuant to expressed statutory 4    authority is reasonably related to the goals that have 5    been advanced, and as long as the person was found by the 6    Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk, the 7    detention is reasonably related, and that detention is 8    subject to periodic, automatic review by the Attorney 9    General every year, and in intervening periods the alien10    can request a review of his status by presenting changed11    material circumstances.12              In that situation, we think that is a very13    reasonable response on behalf of the two political14    branches about how to deal with the severe problem of15    dangerous criminal aliens in our midst.16              It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of17    every nation to protect itself against aliens who that18    nation does not believe should be in its presence for19    purposes of national sovereignty, national security, but20    also the safety of the populace of that country, and that21    is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding22 to. 23242572               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          Safety is not simply a question to be addressedby the States.  When it comes to aliens in this country,it is Congress' responsibility, not that of the States, or 1    in addition to that of the States, to protect the populace 2    of the United States against the presence of dangerous 3    criminal aliens in the United States, and that is what has 4    been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and 5    administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied 6    due process, and the only remaining -- in terms of giving 7    Congress an interest with respect to aliens, it is the 8    equivalent of a State's interest with respect to the 9    mentally ill.10              In that situation, it is directly parallel to11    the interests of a State.  When does a State come in and12    intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an13    individual?  With respect to civil commitment, it is in14    the context of mental illness which gives the State a15    right to come in and look after the individual and protect16    the individual and the State.  With respect to aliens, it17    is Congress' plenary power.18              That has been satisfied.  That has been19    permanently extinguished, that liberty interest.  All that20    remains, then, is the question of dangerousness, and, as21    this Court has held in the civil commitment cases, a State22    may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no23    longer dangerous at the end of a particular period.24              There have been no questions here about the25    statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the73               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9aliens, but we think it is clear that the Attorney Generalhas that authority conferred by Congress.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.          Mr. Stansell, you and your colleague havereserved a little more than 1-1/2 minutes.  Why don't youuse it.     CONSOLIDATED REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY W. STANSELL    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT MA AND PETITIONER ZADVYDAS          MR. STANSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it10111213141516171819202122232425    risk.please the Court:          I have just four points I would like to make.The first is that the administrative process in this case.What 's fundamentally wrong about it, it takes absolutelyno consideration that deportation is not foreseeable.  Ifit did, and if the agency weighed foreseeability withactual and real evidence of dangerousness and flight risk,we would have no quarrel with the agency applying thatconstitutional test in reviewing these individuals.          Secondly, as I just said, the test in any casehas to be, is detention excessive in relationship to thelegitimate Government's interest, and we feel like thedistrict court in Mr. Ma's case had the proper test,balancing foreseeability of deportation withdangerousness, real evidence of dangerousness and flight74         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1              We would draw the line at, is deportation2    foreseeable, and say on balance everyone would get out on3    this case.  This Court may disagree, and want to allow a4    broader balancing test where actual foreseeability might5    be a gradiated scale and allow for different balances to6    be drawn, but in any case, that's the test that should be7 applied. 8910111213141516171819202122232425          Third, that there's no authority for this Courtto expand Mezei.  The decision in Wong Wing is over 100years, and that stands as a general rule that informs theMezei narrow exception.  Witkovich is similarly situated.Individuals who've been ordered deported did not losetheir constitutional rights.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Stansell.
