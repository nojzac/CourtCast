ENGLERT, JR.                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER            MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:            Sixty-six years elapsed between the passage of theRobinson-Patman Act and the judgment of the District Court inthis case.  In that time, there is no reported instance of afinding of a violation by a seller operating in an industry likethis one in which a sale is made to the plaintiff distributorif, and only if, it has already secured a contract for resale toa particular end user.  Courts have long understood that mereoffers at different prices cannot violate the Act, because itrequires two purchases, and that successful purchases inwinner-take-all bidding cannot have the requisite effect oncompetition.  To affirm the judgment below would open up newvistas for application of the Robinson-Patman Act where it hasnever been applied before.This case --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You concede, though, don'tyou, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conduct here?            MR. ENGLERT:  Very much the opposite, Your Honor.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you have a personwho's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the pricethat they offer to different purchasers.  Now, I know yourargument about the structure, but the actual language does seemto encompass the activity.MR. ENGLERT: Well, I don't agree, with respect, Your Honor. With respect to mere offers, offering a price to different purchasers is not covered by the statutory language. With respect to the sales-to-sales comparisons, there is not the requisite effect of such discrimination --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to --MR. ENGLERT: -- on competition.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- get to your first point,the statute talks about discrimination in price betweendifferent purchasers, and not different actual purchases.MR. ENGLERT: But this --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't seem it's thatmuch of a stretch to cover would-be purchasers, potentialpurchasers.            MR. ENGLERT:  Well, except that, back in 1947, thisCourt, in the Bruce's Juices case, made clear, in the early daysof the Act, that it takes two completed sales to violate theAct.  No one sale can violate the Act.  Even earlier than that,4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Third Circuit, in the Shaw's case, in 1939, laid down thatrule, and it's been an accepted rule of Robinson-Patman Actjurisprudence for that entire time.  And it is a natural readingof the statute, and in accordance with the general principle,that this statute should be construed consistently with thelarger body of antitrust law.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But may I not ask, Isn't it truethat each of the parties here, over a long period of time, was apurchaser?  I mean, the -- Reeder was a purchaser, was he not?They were a dealer.            MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, they were a purchaser.  Andwere not the other people who purchased from Volvo alsopurchasers?MR. ENGLERT: Yes. With respect to the sales- -- JUSTICE STEVENS: So there were --MR. ENGLERT: -- -to-sales transactions -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- two purchasers.MR. ENGLERT: Well, with respect to the sales-to-sales transactions in which there were --purchasers.JUSTICE STEVENS: Over a --MR. ENGLERT: -- two purchases --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- period of time, you had twoMR. ENGLERT: Yes. But the statutory language is 5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the effect of "such discrimination" must be to harm competition2 in one of these justified instances.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the discrimination occurred4 over a period of a couple of years, as I understand it.5 MR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. This case was tried6 on the basis of several discrete transaction comparisons. It7 was not tried on the basis of any systematic study of every8 offer to Reeder and every offer to --9 10 1112 dealers who13 were -- you14 15JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if --MR. ENGLERT: -- another --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- these are ordinary automobile sold out of inventory, would you agree that they had two purchasers?MR. ENGLERT: Sure.JUSTICE STEVENS: So that the whole point of your16 case is they're negotiated transactions?17 MR. ENGLERT: The whole point of the case is the --18 is twofold. Each transaction is one in which there is a19 purchase if, and only if, there is already a contract for20 resale, so that when there is an offer compared to a purchase,21 you don't have two purchases. And when you've already got the22 contract for resale --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- I mean, you say that,24 but the title goes to the dealer. The dealer makes the25 purchase. Aren't you -- as I understand your answer to Justice6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Stevens, and also your answer to the Chief Justice, if these2 were automobile dealers that sold some inventory, there would be3 a cause of action if you extrapolate this -- these kind of4 facts. One dealer being discriminated against, vis-a-vis5 another dealer.6 MR. ENGLERT: If the requisite effect on competition7 is shown, yes.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and if there was a sale to9 the other dealer. You would say that there had to be a sale to10 the other dealer.11 MR. ENGLERT: There have to be two sales.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just an --13 MR. ENGLERT: But there would --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not just an offer15 dealer --16 MR. ENGLERT: Correct.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- of higher prices.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there would19 they were selling from inventory. I mean, there would have been20 a preceding sale, and the sale would have been at differential21 prices, as between two dealers.22 MR. ENGLERT: And that's the typical --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.24 MR. ENGLERT: -- Robinson-Patman case. That's the25 case in which there is a potential violation. The case in which7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005to the otherbe sales if￼1 there is a sale by the purchaser if, but only if -- I'm sorry,2 the case in which there is a purchase by the purchaser if, but3 only if, it already has the sale is the case in which it can't4 have lost that sale in competition with a favored dealer because5 of price discrimination, which is what the statutory language6 requires, which is --7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert --8 MR. ENGLERT: -- why the Robinson-Patman Act --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- suppose you had a case of10 two Volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially11 ordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial12 period of time, one dealer -- we'll call that dealer the13 "favored dealer" -- consistently gets higher concessions, and14 the other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case,15 consistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions. So,16 we don't have a picture of what you call "mix and match," but17 two dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and18 one consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on19 sales or making sales at a very low profit. That, too, would be20 out of Robinson-Patman, if I understand your view of the21 statute.2223 That's a24 designed25 out of Robinson-Patman.8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005   MR. ENGLERT:  It -- yes, I think that's correct.closer case to what's the -- what the statute wasto cover than this case, but, yes, that, too, would be￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: So, you go back to the language -- are you finished with that answer? Go ahead and finish, if you want.MR. ENGLERT: Enough for now, Justice Breyer -- JUSTICE BREYER: All right.MR. ENGLERT: -- yes.JUSTICE BREYER: In respect to the language, how doyou read it? I think it's ambiguous. "To discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities." Do you read it -- "different purchaser" -- "to discriminate in price in respect to that commodity that is purchased"? Do you read it "to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities -- i.e., the commodity, the particular item -- the commodity there refers to the particular item in respect to which there is the discrimination"? How do you want to read it, literally? I just want your --MR. ENGLERT: Well --            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- literal reading of the statuteto -- I agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it.  Iagree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side.  Iagree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particularlanguage.  So, look at the phrase and read the language as youwant me to read it.            MR. ENGLERT:  Well, two different issues, JusticeBreyer.  With respect to the two-purchase rule, if the statutory9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 language is ambiguous, and if it can be read to say "purchaser2 status is enough," then I think the principle stated in all of3 this Court's cases, that the Robinson-Patman Act --4 JUSTICE BREYER: You're giving --5 MR. ENGLERT: -- should be construed --6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- me a policy argument. I don't7 want a policy argument, for the moment. I want to know -- what8 you're saying is that the word "purchaser" means "purchaser in9 respect to the particular commodity -- this one that is10 purchased, there has to be a discrimination in price."11 MR. ENGLERT: And there's a textual reason --12 JUSTICE BREYER: And what you're hearing, I think,13 is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect14 to which there was no discrimination in price. So, he is a15 purchaser of that commodity. You see, "commodity" could refer16 to the kind of thing -- Volvo trucks -- or it could refer to the17 particular thing -- this truck. And I want to know how you read18 the literal 1920 --21                 language.                 MR. ENGLERT:  The textual answer to your question isJUSTICE BREYER: That's all I want --MR. ENGLERT: -- the phrase --JUSTICE BREYER: -- the textual answer.MR. ENGLERT: -- the phrase "the effect of such10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000522232425 competition" ties --￼1234 competition 5JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. I'm very --MR. ENGLERT: I'm sorry, the effect of such -- JUSTICE BREYER: -- sorry. The effect of such--MR. ENGLERT: -- discrimination.JUSTICE BREYER: -- was conceded in this case, that effect on the competition. There are two separate67 there's the8 things. There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored9 dealer. In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the10 statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that11 doesn't count. I'm not focusing on that.12 I am focusing upon the truck that he did not13 purchase. The reason that the disfavored dealer did not14 purchase that truck is that he had a rival -- maybe there's only15 one case of it, but there's at least one -- he had a rival, the16 favored dealer, who got the purchase. He got the order from the17 customer, and then ordered the truck. Now, in that one, I take18 it, the19 dealer.20 21problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored    MR. ENGLERT:  Correct.    JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But what you're hearingwhat?  He was a dealer whose line of business was to22 is, "So23 purchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a24 commodity -- namely, Volvo trucks."25 MR. ENGLERT: Well --11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: And there was a discrimination --2 namely, the offer was discriminatory. And there was a harm to3 competition, in the -- in the Robinson-Patman sense -- his rival4 got the sale.5 MR. ENGLERT: Well, I still question whether --6 JUSTICE BREYER: So, I want the textual answer.7 MR. ENGLERT: Okay. I still question whether the --8 under the text -- the effect of such discrimination was the9 requisite effect on --10 11 1213 is that his14 want to say15JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. ENGLERT: -- competition. But --JUSTICE BREYER: The effect of such discrimination next-door rival, in effect, "got the sale." Do you that isn't enough?MR. ENGLERT: Yes, I do want to say that isn't16 enough. And, Justice Breyer, first of all, I --1718 about that. 19202122 relying on the succeeding phrase, where "either or any of the23 purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce,"24 which seems to require that -- "to discriminate in price between25 different purchasers where either or any of the purchases12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree with you Now --MR. ENGLERT: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: -- what?JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Englert, I thought you were￼1 involved in such discrimination" -- I thought that's what you2 were hanging your hat on, to say that there has to be a3 discrimination in particular sales.4 MR. ENGLERT: I think the statute, read as a whole,5 compels that conclusion. But if I'm wrong about that, and if6 there is enough ambiguity to admit of a different conclusion,7 then the principle comes into play that cases of ambiguity in8 the Robinson-Patman Act are construed to be more consistent with9 the overall --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, if we can go back11 to the language, it's between different purchases of commodities12 of "like grade and quality." And that seems to me to indicate13 that Volvo Trucks, generically, must be looked at -- the policy,14 with reference to Volvo trucks, generically. Suppose one dealer15 always got a 10 percent discount, the other dealer always got a16 20 percent discount over a period of time.17 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, I think everyone,18 including the lower courts in this case, agrees that you don't19 look at the goods generically. You have to look at their20 characteristics to determine like grade and quality. And I21 would actually think that the grade --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It has to be purchase-by-purchase23 to determine like grade or quality?24 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. Every Robinson-Patman case25 there's ever been has been purchase-by-purchase at the level of13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425--dealer.JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. That's --MR. ENGLERT: -- sale from the manufacturer to the            JUSTICE BREYER:  You've put your finger right on it. My question is so obvious that you're not giving me an answer.Every case for 60 years has been on your side of it.  Thosejudges, though, were -- must have been reading some language.And how did they interpret that language?  That's all I'm askingyou.  A very literal question.  It has nothing to do with policyor anything.  And all I want you to do is take the statute andread the language so that it is possible for you to win thiscase.            MR. ENGLERT:  Okay.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.            MR. ENGLERT:  I'm a manufacturer.  I'm reading thestatute.  I have to give a price on a particular deal.  Irealize I can't discriminate in price between differentpurchasers of like grade and quality, where the effect of suchdiscrimination may be one of the prohibited effects.  I say,"Okay, can I give a different price to one dealer or toanother?"  Yes, I can, because it says "different purchasers ofcommodities of like grade and quality."  It is a specificinstance of a purchase, a specific instance of discrimination.The very words in the statute are what judges have read14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425consistently to compel that result.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question, just toget it in the -- Supposing volvo had a policy of grantingeverybody a 20 percent concession, and they had  -- exceptReeder -- and they always granted Reeder just a 15 percentconcession, and the -- you had the same sales pattern you havehere.  Would there be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act?MR. ENGLERT: Well, again --JUSTICE STEVENS: Prima facie violation.MR. ENGLERT: I think the answer is no, Your Honor,although that -- although that would be a closer case -- JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if there --MR. ENGLERT: -- than this case.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- were dozens and dozens --MR. ENGLERT: This case was tried on the basis ofthe same transactions.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- of sales to both.MR. ENGLERT: Yes. Yes. That would be a case. But the -- it might fit the policy of the Act, very poor fit with the words of the statute. And --closerbut it's a            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it depends on howyou regard the purchase as on a single -- each singletransaction as a separate purchase or if you look at a course ofdealing and say that, over a period of years, the favored dealeris one purchaser and the disfavored dealer is the other15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005-- whether￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425purchaser.  Why can't you look at the pattern of dealing byautomobile dealers over a period of time?            MR. ENGLERT:  That would be the argument in favor ofan expansive reading of the language in the hypothetical exampleto cover that case.  But it would not be consistent with thegeneral policies of antitrust law.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would be consistent with theliteral language, wouldn't it?  If you treat it, the purchaser,as a -- as -- look not at just individual transactions, but whatthey do over a period of years, just like any other -- anyordinary automobile dealer.  Two dealers in this market, one inArlington and one in Bethesda, are both purchasers, even thoughthey may not compete on the same transactions, aren't they?            MR. ENGLERT:  No.  The effect of such discriminationhas to be to harm competition with the favored purchaser.  Andif all transactions are hermetically sealed from one another,yes, the buyer might like a better price, but it's notcomplaining about the effect of such discrimination oncompetition with the favored purchaser.To put this point in perspective, imagine that Volvo raised its price to every so-called favored purchaser --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But --            MR. ENGLERT:  -- in this case.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  You would agree, in myhypothetical, there's discrimination, but you'd say there's no 16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425injury to competition.            MR. ENGLERT:  There's no injury to competition thatis the effect of such --JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if you --MR. ENGLERT: -- competition with --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- got an expert to --MR. ENGLERT: -- a favored purchaser that is theeffect of such --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- even if you got an expert tocome and say, "Well, these two dealers are in the same relevant market, and there's a likelihood that customers go to the favored dealer," that would not be a prima facie --            MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, if you have that evidence?            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.            MR. ENGLERT:  That there is a likelihood that, in apattern, customers have gone to the favored dealer? That's -- that begins to come within the statutory language in a way this case does not.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand --            MR. ENGLERT:  There is no customer testimony, noevidence of diversion to any favored dealer in this case, noevidence that Reeder lost profits because of the price given toany favored dealer, only evidence that if Reeder had gotten aprice, it would have -- better price -- it would have made moremoney.  Well, every dealer can show that.17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand your argumentthat there's no injury or impact in competition for resale ofthe trucks.  What's wrong with looking at the statute as beingconcerned to protect competition to be the Volvo dealer?  Inother words, you know, they're competing -- if Volvo'srestructuring its approach, they're competing to be the favoreddealer, even though they don't compete with other Volvo dealersdirectly.            MR. ENGLERT:  The main problem with thatinterpretation of the statute is, it takes the last phrase ofthe statute and makes it no longer a limiting phrase.  Itessentially makes all price discrimination illegal.  And thisCourt said, in Brooke Group, and has said in many other cases,that it is not -- not all price discrimination is made illegalby this statute.  It does require the requisite effect oncompetition.            I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.            Mr. Hungar.                ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G.

The position of the United States is --JUSTICE STEVENS: But how can you say --MR. HUNGAR: -- that the answer is no.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the dealer didn't purchasegoods for resale in competition with other Volvo dealers?That's exactly what they do every day, isn't it?MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. When they purchase the goods, they are not in competition with any other Volvo dealer. By definition, they have the sale. And so, if --JUSTICE STEVENS: Can't they be --MR. HUNGAR: That's the point that I'm making. JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in competition just from -- ona day-to-day basis over the years, over a period of time, tryingto get business?competitionMR. HUNGAR: In a different sense, they may be in --JUSTICE STEVENS: Assuming --MR. HUNGAR: -- with other --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- they're in the same relevantmarket, of course.MR. HUNGAR: In a different sense, yes. But the 19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 point is, the price discrimination does not occur when there is2 any competition. And, therefore, the requirements of the Act3 are not satisfied.4 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're assuming they're not in5 competition on a continuing basis, they're only in competition6 for one isolated transaction after another.7 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- they may be, in8 other senses, and in -- and in seeking other customers, in a --9 in some sense, in competition with other Volvo dealers. But, at10 the point that the price discrimination occurs, they are not.11 And, therefore, even in the -- in the -- in the -- well, in any12 of the examples offered by the Respondents in this case, they13 don't show price discrimination between competing purchasers,14 which is what this Court, in the Morton Salt case and in other15 cases, have indicated the Act was aimed at. And as Mr. Englert16 indicated, that is why, in the 70 years since the17 Robinson-Patman Act was enacted, we18 this, because it is understood that19 in these circumstances, and --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Two --21 MR. HUNGAR: -- I would22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- two dealers within 10 miles of23 each other, customers frequently go to both dealers to check out24 -- to get the lowest price. Dealer A gets 10 percent discount25 routinely; Dealer B, 20 percent discount routinely. Over a20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005haven't seen cases likethe Act has no application--￼1 period of time, would there be a violation of the2 Robinson-Patman Act?3 MR. HUNGAR: And all the same structure as this --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.5 MR. HUNGAR: -- hypothetical? Well, the answer is6 no, but only for, I think, one of the several reasons why in7 this case the answer is no. That is, in your hypothetical they8 are, in a sense -- and I'm assuming that there might be direct9 head-to-head competition, but the offers are different -- or10 affected by the differing differentials. So, there is -- there11 is competition between the purchasers, and there is12 discrimination in offers, although not in purchases. So, there13 is still the two-purchaser requirement which is not satisfied in14 that circumstance. There is the -- Reeder is not purchasing in15 -- assuming it loses the sale to the other customer, it's not16 purchasing in competition with a favored customer, a favored17 dealer, because it's not purchasing at all.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so --19 MR. HUNGAR: But I would point out that even if the20 Court is unwilling to go that far in this case, that you don't21 need to go that far to resolve this case and to reverse the22 judgment below for the other -- because of the other failings in23 the plaintiff's case here.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the -- and the main25 failing there is that Volvo Trucks and Reeder-Simco do not21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 compete in the same market for sales of Volvo trucks. Is that a2 correct statement of the record?3 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think I would put it that4 way. I think, again, they don't compete at the point at which5 the price --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For any --7 MR. HUNGAR: -- discrimination occurs.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- particular sales.9 MR. HUNGAR: Right. Yes.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I see.11 MR. HUNGAR: And that's --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.13 MR. HUNGAR: -- right. Other than -- there are the14 -- the two examples of what have been called head-to-head15 competition, in one of which there was clearly no price16 discrimination, in the other of which our reading of the record17 is that a reasonable jury could not have found that there was18 price discrimination. And even if there were price19 discrimination, that one instance, standing alone, could not20 support a finding of a Robinson-PatmanAct --The -- Hiland -- is that--21222324 the one? 25JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?MR. HUNGAR:  -- violation.JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?MR. HUNGAR: Because there 22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE BREYER:  Hiland Dairy?            MR. HUNGAR:  -- because there's no substantialinjury to competition.            JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, a -- I mean, youcould go in -- I see that.  But what -- is there any authorityfor that, that just one -- a head-to-head competition, he boughtthe truck.  Let's -- keep that out of it, so imagine they boughtthe truck, they resold it, and the market structure is suchthere probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, withother dealers, and they lost at least one sale.  That's notenough to prove an injury to competition?clearly --MR. HUNGAR:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I mean,JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the authority for that?MR. HUNGAR: Well, certainly the Morton Salt inference wouldn't apply, because there's no substantial --            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's a different matter. That's a-- what -- I'm saying, What authority is there -- have therebeen cases in which that was not viewed?  After all, let'ssuppose the dealers are located geographically in aboutplace, and it's logical to think they'd go for the samecustomers.  They overlap.  Their territories are close.to think people shop around for trucks.  And we have inrecord one item where they -- one instance in which they foundthe customer, and he said, "Yeah, I did -- I did go and shop in23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the sameLogical the￼1 both. I lost" -- the disfavored dealer lost the sale.2 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't --3 JUSTICE BREYER: Any authority?4 MR. HUNGAR: Well, this Court's cases, and the lower5 courts', have understood the Act to require a likelihood of a6 substantial injury to competition --7 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they say, "This is our8 evidence that it is likely." Just what I said.9 MR. HUNGAR: But one sale is not substantial, Your10 Honor, I would submit. And, moreover, in this case, of course,11 they don't have that evidence of the close dealer with whom they12 are in repeated competition for the same customers that -- and13 so, I don't think we have that case. We don't have a14 substantial injury, even if you assume -- even if you read the15 evidence the way they do with respect to the one head-to-head16 competition.17 And it's important to understand that this -- the18 two-purchaser rule is not the only flaw in the judgment below.19 The Act requires causation. That is, the price differential20 must cause the injury to competition. Here, it's not the price21 differential that causes the injury, in the sense that the22 Robinson-Patman Act addresses. The Act is addressed to the23 situation where they're competing head to head, the favored24 purchaser has a competitive -- a relative competitive advantage25 which allows them to offer a lower price and, thereby, either24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 get the sale or reduce the profits of the competing purchaser.2 But that's simply not the case here in these sales-to-sales or3 offers-to-sales competitions. The fact that some other dealer4 in some other transaction with some other customer got a better5 price has absolutely no relevance, no significance, and no6 effect on Reeder's ability to get a sale or make a profit in its7 transactions with an unrelated customer. So, there -- the8 causation element that's so crucial under the Act is absolutely9 missing here.10 And, in fact, Reeder's interpretation would simply11 read the injury requirement out of the statute. They would say,12 "Whenever there is a price differential, we've been injured,13 because if we had gotten the lower price instead of the higher14 price, we would have made more money." So, there's per se15 injury. The Morton Salt inference is converted into an16 irrebuttable presumption --17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --18 MR. HUNGAR: -- contrary --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Mr. Hungar, do you agree with20 Mr. Englert that even if you had -- you could -- you had a case21 based on two dealers, one consistently gets higher concessions,22 one consistently gets lower concessions, and they're in roughly23 the same market -- that even that would not be covered by24 Robinson-Patman?25 MR. HUNGAR: And they're in repeated head-to-head25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425competition for the same customers -- one gets -- they're getting --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I --MR. HUNGAR: -- differential offers? Is that -- JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I'm not putting thehead-to-head in. Just, one of his sales gets lower concessions; one, higher. That's --MR. HUNGAR: I agree that that would not be actionable under the Robinson-Patman Act. The reasons why -- the reason, or reasons, why depend on whether they are in head-to-head competition or not. If they're never in head-to-head competition, then they're never in competition --JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just --MR. HUNGAR: -- and they would fail to have -- JUSTICE STEVENS: -- modify Justice Ginsburg'squestion a little bit.  Supposing, over a period of years, onedealer always got 15 percent off, and the other one always got20 percent, and there's testimony they're in the same relevantmarket, so presumably customers can go to either one.  What moredo they have to prove to establish a prima facie case?MR. HUNGAR: They have to prove at least what Morton Salt said, which is price differentials between competing purchasers. And the way the purchasers were competing in Morton Salt was that --JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand -- 26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. HUNGAR: -- they were both competing --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I understand the Morton Salt3 case, but do the -- I'm assuming they're in the same relevant4 market in which customers patronize both of them from time to5 time, but they can't identify that Mr. Smith was here on this6 day, and the other dealer on the same day, but just an7 overlapping in the -- in the same competitive market. Would8 that not create a prima facie case? And if not, how much more9 would they have to prove?10 MR. HUNGAR: Well, in this market, they'd have to11 show that they were purchasers --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --13 MR. HUNGAR: -- at --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- they're both purchasers.15 They're dealers, in my hypothesis. Each of them buys a hundred16 cars a year, and one of them pays a higher price than the other,17 and they're 1819 purchased -- 202122 with the -- 232425in the same relevant market --MR. HUNGAR:  Yes, Your Honor, but they haven'tJUSTICE STEVENS:  What?MR. HUNGAR:  They haven't purchased in connectionJUSTICE STEVENS: They all purchased --MR. HUNGAR: -- a price discrimination --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- for the purpose of reselling,27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 if they can find customers.2 MR. HUNGAR: Well, right. But, as Justice Scalia3 pointed out, the Act clearly does not apply to offers. It4 requires purchases --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand.6 MR. HUNGAR: -- and it requires --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: In my case --8 MR. HUNGAR: -- sales.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- there are a hundred purchases10 by each of them at different prices. What more do they have to11 prove, other than that they were in the same relevant market?1213 competition 141516171819 they're in competition with each other?20 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because -- it's not21 enough to prove they're in competition with each other. They22 have to prove that they are in -- that the price differential23 injured, or was likely to injure, substantially, that24 competition. And that is not true if they aren't competing in25 connection with the transactions --28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR.

HUNGAR: -- in which the price discriminationoccurs.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- if you're looking at broadmarket competition, you don't normally require them to identifycompetition on a customer -- on a per-customer basis.  The onlyreason we get into the per-customer basis is that we have thisodd -- not an odd situation, but the situation with Volvo trucksthat no dealer ever buys unless he's already got a -- got a salewaiting.  But in Justice Stevens' hypothetical, we -- as long asthe market was identified, and as long as they were buying, wewouldn't require anything more to show competition, would we?            MR. HUNGAR:  May I answer?            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.            MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, if -- I understood JusticeStevens' hypothetical to address the situation where, as in this circumstance, they are not competing at the point at which they actually purchase --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.            MR. HUNGAR:  -- the product.  If it were thetraditional Robinson-Patman Act case, where they purchase forinventory and are both trying to sell the same goods to the samecustomers, then yes, the problems that we've identified herewould not exist.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar. 29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. HUNGAR:  Thank you.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Phillips.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT            MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:            It seems to me there are three issues that have beenposed by the way both this case has been argued by the partieson the other side and as the questions have arisen.  And thefirst one is whether or not there is competition in thisparticular case.  And Justice Stevens' question, it seems to me,posed the issue about as starkly as it can be:  Is it not thecase that under traditional standards of Tampa Electric, thisCourt's decision there, and a host of other cases, that wedefine "competition" by reference to whether or not entitiescompete for the same -- with respect to the same product in thesame market, same region, and if they're -- if that's what youhave by way of competition, then you look to the next level,which is to see:  Is there price discrimination, and is thereinjury to that competition?            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What evidence was there ofcompetition here?  How -- did you bring forward instances wherethey both bid for sale of special trucks to a singlerepurchaser?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we clearly did that with the -- 30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 with the Hiland case. That was -- that was clear. But the2 testimony was uncontested on both sides. Both Reeder's --3 Reeder testified, "We compete against other dealers every day."4 And Volvo's 5678 was, if youwitness testified --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not other Volvo dealers. MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, other Volvo dealers.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the Volvo policy had two dealers competing for the same sale, they9 gave the same discount to each dealer.10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's not the competition.11 That's the question as whether there is discrimination. The12 question is, Do Volvo dealers compete against other Volvo13 dealers, in the first instance? And with respect to that, the14 testimony was absolutely clear, it's in the -- witnesses for15 Volvo -- are quoted in our brief at page 8 -- explicitly say,16 "We compete, on a daily basis, in the region and the district,17 Volvo dealer to Volvo dealer."18 Now, there's a separate --19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's never -- but, in20 those situations, there's never two purchases, there's always21 one -- there's only one completed purchase.22 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- again, there are lots of23 situations where there are two purchasers. Again, you go back24 to the -- to the four specific transactions that were25 identified. For the 102 sales, 55 percent of the sales between31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 1996 and 2000 involve -- I mean, 1998 -- involved2 direct-comparison sales, where we purchased from Volvo, and one3 of our competitors 200 miles down the road -- and on interstate4 highways, 200 miles down the road's the same as next door -- and5 we -- we purchased exactly the same product, and we got a6 significantly lower concession --7 8 910 -- that was 111213JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but --MR. PHILLIPS: -- under the circumstances.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that was for a resale to for resale to different purchasers.MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, it was --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nobody's buying two --MR. PHILLIPS: -- for resale.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- nobody's buying twotwo different purchasers.MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Anymore than anybody's buying1415 trucks from 1617 two cars from two different purchasers in the -- in the classic18 inventory situation.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's very hard to compare20 those two sales, because they all depend upon the special21 features on the trucks that are ordered by the particular22 individual, and also how -- you know, how much of a hard bargain23 that individual is driving. I don't know how you can compare a24 sale to one -- one person with XYZ features on the truck with a25 sale to a totally different person with ABC features on the32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 truck.2 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, that was precisely3 the defense that Volvo made at trial. They put it to the jury,4 "Remember, it has to be like kind and quality. We are required5 to demonstrate that the truck that we are getting a 10 percent6 discount on and the truck that they're getting a 20 percent7 discount on is exactly the same like kind and quality of truck."8 And that was their defense. And our witness meticulously --9 I'd commend the record to you if you want to read it -- but he10 meticulously examined each of those trucks and showed that,11 systematically, for 102 sales, they sold the exact same truck to12 a dealer down the road, with a significantly better price than13 the truck they sold to us, in order to implement the "Volvo14 Vision" and 151617drive my client --JUSTICE SCALIA: For resale --MR. PHILLIPS: -- out of the dealership business. JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to a different purchaser, who18 may have been in a better position with regard to the19 negotiation than any of your customers were.20 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, he -- but whatever that21 person's position was, vis-a-vis its customer, doesn't affect22 the relationship between Reeder-Simco and Volvo, and that23 individual and Volvo.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it --25 MR. PHILLIPS: There, it has to be a level playing33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 field.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why is it --3 MR. PHILLIPS: That is precisely what4 Robinson-Patman is about.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why is it unreasonable -- why6 does it violate the principle of Robinson-Patman, and why does7 it destroy competition, for Volvo to say, "We'll make whatever8 discount it takes to get the sale, and if this dealer needs a 209 percent discount for this sale, but this other fellow over here10 only needs a 10 percent discount to make that sale, we're going11 to have a differential discount"? Why -- I don't see12 harms competition.13 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- it wouldn't14 necessarily, on an episodic basis. But what you have15 case is substantial price discrimination across time,16 Court held, under Morton Salt, triggers an inference of17 competitive injury.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the problem that I19 have with even accepting your theory is what the other side20 calls the "mix and match" quality of your evidence. That is,21 you say here's Reeder, disfavored, and here's someone else,22 favored. But it's not consistently the same someone else. And,23 for all we know, someone else could make a case saying, "We24 compare ourselves with Reeder, and we say, oh, there was that25 sale 7 months ago, where they got a whopping discount and we got34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005why thatin thiswhich this￼1 a much smaller one." You're not -- you don't have the same2 favored customer. You're picking from a series of sales, and we3 don't know how manipulative this proof is. And we I mean - and4 we don't --5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, putting aside the fact,6 Your Honor, that I think that that's essentially a jury question7 -- I mean, I do think both sides get to put on the evidence that8 shows that there's been discrimination and that there -- and9 then we know what the market consequences will be. But if you10 look at plaintiff's exhibit 104, which is in the appendix to the11 Court of Appeals at 577, and you look down that list, you will12 see that they are -- where they're specifically talking about13 Reeder-Simco, and it has -- and it satisfies its 28 percent of14 its overall objective in 1999; and then you go through the15 testimony of Reeder-Simco's co-owner, and he's -- identifies16 each of the four or five competing entities that were the17 beneficiaries of those -- of the price discrimination of those18 sales in the 102 sales that were the basis for liability; and19 their percentages for the objectives during the next -- during20 1999 are 7121 percent --2223 --24 25percent, 81 percent, 97 percent, 107 percent, 92those are -- those are huge differentials.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Phillips, when you loseMR. PHILLIPS: And --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I may. When you lose a35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sale, it's because Volvo didn't give you a big enough discount.It's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a biggerdiscount.            MR. PHILLIPS:  That's today, Mr. Chief Justice, tobe sure.  But tomorrow, when I go to the next dealer to -- go tothe next purchaser, the reason I didn't get that sale wasbecause I didn't have enough capital to have the same quality ofsalesperson in place to make that sale.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but, I mean, that's -- I mean, long term -- of course, Volvo can terminate you, as a dealer, tomorrow. And ----MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it can't.  Under the contractCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and under State -- Arkansas Statelaw, it can't.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- well, what -- but it -- under the Robinson-Patman Act, it can.MR. PHILLIPS: As long as it doesn't discriminate on the basis of price --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The classic -- MR. PHILLIPS: -- you're right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- case that theRobinson-Patmanbecause they'reAct is directed to is when you lose salesgiving bigger discounts to other sellers.  And36Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that's just not the case here.            MR. PHILLIPS:  But it -- it's not just sales.  It'salways been lost profits, as well. And if we are paying more, we're losing money, vis-a-vis our competitors. And then every day after that, we're competing with our -- one arm tied behind our back because we have less money. And is there any reason to doubt that --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But Volvo's interest may bein as -- making as much money off of sales this year, and theymay not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller,are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.MR. PHILLIPS: That's true. But we know from the record that Volvo's purpose in this enterprise was to eliminate 50 percent of its dealers --JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a --            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and to do so by using pricediscrimination.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that's a -- that's a broadRobinson-Patman principle you're arguing for, that a -- that aseller such as Volvo has to make sure that each of itsdistributors makes the same profit?MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, no --JUSTICE SCALIA: And if --MR. PHILLIPS: -- of course not.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it works its system in such a37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 way that one of them is making less profit than another, it's2 liable?3 MR. PHILLIPS: No, there are -- there are two4 elements to this, Justice Scalia. You first have to demonstrate5 that there's discrimination. And the way you demonstrate6 anticompetitive discrimination is to show that there is a7 consistent pattern. It has to be substantial discrimination8 over a substantial period of time.9 If we're trying to cut deals on a daily basis,10 presumably today you got a deal with a customer, and I'll give11 you a 10 percent, and then the Chief Justice got a deal12 tomorrow, and I may give him 12 percent, but, 2 weeks down the13 line, the situations will likely be flipped out. You're not14 going to find, where you have 55 percent of your sales, 10215 sales involving $250,000-plus of sales differentials to be the16 basis for the claim that there is price discrimination in the17 first instance, Justice Scalia.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any instance where you19 made an offer to a buyer assuming that you'd get the kind of a20 break that Volvo gives to other dealers -- all right? -- you21 made that22 price" --2324 examples. 25offer, and the buyer says, "Yes, I'll take it at thatand then you go to Volvo, and they won't give you that?  MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, sure.  We had thousands of thoseJUSTICE SCALIA: Where you made the offer to the 38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 buyer -- 234 it --MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and the buyer had agreed to buy5 6 78 buy it. We9 sales person thought that, "If I can get this discount at thisMR. PHILLIPS: Sure.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and you --MR. PHILLIPS: Where we -- well, I -- had agreed to had a -- clearly, there was an understanding. Our10 rate, I can cut this deal," went to -- went to Volvo, asked for11 that rate, Volvo said no. Didn't get the deal.12 JUSTICE BREYER: This is the Robinson --13 MR. PHILLIPS: That happened literally more than a14 thousand times. The testimony on that is rampant. And the15 reason we don't make more of that, Justice Scalia, in this16 particular case, is because the jury verdict is based on actual17 sales. There is as very clear fidelity to the two-purchaser18 rule in the way the jury verdict was rendered and the way the19 Court of Appeals affirmed it. That said, I -- a lot of this20 discussion about, you know: Is that two-purchaser rule, in its21 most strict version, the right way to interpret the22 Robinson-Patman Act? Our view is, it's not. But we don't have23 to get there --24 JUSTICE BREYER: If it's not, the -- the reason -- I25 thought, for about 60 years, the words "different purchasers of39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 commodities," it forbids any person to discriminate in price2 between different purchasers of commodities. Now, you have to3 refer -- as soon as I ask the question, or start getting into4 the language, I forget the statute, and it's so complicated that5 I'm giving you time to think about it --6 [Laughter.]7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and to think of those words in8 your mind.9 MR. PHILLIPS: All right.10 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a -- it's forbidden to11 discriminate in price between different purchasers of12 commodities.13 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I had always thought -- and I15 think the Courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of16 decisions -- that the words "discriminate in price between17 different purchasers of commodities" meant you can't18 discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item,19 or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price20 exists. That's what I thought it meant. And it seems to me21 that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that22 was the general understanding of the courts. And either it's23 not permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know24 why it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy25 reason for not doing it in respect to the policy.40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 And in respect to the policy, what worries me about2 the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo --3 forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here.4 If it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to5 compete better with other brands. And that means lower prices6 for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt.7 So, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with8 60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust9 law, I guess I would -- might favor your opponents in this. I'm10 exposing my entire line of thought. I'm trying to protect11 interbrand competition, why -- while, at the same time, not12 being -- not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson-Patman;13 and, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been14 read. 1516 Justice17 what we18 commodities.So, what's your response?    MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I guess the difficulty I have,Breyer, is understanding why you don't think we are -- have here is precisely different purchasers of1920 the problem21 between the22 of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination23 existed. Insofar as there were items, or items, purchased,24 there is no discrimination. At least there is no discrimination25 that -- in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kindJUSTICE BREYER: No, I said -- I said they -- in -- for you is that, in respect to discriminationitem, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of injury. In respect to instances where you have a strong case2 of the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as I3 just defined it.4 MR. PHILLIPS: I apologize for being --5 JUSTICE BREYER: No, let me deal --6 MR. PHILLIPS: -- dense, Justice Breyer.7 [Laughter.]8 JUSTICE BREYER: -- with the latter. I will say --9 MR. PHILLIPS: Let --10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- there are some items where your11 client bought the truck.12 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.13 JUSTICE BREYER: When he bought the truck, he got14 the sale, although he earned less profit. Put those to the15 side.16 MR. PHILLIPS: It's difficult --17 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's focus --18 MR. PHILLIPS: -- for me to do that, Justice Breyer19 --20 JUSTICE BREYER: But you are.21 MR. PHILLIPS: -- but I understand.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's focus --23 [Laughter.]24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- on the items -- let's focus on25 the items where he didn't get the sale.42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.            JUSTICE BREYER:  When he didn't get the sale, therewas no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer inrespect to which the discrimination existed.--MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay?  Now, it's that second classMR. PHILLIPS:  That's what you want me to focus on.JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.MR. PHILLIPS:  That's fine.  As long as you acceptthat the first class is a distinct one, and, as far as I'm concerned --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course it's distinct.  Of course--            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- but -- and it totally makes mycase, as far as I'm concerned.that, but --JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, you have a --MR. PHILLIPS: I realize you may disagree with me on[Laughter.]            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- we'll start there.  But I justwant to be clear that that's a completely separate analysis.Then, it seems to me, what you -- what you have to go back to isthe kind of analysis that Justice Stevens was saying, which isthat when you're talking about different purchasers of43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 commodities, there is no reason to be so focused on the -- on2 the identical transaction, rather than recognizing, particularly3 in the context of a dealership arrangement where you're -- have4 continuous relationships between the -- between the seller --5 the manufacturer and the dealer, where you have this enormous6 disadvantage to the dealer, who has already sunk, you know, huge7 amounts of money into this and is in -- essentially at the whim8 of what is now a monopoly seller -- a monopsony -- a monopoly9 seller. And, under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense10 to say, "Look, if I'm going to systematically keep getting 20 --11 10 percent discounts, where my competitor, a hundred miles away,12 is always getting 20 percent discounts," that's a situation that13 this statute seems clearly aimed at dealing with.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not at the whim of a15 monopoly seller. You mentioned to me just a little while ago,16 you've got a contract with them. You can put in that contract17 whatever you want about pricing.18 MR. PHILLIPS: I have a 5-year contract that's19 already in place, so, at least for the 5 years, I'm pretty much20 at the whim of my -- unless I want to breach the contract, which21 --2223 contract. 242544Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SCALIA:  Youshould have written a betterMR. PHILLIPS:  Well,[Laughter.]unfortunately --￼1 MR. PHILLIPS: -- I didn't write that contract,2 Justice Scalia.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But on a misinterpretation of4 Robinson-Patman.5 [Laughter.]6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with the7 policy argument -- at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather8 than the trees -- that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer9 competition in interbrand -- in the interbrand market, rather10 than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's11 ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the12 manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed13 to protect the intrabrand position?14 MR. PHILLIPS: I think to make that argument you15 essentially have to make mush out of the last half of the16 Robinson-Patman Act, because it's not injury in any line of17 commerce, which is where I think you would be talking about18 interbrand problems. It's problems with respect to customers of19 either of them. And it's quite clear, and it's been clear since20 1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt,21 that this is designed to recognize that when you harm an22 intrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to23 competition that this statute was aimed at. And this Court24 reaffirmed that25 in Texaco. And1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990,it's -- and notwithstanding some effort to ask45Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me2 that that principle ought to be completely settled at this3 stage. If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix4 that's offered up by Congress.5 To go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I6 told you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have7 to show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of8 time, you get the Morton Salt inference. You -- then we still9 have to show, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, that we have10 actual injury to our business and property. And in this11 context, it seems to me, the evidence is absolutely12 overwhelming, because you have a situation where, in 1995, we13 are next-to-none dealer for Volvo. In 1995, we're selling 6614 cars, we're making $165,000. Volvo implements its "Volvo15 Vision," the purpose of which is to drive my client out of this16 dealership. It engages in systematic discrimination, both with17 respect to unquestionable purchases on both sides and, candidly,18 more broadly than that. And the effect of that, at the end of19 the day, is that our sales go from 65 to 34 to 18 to 8. Our20 gross profits dropped to $26,327.21 You compare that to the kind of evidence this Court22 looked at in the -- in the J. Truett Payne case, where it wasn't23 clear that there was really any discrimination involved there,24 there was no drop in the market, there was no evidence of any25 diversion of any sales. And, even in that context, this Court46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 was unwilling to say that the Fifth Circuit's decision holding2 that the evidence was flat-out inconsistent -- or inadequate to3 sustain the verdict, was overturned, had to be sent back.4 I submit to you, the evidence in this case is vastly5 stronger. The jury reached the result that it did. That result6 was approved in the face of a JMOL --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let me ask you --8 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and affirmed --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question.10 MR. PHILLIPS: -- on appeal.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing you did have a contract,12 such as Justice Scalia suggests, in which the manufacturer13 agreed that, at any given point of time, you will get just as14 favorable a concession as any other Volvo dealer could get at15 the same time. If there were such a contract in place, would16 the evidence show that it was breached?17 MR. PHILLIPS: In this case, yes, it would have18 been. We have evidence that they clearly didn't. Because they19 have a policy of trying to accomplish the same thing, and didn't20 achieve that in this particular case, in at least two instances.2122 judgment on23 and that is24 25JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did -- you did get athe -- whatever it was -- the State Franchises Act, not being contested --MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on appeal.47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- Justice Ginsburg.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that if -- the question iswhether fair franchising practices -- were there unfairpractices?  You won a verdict that there was a violation of theFairness in Franchising Act.MR. PHILLIPS: Right. We clearly aren't raising the State law issue here. Our argument here is that the Robinson-Patman --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you won on it. MR. PHILLIPS: -- violation --JUSTICE GINSBURG: You won on it. But thedifference is that that doesn't give you treble damages.            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it also has a different statuteof limitations, Justice Ginsburg. There are a lot of differences between the State law and the Federal claim that we're --JUSTICE GINSBURG: On --MR. PHILLIPS: -- that we're pursuing here. JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- limitations, one of theaspects of this mismatches -- that in one case you went back asmuch as -- there was a 7-month differential.  Is there atimeframe, if we adopt your theory, about -- in which you canengage in this comparison?            MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, of course.  You require the juryto make a determination that it's within a reasonable period of48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 time and that it's in a reasonable adjustment. There is no2 challenge to the jury instruction on whether or not the3 comparisons that were made were legitimate in any way. So,4 that's -- you know, there's no question that this Court can5 certainly establish a rule that says certain timeframes are6 either, per se, good or bad, but that issue is clearly not7 raised by the way the jury -- this jury was instructed, because8 there was no challenge to the instruction, in this case.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's also not disputed now10 that these were goods of like grade and quality.11 MR. PHILLIPS: Not disputed that these are goods of12 like grade and quality, Your Honor.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, how many States have14 these fair franchising laws? Are there any States that don't?15 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I'm sure there are some States16 that don't. I think there are about 30-some States that do, as17 I recall.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument that focuses19 on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing20 those sales at all. I mean, if you -- you had made all the21 sales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger22 discount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd23 have the same argument, right?24 MR.25 those sales the1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400PHILLIPS:  Well, I think if we had gotten all offirst time around, we would have ended up with49Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the profitsthat would have allowed us to make the sales --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, you just go back and 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebodylook again,else was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten thebigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales,and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able tobe a dealer for a longer time.            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think, at the end of the day,what we're talking about is essentially a jury question:  Werewe entitled to say these were lost profits, the margins werereduced, we didn't have as much money?  That interfered with ourability to make sales in the future period, because you have thecomplete before-and-after documented history in this particularcase.JUSTICE SOUTER: So --            MR. PHILLIPS:  It seems to me that's a juryquestion.  And the jury found in our favor.JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't --            JUSTICE BREYER:  You suggest something very -- tome, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, Ithink, from prior law that --            MR. PHILLIPS:  I hope not.            JUSTICE BREYER:  If you want to go look at this, youknow, you say, all right, here's -- we should be realistic aboutit.  We're going to be realistic.  Realistic, they -- we're only50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425now looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item,but the profit was lower.  There's no purchaser problem.            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.            JUSTICE BREYER:  But they got a lower profit.  And Ithink, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that thatcounts as an injury.            MR. PHILLIPS:  That, by itself, wouldn't count as aninjury.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Yes, but it's -- you know, itshows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven outof business.            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Indeed, the market in -- thedealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market,which it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the resultof -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there thatwould be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrustlaw.  So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye toMorton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that wasquite formalistic.  It didn't really look to the injury tocompetition in a market.  It had a formalistic slogan thatwould, in fact, be a proxy for that.            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.            JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what dofollow your -- we follow your advice, we51you think of that?  Wesay, "Okay, we're goingWashington, DC 20005Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 to be very realistic in the future. Forget the presumptions.2 And, court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of3 increased concentration through people going out of business,4 will lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies5 there." What about that? I mean, I don't know if you -- you6 know, I --7 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not here to --8 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm being a little --9 MR. PHILLIPS: -- I'm not here, necessarily, as an10 advocate for overturning Morton Salt, for obvious reasons. I11 think the answer to your question is, under Morton Salt we12 clearly win, because we -- we probably didn't need to show as13 much as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular14 discrimination on our ability to compete in the future. I think15 we were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of16 the substantial -- or reasonable possibility of injury in the17 first instance. But, beyond that, I -- you know, you could18 certainly hold, in this case, that Reeder-Simco has made more19 than enough of a case in order to recover under the20 Robinson-Patman Act. But --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in fact --22 MR. PHILLIPS: -- we, neverthe- -- I'm sorry,23 Justice --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you almost have to show that.25 But the evidence of the head-to-head competition, it seems to52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 me, too insubstantial to support2 agree? I -- and I --3 MR. PHILLIPS: One --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: --5 you almost concede that, right?6 MR. PHILLIPS: Well,7 it. And part of this -- part of8 that head-to-head item wasn't part of the jury instruction. So,9 that -- we -- I can't rely on it, in terms of supporting it. If10 you ask me, outside of the context of this case, would I defend11 that argument? I probably would try to defend the argument.12 But it's obviously much tougher when you only have one13 head-to-head. It's completely different when you're talking14 about 102 sales-to-sales comparisons over years, with15 significant differentials, that clearly caused the kind of16 injury we have here.17 If there are no further questions, Your Honors, I'd18 give you back the rest of my time.19 Thank you.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.21 Mr. Englert, you have four minutes remaining.22 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.2324 MR.25 The1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERENGLERT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.heart of the theory of this case came up in53Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005liability here.  Would youI -- your opposing counsel sayswe -- I mean, we don't rely on the problem is that it's not --￼1 colloquy between the Chief Justice and Mr. Phillips. The Chief2 Justice pointed out that Reeder doesn't lose a sale because of3 the concession that Volvo gives to the other dealer, which makes4 this quite different from every other Robinson-Patman case. Mr.5 Phillips' response was, "That's today, Your Honor. But our6 future ability to compete is impaired." Well, that's very7 similar to the evidence this Court referred to as "weak" in J.8 Truett Payne. The Court didn't go all the way and say that that9 wasn't enough to give rise to damages under section 4 of the10 Clayton Act, but the -- but all nine Justices agreed that such11 evidence was very weak. The Fifth Circuit, on remand, threw out12 the jury verdict, a case that arose in the same posture as this13 case. And there is not -- as we said in the reply brief, Reeder14 is complaining about price, not price discrimination.15 Now, let me say a word or two about the record. Mr.16 Phillips says the "Volvo Vision" was to get rid of dealers, and17 to do so through price discrimination. That is a leap of faith18 that Reeder asked the jury to make at trial, but there is not an19 iota of evidence connecting Volvo's interest in making its20 dealer network smaller and more efficient to price21 discrimination. That's entirely a leap of faith. Mr. Phillips22 says an inference should be made. That's not the kind of23 inference we usually allow juries to draw in antitrust cases24 without some evidence.25 The evidence was actually that Reeder's biggest54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 customer, New Hi-Way, which was 82 percent of its business, was2 bought by a Memphis company. So, just to point to Reeder's3 before-and-after sales is really terribly misleading, in terms4 of causation here between so-called discrimination and the5 decline in Reeder's business.6 The so-called 102 sales are four transactions.7 There's one 77-truck transaction to New Hi-Way before it was8 bought by the Memphis company, and 25 other trucks in the other9 three transactions. They are all cases in which all Reeder did10 was take its own completed sales and compare them to sales by11 some other dealer in some other State. Reeder wasn't competing12 for the sale to that dealer's customer. That customer wasn't13 competing for the sale to Reeder's customer. So it is, as14 Justice Ginsburg's questions pointed out, completely a15 mix-and-match approach.16 And Bill Heck conceded that there were times when17 Reeder got better concessions than other dealers. If you have a18 company that doesn't engage in uniform pricing, as Volvo does19 not, it's not going to be hard for any plaintiff, whether it's20 Reeder or Reeder's competitor, to come up with instances in21 which it was the so-called disfavored dealer if it is admissible22 to compare transactions to completely unrelated transactions,23 which is what the proof at trial in this case was.24 Thank you.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you, if you have aminute left, is your central point that there was no proof ofdamages or no proof of injury to competition?They need --MR. ENGLERT:  Both, Your Honor.  They need both.JUSTICE STEVENS: I know they --MR. ENGLERT: In 2(a) --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- need both, but which is yourprincipal argument?            MR. ENGLERT:  My principal argument is under 2(a),but if I fail on that, I think they fail under Clayton Act, section 4, as well. And --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Your principal argument, thatthere was no injury to competition.            MR. ENGLERT:  That was the effect of suchdiscrimination, yes.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Okay.
