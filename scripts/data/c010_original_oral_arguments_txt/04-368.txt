United States.          Ms. Mahoney.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MS. MAHONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Government concedes that the destruction ofdocuments in anticipation of a proceeding was not a crimein the fall of 2001 based upon a statutory rule thatCongress had preserved for over a century.  The centralquestion in this case is whether Congress, nevertheless,intended to make a polite request to engage in that lawfulconduct, a form of witness tampering punishable by tenyears in prison.  We ask this Court to reject thatinterpretation of the statute and to hold that ArthurAndersen did not commit a crime.          I'd like to turn first to the term "corruptlypersuade" as it's used in Section 1512 and explain whyArthur Andersen's interpretation represents not only areasonable reading, but the best reading of the languagein the statute.          The first thing that we see when we look at the3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 statutory context is that Congress did not prohibit -- did2 not prohibit -- all persuasion to destroy documents for3 the specific purpose of making them unavailable for use in4 an official proceeding. It did not, because it did not5 simply say, "Anyone who persuades a witness to do this has6 violated the statute." It added a very important7 limitation, and that is the word "corruptly" -- "corruptly8 persuades."9 So what kinds of requests are excluded from the10 definition? When is it that it's okay to persuade someone11 to destroy a document for use in an official proceeding?12 And the answer, we think, based on the traditional meaning13 of the term "corruptly," is that "corruptly" means that14 you have persuaded someone in a fashion that uses improper15 means, such as bribery, or you've asked the witness to16 violate duties imposed by other law, whether that's the17 duties imposed by contempt or the duties imposed by a18 whole range of statutes that govern the obligations of19 people in our society.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose you persuaded --21 and I know that is not this case -- suppose you persuaded22 the person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a23 fraud. Would that be corrupt?24 MS. MAHONEY: If -- Your Honor, if it was a25 crime, then, yes --4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in order to -- let's say2 it's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and3 you persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to4 conceal the fraud.5 MS. MAHONEY: Okay, if this is in a -- in the6 course of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to7 be a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by8 Section 1512. If it is in advance of a proceeding -- and9 let's assume that you know that a proceeding --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.11 MS. MAHONEY: -- is likely, then the answer12 depends on whether you know that you are concealing --13 that you know a crime has been committed. And if you know14 that a crime has bee committed, then you are violating a15 federal statute, 18 U.S.C. --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question is, Does that give17 -- would that give some content to the meaning18 "corruptly," in your view?19 MS. MAHONEY: Well, in that case, if20 knows that you have committed a crime, and you21 them to violate, they have a duty, under those22 circumstances, not to assist you in concealing23 offense. That's a duty that's imposed by criminal law.24 So if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are25 corrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005ofyourthe witnessare asking￼1 fall within the interpretation of the statute that Arthur2 Andersen is advancing here.3 And it fits, Your Honor, with what Congress4 really did for a hundred years before 2002. What it did5 is, it said that -- under the Pettibone rule, that it is6 not a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of7 a proceeding. But if you know that -- if you know that a8 crime has been -- a crime has been committed and you9 destroy documents, that is a crime.10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I --11 MS. MAHONEY: That's a crime --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- may I ask you about13 another provision, Section 1515(c)? And that says, this14 chapter -- and it -- and it's referring back to Section15 1512 -- "does not prohibit or punish the providing of16 lawful bona fide legal representation services in17 connection with, or anticipation of, an official18 proceeding."19 Now, how -- did Ms. Temple invoke that provision20 in this case?21 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the -- that section22 was not argued to the District Court, but it was invoked23 in the following way, in two ways. First of all, there24 was evidence introduced in the case that she was providing25 legal advice. And since it is not in affirmative defense,6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 it really was the Government's burden at all times, at2 least once there was evidence introduced that she was3 providing legal advice, to get a finding from the jury4 that she was not engaged in bona fide and lawful services,5 particularly in this case, Your Honor, where the6 Government argued, told the jury,7 the, quote, "central figure," end8 this episode. And in addition --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: How dothat Nancy Temple wasquote, in this -- inyou know it's not an10 affirmative defense?11 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it doesn't read like an12 affirmative defense, Your Honor. It doesn't say13 "affirmative defense." It simply -- and in -- when it was14 introduced, it was listed in the legislation as a Rule of15 Construction. And I think that's exactly how it reads.16 It doesn't purport to put the burden of proof on Andersen,17 or on Nancy Temple.18 And, Your honor, I think, actually --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course, it has the20 word "lawful," "the providing of lawful bona fide legal21 representation services." So, you know, it could be22 argued that if she violating the other provisions, she's23 still in violation.24 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, under the25 Government's definition of "corruptly," she couldn't have7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 been providing lawful bona fide services.2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's what I want to3 know, is, in light of the Government's position and the4 way this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what5 does it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision? I'm6 just curious how it all plays out.7 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think it negates it8 in its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in9 this case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding10 ability of a possible future proceeding, even if the11 Andersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that12 their conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt. They13 were instructed that they must find that.14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does that have the15 effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your16 view?17 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. But I think, Your18 Honor -- because I think it would be impossible to satisfy19 it under this instruction. In addition, I also think that20 the -- that this provision really just demonstrates that21 the Government's interpretation of "corruptly" is wrong,22 to begin with.23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's the effect, in24 1512(b), of the word "knowingly"?25 MS. MAHONEY: I think, Your Honor, that8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 "knowingly" means, in this context -- just as it means2 "knowingly intimidate," "knowingly threatened," "knowingly3 corruptly persuade" -- that means that you have to know4 that your persuasion is asking the witness to violate5 their duties, to violate the law. You have to know that6 it's corrupt.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that satisfied at least8 by the part of the definition that refers to "subverting9 an official proceeding"? I mean, that certainly carries,10 to me, the implication that you realize that you're doing11 something wrong. An official proceeding is, prima facie12 at least, lawful, and you are subverting it. Doesn't that13 satisfy the "knowingly" requirement?14 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor,15 because the definition that was given to this jury was16 "subvert, undermine, or impede," and not just the17 integrity of the proceeding; but, rather, the fact-finding18 ability of a future proceeding --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: I --20 MS. MAHONEY: -- including a governmental21 inquiry.22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I think I would go far in23 agreeing with you if the -- if the instruction had been24 "merely to impede" or "merely to undermine." Now, I guess25 that gets to a question I wanted somebody to answer, and9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 you can probably do it. Did the -- did the Court, in2 giving the instructions, ever refer -- in defining the3 term, ever refer to any of these three possibilities,4 separately, or did it do it simply as "subvert, undermine,5 or" -- what was the third? -- impede"?6 MS. MAHONEY: Impede. I believe -- I believe it7 was done as a -- as a -- as a group.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It did --9 MS. MAHONEY: But it says "or."10 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- one other question. In11 anticipation of that instruction -- I assume the counsel12 new what was coming -- did the Government ever argue to13 the jury that "merely impeding," alone, or "merely14 undermining," alone, would be sufficient, as distinct from15 saying, "If he subverts, undermines, and impedes"?16 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I'm not certain of the17 answer, except that I do know that the Government did18 argue that simply -- the mere idea that David Duncan19 testified that, you know, he thought that the -- somebody20 at the SEC might want to look at this information someday21 was sufficient to satisfy the instructions. And so, I22 think it is a fair inference that the way that they argued23 this case to the jury was that any intent to keep any kind24 of information away from the SEC was enough to satisfy the25 definition in this case. And, in fact, Your Honor, when10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the instructions were being debated, the pattern2 instruction for the Fifth Circuit for "corruptly," under3 1503, actually is -- includes the words "knowingly or4 dishonestly to subvert the integrity of the proceeding."5 The Government insisted that the word "dishonestly" not be6 used, that the word "impede" be added, and they changed7 "fact-finding" a bit -- changed it from "subverting the8 proceedings" to "the fact-finding ability." They did9 everything they could to strip this instruction of any10 mens rea, and then went beyond that and said, "And in11 addition, even if the Andersen employees had a good-faith12 and sincere belief that their conduct did not violate the13 law, it's still a crime."14 So, what we have here is an array of testimony15 from people who say, "We honestly believed that this was16 permissible conduct," but the jury was told that they had17 to convict anyway if there was any possible partial18 motivation to impede possible future fact-finding --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does --20 MS. MAHONEY: -- of an inquiry.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how does -- how does David22 Duncan's guilty plea -- he entered a plea of guilty to a23 charge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to24 impede the SEC investigation by shredding documents. So,25 what were the elements of that offense that are absent in11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 this one?2 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, he plead guilty to the3 offense, as described to him and agreed upon between him4 and his lawyer; in other -- and the Government -- which is5 basically the instruction that was given in this case.6 When he testified in this proceeding, he repeatedly said,7 despite his guilty plea, that he did not believe, at the8 time, that he had done anything unlawful or improper. He9 said, "I thought my conduct was perfectly appropriate. I10 plead guilty because I was persuaded that it didn't matter11 what I thought at the time."12 JUSTICE SCALIA: What sentence did he get, by13 the way?14 MS. MAHONEY: He's not been sentenced yet, Your15 Honor.16 And he was explicit throughout. He also said --17 he never testified that he even thought that an SEC18 proceeding was probable at the time; he just thought it19 was possible. Nor did he say that he ever consciously20 tried to hide the truth or hide the facts. What he did21 say is that, "Yes, part of what was on my mind at the time22 that I asked for compliance with this policy was that the23 SEC and others might want to look at these files someday,24 and I'd better get them in compliance with our retention25 policy, because I know that drafts and notes are the kinds12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of things that could be misused and misconstrued at some2 point in the future." That was the basis of his guilty3 plea, that was the basis of his testimony in this case.4 And the Government's interpretation, the instructions that5 were given to this jury, deprived the term "corruptly6 persuade" of any of its ordinary and traditional meaning.7 Under the Government's view, for instance, of8 "corruptly," bribery becomes irrelevant under this9 statute. I mean, if you look at this statute, and you10 say, "What was Congress trying to prohibit here when it11 says" -- it's a got a list of wrongful means of12 interfering with witnesses. It says "intimidate" and13 "threaten" and "use of physical force," and it says14 "corruptly persuades." The first thing that would come to15 your mind is bribery. But bribery is irrelevant under the16 Government's interpretation, and let me explain why.17 Because they say that, "Well, yes, it's true, it says18 'corruptly persuade,' but all that means if you -- is if19 you had any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a20 proceeding, then you're guilty, just for asking. It21 doesn't matter whether you used any money -- monetary22 compensation in order to extract this behavior; you're23 automatically guilty. But if you use bribery --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume it also would make25 "intimidate," and so forth, quite superfluous.13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. MAHONEY: It absolutely would, Your Honor,2 because it would basically cover any kind of request.3 But, in addition, they say that under their4 definition what it really means is that if you did it for5 some other motive, if you got them to destroy the document6 so that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding --7 and that was your intent, that it couldn't be used in an8 official proceeding -- and you bribed them to do it, but9 your motive was to avoid embarrassment, it would not be a10 crime. Under Andersen's interpretation, it would still be11 a crime, because of course you have corruptly persuaded12 them to destroy a document for use in an official13 proceeding, even if -- at the appropriate time, if there14 is a nexus -- because it doesn't matter whether you were15 trying to avoid embarrassment; if you were bribing them to16 keep it out of the -- of the proceeding, of course that17 would be covered by the traditional definition of18 "corruptly persuade."19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you're anticipating a20 revenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from21 the SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not22 required to keep, but that would make the officials' task23 easier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of24 days, instead of -- it's going to take him a week. Can25 you make it harder for him?14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, under Section 1519,2 now, it may well be that that is criminal behavior,3 because it -- Congress has now, basically, required you to4 preserve documents. But, at the time, no, that would not5 have been a crime. And if you could do it yourself, then6 asking your wife to throw them out instead can't be what7 Congress really had in mind8 hypothetical, the man could9 go to jail, but if he asked10 goes to jail for ten years.under Section 1512.  You know,throw it out himself and nothis wife to do it, then he1112 lingering13 know that14 basis; we1516 statute, reasonably read, Your Honor, tells you exactly17 what that specific thing is. If you intimidate them, if18 you mislead them, if you use physical force, if you19 corruptly persuade them. And that means either you've20 used unlawful means, like bribery, or you asked them to21 violate their independent legal duties. And that22 definition, Your Honor, is quite consistent with the23 traditional interpretation of the term "corruptly," even24 in the obstruction statutes.25 And I'd like to just emphasize, for instance, in15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE KENNEDY:feeling that something's wrong out there.  Iwe don't -- we don't convict people on thatrequire something more specific.MS. MAHONEY:  Well, and I think that thisThere is, in the case, this￼1 a tampering case, a juror tampering case that preceded the2 congressional adoption of the term "corruptly persuades,"3 the Jackson case, the jury was specifically instructed4 that "corruptly" means "knowingly and willfully, with the5 specific intent to influence a juror to violate his duties6 as a 78 jury9 "an act is done corruptly if it is done voluntarily andpetit juror."Similarly, in Aguilar, in the District Court, thewas instructed -- that was a tampering case -- quote,10 intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or11 a lawful result by some unlawful method," end quote.12 This is exactly parallel to the interpretation that13 Andersen is asking this Court to adopt. And if that if14 that interpretation is adopted, it makes sense of this15 statute. If this statute isn't read in reference to the16 violation of other legal duties, than it covers a whole17 range of conduct that is unquestionably innocent --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I just don't like the19 IRS, and I know they're coming. I have some very detailed20 summaries which will give them the answer they need right21 away. I throw away those summaries and make them go back22 to the original records just to make it tough for them.23 Can I do that?24 MS. MAHONEY: Section 1519,25 can. Could you have done that in the16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPOI don't think you-- in the fall ofWashington, DC 20005￼1 2001? Yes, Your Honor, you could. What that really2 reflects is the Pettibone rule. The Pettibone rule, for a3 hundred years, was that destruction and other kinds of4 acts of potential obstruction in advance of a proceeding5 were not a crime.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, we -- you know, we7 all know that what are euphemistically termed "record-8 retention programs" are, in fact, record-destruction9 programs, and that one of the purposes of the destruction10 is to eliminate from the files information that private11 individuals can use for lawsuits and that Government12 investigators can use for investigations. And there has13 been nothing unlawful about having such a program, even if14 one of your purposes is not to leave lying around in the15 file stuff that can be used against you by either the16 government or a private individual.17 So, I would have thought that your argument was18 very persuasive, except for the fact of 1519. I think19 that 1519 gives me cause to believe that Congress could,20 indeed, say, "You can't have record-retention programs."21 How else do you interpret 1519?2223 it in the24 reason --25MS. MAHONEY:  Well, they certainly hadn't saidfall of 2001, Your Honor.  And so, for thatJUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but I -- well, yeah, but17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425--MS. MAHONEY:  But --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but your argument is, youknow, "It's inconceivable that they would have meantthat."  But, my -- they said it in 1519 --          MS. MAHONEY:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- -- in 2002.          MS. MAHONEY:  -- let me put it this way.  Ifthey're gonna -- if they're going to say it, though, theyhave to say it with very clear language, because,otherwise, there would be no fair warning.  You couldn'tconclude from the language of the witness-tamperingstatute, which is designed to protect witnesses, thatCongress had made all record-retention programs unlawful.          I also think, Your Honor, that when it comestime to construe Section 1519, some kind of nexus willhave to be, you know, reasonably read in there, because,otherwise, you are correct, all document retentionpolicies, or virtually all of them, are fatally doomed.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  And what is a"document"?  I mean, in Justice Kennedy's example, is itjust some handwritten notes?  Do they become "documents"?          MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And, inthis case, the evidence was quite clear that, you know,Andersen retained its work papers, and the work papers18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 were extremely extensive, and they were required to fully2 document the audit. The only things that were thrown away3 were notes and preliminary drafts, which had already been4 incorporated, in effect, into the final conclusions in the5 work papers; and yet that was the whole theory of this6 case, is that there were some documents that were7 destroyed. They were precisely the kinds of documents8 that document-retention policies are designed to9 eliminate, in part -- for a variety of reasons, but, in10 part, because they are preliminary in character and they11 can be misconstrued.12 For instance, Your Honor, the FBI agents,13 generally speaking, have the practice of not keeping their14 notes of interviews. They take those notes, they make a15 file memorandum, they throw away the notes. Why do they16 do that? Of course they know the defendant would love to17 have those notes when it comes time for a trial. They do18 it because they feel that they have written it up in an19 accurate way, and enough's enough.20 That's what we're talking about here, Your Honor.21 And there was nothing in the language of 1512 that would22 have put Andersen on notice that its document-retention23 policy was -- well, in fact, the Government doesn't say24 its document retention was a crime; it says it wasn't a25 crime. Instead, the crime was when David Duncan asked his19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 secretary to throw away documents that he could have2 thrown away, lawfully, himself. This statute does not3 give fair warning that that --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was Section 1519 at issue?5 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. Section 1519 did6 not get passed until the year 2002. It did not exist.7 Instead, the rule that was in force then was the Pettibone8 rule, the one that's reflected in the text of Section9 1505; and that is, "the proceeding must be pending."10 That's, no doubt, why the Government didn't charge11 Andersen with a crime under Section 1505. I mean, they12 make it sound like the culpability here is the destruction13 of records. Well, if so, then you would think that they14 would have charged Andersen with destroying documents --15 16 1718 provision19 the -- whether the proceeding is pending? I forget which20 one it is.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait a minute --MS. MAHONEY:  -- but they didn't.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- wasn't there anotherin effect that said it doesn't matter whether21 MS. MAHONEY: Well, that -- no, that's just 15-22 -- that's 1512, for witness tampering. But for the act of23 destroying documents to interfere with a proceeding --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.25 MS. MAHONEY: -- that's Section 1505, and the20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 proceeding must be pending. And that is -- that is still2 the rule today, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- just to make it4 clear, I take it you would still have the same objection5 to the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a6 proceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?7 MS. MAHONEY: Well, if a proceeding is -- yes,8 we would, in this case. Yes, absolutely. But, you know,9 if a proceeding is pending, then it changed the -- changes10 the way that you apply the definition of "corruptly." But11 you're certainly right that the definition is the same.12 The question is, under the proper definition of13 "corruptly," did you induce the witnesses to engage in14 this activity through improper means, such as bribery, or15 did you try to get them to violate their independent legal16 duties? For instance, if they had duties, under Section17 1519, not to destroy, then it makes perfect sense, because18 what you have done is, you have asked the witness to19 engage in conduct which violates the law, and that20 corrupts them, it harms them, it fits with the purposes of21 the statute, it fits with the structure.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it was proper, then, for23 Michael Odom to tell the Andersen personnel when he's24 encouraging them to follow the policy -- he said, "If it's25 destroyed in the course of normal policy and litigation,21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 and litigation is filed the next day, that's great. We2 followed our policy, and whatever there was that might3 have been of interest to somebody, it's gone and4 irretrievable."5 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's fine for him to make7 that linkage between, "Destroy it. Maybe there's going to8 be litigation filed tomorrow." "That's great. It will be9 gone"?10 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, at the time that he11 made that statement, what that statement actually reflects12 is the Pettibone rule. He was accurate in his -- in his13 statement about what the law was governing document14 destruction at the time. That's a good-faith reasonable15 belief that was absolutely supported by the law.16 But, more importantly, Your Honor, if we look at Mr.17 Odom's remarks, he wasn't working -- he wasn't -- this18 wasn't in connection with the Enron engagement; there were19 only, I think, ten people, out of, like, 80, at that20 training seminar that had anything to do with Enron. He21 was talking about the firm's document-retention policy.22 The jury asked to see that videotape. They may have23 actually convicted Andersen based upon his remarks about24 the document-retention policy. They, similarly, may have25 convicted Andersen based upon Nancy Temple's memos that --22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425one of which was a reminder to the engagement team thatthey were supposed to applying -- complying with thedocument-retention policy.  That's legal services.  This--          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Odom wasn't saying this inthe abstract.  There were other proceedings, weren'tthere?          MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, it was just atraining session that was just a -- a section of thetraining session.  It has -- literally, I think there were89 attendees, only about ten of them --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At the time of that training,were there not other proceedings involving ArthurAndersen?          MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  No, I don'tbelieve so.  That's --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  There were, involving Enron, atthat point, isn't that correct?  The -- Enron had gottenthe letter?          MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  That was onOctober the 10th.  The letter did not come until Octoberthe 17th.  Andersen learned about it on October the 19th.          I'd like to save the remainder of my time forrebuttal, please.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Ms.23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mahoney.Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Arthur Andersen's conduct in this case explainswhy Congress enacted a statute like Section 1512 thatprotects against the anticipatory destruction of documentswhen a proceeding is --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, Section 1519, enactedsubsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than1512?          MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, Section 1519 wasenacted after the events --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.          MR. DREEBEN:  -- in this case in order to plugthe loophole that Arthur Andersen has pointed out existedin Section 1512 at the time.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you think it's superfluous.1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise infutility, because the law already did what 1519 said.          MR. DREEBEN:  No.  The law did not already dowhat 1519 says.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wherein does it go further?24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: It reaches single-actor2 obstructive conduct. What Ms. Mahoney has said --3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about the4 Pettibone interpretation that has been outstanding for a5 long time?67 O'Connor,8 similarly9 against obstruction of pending judicial, administrative,MR. DREEBEN:  Pettibone applied, Justiceto a specific statute, Section 1503, and it'sincorporated in 1505.  Those statutes protected10 and congressional proceedings. The innovation in Section11 1512 was to reach beyond the existence of a pending12 proceeding and to ensure that basically the store doesn't13 get robbed before the proceeding starts.14 If Arthur Andersen is correct, the anticipation of a15 grand jury investigation that is thought to occur the next16 day, a corporation can send out a directive to its17 employees and say, "Shred all the smoking guns." It's the18 corporate equivalent of seeing something that looks like a19 crime scene and sending somebody in before the police can20 get the yellow tape up to wipe down the fingerprints.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: When can they do it? When can22 they do it? You didn't allege here that it was in23 anticipation of any particular proceeding. You say they24 can't do it once they know that the investigation is on25 the way. But your theory in this case is that they can't25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425do it, whether they know the investigation is on the wayor not.  They can't destroy any evidence that might be thesubject of an investigation.          MR. DREEBEN:  No, that's not our theory --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is your theory?          MR. DREEBEN:  Our theory is that a person actscorruptly when anticipating a reasonable possibility of aninvestigation into a specific matter, directs anotherperson to destroy documents that are potentially relevant.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  "A reasonable possibility of aninvestigation."          MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you want criminal liabilityto turn upon that.          MR. DREEBEN:  I think that --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether or not there is areasonable possibility of an investigation.  You wantsomebody to go to jail on how a jury decides thatquestion.          MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think there's anythingunusual about the decision of that kind of question atall.  It's a analogous, but different and quitedistinguishable nexus requirement from the kind of nexusrequirement that this Court interpreted Section 1503 tohave in the --26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose I have a company and Iknow that the pattern is, I'm going to be audited everyfive years by the IRS.  And in year four, I -- one year --one year before the investigation, I instruct mybookkeeping staff, "Keep everything you need to documentour expenses, but destroy everything that's remotelyrelated to that, or indirectly related to that.  Give themjust a clean, simple file.  Destroy anything that's -- allsupporting documentation.  Give them what they need andwhat they're entitled to have, but nothing else.  Andstep up that policy, because they're going to be here nextyear."  Under your -- it seems to me that that violatesyour rule.          MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Kennedy, it turns onwhether the intent there is to subvert, undermine, orimpede the proceeding.  And the answer is, if it is yes,then it would be prohibited by this statute.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it would be prohibited totell somebody to do it.          MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you could do it.  The doingof it is perfectly okay.you?MR. DREEBEN:  That was a --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't that seem strange to27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425               MR. DREEBEN:  It seemed strange to Congress,     too.  And when this case threw a spotlight on that     omission in the statute, Congress didn't react --               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would suggest that it throws     a spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong.  It     doesn't --[Laughter.]               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it doesn't make -- it     doesn't make any sense to make unlawful the asking of     somebody to do something which is, itself, not unlawful,     so that the person could do it, but if you asked them to     do it, you're guilty, he's not guilty.  And that's -- that     is weird.[Laughter.]               MR. DREEBEN:  What was weird about it, Justice     Scalia, is that it allowed the person to do it himself.     And when Congress --               JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, let me ask you about     this precise thing.  Is it Mr. Duncan?  If he had,     himself, shredded the documents, or destroyed them, that     was perfectly okay at the time it was done.               MR. DREEBEN:  It wasn't --               JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is that right?               MR. DREEBEN:  -- prohibited by this statute.And when --28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It would not have been aviolation.          MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But the Government got theconviction, got him to plead guilty, apparently, on thebasis that if he asked somebody else to do what wasperfectly lawful for him to do, it would violate thestatute.          MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, Justice O'Connor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what -- how do you readthat in coordination with the so-called safe-harborprovision for legal advice and so on?          MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that the safe-harborprovision substantially bears on this case at all.  Firstof all, Arthur Andersen never raised the safe-harborprovision, so that the Government would --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And the woman lawyer neverraised it, is that right?          MR. DREEBEN:  Nancy Temple was not a defendantin this case, but her conduct was at issue, because, afterhaving immediately recognized that an SEC investigationwas highly probable, Nancy Temple sends out a documentreminder saying --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well --          MR. DREEBEN:  -- basically, "purge the files."29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But under this statute, with2 the safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her,3 as a lawyer, to say, "You can destroy these documents"?4 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it is, in this case, if her5 intent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the --6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your definition of7 "subvert, undermine" is, if you destroy any document that8 might raise a question, say, in the IRS audit. It seems9 to me that is a sweeping position, which will cause10 problems for every major corporation or small business in11 this country. I just -- I just don't understand it.12 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,13 because the Government's position here has never been that14 the mere existence of a document-destruction policy used15 under routine circumstances is a violation of the statute.16 What the Government focused on in this case was using a17 document-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to18 clean up and purge files when a government investigation19 was anticipated and it was perceived that these materials20 would be relevant.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's like in -- the22 old -- the rule in the Army, "Make two copies of23 everything you throw out." I mean, that's what they're24 going to have to do.25 [Laughter.]30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think --2 JUSTICE BREYER: You used words --3 MR. DREEBEN: Under this statute, Justice4 Kennedy, that's not the issue. I think the timeline here5 is critical. This was not a company that was routinely6 exercising a document-destruction policy, or document-7 retention policy, to maintain only that which was8 necessary for its ongoing business.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it was. The training10 session that you introduced in evidence was precisely11 that, a general training session for all employees,12 saying, "This is our document," quote, "retention policy."13 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but that was triggered, in14 part, by Nancy Temple's recognition -- in the midst of15 serving on a crisis response team, recognizing that Enron16 was in the process of imploding, Arthur Andersen, which17 was basically on probation with the SEC -- because it had18 been previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior19 summer, and was under a cease and desist order -- and20 seeing the SEC coming down the pike, at that moment, she21 decides to remind the Enron team, which had not been at22 all compliant with this document-retention policy, "It's23 time to get the files in line." This wasn't because all24 of a sudden the company had become preoccupied with25 neatness; it was so that it could document, in its audit31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 work papers, those things that supported its conclusions.2 That's what its document policy said.34 Enron had 5678 begun to become -- surfacing in the Wall Street Journal,9 in the financial press, the stock price was sliding.JUSTICE SCALIA:  He says that occurred beforeeven gotten a letter.MR. DREEBEN:  But not --JUSTICE SCALIA:  That meeting.MR. DREEBEN:  -- not before Enron's problems had10 Everybody who was sophisticated in this environment -- and11 surely Arthur Andersen was -- knew that when a Fortune 50012 company is looking at a potential need to restate its13 income statements because the accountants have been --14 proved a black-and-white violation of GAAP, and they all15 knew that16 to occur.1718 that they19 would be no problem. But what20 illegal to do what every other21 do if they don't have an audit22 I just don't understand it.23 MR. DREEBEN: No other company in the country24 would do this, Justice Kennedy. This is an extraordinary25 case precisely because --32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005that was true, that SEC proceedings are likely Even the witness --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Ifdid this in order toyou -- if you had allegedcover up a fraud, thereyou're doing is to say it'scompany in the country canimmediately on the horizon.￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that it would be2 perfectly okay for this company, or any other one, to3 destroy their documents. What's bad is telling somebody4 to destroy the documents.5 MR. DREEBEN: But in an organizational context,6 that's the only way that directives like this can be given7 out and implemented. This wasn't a case of --8 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you know that the --9 you've put your finger on a problem for me. You have10 said, Would it be the case that a person, before the11 proceeding begins, could simply tell somebody else to12 destroy the smoking gun? I understand that you fear that13 Andersen's approach would lead to that result. And it's14 bothering me. Therefore, I'd like you whether the word15 "corruptly" could include a person who knows three things:16 one, that the investigation, which has not yet started,17 almost certainly will want this document; two, there is no18 legal right to withhold it; and, three, that if I tell him19 to do it, it will be destroyed -- I mean, that it's20 important to the investigation. Important to the21 investigation, they want it, it's cover-up, and they will,22 in fact, have no legal right to take it back. Now, would23 that be "corrupt"?24 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it would --25 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼123 then does 45 case, and 67 there was8 doing the9 that it will be wanted, that it's important, and there isMR. DREEBEN:  -- be "corrupt."JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  IF that's "corrupt,"that cover this case?MR. DREEBEN:  I think that it does cover this--JUSTICE BREYER:  How?  Because it seems to mequite a lot of -- by the way, the person who'spersuading has to know this.  They have to know10 no legal right to withhold it. So it seems to me that, on11 the one hand, that does cover your problem, and, on the12 other hand, it does not cover this case. Now, that's what13 I'd like you to reply to.14 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think that15 the facts of the case are subsumed within the description16 that you've given. The jury instructions did not require17 findings on all of those features; and that is, in large18 part, because of the kinds of instructions that Arthur19 Andersen --20 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The jury instruction left21 out the word "corruptly," as far as I can see, in the part22 that was critical. They define "corruptly" as simply an23 intent to impede. And the word "impede" goes well beyond24 what I've said, both because it does not cover the three25 things, but, most particularly, because it does not say34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that it was dishonest or that the person who did the2 persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the3 investigation would have the legal right to get the4 material and there was no right to withhold it. The words5 that Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say6 precisely that, were at least a step in the right7 direction.89 than what10 about it,11 intent to12 I think --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't -- wasn't that14 instruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be15 the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of16 what was being done was no defense? I mean, if you had an17 instruction that depended upon the word "subvert," I could18 -- I could understand your argument. But it seems to me19 that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty20 with your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond21 "subvert" to merely "impede," and it included an22 instruction that good faith was no defense.23 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, this is to24 statute, and the word "corruptly" is not a word, that has25 been ever construed to require consciousness of35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. DREEBEN:  The jury instruction said lessyou have suggested, Justice Breyer, no questionbut what they did require was that there be anundermine, subvert, or impede the investigation.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425illegality.  That is a --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about "knowingly"?          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yeah, the word "knowingly."          JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about "knowingly"?  Doesthat -- does that usually connote knowledge of theillegality?          MR. DREEBEN:  Definitely not.  The word"knowingly" usually connotes knowledge of the underlyingfacts.  And, in this case --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Knowingly corruptly."          MR. DREEBEN:  The word "knowingly" does nottravel down the statute to modify "corruptly."  It --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't see why it doesn't.  Imean, there's no grammatical break.          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there is a logical break,because if it travel down the statute and reach all theway to "misleading conduct," what Congress would havewritten is a statute, when you read the definition of"misleading conduct," that says, "whoever knowinglyknowingly makes a false statement," because the definitionof misleading conduct includes "knowingly making falsestatements," "knowingly omitting things," "intentionallyengaging in deceptive behavior."  And you'd end up with a-- in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever.          It makes sense for Congress to have said,36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 "knowingly used force or intimidation." But then when you2 get to the word "threat," there is inherent knowledge in3 it. "Corruptly" inherently embodies knowledge. And the4 definition of "misleading conduct" inherently --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's certainly --6 MR. DREEBEN: -- embodies knowledge.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I will -- I will grant8 you that the definition that the Government asked for, and9 got, for "corruptly persuades," does have that10 implication, so far as the "subvert" prong is concerned.11 But when you get beyond the "subvert" prong, and you get12 down to the third one, "merely to impede," you're getting13 pretty thin, so far as the -- as the implication of14 knowledge of wrongdoing is concerned, and you've still go15 the problem of the instruction that negated good faith is16 a defense.17 MR. DREEBEN: Let me try to address each of18 those. First of all, the words were used as a definition19 of "improper purpose," and they were used together,20 "subvert, undermine, or impede," and they logically have a21 relationship to each other. When the Court of Appeals22 looked at those words and defined them, which it did, it23 talked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining24 of the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that25 the Government was anticipated to make. And I think,37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 "impede" has to be read logically in that group. Now, I2 will acknowledge that "impeding" can have broader3 connotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the4 obstruction --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why did -- if that is so, why6 did you need it? In other words, you had a -- you had a7 pattern instruction, apparently, that was -- that was8 keyed to "subversion," which I think would be an easy9 argument for you. If the addition of "impede" really10 wasn't adding that much, why did you ask the Court to put11 it in there?12 MR. DREEBEN: Here is what it adds, Justice13 Souter. "Undermine" and "subvert" have a connotation of14 completely preventing the performance of the official duty15 in the proceeding. "Impede" removes any implication that16 you need to totally thwart17 order to be guilty of this18 "interfere" with it, which19 Appeals used to define it.20 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you could21 undermine and be unsuccessful. It's not as though22 undermine means that you're necessarily going to succeed.23 MR. DREEBEN: No, but it was to avoid any24 connotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of25 those words that the Government sought the use of the word38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the government activity incrime.  It's enough tois the word that the Court of￼1 "impede." And I should note that it appears, in Section2 1503, Section 1505 --3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But not in 1512.4 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. That's correct.5 But what --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's not there.7 MR. DREEBEN: -- what the Government was doing8 in this instance was attempting to give content to the9 word "corruptly" that would enable the jurors to know that10 they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in11 dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext12 to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-13 finding ability of an anticipated proceeding.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but it sounds like --15 actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute,16 but that's, in a sense, my problem. The statute talks17 about "corruptly persuading another person to destroy a18 paper with the intent to impair that paper's availability19 for use in an official proceeding." So, then we look at20 the instruction, and the instruction speaks of "destroying21 the paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede."22 Fine. It sounds like it's just the same as the statute,23 but for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the24 word "corruptly."25 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, it's a definition39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of "corruptly" that --2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So to define3 "corruptly" as "doing the same thing that the rest of the4 statute does" seems a little strange. If I were a juror,5 I might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of6 purpose.7 MR. DREEBEN: The Court of Appeals addressed the8 argument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of9 "corruptly" that was used in this case is redundant and10 superfluous in light of the additional intent that --11 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not perfectly redundant.12 One can imagine driving a wedge between making something13 unavailable, which the jury would find relevant, or the14 investigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact-15 finding ability of the investigator. They're not16 logically identical, but they do strike me as so similar17 that it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a18 difference between those two phrases.19 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that they have a20 very significant difference, an important function in21 ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope22 of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is23 what Congress intended it to do.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge25 me to go back to a previous answer you gave? I'm sorry, I40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼89 10 11JUSTICE SCALIA:  3(a), right.MR. DREEBEN:  -- of the Government's appendix --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MR. DREEBEN:  -- to its brief, at the bottom ofsubsection (b) --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MR. DREEBEN:  -- appears, "Whoever knowingly1 didn't quite get it. In responding to Justice Souter's2 inquiry concerning the word "knowingly," you said the word3 "knowingly" appears later, so that it would be -- it would4 be reduplicative. What later appearance are you talking5 about, in 1512(b)?6 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, on page 5(a) --7 or, I'm sorry, on page 3(a) --12 the page, 131415 uses intimidation or physical force" --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.17 MR. DREEBEN: -- et cetera.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.19 MR. DREEBEN: The last phrase in the sequence is20 "engages in misleading conduct towards another person."21 That phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page22 11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the Government's23 appendix. It's Section 1515(a)(3). And it says the term24 "misleading conduct" means "knowingly making a false25 statement; intentionally omitting information from a41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425statement; with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting orinviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent tomislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on asample;" and, finally, "knowingly using a trick scheme ordevice."          So, "knowingly" is to be read in as if it werepart of Section 1512 when it comes to defining the term"engaging in misleading conduct," so you would end up witha statute that Congress have, for some reason, draftedthat includes the word "knowingly" at the beginning, andthen "knowingly" later as the definition of one of theterms that the initial "knowingly" --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I don't know how you canavoid that.          MR. DREEBEN:  You avoid it --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Whoever knowingly engages inmisleading conduct," which is later defined as --          MR. DREEBEN:  No.  It's, "Whoever knowingly usesintimidation or physical force."  That's what "knowingly"applies to.  And then the words "threaten, corruptlypersuade, and engages in misleading conduct," haveinherent knowledge in them.

DREEBEN:  And, in that context --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- why isn't the answer to yourargument that the requirement in (b) -- "knowingly"requirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down throughthe series, but it travels at least as far as "corruptlypersuades"?          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's sort of reading thestatute just to achieve a result.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but we know it --          MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's contrary to --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- applies to something at thebeginning of the series.  It's got -- it's got some workto do.  You've made an argument that it doesn't apply, orit would be logically absurd to apply it, to something atthe end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle.And why isn't the answer to your argument simply to say,43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 "Okay, it doesn't travel all the way to the end, but it2 travels up to the end, and it travels as far as this"?3 MR. DREEBEN: Because a "threat," itself, which4 is the third term in the series, and the one that precedes5 the term that's at issue here, also involves an element of6 scienter or knowledge. You can use intimidation7 inadvertently. You could be a very heavy, dangerous-8 looking guy, standing out in front of the grand jury room,9 and a witness might come along and see you and realize, to10 himself, "Uh-oh, I'm in trouble if I testify." If you11 haven't done that knowingly --12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that big, heavy guy13 would violate the statute just by standing there?14 MR. DREEBEN: He wouldn't, Chief Justice15 Rehnquist, precisely because it requires that he knowingly16 use intimidation. So that --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you can -- you18 can use intimidation unknowingly, any more than you can19 threaten unknowingly. If they felt it necessary to put20 "knowingly" before "use intimidation," I think they would21 have felt it necessary to put "knowingly" before22 "threaten." The two terms are just about identical.23 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that they're24 actually quite different in the context of this statute,25 but even if the Court were to conclude that "knowingly"44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 did travel down and produce a phrase, "knowingly2 corruptly," the word "knowingly" generally in the criminal3 law refers to "knowledge of the facts that make your4 conduct unlawful." Arthur Andersen here is asking for a5 very --6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, the --- in general terms,7 when you speak of "general interpretation," I suppose I8 think it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes9 with the following idea. Congress did not intend to try10 to make of the statute a highly general weapon for the11 Justice Department to pick and choose. That's a12 notification problem. It's also because we don't want one13 law, "It is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the14 Attorney General." You know, I mean, we want to have15 narrow criminal statutes.16 Now, is it reasonable to start with that frame17 of mind? And if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against18 you in this case?19 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it does,20 Justice Breyer. There are, of course, contexts where the21 Court concludes that a statute, after applying all the22 tools of statutory construction, is ambiguous, and then23 rules of construction do apply to narrow it; but there is24 no provision that says that the Court should approach the25 question of construction with a view to narrow it. I45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 think --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, how about the rule of3 lenity in the criminal statutes? If this thing is so4 confusing, how's the business person supposed to know what5 they can do? How's the lawyer supposed to know?6 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it is that7 confusing, Justice O'Connor. This is a statute that was8 enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-9 understood meaning of the word "corruptly." The same word10 appears in Section 1505. When the D.C. Circuit concluded11 that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular12 case, Congress came back with a definition that13 legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said14 "corruptly" means "acting with an improper purpose." The15 "improper purpose" in an obstruction-of-justice case has16 traditionally been "the purpose to obstruct justice."17 That definition logically applies to Section18 1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades19 provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it20 had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-21 tampering in the statute, originally. And some courts22 concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section23 1503, either.24 To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model25 of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test2 would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering3 a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the4 witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying5 documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an6 anticipation that the subpoena was likely. Those kinds of7 acts were considered to be unlawful.8 Similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to9 an individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith,10 not to protect that individual's own interest, but to11 obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal12 organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts13 had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had14 recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the15 time of the enactment of this statute. And Congress16 specifically said, "We want 1512 to be able to pick up the17 kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer18 prosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been19 included in the original version of 1512." So that there20 is history here that explains how these terms should be21 applied.22 And as far as Petitioner's contention that the23 word "corruptly" does nothing and leads to a series of24 horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and25 appropriate use of the word "corruptly" solves those47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 problems. Petitioners talk about how people should be2 able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary3 investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to4 engage in those conversations. But if an entity has5 subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply6 invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going7 to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that8 proceeding to invite them to exercise that right. If the9 agency wants their testimony, it can get it through10 compulsion.11 Similarly, Petitioners argue that document12 policies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's13 approach. But as the Court of Appeals specifically14 recognized in this case, a sound application of the word15 "corruptly" would look to whether there is a threat of16 some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an17 obligation not to destroy the documents before the18 proceeding gets started.19 And, as well, there are intents that are simply20 not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that21 may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable. And22 if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate23 another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to24 violate 1512. And a sound use of "corruptly" prevents all25 of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad.2 Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to3 attacking the word "corruptly," also has advanced a number4 of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some5 connection that had to be required between the Defendant's6 intent in a possible future proceeding. But the reason7 that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is8 largely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided9 to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the10 statute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to11 impose today. It never asked that the Defendant must be12 shown to believe that some particular proceeding was13 likely to occur in the near future. Instead, what it did14 is say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair15 an object's availability for use in a particular16 proceeding. And what the Court of Appeals said is that if17 there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error;18 it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding19 that was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron.20 And the other instruction that Petitioners asked21 for in the District Court is that the official proceeding22 must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the23 future. But that instruction is flatly contrary to the24 statute.25CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Dreeben.          I'd like to first address the fact that much ofthe Government's argument is focused on this nexus, theimminence of the proceeding, that sort of thing, butactually the jury was not required to find any nexuswhatsoever, and was told the wrong definition of an"official proceeding," to boot.  It was told that theinformal inquiry by the SEC staff was an officialproceeding, and that an official proceeding was alreadygoing on at the time of the events at issue here; in fact,even before Nancy Temple even knew about that informalinquiry, which, in and of itself, is reversible error.And --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you think it shouldhave been?          MS.

MAHONEY:  Thank you.Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Government's definition. That's in -- a matter within the2 jurisdiction of an agency, and that's not the language3 that appears in this statute.4 Also, in terms of whether Andersen raised this5 argument, of course they did. They asked for an6 instruction that the proceeding be ongoing or scheduled,7 because that was Fifth Circuit law at the time. Andersen8 wasn't supposed to guess that the Fifth Circuit was going9 to change what it had held in case called Shively. And10 the Fifth Circuit understood that Andersen had preserved11 the argument, and expressly says in its opinion that the12 issue is, What is the concreteness of the Defendant's13 expectation of a proceeding that should be required under14 this statute? -- and found that "feared" was enough.15 That's not enough. "Possible" is not enough, especially16 if a broad definition, like the one the Government wants17 to have -- there's got to be a serious nexus.18 Nexus problems can be avoided, though, if the19 more traditional definition of "corruptly" is used in the20 first place, which is not only required by lenity, but,21 frankly, is required even by the witness-tampering cases22 under Section 1503. As I read to you, the definitions of23 "corruptly" are completely consistent with Andersen's24 definition.25 The Government says, "Oh, no. In fact, all it51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 meant under 1503 was an intent to obstruct justice." That2 can't possibly be what Congress intended for Section 1512,3 because this Court had held, for -- a hundred years ago,4 that you necessarily lack the evil intent to obstruct if a5 proceeding is not pending. And 1512 does apply even6 before proceedings begin, so the definition had to be7 tailored to the precise circumstances of Section 1512. It8 couldn't import the precise thing.9 Plus, the definition under 1503 has never been10 any intent to impede the fact-finding ability is a11 prohibited intent. That would require lawyers and clients12 all over the country to go to jail. It's that you intend13 to subvert and undermine the integrity of the due14 administration of justice. And that term does not mean15 simply to impede the fact-finding; it means that you16 intend to disobey those duties that are imposed upon you17 in the course of a proceeding. And cases, including the18 Howard case cited in our brief and cited by the19 Government, make that crystal clear. It is not translated20 to what this jury instruction was, which is that -- any21 intent to impede fact-finding.22 Just take a look at the examples, if the23 Government were correct about this. If I were to ask my24 lawyer to assert, let's say, a reporter's privilege that25 is debatable, under the Government's -- and I do it,52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because I know that that document is harmful, and I wantto keep it out of the proceeding -- under the Government'sdefinition, that is corrupt, because I am trying to getanother person to withhold a document in order to impedethe fact-finding ability of the decision-maker.          It makes no sense to define "corruptly" thatway.  If you, instead, define it with reference to duties,it makes perfect sense.  That's not corrupt, because thereis no duty to provide a document when you have a good-faith claim of privilege.          Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.Mahoney.
