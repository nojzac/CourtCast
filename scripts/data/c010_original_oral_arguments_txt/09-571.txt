Thompson.            Mr. Duncan.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            MR. DUNCAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:101112   training prosecutors.  The Petitioner, Orleans Parish13   District Attorney's Office, was found liable for the14   terrible injuries caused to Mr. Thompson by a Brady15   violation on the theory the office was deliberately16   indifferent to Brady training, this despite the fact17   that there was proved no pattern of previous misconduct18   by office prosecutors.19               The district court exempted this case from20   the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed21   analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton22   opinion.  There, the Court suggested that a city may be23   liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police24   officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly25 force.                                3                    Alderson Reporting Company            This case asks when a district attorney'soffice may be liable under section 1983 for inadequately￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               Extending that hypothetical to this case was2   error.  It misunderstood Canton's distinction between3456   between?  Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one7   rookie police officer.  Here, it wasn't one roguesingle-incident and pattern liability, nullifyingCanton's stringent standards of fault and causation.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't this something in 8   prosecutor.  There were four prosecutors who knew of 9   this blood evidence, and there were multiple10   opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them11   apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this12   quiet.13               Now, if we were just talking about -- what14   was his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case.15   But we have the three other prosecutors.  And so I think16   it's questionable to characterize this as a single17   incident.18               MR. DUNCAN:  I understand your question,19   Justice Ginsburg.  Our argument does not turn on whether20   it was one or three or four prosecutors.  What our21   argument does turn on is that the theory from the Canton22   hypothetical, which does not require a pattern, was23   clearly at issue in this case.  The district court24   analogized to Canton in order to allow the jury to find25   liability absent a pattern.                                4                    Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            There is no question that, whether it wasone or four prosecutors, this is a single incident of aBrady violation.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, this is asingle incident, and Canton said if you know that a tortis likely to happen without training, then one incidentis enough.Official - Subject to Final Review            Every prosecutor knows that there can beBrady violations if people are not taught what Bradymeans, because it's not self-evident in every situation,1011   correct?12               MR. DUNCAN:  That's -- that's true, Justice13   Sotomayor.  Yes.14151617   out of law school.  If you know that they are going to18   meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively19   known, like that if you get a lab report, you should            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So if youknow that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors'offices are filled with young ADAs who have just come20   turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that21   what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab22 reports?23               Now, I know you claim you had that policy.24               MR. DUNCAN:  Correct.25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We can talk later about                                5                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the 2   jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not. 3   That's a sufficiency of the evidence question. 4               But if you know that lab reports have to be 5   turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not 6   to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no 7   policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had 8   no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible 9   for a Canton-like violation?10               MR. DUNCAN:  The question is under the Brady11   scenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on?12   Does it fall on the single-incident line or the pattern13   line?  We say it falls on the pattern line.14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Life doesn't always come15   in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this16   doesn't fit into a single rookie.17               You have -- if you have four prosecutors who18   are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like19   there's kind of a culture in the office that we don't20   turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because21   one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will22   show you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from23   Thompson to have it mean anything.24               So there was misunderstanding about that.25   But what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into                                6                    Alderson Reporting Company￼               Official - Subject to Final Review1   a single incident, it doesn't fit.  So we have a2345   Canton, Your Honor.  Let me answer it this way:  If we6   pay close attention to the function of thesituation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directlyconfronted before.MR. DUNCAN:  I think the Court has in 7   single-incident hypothetical in Canton, I think it 8   illuminates the kind of notice, the kind of fault, and 9   the kind of causation that needs to arise out of a10   general situation.11               So looking carefully, what Canton said is:12   A policymaker who fails to give police officers the13   basic constitutional standard for deadly force, which14   they are not equipped to know in the beginning, and15   without which they --16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you tell me -- I17   think I have a copy.18               MR. DUNCAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Yes.19   This is -- this is -- I'm referring to the -- the basic20   Canton standard is at 390, page 390 of the Canton21   opinion.  And specifically, the footnote is footnote 10,22232425   footnote 10.  City policymakers know -- "For example,"that discusses the two possibilities, the no-pattern andthe pattern possibilities.So -- and I'm reading from Canton at             7Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   the Court said, "city policymakers know to a moral 2   certainty that their police officers will be required to 3   arrest fleeing felons.  The city has armed its officers 4   with firearms, in part to allow them to accomplish this 5   task.  Thus, the need to train officers in the 6   constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force... 7   can be said to be 'so obvious' that the failure to do 8   so" is "deliberate indifference." 9               Now, what we have there, as Justice10   O'Connor's concurrence in that case and then later the11   Court's opinion in Bryan County explain, you have a12   failure to inform city personnel of the basic standard13   without which they have no hope of doing their job in a14   constitutional manner.  So you put your employees in a1516171819202122232425situation of impossibility, and when a deadly forceviolation occurs, what you have --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  These are people whohaven't gone to law school, right?            MR. DUNCAN:  That's correct.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And do not know that youcannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?            MR. DUNCAN:  They've got no backgroundequipment to know what the constitutional standard is.And so that satisfies, in a general situation --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you were giving guns to                           8               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   lawyers, it might have been different. 2               (Laughter.) 3               MR. DUNCAN:  It could be, Your Honor. 4               Here, you're giving -- 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Depending on the law school 6   they went to or what? 7               {Laughter.) 8               MR. DUNCAN:  It could be. 9               However, what you are giving to lawyers here10   is the task of analyzing legal judgments.  Can lawyers'11   judgments go astray, Justice Sotomayor?  Absolutely.12   Absolutely.  But --13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now what you're14   suggesting is that for certainty you know that a15   lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a16   particular area of law is that complicated.17               Your people disagreed -- some of your people18   disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab19   report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when20   you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady21   violation.  That has been conceded in this case, so I22   accept as a working proposition that they should have23   known that.24               What you're suggesting is you get a pass25   because, even though you know that there's an area of                                9                    Alderson Reporting Company￼123456   example.7Official - Subject to Final Reviewlaw that a young lawyer is not going to be able tofigure out on their own, you fail to train them andyou're okay.                 MR. DUNCAN:  Well, that --                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not the Canton 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what you're10   saying.11               MR. DUNCAN:  No, that's not what we're12   saying.  We're not saying that the policymaker                MR. DUNCAN:  That is not -- that's the8   Canton example, Your Honor.  What we have here --13141516171819202122232425inevitably knows my prosecutors are going to make thismistake, and so I need to train on it and I don't careabout training on it.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then why don't wejust --            JUSTICE ALITO:  Can we just -- can we clearsomething up?            MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, sir.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you -- are you acceptingthe proposition that Brady always requires that labreports be turned over?            MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  What we wouldconcede in this case is --                           10               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911   have evidence in this case that the -- uncontradicted12   evidence, that the office policy was to turn over all13   scientific reports.  But --                 MR. DUNCAN:  Sure.            JUSTICE ALITO:  I know you concede thatthere was a Brady violation here --            MR. DUNCAN:  Yes.            JUSTICE ALITO:  -- but in answer to some ofthe questions, it seems to me you were possibly -- or atleast you did not express an opinion on the suggestionthat it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turnover a lab report.                 MR. DUNCAN:  I'm not aware that it would10   always be a violation of Brady.  However, of course, we            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Duncan, could I give youa hypothetical -- -141516171819202122   system.  So sometimes important cases will be tried by23   experienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by24   people right out of law school.  And there will be no25   Brady supervision at all, no Brady training.  And there                                11                    Alderson Reporting Company            JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- just to test how strongyour position is here.            So let's say that there is a new DA comes totown, and he says, there's going to be one attorney percase from now on, and it will be a random assignment￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   is a closed file system, that we only turn over what 2   we're required to turn over and not anything else. 3               And in addition to that, if I, the DA, find 4   that you have turned over things that you're not 5   required to turn over, that will be taken into account 6   in your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary 7   purposes, et cetera.  That will be very severely frowned 8   upon. 9               So he, the new DA --10               MR. DUNCAN:  I'm sorry -- repeat the last11   part again, the "severely frowned upon" part.12               JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you turn over anything13   that you didn't have to.  Okay?14               MR. DUNCAN:  Exactly.  I understand.15               JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you give any material16   that you're not required to do by law.17               And so he puts into place this whole system18   and -- and says, okay, go to it.  And what happens is19   that there are Brady violations.  And there's a Brady202122232425violation in a capital case and the person sits on deathrow, or the person is executed, whichever, and there's aclaim brought.            Is that claim not a good claim?            MR. DUNCAN:  If there is a pattern ofdemonstrated --                           12               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review123456   violation, Justice Kagan.  But in your hypothetical, you7   noted a policy of actually assigning inexperienced            JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's not a pattern,because he just came to town and he just, you know,instituted all these policies, and this is the firstBrady violation.MR. DUNCAN:  Not for the first Brady 8   prosecutors randomly to perhaps high-profile cases. 9               If that were the facts, the jury, as they10   could have in this case, could have found that an11   official policy actually caused the violation.  But they12   didn't find it in this case.  So the hypo leaves open13141516171819202122232425that possibility.            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the failure to train orsupervise in any way and the setting up a structuralsystem that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Bradyviolations, that would not be enough?            In other words, even if the jury said yes,you are liable under that second theory -- not thepolicy theory, but the failure to train and supervisetheory -- that -- that would have to be rejected?            MR. DUNCAN:  No -- exactly, Your Honor.  Noliability there, because it doesn't meet the stringentfault and causation standards of Canton.            This goes back to --                           13               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5   word-for-word taken from Canton.  And when I read the 6   question that you presented in your Petitioner's brief 7   -- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case 8   was about was an instance where there was only -- it was 9   conceded that there was only one such instance.10               But then when I read your second reiteration11   of the question, which is a little different, and read12   the briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones.13   And so what you're really asking us to do is to decide14   in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence15   supports them.  I didn't think I was getting into that,16   and, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly17   supports it, but others could disagree.  But why are weJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how is that so?  The-- I've read the instruction that the court gave, and itseemed to me the instruction the Court gave was18192021   you're asking?  Is there something in the instructions22   that is wrong?  What?getting into that business in this Court?            MR. DUNCAN:  We're not asking you to.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then what is it23               MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, the instructions --24               JUSTICE BREYER:  What?25               MR. DUNCAN:  -- reflect that the single                                14                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   incident theory -- 2               JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.  Where -- I'm 3   reading the instruction.  I have it here.  What is it? 4   I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm just saying, what in 5   the words stated are wrong?  And where is the request 6   that they be stated differently?  That I should look at 7   that, and that they weren't.  Okay. 8               MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  Let me 9   help you with that.  The -- the -- at the Joint Appendix10   page 828, we have the instructions on deliberate11   indifference.12131415161718   indifference.  Let me start here, Justice Breyer.  These19   instructions are taken from the Second Circuit's Walker20   decision, which was the first court that I am aware of21   to allow for the possibility of single-incident22   liability in a Brady situation.23               The second instruction there allows a24   choice.  It allows a choice for the jury to find that a25   single-incident situation -- I'm sorry -- that a                                15                    Alderson Reporting Company            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  What'sthe page number.MR. DUNCAN:  828.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  828.MR. DUNCAN:  Joint Appendix 828.There are the instructions on deliberate￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   situation involving a Brady decision could arise and be2 a basis -- 3               JUSTICE BREYER:  What are the words -- I 4   mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are 5   pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said.  So 6   what are the words on page 828 that you think he should 7   have said that he didn't say? 8               MR. DUNCAN:  "The situation involved a 9   difficult choice or one that prosecutors had a history10   of mishandling."11               JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What he says12   here is, "The situation involved a difficult choice or13   one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling,14   such that additional training, supervision, or15   monitoring was clearly needed."16               So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading17   the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo18   here.  It looks to me like he gave those words.19               MR. DUNCAN:  That is the -- I'm sorry.  Then20   I misunderstood your question.  Those are the actual21   instructions.22               JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying what is it that23   you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you24   asked him not to do that he did do?  That's what25   happens.  That's the way you object to an instruction.                                16                    Alderson Reporting Company￼8 9101112131415161718            MR. DUNCAN:  The Petitioners specificallyasked that an instruction be given that required apattern of similar violations --            JUSTICE BREYER:  I want you to point out inthe record the words that were said to the districtcourt saying, Judge, I want you to say this, and thenthe judge didn't do it.            MR. DUNCAN:  It is instruction number 14.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Which is where?            MR. DUNCAN:  The proposed instruction.  IOfficial - Subject to Final ReviewMR. DUNCAN:  I understand, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So what is that?MR. DUNCAN:  I misunderstood.  I was reading12345   the jury instructions.  What the Petitioners --6               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought he asked that.7   So I was glad to see that.  Thank you.where I thought the single-incident theory was posed in     regret to say I don't believe that's in the Joint19   Appendix, Your Honor.  And it is also --202122232425   objection?            JUSTICE BREYER:  Then I think we take it assaying that you not objecting to what -- to instruction.MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.               17   Alderson Reporting Company            JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, your whole brief isobjecting to the instruction, and you didn't include the￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  The argument 2   is not about the specific jury instruction.  It's about 3   the legal theory.  What it's about -- 4               JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait.  If you don't 5   object to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm 6   saying, that what you're objecting to is you don't think 7   the evidence was such that, given that instruction, the 8   jury could find guilt.  And that's what I thought this 9   case wasn't about to begin with, and there are three10   other instances.  So I don't see why, given this111213141516171819202122232425instruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.            MR. DUNCAN:  What our main complaint is, isabout the failure of the district court to grant amotion for summary judgment and a judgment as a matterof law on the basis that a failure-to-train theory underthese circumstances does not permit the single -- thesingle-incident --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understood -- andmaybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that therewas no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor couldbe handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure totrain for one incident.it came --MR. DUNCAN:  Absent a pattern.  Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was the petition as               18   Alderson Reporting Company￼8 9101112131415side because the general Brady situation is unlike thesingle-incident --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you --            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I add to myhypothetical, then?            MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, Your Honor.            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose that this newdistrict attorney said -- you know, every day he cameOfficial - Subject to Final Review1               MR. DUNCAN:  Correct.2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it doesn't matter3   what the facts are.  The facts that Justice Kagan gaveyou would never constitute an actionable claim against aprosecutor; is that your position in this case?4567   hypothetical, yes.  It would have to fall on the patternMR. DUNCAN:  That's -- under the Canton16   into the office and he said:  I think Brady is just17   crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the18   Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't19   get caught, anything you do is okay by me.20               MR. DUNCAN:  That sounds like a policy to21   me, Your Honor.  That sounds like a policy, an22232425   office.actionable policy on the part of the policymaker.            JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not a policy.  He'sjust, you know, making his views known around the            19Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. DUNCAN:  Well, this Court has defined2   "policy" as a deliberate choice to embark on a course of3   action in Pembaur, which this Court accepted.  That4   sounds like a policy to me.  If it's not a policy --5678   get penalized for doing so.  That's the policy.9               MR. DUNCAN:  Well, then the policy is            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then the policy is just thatyou -- you have to turn over what you have to turn over,nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you'll10   constitutional.  So what we would look to is, are11   prosecutors failing to exercise their judgment properly12   pursuant to that policy?  And that falls very squarely13   within the second part of the Canton choices, which14   requires a pattern.15               This case is about the alleged failure to16   remedy, to guide, to reinforce, the pre-existing legal17   judgment that a prosecutor has by virtue of being a18   legal professional.19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that so?  I mean, you20   are assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a21   course in criminal procedure, and I think there are many22   law schools where they don't even have such a course and23   others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's24   compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure.  So25   you're assuming that.  And, of course, the time is                                20                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   running.  There's something I wanted to ask you about 2   Brady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would 3   want special vigilance.  And that is, Miranda warnings, 4   you know what was said; search and seizure, you know 5   what the police did.  But the problem with Brady -- and 6   this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know. 7   If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, 8   there's a very high risk, as there was in this case, 9   that it will never come to light.10               So, recognizing the legal obligation of the11   prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady12   evidence because it doesn't help the State's case,13   shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking14   about a Brady claim?15               MR. DUNCAN:  Well, of course, there should16   be vigilance, but the question you pose,17   Justice Ginsburg, is whether the latency, the18   hiddenness, that characterizes Brady violations should19   change where we locate the Canton violation.  Should it20   be enough to put it into the single-incident, so-obvious21   category, or still in the pattern category?  But Canton22   doesn't indicate that the latency of a particular23   violation should -- should turn on which category it24   goes into.  Instead, it's the nature of the employee25   duties and the employees themselves and how                                21                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   that situation gives notice to a policymaker about when2   there are obvious training risks.  That's what we're3456   not -- of course, it's not.  But the office has failed7   not just to train, but to inform of the basictalking about.            So to go back to the hypothetical in Canton,whether or not a deadly force situation is secret or 8   constitutional duty without which those officers have no 9   chance of fulfilling their duties.  And when they do a10   deadly force violation under those circumstances, the11   causal link will be very strong.  It will be strong12131415   are met without the pattern.  But what -- you do not16   have that in the situation of Brady compliance because,17   as -- as everyone agrees Brady involves gray areas.  It18   is -- it is impossible to determine beforehand exactly19   why a Brady violation will occur and what specific20   training measures would prevent it from occurring.21               And what that means is this falls plainly22   within what Canton said about the pattern situation.23   And here's what Canton said in the footnote 10 following24   onto the hypothetical.  "It could also be that the25   police, in exercising their discretion, so often violate                                22                    Alderson Reporting Companyenough to meet Canton.            And so there you have -- there you have asituation where deliberate indifference and causation￼Official - Subject to Final Review123456   -- he read the instructions.  They came right out of7   Canton.  Seems perfect.8               Now you're saying, well, whether they did orconstitutional rights that the need for further trainingmust have been plainly obvious...."            That's the situation we have posed by theBrady situation in general.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But, look -- I 9   not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have10   liability if there's only one incident.  And at that11   point, I say, gee, I don't know.  I mean, maybe it12   depends on what the incident is.  Maybe the incident13   involved somebody saying, hey, Brady?  What's Brady?  Or14   somebody saying, what's a criminal trial?  I mean, that15   person needs training.16               And -- or -- but I don't even have to think17   of that here, because there were four incidents here.18   And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird19   hypotheticals.  So where we have four instances and we20   have correct instructions, what's the problem?21               MR. DUNCAN:  Your Honor, there weren't four22   instances.  There was one Brady violation that possibly23   could have involved one to four prosecutors.  That's24   one --25                                23                    Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay.  We have -- we￼               Official - Subject to Final Review1   have -- all this case?  I thought that they had several2345678   true.9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not -- not before thisinstances in other cases.            MR. DUNCAN:  No.  No, Your Honor.            JUSTICE BREYER:  All involved -- in otherwords, there has never in this office been an instanceof a Brady violation outside of this case.MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  That's not10   case.  There was some --11               JUSTICE BREYER:  After, that's what it was.12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- later, as far as we13   know.141516171819202122232425                                24                    Alderson Reporting Company            MR. DUNCAN:  There were some -- there werefour reported Brady violations before this case, in thedecade leading up, involving this office, that hadnothing to do with the circumstances involved here.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.  There were four Bradyviolations involving this office, okay?            MR. DUNCAN:  Correct, out of tens ofthousands of prosecutions.            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So now we'retalking about not one; we are talking about four --MR. DUNCAN:  We're -- but we're not --JUSTICE BREYER: -- over many years, with￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   tens of thousands of violations, correct?2               MR. DUNCAN:  What was -- the Fifth Circuit3   panel in this case affirmatively said Thompson did not4   even try to prove a pattern, and he did not prove a5   pattern of violations.  The Fifth Circuit panel said6   that.7               JUSTICE BREYER:  This is helpful.  Thank8   you.9JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On your instruction in --MR.

So:  "The14   situation involved a difficult choice and one that15   prosecutors had a history of mishandling."would the instruction in your view have been proper, if16               MR. DUNCAN:  That's closer to what it should17   be, Justice Kennedy, yes, because that begins to capture18   the pattern requirement.  It's not -- it's not the19202122232425   the Respondent in this case.  There's no -- there's no                                25                    Alderson Reporting Companypattern instruction that was specifically put forth bythe Petitioners in instruction number 15.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has there been -- hasthere been any argument that you have waived yourobjection to the instructions?MR. DUNCAN:  Not by Petitioners -- not by￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   -- question --2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you -- did you object3   to it?  To this charge?4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. DUNCAN:  The -- the charge?            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  With the "or" --difficult choice "or" one that prosecutors had a historyof mishandling.            MR. DUNCAN:  No, the Petitioners did notobject to the -- the specific formulation of that10   charge.  Immediately after that charge, though, they --11   they said, no, but we -- we have to have a pattern12   instruction here.  In other words --13141516171819   question presented to us.  You didn't present to us an202122232425issue of whether the jury instruction --            MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- was wrong or not.            MR. DUNCAN:  What we present is the legaltheory on which this case was submitted -- what got tothe jury in the first place never should have got to                           26               Alderson Reporting Company            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, thepattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?            MR. DUNCAN:  It was rejected.  It wasrejected twice, Your Honor, first in the formal juryinstructions and then at the charge colloquy.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that wasn't the￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   that legal theory at all.2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You see, what I'm trying3   to figure out is whether your position is that under no4   circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan5   set forth, could you be charged with a single-incident6   Canton violation.  That is your -- your theory?7 8 9            MR. DUNCAN:  With respect to the Bradysituation, Your Honor.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Brady situation.1011121314   fulfilling their constitutional obligations.  If we --15   it's difficult to imagine that situation for            MR. DUNCAN:  Let me answer it this way:What -- what the Canton single-incident hypo is talkingabout is failing to provide employees with basic tools,without which they absolutely have no chance of16   prosecutors.17181920   there's Brady evidence in the file.  If you have that21   situation, then it's closer to the Canton            It is -- it's conceivable that a districtattorney's office set up -- sets up a structure whereprosecutors have no chance of even knowing whether22   single-incident hypothetical, but not involving the23   exercise of legal judgment in particular cases.  We say24   no.25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how do you                                27                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what2   you're supposed to turn over?  That was Justice3   Ginsburg's question.4               MR. DUNCAN:  That's exactly -- that's my5   point.  That's my point.  If you don't -- if you don't6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425even -- in other words, if you don't even have a policefile, for instance, you can't exercise your legaljudgment if you don't even know what -- what thesubject of your legal -- the object of your legaljudgment is.            But that's not this case.  What we'retalking about here is a failure to remedy, reinforce,refine existing legal judgment that prosecutors have.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            MR.

GORDON COONEY, JR.               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MR. COONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            Although the Petitioners' brief attempts torelitigate factual issues that were resolved againstthem by the jury, they have raised today only onequestion of law, and that is whether this Court should                           28               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   write into section 1983 a per se rule that the only way, 2   the only way, a civil rights victim can ever establish 3   the deliberate indifference of a district attorney is if 4   he can prove a prior significant history of assistant 5   prosecutors violating other citizens' constitutional 6   rights. 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  For -- for Brady 8   violations.  They limit the principle to Brady 9   violations.10               MR. COONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I would11   submit that --12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's a significant13   limitation, don't you think?14               MR. COONEY:  But I would submit, Your Honor,15   that this Court's -- that their requirement for proving16   deliberate indifference is, first, contrary to the17   teaching of this Court in Canton and subsequent cases.18   It finds no place in the language of section 1983 --19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But at the -- but at the20   outset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong --21   that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to22   have a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train23   case.  You didn't mention that.24               MR.

COONEY:  It is absolutely a deliberateindifference to the need to train and provide otherprotections to the office.                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think that's very 9   tell assistant district attorneys if you were the10   district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you, with11   the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what12   kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with13   respect to Brady?14               MR. COONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  First of all15   I think Canton says you have to look at the specific16   circumstances.  And so I don't think there's a17   one-size-fits-all way or message that has to be18   provided.19               JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but you are training20   them, so:  Now I want to tell you what you have to do                JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, if you could -- could8   you just say as succinctly as possible what you would21 22 23 24 25under Brady.            MR. COONEY:  Well, first --            JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you tell them?            MR. COONEY:  In this office, Your Honor, Ithink the first thing one has to confront is Mr.                           30               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   Connick's testimony and, in fact, the concession that2   the Petitioners made on pages 6 and 7 of their merits3   brief that the office started with what the brief4   described as "Connick's disclosure policies were no5   mystery" -- turn over what the law required and nothing6   more.  I mean, that would be --7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well,8   Justice Alito's question was, what you would tell the9   assistant DAs?  What's your answer?101112131415   that rule?  The rule is perfectly lawful, my goodness.16               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I'm not saying it's17   an unlawful rule.  However, it requires a countervailing18   message.  And if you're going to adopt --            MR. COONEY:  And Mr. Chief Justice, with --if -- first of all, I wouldn't start with that rule.But if I started with that rule it would be incumbentupon me --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't you start with19               JUSTICE ALITO:  I really would appreciate it20   if you'd get to my question.  Brady requires that21   exculpatory evidence be turned over.  Now, do you -- do22   you think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know23   that?24               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I don't know that.25   It seems from the record in this case they thought that                                31                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   you are the instructor.  You phrase the lesson that you 5   think is required by Brady that has to be given to them. 6               MR. COONEY:  I think at a minimum it has two 7   pieces, Your Honor.  It has basic instruction about how 8   to go about fulfilling the Brady obligation, and how do 9   you go about looking through the file to make sure you10   know what's there, making sure you have documents that11   are in the possession of the police.12               Thinking in advance, as this Court talked13   about in the Agurs case, about what the evidence is14   going to be at trial and looking thoughtfully at that15   evidence to determine whether or not the evidence was16   favorable to the accused and needs to be produced.17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  That's your18   instruction on Brady.  Now, you're basing liability on19   -- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady.  So20   you say they should have instructed on Brady.21               What else should they have instructed on?22               MR. COONEY:  Well --23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're the -- you're24   the new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct25   my people.  What -- what do they instruct on?  I know                                32                    Alderson Reporting Companyonly something that screamed "exculpatory evidence" onits face needed to be turned over.JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Now, you phrase --￼               Official - Subject to Final Review1   they instruct on Brady under your view.  What else?23456789   violate the Constitution.  I think that's a good thing,            MR. COONEY:  I think the second thing thatthe -- that the office really should do is to -- to talkabout the importance of safeguarding the innocent here,that our job is not just to secure convictions.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we're lookingat -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to10111213   constitutional requirements.  We know Brady is one.14   What's the next one?  What's day 2 in the course?15               MR. COONEY:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I do16   think that there are other constitutional requirements17   involved.  Most of the hypotheticals, however, that have18   been brought before the Court as a parade of horribles19   aren't actions by the district attorney.20               JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, with respect, I21   really don't think, as a young district -- assistant22   district attorney, that you have told me anything that's23   going to be really helpful to me other than, you know,24   follow the law, which you certainly should do, in25   dealing with my obligation to turn over physical                                33                    Alderson Reporting Companyto tell them they have an obligation as well to protectthe innocent.But we're worried about violations of our￼89 10case where all I have was physical evidence, but therehas been no testing of it.            Now, do I have to turn over that physicalOfficial - Subject to Final Review1234567   physical evidence, I have a blood test.  I have anotherevidence, which is what's involved here.            MR. COONEY:  Your Honor --            JUSTICE ALITO:  Or a lab report regardingphysical evidence.            Now, suppose I have -- I have several cases.I have this case, where I have got blood -- I have11   evidence?12               MR. COONEY:  In this case, there has been a13   stipulation by the district attorney's office that you14   do.  And I think if you think about the evidence in this15 case --16               JUSTICE ALITO:  I have to turn over all17   physical evidence that's in my possession?18               MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor.19               JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.20               MR. COONEY:  But here, the specific --21               JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, what's the instruction22   that you're going to give me to tell me where I'm going23   to draw that line?24               MR. COONEY:  If you have physical evidence25   that, if tested, can establish the innocence of the                                34                    Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9person who is charged, you have to turn it over.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do I know thatbefore the --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, didn't they here?Didn't they make it available?            JUSTICE ALITO:  How do I know that beforethe physical evidence is tested?            Suppose I've got all sorts of items thatOfficial - Subject to Final Review     were found at the -- at the scene, and they might have10   DNA on them.  They might have epithelial samples on11   them -- you know, all this fancy forensic testing that's12   done these days.  Do I have to turn over all of that?131415161718192021222324   situation.  So the instruction would be:  If you have25   physical evidence and you have tested it for blood and            MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor.  In this case,what we're talking about is a piece of evidence, aspecific piece, several specific pieces of physicalevidence, that it has been stipulated the prosecutorsknew contained the blood of the perpetrator.            It -- the rule and the training that shouldhave been provided in this instance, particularly sincethe DA argues that it was perfectly clear that thatshould have been produced --            JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, you see what I'mgetting at is that you're dealing with a very specific            35Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   you have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but 2   you don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type 3   of the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that 4   has to be turned over. 5               And you're saying that the failure to 6   provide training to every assistant district attorney on 7   a question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a 8   potential claim, gives rise to a claim? 9               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, what I'm saying is10   I think there are at least three layers to the training11   that were missing here.  One was the clear message about12   the importance of Brady compliance.  The second was the13   basic ground rules about how you go about your Brady14   obligation.  And, third, if you have evidence that can15   conclusively establish to a scientific certainty the16   innocence of the person being charged, you have to turn17   it over or get it -- get it tested.  You can't just put18   it in your hip pocket and say, I know --19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  Wait a20   minute.  What evidence is there that they put this in21   their hip pocket?22               There was a disclosure that the evidence23   existed.  Where is the evidence that the defense counsel24   didn't have access to asking for it?25               MR. COONEY:  Yes, Your Honor --                                36                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or asking for it to be2   tested?  Where was that suppressed?3               MR. COONEY:  The -- the only information --4   there was a discovery response that was filed very5   shortly before trial, long after Mr. Thompson was6   charged with the crime, where in response to one of the7   questions, the response was:  "Inspection to be8   permitted."  If you look at the chronology --9 10 11 1215   simply -- and physical evidence from the scene of the16   crime.  The answer was:  "Inspection to be permitted."17               Then the blood evidence, the very next day,18   after the response was provided, was removed from the19   crime lab by the prosecutors, never to be found again.20   And defense counsel testified without impeachment at21   trial that he went to the evidence locker, looked in the22   evidence locker, found certain pieces of physical23   evidence consistent with the discovery response, but not24   the blood evidence, neither the blood report nor the25   physical specimens that were involved in this case, Your                                37                    Alderson Reporting Company            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what -- where's theBrady violation for telling a defense attorney there wasa blood sample there, you can test it?                 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, there was no13   information provided.  It was -- the simple response was14   that the request was for all scientific evidence, and it￼1 Honor. 2Official - Subject to Final Review            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that you are claimingthere was suppression of that evidence? 3 4 5 6 7 8   arguments. 9               Do you have to instruct new -- I suspect new10   prosecutors coming out of law school don't know what11   those rules are.  Do you have to give instruction on12   what they can say in closing arguments?13               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think, first of14   all, the issue has to rise to a constitutional level in15   order to be talking about this for section 198316   purposes.17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  My18   understanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in19   criminal law.  I need training in that.  But myMR. COONEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if it is --prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutionalrights by making improper statements in their closing20212223   people.  You know that.  You know that that can happen,24   just as you know there can be Brady violations.  So they25   need training in exactly what they can say and can't sayunderstanding is that comments in a closing argument cangive rise to a constitutional violation.So you should -- you should train those            38Alderson Reporting Company￼6 7 8 9course is expanding.            MR. COONEY:  Justice Kennedy --Official - Subject to Final Review1   in closing argument.2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And Miranda and proper3   supervision of affidavits in support of search warrants,4   and proper instructions that tell the police not to5   exceed the scope of the warrant.  So this is -- our            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the point ofconcern here is that we're going to have to go through alist, case by case, of everything there has to betraining on.10111213   some important distinctions here.  And, first of all,14   when you're talking about search and seizure, when15   you're talking about Miranda, you're talking about those16   things, the actor that is committing the constitutional17   tort there is not the district attorney.  It's theMR. COONEY:  I think -- I think there are18   police.  What we're talking about here, the19202122232425   should be given there.  But I think there's aconstitutional tort --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you're talkingabout improper comments in closing argument, it is theprosecuting attorney.            MR. COONEY:  But the second importantdistinction, Your Honor -- and I do believe training            39Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   fundamental distinction between a Brady violation, which 2   happens in private and may never be revealed and, if 3   revealed, often happens long after trial and long after 4   incarceration, and a situation where a prosecutor makes 5   an improper comment during a closing jury, which is made 6   in public.  Defense counsel has the opportunity right 7   there to stand up and say, Your Honor, I object, and the 8   court has the ability to address that issue then and9 there.10               With a Brady violation, you don't have any11   of that.  It's made in secret.  It's --12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't -- you13   don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?14               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think they do.15   But I think there's -- there's a particular issue.16   There's particular force in this context because of the17   unique nature of Brady, because it's made in private,18   because it is -- by definition, if the information has19   been concealed, it has not been revealed prior to the20   time the defendant suffers constitutional harm.  He's --21 22 23 24 25he's found guilty, he's sentenced to death, et cetera.            The Brady violation, unlike your situation,Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't come to light, perhaps ever.But in Mr. Thompson's case --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we have --                           40               Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review123456789   kill people if you're not properly trained.  Brady,            MR. COONEY:  -- more than a decade after hewas convicted.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it's something like Iwas trying to get at before when I said Miranda is outthere, you know what was said, you know what was seized,talking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn'tcome out with it, high risk it will never come out.So we have use of force, plus -- that can101112131415161718   Honor.  And -- and I think it's important to remember19   that in this case, this was a no-training case.  Thebecause if they don't come up with the information, itcould have what almost happened in this case.Anything else on this special list?MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The concern was that youdon't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinicallaw school course before you let them do their job.MR. COONEY:  I agree with that concern, Your20212223   enough?  I mean, is an hour a year enough?  Is an hour a24   month enough?evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson wasthere was zero Brady training in the office.JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what would have been25               MR. COONEY:  I think that would have been                                41                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   it asks the question:  Is there an obvious need for5   training based on the circumstances of thisdependent on what its content was, Your Honor, and theother circumstances of the office.If you look at Canton, what Canton does is 6   particular -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  As I understand it, 8   you -- you really have a need to train them, when you 9   know defense counsel is coming over to look at the10   physical evidence, don't remove from the locker some of11   the physical evidence.12               (Laughter.)13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want to give a course14 in that?15               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, what -- what16   happened is the physical evidence very conveniently was17   being sent to the crime lab when it was removed.  And so18   we don't know what the motivation was as to why that19   physical evidence was removed at that time.  What we20   know is for many, many months --21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then, you shouldn't22   have -- you shouldn't have mentioned it.  I thought you23   were -- you were asserting that it was intentionally24   removed in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing25 it.                                42                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review                 MR. COONEY:  What we assert, Your Honor --                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't know that.                 MR. COONEY:  It was certainly not -- it was                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, there's a10               MR. COONEY:  -- of not just that.11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is a causation12   problem here.  Even assuming training, if Deegan was123456789 --intentionally not placed back in into evidence after itcame back from the crime lab, and there was actualtestimony from the grand jury that was handling this andlooking into this situation for some period of time --131415161718192021   that directly.  First of all, the causation question was22   put to the jury; the jury instruction very clearly said23   in order for there to be liability here, the fault must24   be in the training program, not in the individual25   prosecutor.  And the defense argued vehemently that                                43                    Alderson Reporting Companygoing to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as headmitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lackof training is just irrelevant.are --MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think there            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm very concernedabout that causation aspect.MR. COONEY:  First of all -- let me address￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   there was a lack of causation.  What's interesting here 2   is -- 3               JUSTICE ALITO:  But the judge actually, 4   though, instructed the jury -- this is back on J.A. 5   828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's 6   failure to adequately train, monitor, or supervise 7   amounted to -- deliberate indifference, et cetera. 8               So liability could have been predicated not 9   on the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a10   process by which superiors in the district attorney's11   office reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were12   made by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct?13               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, the concept of14   monitoring or supervision was actually a concept that15   defendants injected into the case.  And so, to the16   extent that there is any concern that there's an17   expansion from training, it's been error that's invited.18   And I don't believe it's error, Your Honor, but it's not19   something that -- that was put into the case by the20   defense or the court.21               JUSTICE ALITO:  Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't22   that be error?  That the -- the head of a very large23   office is personally liable under Canton for violations24   that are -- that are produced by actions taken by25   subordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to                                44                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   review all of the decisions that are made by those2   subordinates?  Doesn't that go well beyond anything3   Canton permits?4               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, again, the clear5   thrust of this case was a failure-to-train case.  The6   concept of monitoring and supervision was introduced by7   the defense, not by the -- by the plaintiffs.  But to8 9101112131415161718get back to Justice Kennedy's case --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you please statein simple terms to me what exactly they failed to trainthese prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do?What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally; I'masking specifically -- what is the exact training thatwas required in this situation that caused the violationin this case?            MR. COONEY:  Number one, there wasabsolutely no Brady training at all.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Forget about no Brady19   training.  What -- I think Justice Alito asked this20   question.  What specifically would the training have21   said or done that would have avoided this Brady22   violation?2324 25            MR. COONEY:  First of all, I think a broadstatement in training about the importance ofsafeguarding the rights of the accused --                           45               Alderson Reporting Company￼6 7 8 9you're intending?            MR. COONEY:  No, it isn't, Your Honor.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  So tell me.Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, that seems to2   suggest that you're claiming that if there was an3   intentional violation by the prosecutors, that that4   statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing5   something he or she knew was illegal.  Is that what            MR. COONEY:  The -- the second aspect of --of it, though, is what I said to Justice Alito, and thatis that if you have physical evidence which, if tested,would establish either the guilt or the innocence of the10111213   -- of the defendant, it needs to be produced.  Or at1415161718192021   here.22least tested.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That goes to thesufficiency --            MR. COONEY:  Right.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- whether they had apolicy to turn over or -- because it was tested, sothere was no Brady violation from the failure to test            MR. COONEY:  The Brady violation was forfailure to produce; you're right.232425   right on this?  Here -- I read on page 4 of your briefJUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't -- am I right -- am I            46Alderson Reporting Company￼13141516   question.17MR. COONEY:  We don't know that, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah, that's something --MR. COONEY:  That's the unresolved factualJUSTICE BREYER:  I see.Official - Subject to Final Review 1   that it seemed what happened -- and I might not be 2   right.  Correct me if I'm not.  What happened is a piece 3   of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the 4   prosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what 5   it said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was 6   type B.  And the person on trial has blood of type O. 7   Is that what happened? 8               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, certainly what the 9   crime lab report said was that the blood that was tested10   of the perpetrator was type B.11               JUSTICE BREYER:  And the -- and the12   prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?18192021222324   was in fact type O.  But the evidence is --25               JUSTICE BREYER:  When the did they learn                                47                    Alderson Reporting Company            MR. COONEY:  And I think that's wherecausation comes in, Your Honor, because I think thereare two possibilities.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Did it turn out at thetrial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?            MR. COONEY:  It turned out that Mr. Thompson￼Official - Subject to Final Review1 that? 2               MR. COONEY:  The evidence is unclear as to 3   whether or not the assistants knew at the time that John 4   Thompson had type O blood. 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask you what 6   -- most law offices with which I'm familiar, the 7   training is mentoring.  In other words, the young 8   attorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by 9   following them along -- around.10               Would it have been an adequate training11   program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors,12   you don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after13   a year, and you're going to follow one of the14   prosecutors around and learn from them?  Is that an151617181920212223   is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year?  We24   -- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year.25   They went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but                                48                    Alderson Reporting Companyadequate training program?            MR. COONEY:  If, in fact, the seniorprosecutors, Your Honor, have a good familiarity withthe constitutional requirements --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.MR. COONEY:  -- absolutely.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even -- even if theviolation that becomes the basis for the claim later on￼3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. COONEY:  I think --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that give riseto a claim of the sort you're bringing here?            MR. COONEY:  I think the failure here -- andI think we have to come back to the deliberateindifference piece because what would happen there inthat instance, Your Honor, even if the training was notprovided, I think as experience has shown under Canton,that claim would fail for failure to show the deliberateindifference of the policymaker.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Cooney, when you -- whenyou gave the specific instruction that you think shouldbe provided to assistant district attorneys, what youstated was a questionable understanding of Brady, IOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn2   about this type of question.  And --10111213141516171819   think.  You -- did I understand you correctly?202122232425            You said that Brady means that if theprosecutor has physical evidence which, if tested, mightestablish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatoryevidence that must be turned over.            MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, that certainly hasbeen the position taken by the district attorney's                           49               Alderson Reporting Company            But here you had substantial evidence aboutMr. Connick's indifference.￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   office in this case -- 2               JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that consistent with 3   Arizona v. Youngblood? 4               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I believe it -- it 5   is consistent with Brady that if -- if one has a piece 6   of evidence that can conclusively establish that the 7   defendant is innocent, that it can't be the law that the 8   prosecutor can just put it in his hip pocket, not get it 9   tested, and not turn it over to the defense, and not10   worry about whether they're prosecuting an innocent man.11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, you see, it was12   tested.  And it was made available to the defense.13   Turning over -- using the word "turning over" is14   ridiculous, because they're not going to physically give15   it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he16   wants.  They're going to give it to a lab that will17181920   defense attorney anything.  They had to make it21   available for testing.  He never asked for testing.22   They did the lab reports.  So now we come down to the23   only failure is in the turning over of this report.24   Correct?25               MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor.  First of all,                                50                    Alderson Reporting Companyestablish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera.            So it was made available.  He went to lookat it, but the looking at it wouldn't have told the￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   there is -- there is a stipulation, stipulation L at2   J.A.  14:  Prior to the armed robbery trial, Mr.3   Thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the4   existence of the blood evidence, that the evidence had5   been tested, that a blood type was determined6   definitively --7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, what did I just8   say?  The failure to turn over the report, correct?9 10 11            MR. COONEY:  But -- but -- yes, Your Honor.But what also is present here is the defense never hadthe chance to -- never saw the physical blood evidence12 itself.13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Never knew it existed?14               MR. COONEY:  Never knew it existed, Your15 Honor.16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's --17               MR. COONEY:  There is testimony,18   clear testimony to that effect.  If you look at Mr.19   Williams's testimony in this case, there is a section of20   the cross-examination where John Thompson's defense21   counsel at the original criminal trial said just that.22   He didn't know it existed.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it isn't -- it isn't24   clear from what -- according to what you said earlier,25   it isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from                                51                    Alderson Reporting Company￼               Official - Subject to Final Review1   the defense.  It might have just been -- you said it wassent to the lab when -- when he came to look for it.            MR. COONEY:  But --2345   have gone into that detail?  Don't send something to the6 7 8 9lab when defense counsel is coming over to look for it.I mean, you know, that -- that's pretty detailed.JUSTICE SCALIA:  So would training have --            MR. COONEY:  Yes, Justice Scalia, but herethere's a stipulation that the crime lab report with theconclusive evidence about the perpetrator's bloodtype was never --10111213141516171819   accident, right?  And the training would -- would20   probably not have remedied that -- that difficulty.21               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, four prosecutors --22   it is clear that four prosecutors knew about theJUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay, but -- but that --MR. COONEY:  -- ever provided.JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the lab report.That -- that's what Justice --            MR. COONEY:  And the physical evidence wasnever seen, Your Honor, by defense counsel.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  For all we know, by23   existence of blood evidence for months, and it was never24   produced to the defense.  And that blood evidence would25   have conclusively established John Thompson's innocence.                                52                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The defense was told to2   come over and look for it -- to look at it.  And when hecame over to look at it -- for all we know, byaccident -- it was -- it had been sent to the lab.3456   was not come over and see the blood evidence.  It was --7   there was a broad request for -- for --8JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I understand, but --MR. COONEY:  But -- but Your Honor, the "it" 9   yes.  Okay.10               MR. COONEY:  -- physical evidence at the11   crime scene, including things that had nothing to do12   with the blood.  So there's nothing that the defense13   lawyer would have known by going to the evidence room to14   say:  I know there is nothing here.15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But isn't that --16   isn't that best practice?  In other words, I thought17   that was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does18   is say look at everything we've got.  And as my brother19   has suggested, what is important may not be there for20   either deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.21               MR. COONEY:  But the point here, Your22   Honor -- and I think this goes to the causation point,23   that -- that it would appear -- it would appear from24   looking at Mr. Williams's testimony that there was a25   deliberate effort to stay away from blood evidence in                                53                    Alderson Reporting Company￼               Official - Subject to Final Review1   the carjacking case.  And Mr. Williams conceded that. 2 3 4 5 6 7   case.  If it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an 8   intentional violation of Brady, there is no training 9   that was going to stop him from doing that.10               MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor, I think there11   is a difference between a tactical choice to do12   something sharp, on the one hand, and a knowing Brady13   violation, on the other hand.14               And the jury could clearly conclude --15   particularly because the 30(b)(6) witness in this office16   testified that, in his view, it wasn't Brady material17   unless the -- unless the prosecutors knew John18   Thompson's blood type -- the jury could clearly conclude19   that what happened here was these four prosecutors20   didn't understand and never got a clear message about --21   about what Brady required, and they -- they did not22   produce this evidence.23               There is nothing that clearly showed that24   they committed knowing Brady violations in this case.25               JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Cooney, I'm still                                54                    Alderson Reporting CompanySo this idea that this was an innocent error on the partof the prosecutors does not find support in the record.The question is --JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if it was willful --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that dooms your￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   confused as to sort of how much is enough by way of 2   training and how you would ask a court or a jury to 3   decide that. 4               You suggested to the Chief Justice formal 5   training wasn't -- isn't necessary if there's some 6   supervision, if there's some mentoring.  But, you know, 7   this seems to give cities no sense of what they have to 8   do.  No safe harbors.  Is that your position? 9               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think that Canton10   articulates a very flexible test.  And I don't think11   Canton says there is one size that fits all.  And I12   think the protection that district attorney's offices13   get from Canton is from the standard of deliberate14   indifference.15               And if one looks at the 21 years of16   experience under Canton, there have been between 6 and 817   cases against prosecutors' offices under this kind of18   theory, in total, where there was some payout from the19   prosecutors' offices to the defense.  Total.  In the 2120   years.21               So -- and the Court said -- this Court said22   in Canton, judge and jury doing their job are adequate23   to the test.  I think we have been spending a lot of24   time focusing on how much training.  The fact is, this25   is a no-training case, where evidence that the -- that                                55                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   the defendants now concede should have been produced 2   wasn't produced, and four people knew about it and 3   failed to produce it. 4               In addition, there were multiple additional 5   pieces of Brady material in the murder case that weren't 6   produced.  And this -- 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would this have been 8   -- would this be a no-training case if the rule was you 9   have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair10   prosecutor before we let you have a case, and, in fact,11   you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a12   capital case?  That's all it says.  Is that sufficient13   training?14               MR. COONEY:  I think, again, you would have15   to look at the circumstances of the office.  I think16   with this -- this presumption against disclosure that17   was present in Connick's office, that takes this case18   out of the realm of the typical prosecutor's case,19   because it is a bare minimum disclosure rule.20               I think there needs to be -- if you're going21   to have that bare minimum disclosure rule, there needs22   to be something to counterbalance it.  If you look at23   what the assistants testified to in this case, they all24   knew what not to produce.  What they didn't know was25   what to produce.                                56                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what do you do with 2   the Dubelier testimony?  Didn't he testify that it was 3   standard operating procedure to turn over all lab 4   reports? 5               MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think there are 6   two very quick answers to that.  If one looks at J.A. 7   550 to 551, which was Mr. Glas, the grand jury 8   prosecutor's, testimony. 9               What he clearly said was, during the grand10   jury, when Mr. Connick decided to terminate the grand11   jury, Mr. Connick and his first assistant were actually12   arguing with Glas that if the prosecutors didn't know13   John Thompson's blood type, they didn't need to turn14   over the blood report.15               So that's number one.  I think there is an16   issue of fact that has to be resolved in our favor17   solely from J.A. 550 and 551.18               And the second is, Your Honor, the -- the19   rule, the bare minimum discovery rule.  Louisiana law20   did not require the production of crime lab reports in21   1985.22 23 24 25  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.  Mr. Duncan, have you 3 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                 57     Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. DUNCAN:  Justice Alito and Justice 2   Kagan, you asked repeatedly questions designed to elicit 3   a response from my colleague:  What would you tell a 4   ADAs with respect to training -- and I believe Justice 5   Sotomayor as well -- that would have prevented such a 6   thing?  And I didn't hear a clear answer. 7               The legal issue in this case turns on the 8   fact that, in the deadly force scenario that Canton 9   marks out as the paradigm single-incident case, it is10   very clear what a police office needs to tell a police11   officer.  Here's the deadly force standard under12   Tennessee v. Garner:  Don't shoot people unless there's13   a reasonable probability of physical danger to yourself14   or to others.  You've got to tell them that.15               With respect to the Brady scenario, it's not16   clear at all.  Yes, of course, training is useful.  Yes,17   of course, training is important.  But how do you18   connect up a lack of specific training with a particular19   violation that occurs?20               And having heard the argument, I'm -- I'm no21   longer clear as to what the theory of the case of my22   colleague's is about what caused the violation.23   Whatever caused the violation, I haven't heard about a24   specific training measure that would have actually25   prevented what happened in this case.                                58                    Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you train2   your new hires?  First day, somebody right out of law3   school shows up and says, I want to be an assistant4   district attorney.  How do you train them?5678   did.  Brady was important.  One witness said --9   McElroy -- from the moment you walked in the door, you            MR. COONEY:  I think the first thing you dois you have a hiring process that emphasizes theimportant of -- the importance of Brady, as this office10   had to write an essay on Brady.  Brady was emphasized as11   being very important.  And then --12               JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Duncan, that I think you13   can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury14   found.1516171819202122232425            MR. DUNCAN:  I -- I don't think -- the jurycouldn't have found that that didn't occur, Your Honor.The jury found that that was inadequate.            JUSTICE KAGAN:  The jury found that therewas inadequate training.            MR. DUNCAN:  Correct, Your Honor.            JUSTICE KAGAN:  In fact, the jury found -- Ithink, if you look at the record -- the jury could havefound, a reasonable jury could have found, that therewas no training here.            MR. DUNCAN:  A reasonable jury could have                           59               Alderson Reporting Company￼15161718192021   not.2223 24 25            MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  Absolutely            JUSTICE BREYER:  We don't?            MR. DUNCAN:  No, you do not.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because they found that thefailure to adequately train amounted to deliberate                           60               Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   found -- well, Your Honor, we don't contest the finding 2   of inadequate training.  What we contest is the 3   ingredients that lead -- that can lead to a deliberate 4   indifference finding on the basis of inadequate5 training. 6               And what we say is that this case, that is a 7   general case about you failed to train on Brady, it 8   doesn't fit within the single-incident hypothetical. 9   And what I was trying to get at with -- with response to10   your questions and Justice Alito's question was that, if11   you can't say with any specificity, well, what training12   do you give?13               You asked repeatedly, Your Honor, how much14   training is enough?  So is an hour a year?  I thought Iheard my colleague say that an hour a year may make thisnot a no-training case, and so what you have there is apattern --            JUSTICE BREYER:  So we have to overturn thejury finding?￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   indifference to the fact that inaction would obviously2   result in a constitutional violation.  That's what they3   found.4               Now, how can we -- assuming that's true and5   accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there6   was something unlawful?  Because you're arguing --7   you're all arguing about whether the training program8   really was adequate or not.
