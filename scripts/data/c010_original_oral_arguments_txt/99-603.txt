Velazquez, and United States v. Velazquez.          Mr. Levine.          MR. LEVINE:  Levine, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Levine.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN LEVINEON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER LEGAL SERVICE CORPORATION          MR. LEVINE:  May it please the Court, Mr. Chief          This is a case concerning Congress' power to101112    Justice:1314 allocate dollars in the federally subsidized Legal15 Services program for the categories of civil16 representation that Congress has chosen to furnish. Under17 the Rust v. Sullivan line of cases, it is Congress itself18 that has the power to decide which policies or programs it19 will promote. It is not the participants in the program,20 namely the Legal Services lawyers, the grantees, or even21    the clients, that have that power.22              Here -- here, the Government is acting to23 promote its policy of providing free legal services for24 certain categories or types of civil representation, and25 it is the lawyers who are delivering those services. What31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Congress did not do was create a Legal Services program to promote diverse private expression by Legal Services lawyers around the country.In 1996, in response to criticism in Congress that the Legal Services lawyers had veered off-course from the program's original purpose by participating in politicized and expensive litigations, a compromise appropriations bill was enacted to limit the scope of the kinds of civil representations that would be funded. Specifically, Congress decided not to finance any longer, litigation to amend or otherwise challenge the Federal or State welfare reform system.QUESTION: Mr. Levine, does the statute at issue here in your view prohibit a Legal Aid attorney representing an individual client from making a constitutional challenge to the application of a particular welfare law?          MR. LEVINE:  Yes.QUESTION: There seems to be some dispute about whether it does that, but you think that's clear?          MR. LEVINE:  Yes.QUESTION: And if so I presume that it disables him from undertaking representation in that case.          MR. LEVINE:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And in fact, I take it, the same41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prohibition applies if the law or regulation in question is superseded by another Federal statute, or inconsistent with the ADA, et cetera?          MR. LEVINE:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  What --          QUESTION:  May I ask a question about preciselyhow that would operate? Let's assume we had an attorney who is funded by Legal Services Corporation and is going to make just the argument that under existing law and regulation the client should receive benefits.That lawyer is joined by another lawyer who is not Legal Services-funded, and that lawyer in the same case, without using any Legal Service funds, urges, and beyond that, the existing law, if it works to deny my client benefits, it's unconstitutional.In other words, I understand your answer so far, that the Legal Services Corporation lawyer cannot present arguments about existing law. Can that lawyer, sticking to what Congress says it will pay for, present that part of the lawsuit while another lawyer not funded by Legal Services argues questions of the consistency of the regulation, of the statute, questions of the compatibility of the statute with the Constitution?          MR. LEVINE:  I would say no, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And what is it in the 504(a)(16) that51 makes it clear that not only can the Legal Services lawyer2 herself engage in such representation, but cannot team up3    with a lawyer who is not under that disability?4 MR. LEVINE: Your Honor, your hypothetical would5 have been that counsel would be co-counsel in one case on6 behalf of an individual seeking to obtain benefits under7    existing law and seeking to challenge --89 time. 1011 1213 statute on its face is clear, that a lawyer could not14 participate in a case in which there was a challenge to an15 existing Federal or State welfare reform statute.16 The -- Congress made a determination that it did17 not want to participate in funding Legal Services for18 efforts to challenge existing welfare reform statutes, and19 in the program integrity guidelines that are set up, that20 have been established pursuant to the statute to assure21 the independence of an affiliate organization of a Legal22 Services program, it is stressed in those regulations that23 it's very important that the Legal Services offices funded24 by Federal Legal Services be separate and distinct from25    the other, and it seems to me --6QUESTION: Making arguments lawyers make all theMR. LEVINE:  In the alternative.QUESTION:  Yes.MR. LEVINE:  And the position of -- I think the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Okay, I understand the --MR. LEVINE: -- and it seems to me that the hypothetical that you're suggesting where two lawyers essentially are co-counsel for one client, that the arguments in the alternative offends that statute --QUESTION: Yes, okay, I think you've been very clear on that. You're saying the Legal Services attorney cannot, in any way, shape, or manner, participate in a lawsuit where anybody makes such a claim. It's not just a limitation on use of the funds of Legal Services Corporation, but of the funds -- he just can't101112    participate.13              MR. LEVINE:  That's correct.14              QUESTION:  The other thing I would like just to15 make clear on what is the factual background, or what are16    the limits of this 504(a)(16).  Could a Legal17 Service-funded lawyer make the argument, court, you must18 read the regulation and statute this way, because if you19 don't, the regulation will be under a statutory cloud, or20 the statute would be under a constitutional crowd --21 cloud. In other words, to urge interpretation of the22 governing statute or regulation to avoid what the Legal23 Services Corporation lawyer tells the court would be a24    serious constitutional question?25 MR. LEVINE: Well, it seems to me at the1 beginning of the representation of an individual seeking 2    to obtain benefits under existing law, a Legal3 Services-funded lawyer makes a determination whether he4 can proceed in the category of case to just seek benefits5 under the existing law, or whether the arguments that6 would be made on behalf of his client would be in some 7    prohibited area, and if it's going to be in some 8    prohibited area -- 9              QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- the question I'm asking10 is, is it a prohibited area to say, the reason why I'm11 urging this reading of the existing law is, it would be12 under a constitutional cloud if you read it any other way?13 MR. LEVINE: Well, Your Honor, it seems to me14 that the arguments that a Legal Services lawyer makes to15 the court on behalf of his client are the permitted16 arguments under the statute. I don't think a lawyer,17 unless questioned by the court, ought to be raising with18 the court a hypothetical argument that would be --19              QUESTION:  Not a hypothetical -- not a20 hypothetical argument. Very often, lawyers urge, and this21 Court, and other Federal courts will say they're going to22    read the statute a certain way to avoid a serious23 constitutional question. Nothing abstract about it.24 Brandeis has said it, it's been said many times since,25    that you read statutes, if possible, to avoid a81 constitutional question. So I'm asking, is that such an2 argument within the ball park for Legal Services 3    Corporation?4 MR. LEVINE: It seems to me, Your Honor, in a5 colloquy with the court with respect to a particular claim6 for benefits under existing law, if a Legal Services7 lawyer is asked questions that get into, if you will -- 8              QUESTION:  Nothing so shy, just up front in the9 briefs --10              MR. LEVINE:  Up front, that said -- the lawyer11 ought to be saying to that court, if Your Honor wants to12 pursue that line of inquiry, I can answer it here today --13 QUESTION: It's not a question -- it's not a14 question by the judge. The lawyer wants to put forward a15 principle of statutory construction, which is that you16 avoid interpreting the statute a certain way if it would17 lead to a serious constitutional issue, and we think it18    would, says the lawyer.  Is that prohibited?19 MR. LEVINE: It seems to me, Your Honor, that20 the lawyer can't participate in litigation which is21    seeking to amend or alter the --22              QUESTION:  We know that.23              MR. LEVINE:  -- statute.24              QUESTION:  We know that.25              MR. LEVINE:  And so --9 1 2 3 4 5 6    question.7 MR. LEVINE: It seems to me in explaining the8 argument, you can make the argument that I am making this9 argument under existing law so that the court doesn't have10 to reach another argument that I would not be permitted to11 make.1213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Mr. Levine, how could you possibly represent a client adequately if you believe there is a serious constitutional question if the statute is interpreted a certain way, and you make that argument to the court, but then you don't take the next step, which I have never seen avoided, moreover, if you do interpret it this way, it's unconstitutional?          I mean, if he's going to make that argument hehas to stay out of the case, doesn't he?          MR. LEVINE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Okay.  That's the answer.          QUESTION:  Then, here's the problem I have.When you say that, or when the policy says that the lawyer can bring the case when it amounts to a claim under10          QUESTION:  This is a matter of statutoryconstruction --MR. LEVINE:  The argument --QUESTION: -- of statutory construction, that you interpret it so as to avoid a serious constitutional1 existing law, I assumed that that meant law properly2 interpreted, but now you seem to be saying in response to 3    Justice Scalia that if the only way one can reach in4 effect a proper interpretation of law is to look at the5 constitutional problem that would result if you see it any6 other way than favorably to my client, the lawyer can't 7    make that argument -- 8              MR. LEVINE:  Well -- 9              QUESTION:  -- because the lawyer can't go to the10    point that Justice Scalia just mentioned.11              MR. LEVINE:  It's --12              QUESTION:  And it therefore seems to me that13 your position is boiling down to saying that existing law14 means whatever the law is, or only the law, as admitted or15    stipulated to by the Government.16              MR. LEVINE:  Well, there are --17 QUESTION: Because the Government is saying,18 well, we're denying benefits under existing law, and19 you're saying, if existing law can only be properly20 understood in relation to the constitutional risks, you21 can't understand existing law in that way, which virtually22 limits the right of the Government lawyer even more than I23    thought he was going to do.24              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, the statute permits a25 Legal Services lawyer to assist a low income person obtain111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425benefits under existing law, and existing law under those circumstances would be what the State welfare reform statute and the regulations provide, and --QUESTION: But we don't know what -- there's a question about what it does provide, and the argument on avoiding constitutional difficulty is an argument about what the law is, what the law should be understood to be, and that argument, based on your answer to Justice Scalia, is an argument that the lawyer apparently cannot make.MR. LEVINE: That lawyer cannot make that argument, and he shouldn't take the case in the first place. The bulk of --QUESTION: So that client has to accept the interpretation of the local welfare office as the law.          MR. LEVINE:  Oh, no.  No, no.  That client wouldgo and get another lawyer with the assistance --          QUESTION:  -- unless he gets outside counsel --MR. LEVINE: -- with the assistance of the Legal Services lawyer. If the Legal Services lawyer here makes a determination that the case that ought to be brought is one that would involve the issues that Justice Scalia has said then the lawyer would say, my -- I can't --          QUESTION:  Oh, I understand that, but all I'msaying is --          MR. LEVINE:  -- over --                            12123456789    discrimination?QUESTION: -- if I understand your position, then there is a category of arguments about what the law is, what the law should be understood to be, that the Legal Services lawyer cannot make.MR. LEVINE:  That's correct.QUESTION:  Yes.MR. LEVINE:  The over -- well over --QUESTION:  Is that some kind of viewpoint10              MR. LEVINE:  No.  I mean, it's simply, Congress11 is deciding to fund certain categories of welfare benefit12    cases, and not other categories of cases.13 QUESTION: What about a Legal Services lawyer14 under this statute making an argument that a regulation15 issued by the agency is invalid under the statute?16 MR. LEVINE: That would not be permitted either.17 That would be in the category of cases where Congress --18 where Congress has decided that it will not permit19 challenges to Federal or State welfare reform systems, and20 the purpose, the purpose for this really makes sense.21 At the same time that these funding -- that this22 appropriations bill was enacted in 1996, Congress was23 enacting the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity24 statute, and in that statute Congress basically moved25 responsibility for welfare reform from the Federal 131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Government to the State governments and invited the State governments to develop the State welfare reform programs different than had been done previously.And at the same time, in the same Congress, Congress said that at the same time that we are providing this responsibility to the States, we are simply not going to pay Federal Legal Services lawyers to get involved in the litigation involving the mosaic and interplay of the Federal and State welfare reform systems, and it made perfect sense.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Levine.          Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER           ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATESMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:As this Court made clear in West v. Sullivan, the Government -- when the Government appropriates funds to establish a Government program it is entitled, within quite broad limits, to define the scope of that program.          QUESTION:  Are there limits?          MR. KNEEDLER:  There are limits, and theprincipal --          QUESTION:  And what are they?          MR. KNEEDLER:  The only situation in which this141 Court has struck down a Government funding restriction on2 viewpoint grounds was in the Rosenberger case, and in that3 case, what the Court held is, there the university had4 made funds available to encourage a broad diversity of5 private expression and had created what this Court there6 termed a public forum and reiterated in the NEA case7 that -- 8              QUESTION:  Well, in Rosenberger I do think that9 the Government wasn't paying for the speaker, and here10    it's paying for the speaker.11 On the other hand, it seems to me unlike Rust,12 in that the speech, the message, the communication that's13 prohibited doesn't contradict the Government's purpose if14 wesay--andIdon'tknowifwecansay,butifwewere15 to say that this was an unlimited forum of some kind, then16    we have to ask whether or not this restriction is17 reasonable, and I just don't see how it's reasonable for18 the Government to restrict the presentation ofacaseon19    important legal issues to the third branch.20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, Congress did not establish21 the Legal Services Corporation and the program under it as22 a public forum. For purposes of forum analysis the23 question is whether the Legal Services Corporation is a24 forum. That is the program, because that was the program25    in the Rosenberger case.15 1              It was the precise expression or activity that2 was funded by, in that case, the university's activities,3 and it -- what Congress did in the Legal Services Act was4 to provide for the furnishing of a particular professional5 service, just like in Rust, the particular professional6 service that is not the full expression of ideas of the7 sort that has been covered by this Court's free speech8 cases, it is a professional service in which there are9 submissions made to a body, either administrative or10 judicial body, under structural, procedural and11    substantive --12              QUESTION:  It does carry down to free speech.13    It's a petition to the Government.14 MR. KNEEDLER: It is, but as this Court said in15 the Walters case and the Yorkline case, the First16 Amendment really doesn't add anything to what has been the17 traditional source of constitutional guidance in that18    area, which has been the Due Process Clause.19              QUESTION:  Well, but it does add something,20 because given the fact, as Justice Kennedy has just21 pointed out, given the limitations that this kind of forum22 involve restrictions on relevance and so on, there still23 is a speech, a central speech element in what's going on24 here, and there is a general principle, I think, that when25 the Government takes action to disfavor speech simply161 because it disagrees with the Government, you're getting2 just about to the molten core of the First Amendment.3 And it would seem to me that because that's what4 the policy does here, there would be a good reason for us5 to say, we should not characterize this as simply the6 Government paying for services. We ought to characterize7 it as a speech case, because there's something very risky8 going on when the Government's policy in effect says, you9 can't make an argument that disagrees with the Government.10              MR. KNEEDLER:  With all respect --11              QUESTION:  So that's what I think is extra here.12 that's why I think this is not merely a due process case.MR. KNEEDLER:  But there are many situations insystem in which Congress has enacted laws thatlitigant over another, one sort of claim over1314 our legal15 favor one16    another, the furnishing --17 QUESTION: This isn't merely favoring. This is18 saying, in effect, you may not make the argument that the19    Government is constitutionally wrong.20              MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I think what Congress did21 here was say that a lawyer may not take on that case to22    begin with.  In other words --23              QUESTION:  Well, yeah.  Then the result of that24 is that the lawyer may take on the case insofar as it does25 not involve a constitutional challenge, but insofar as it171 involves or could reasonably involve a challenge to the2 law as being a constitutional mistake, then the lawyer3 cannot take on the case, which is another way of saying4 the lawyer cannot, with the incentive of the Government 5    money, say that, or State money, say that. 6              MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, any speech that would7 happen in a courtroom first of all is not the lawyer's own8 self-expression. The lawyer is advancing arguments on9 behalf of a client, and not as a public forum with a free10 debate. The lawyer is making arguments that have legal11    consequences.12              QUESTION:  Is the Government the client?13 MR. KNEEDLER: The Government is not the client,14 but what the Government is, is, it is the Government that15 established the program and, as this Court held in Rust,16 that when the Government establishes a program, it is17 entitled to encourage certain activities and not others,18 and --19              QUESTION:  Well, but we said in Forbes, the20 public television case, that when the Government21 established its forum you have to give certain discretion22 to the immediate speaker to preserve the integrity of the23 message. In that case, the integrity of the message was24 preserved by excluding certain views. Here, the necessity25 is the argument, the argument is that the necessity is to181 add certain speech to preserve the integrity of the 2    message for the forum that's been created. 3              MR. KNEEDLER:  In Forbes it is possible to think4 of what was going on there as a debate, and classically a5 debate among candidates about political issues. We have6 never thought in our legal system of a courtroom or7 lawyers as engaging in a public policy or political 8    debate.  They are -- 9              QUESTION:  Well, the terms of the debate by the10 lawyer may not be political, but the lawyer's raising of11 constitutional issues is normally a direct response to12 what, in fact, is the result of a political debate. So13 you can't exclude, in effect, the significance of politics14    from constitutional challenge.15              MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but once the matter has been16 reduced out of the lobbying or the political sphere into17 the litigation sphere, we have a set of procedural and18 substantive rules that have legal consequences. When a19 complaint is filed in court, the other party must respond20    and the court will enter a judgment.21              QUESTION:  Well, that's right, but if I may just22 cut you short a little bit on that, those rules allow for23 challenges to what are political determinations by the24 Congress. They allow challenges to political results.25 MR. KNEEDLER: If I could just go back to the 191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Rust case, what the Court said there, and it is very similar, because it had to do with the furnishing of particular services, and particular types of expression were not permitted under that program.QUESTION: But it was Government expression.MR. KNEEDLER: No, it was -- I -- it was not -- QUESTION: The doctors, I thought, were hired togive the Government's message, and only that message, to the people that they counseled.MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think that's a fair characterization of the program in Rust, and in fact the respondents in this case concede that the Government was not the speaker. What the Government was doing was paying for counselors to exercise their professional judgment in their interactions with clients.That did not lead to a one-directional urging for every person who walked in the door to have family planning. It was counseling to help the client come to her own conclusion as to what the result was. It was professional services, professional judgments just like this one is, and what the Court said --          QUESTION:  May I ask --MR. KNEEDLER: -- some types of services are outside the scope of the program, and that's exactly what Congress said here.20 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you a2 question about -- and you keep bringing up Rust, and it3 seems to me that whatever else is wrong with this, it4 fails the line that runs from Speiser v. Randolph. That 5    is, what you're saying is not only can't you use the6 Government's money to speak the speech, but you can't use7 your private money to do it, and I thought in all those8 cases, the lobbying cases, sure, we don't have to pay for9 your lobbying, but we can't stop you from doing it with10    your own money.11              MR. KNEEDLER:  If I could make two responses to12 that. First of all, in Rust itself, the Court recognized13 that the matching funds that were required under Title X14 were also subject to the restrictions, and that's in15    footnote 5 of the Rust decision.16              But beyond that, what the Legal Services17 Corporation provided for here is exactly what was provided18 for in Rust, which was allowing the recipient to set up a19 separate entity to engage in the activities that could not20    be engaged in by the recipient itself.21 The LSC regulations were patterned directly22    after the regulations in Rust, and --23 QUESTION: And so the same lawyer could present24 this -- the argument without any inhibition, using the25    counterpart organization.211 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- it would -- the matter 2 would have to be presented by the counterpart3 organization.4 Now, if the -- if the lawyer involved was a5 part-time lawyer with the Legal Services-funded recipient,6 and worked separately for the other entity, and there was7 the requisite separation of functions, yes, that lawyer8 could present the arguments, assuming that the separation 9    requirements were met in the other program.10 But that -- what the Legal Services Corporation11 did here is consistent with the Regan decision, with12 League of Women Voters, and most significantly with Rust,13 in providing for that private expression. But of course,14 that's to allow for the recipient's private expression,15    the association's private expression.16              Here, I think it's also important to bear in17 mind that the vast majority of the funds, non-LSC funds18 that are received, are also public funds, the IOLTA funds,19 the State funds, so we're not talking about an entity that20    has a large amount of private funds of the sort21    private association would have.22              QUESTION:  Well, this would be tagged23    State funds, this restriction, as well as --24              MR. KNEEDLER:  This fund does -- this25    restriction does apply to State funds.22a typicalonto, say, 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, let me -- would you2 just clear up one factual thing for me? If, after a3 lawyer's been working on a case for a month or two, he4 finds out there's an argument of this kind in the picture, 5    must he withdraw? 6              MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  The statute does it.  I7 would like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may. 8              QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kneedler.  Mr. 9    Neuborne, we'll hear from you.10                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURT NEUBORNE11                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS12              MR. NEUBORNE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it13    please the Court:14 The principal legal issue before the Court this15 morning is narrow and precisely tailored. May Congress16 choose to provide Federal subsidies to a broad array of17 private lawyers in order to commit them to represent poor18 clients in litigation in a particular area of the law, in19 this case welfare law, but forbid the subsidized lawyers20 from using the Federal funds to raise any argument in21 court which seeks to challenge or amend existing law, for22 the extraordinary sweep that the Legal Services23 Corporation has conceded that those words are to be given.24              In short, may Congress condition a subsidy to a25 lawyer for the poor on an explicit requirement that the231 subsidized lawyer argue only in favor of enforcing the2 legal status quo as that is defined by the last regulation3 to be issued down the legal chain, and not challenging in4 any way, by raising its constitutionality, its5 insufficiency to follow statutes, or its inappropriate 6    construction and creation -- yes, sir.7 QUESTION: You can put it that way, but you can 8    just as readily put it, may the Government fund9 representation in cases that raise certain issues and not10 fund representation in cases that involve other issues.11 It's not a matter of muzzling someone who's taking on a12 case. It's a matter of the Government saying, this is the13 category of cases where we pay for representation. This14 is another category of cases where we don't pay for15 representation. We're not muzzling anybody.16              MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes, sir.  We have no quarrel17 with the general principle that the Government has broad18 power to determine the kinds and categories of cases that19    it wishes to fund.20 QUESTION: What's wrong with a category of case21 that involves welfare recipients, but does not involve a22 challenge to the constitutionality of the welfare law, or23 the validity of regulations enacted under the welfare law?24    What is wrong with that as a category?25              MR. NEUBORNE:  What's wrong with it, Justice241 Scalia, is that it is overtly too broadbased. When the2 Government simply merges its idea of category into the3 notion of whether or not the Government -- a lawyer for4 the poor is to be permitted to raise an argument that5 challenges the Government's own viewpoint about what the6 law should be, the Government has simply taken and7 broadened a power of categorization but used it to permit8 the argument of one side of this question and not the 9    argument of another.10              QUESTION:  It doesn't favor one side or the11 other. It just denies representation in certain12 categories. It seems to me any category of case is13 viewpoint-based. It's hard to imagine picking out a14 category of case that doesn't simply eliminate other15 categories that have a particular viewpoint.16              MR. NEUBORNE:  With respect, this is a unique17 restriction. This is the only restriction that I've18 ever -- or that I believe exists, in which the Government19 has said that you can represent someone in court, in a20 particular subject matter area, but you cannot challenge21    the existing legal status quo.22              QUESTION:  But it hasn't said that.  It has23 said, you can represent someone in court so long as it is24 a case that does not involve a challenge to this event.25              MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes, but that's simply --25 1              QUESTION:  There's a big difference.2 MR. NEUBORNE: Well, with respect, I don't think3 so, because all it does is impose an unconstitutional4 provision on the subsidy. What it says to the lawyer and5 to the client is that it will give you this money. It6 will give you this money on condition that there is to be7 no argument raised in this case that challenges the legal8 status quo. 9              QUESTION:  What if the statute said, Mr.10 Neuborne, that these Legal Service lawyers could represent11 low income clients seeking welfare benefits, but they --12 once a case went to court, they could not handle it?13              MR. NEUBORNE:  In other words, a categorical14    restriction saying no welfare cases.QUESTION: Well, at the administrative level,                MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes.                QUESTION:  -- but you --                MR. NEUBORNE:  That would be --                QUESTION:  -- we won't fund you going into                QUESTION:  What would be your answer to that?                MR. NEUBORNE:  There is -- it would depend on261516    yes --1718192021    court.22232425          MR. NEUBORNE:  That, Chief Justice, would be avery different case.  That --1 the motive with which the restriction was imposed. If the2 motive had been imposed in order to weaken the enforcement 3    to dissipate in legal rights, then it would be4 viewpoint-discriminatory then. If the motive -- 5              QUESTION:  Well, why wasn't Rust a situation6 involving some kind of viewpoint discrimination under your 7    view?  I mean, we have to deal with Rust. 8              MR. NEUBORNE:  Under the Court's decision in9 Rust, a fundamental distinction was raised, and if I could10 compare two cases that the Chief Justice wrote, I think it11    would demonstrate that.12 In TR -- in TWR, this Court held that there is13 substantial power to differentiate among speakers in14 granting subsidies as long as viewpoint-neutral criteria15 are used. In Rust, the Court went one step further. The16 Court then said, where the Government is in fact not -- is17 in fact a participant in this speech forum -- in other18 words, where the Government wishes to expound its own19 message --20 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Neuborne, Rust doesn't say21 where the Government wishes to expound its own -- Rust22 didn't say that the Government is the speaker.23 MR. NEUBORNE: Well, my understanding, Chief24 Justice, is that is the way the Court has construed25    subsequent cases.27 1              QUESTION:  Well, are you talking about the Rust2 opinion -- you say you're going to compare two cases which 3    I wrote, one of them being TWR -- 4              MR. NEUBORNE:  I'm sorry.5 QUESTION: -- and one being Rust. Did you get 6    out of the Rust opinion? 7              MR. NEUBORNE:  That'll teach me to do that. 8              (Laughter.)9 MR. NEUBORNE: The -- as I read the Rust case,10 and this is before Rosenberger put the gloss on it that11 I've attempted to present this morning, but as I12 originally read the Rust opinion, and as I believe it's13 fairly read, Rust was a case in which the Government had a14 substantive program with a particular point of view that15 it wished to have disseminated and was hiring doctors to16 disseminate that point of view and not the other point of17    view, and as long as the Government --18 QUESTION: Well, maybe here the Government has a19 welfare program and they believe in it, and they don't20    want it challenged.21              MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, but that point of view --22 yes, the only difference here is that the Government does23 have a Rust speaker in this case. The Government's Rust24 speaker in this case is the Government's lawyer. That's25 the Government program that the Government speaks through,281 through its program. What the Government is attempting to2 do here --3 QUESTION: It's not the Government's lawyer, 4    it's the client's lawyer.5 MR. NEUBORNE: No, what I meant, the Government, 6    the other lawyer in the case -- 7              QUESTION:  Oh.  Oh. 8              MR. NEUBORNE:  -- is the speaker that would fall9 within the Rust parameters. That is a situation where the10 Government has hired somebody to speak for the Government,11    to advance a Government message.12              What the Government is attempting to do here is13 to commandeer the voice of the other lawyer in the case as14 well, and this Court has already unequivocally held that a15 subsidized lawyer for the poor does not act under color of16 law precisely because the subsidized lawyer doesn't speak17 for the State, may not be permitted to even think about18 speaking for the State, because the lawyer's duty is to19    the client, and to insulate the lawyer from the20 possibility of being controlled by the State, in the --21 this Court has held unequivocally that the lawyer doesn't22    act under color of law.  Now, if --23 QUESTION: Mr. Neuborne, I want to get you to24 state your first premise, and I think it's this, but if25    I'm wrong, that's what I want to find out.2912345678    discrimination.9              MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes, sir.You've got one principle. To state it crudely, the Government can decide what to pay for and what not to pay for.MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes.QUESTION: You've got another principle that says, the Government cannot use its leverage, whether it be by subsidization or otherwise, to engage in viewpoint10 QUESTION: Is your basic principle that whenever11 a given set of facts could be characterized by either one12 or the other of those principles, that the First Amendment13 principle always prevails, that trumps the other one, that14 there always should be a choice to characterize the issue15 as a speech issue, not as a mere subsidization issue?16              MR. NEUBORNE:  I'm not sure I understand what --17 your question, but I'll try to answer it. My principle is18 this --19 QUESTION: He's asking you if Rust has to be20    overruled to decide this case.21              (Laughter.)22              MR. NEUBORNE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.23              QUESTION:  Why don't you answer my question?24              (Laughter.)25 MR. NEUBORNE: I used to have a fantasy saying I30 1    was going 2    question. 3 45 in order?6 the activity itself that the Government is funding is so7 permeated with First Amendment overtones, as this Court8 has noted.9 I mean, speech in court on behalf of a poor10 client can be a petition to redress grievances. It is a11 forum of ideas. Of course it's not a public forum, but12 it's a specialized forum in which the clash of ideas is13 crucially important, and in which the Government may never14 be permitted to put its thumb on the scales of those ideas15 in an effort to use law to control viewpoint, and theto put one of you on hold while I answered this(Laughter.)MR. NEUBORNE:  The question -- may I answer themJustice Souter's question I think applies where16 viewpoint here is the viewpoint of legality.17              As Justice Kennedy pointed out in the18 Rosenberger opinion, when you exclude an entire19 perspective from the forum you have skewed that forum20    forever.2122 creation23 question24 forum in25    creating a forum.  It really isn't at all. QUESTION:  But Rosenberger was a definiteby the Government of a forum, and I reallyyour analogizing the -- what many people call acourt, as the same thing as the Government31 1              MR. NEUBORNE:  It's not necessarily the same2 thing. The forum in Rosenberger, of course, was the3 creation of a limited public forum for widespread speech.4 The forum that we have here is the creation of a5 funding scheme designed to enhance and permit speech6 within a court. Now, that's not the same thing as a 7    public forum.  Nobody can walk in off the street --8 QUESTION: So you would concede that it's lawful9 to prevent the attorney, using Government funds, from10 engaging in lobbying activities, or writing a Senator11 saying please change this law to make it more clear?12 MR. NEUBORNE: Well, unless one could identify a13 forum in which that would take place. I don't concede14 that that's unconstitutional -- that that's necessarily15 constitutional, because if it was done with the intention16 of making it difficult to provide a particular point of17 view to the Government, it would raise problems. But for18 the purposes of the argument this morning, we do have the19 most discrete forum that you can think of. It is a20 forum --21              QUESTION:  My next question was going to be, we22 then have to identify something that looks like a forum23    and that we can call a limited forum.24              MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, or, as you wrote in25 Arkansas Public Television, a private forum, because in321 Arkansas Public Television, which I believe is the most2 relevant precedent, in Arkansas Public Television, the3 Court was confronted with a forum that itself had4 constitutional protection, where the participants in that5 forum, the public journalists, were themselves entitled to 6    a degree of First Amendment protection.7 And I think what this Court, as I read Arkansas8 Public Television, what this Court held is that when the9 journalists are essentially exercising their own editorial10 discretion, when they're speaking for themselves, then11 they're essentially Rust participants, and they're12 entitled to say what they would, to engage in all sorts of13 viewpoint determination, and no one has the right, simply14 because public funds are being used, to claim that there15    is a command that other types of speech have been16    determined.17 QUESTION: I confess to being really confused by18 this forum discussion. I don't see the creation of any19 forum here. It seems to me the forums involved are20 courtrooms that are deciding particular cases. There is21 not one single forum; there are courtrooms deciding22 particular cases. And it seems to me the Government has23 said, you can go into this forum and you can't go into the24    other forum.25              MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes, but it --331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: It's not a matter of discriminating between speakers in some single forum that the Government has invented.MR. NEUBORNE: With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think the Government has said -- is saying you can go into this forum and not that forum based on an effort to insulate its complaint from challenge.It is the fact that these are viewpoint-discriminatory criteria that the Government is using to condition access to the forum.QUESTION: Perhaps so, but not conditionally access to a single forum. They're saying you can go into some forums, and you can't go into some other forums.MR. NEUBORNE: Well, you can go into a courtroom as long as you argue in favor of the Government's status quo. You cannot enter the courtroom --          QUESTION:  That's not so.          MR. NEUBORNE:  -- if you argue against theGovernment's status quo.QUESTION: That's not so. You cannot go into the courtroom if certain issues are involved. I don't care what side you're on here.          MR. NEUBORNE:  No, but --QUESTION: We're not going to fund if certain issues are involved in the case. Now, there are other341 forums where those issues aren't involved, and you can go 2    into theirs.3 Now, maybe there's something against that, but4 it seems to me it doesn't analogize to creating a single5 forum and then discriminating among speakers in some 6    single forum.7 MR. NEUBORNE: With respect, Justice Scalia, I8 don't mean to belabor the point. The forum here is a9 courtroom. The forum is one of the most traditional10 places where ideas are exchanged and where individuals11 petition for redress and speak on important issues.12 QUESTION: It's not all courtrooms. It's only13 courtrooms involving certain categories of cases.14              MR. NEUBORNE:  I know, but --15              QUESTION:  Isn't that right?16              MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes, but the --17              QUESTION:  So --18              MR. NEUBORNE:  But the statute defines those19 courtrooms. What the statute says is, you can speak20 freely in a forum in which you advance the status quo.21 You cannot speak freely in a forum in which you do not.22    Now, whether --23              QUESTION:  We do have in some States, the State24 of California I know, the rule that an administrative25 agency cannot question the constitutionality of a statute.351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. NEUBORNE: Yes, but of course that's, one, in an administrative proceeding, it is not in a judicial proceeding, and there's no effort to condition a subsidy on a willingness to either agree or not agree with the Government's status quo.QUESTION: Well, I'm saying it's not unheard of to have forums for the adjudication of legal issues where that forum itself is limited. It's of course --          MR. NEUBORNE:  Oh, yes.          QUESTION:  -- not a Federal court.          MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Well, there's also a doctrine fromthis Court that municipal corporations created by the State can't challenge State regulations.MR. NEUBORNE: Yes, and those are substantive rules of law governing power here, but here what the Government has done is taken a subsidy, a speech subsidy, a crucially important --QUESTION: Suppose that I was worried about the public forum doctrine, not knowing what happens if you start applying it in the way you want, but suppose I accepted your argument -- this is all hypothetical.MR. NEUBORNE: Yes, I mean, could I just -- QUESTION: Suppose I accepted your argument -- MR. NEUBORNE: -- it's a private forum.361              QUESTION:  Well, whatever kind of a forum.2 There's a whole speech mechanism there that you're3 suddenly transposing here, and suppose I nonetheless4 agreed with you, for hypothetical sake, that this is a5 very unreasonable thing in respect to a client who may be6 entitled to money, i.e., property owed by the Government.7 Well, why wouldn't it be unlawful under the Due Process8 Clause? 9          MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, it would.  It would beunlawful under the --10111213141516    argument?17              MR. NEUBORNE:  We don't.  We urged the Due18 Process Clause below. We would welcome a Due Process19    Clause decision from the Court.20 QUESTION: May I suggest one other strand that,21 I wondered why you didn't pick it up? One could view this22 as a classic unconstitutional condition case. That is,23 here we give you a pot of money, like we give you whatever24 the benefit was in Speiser, but if with your own money25 you're going to do what we don't want to have heard, then 37QUESTION:  All right, so --          MR. NEUBORNE:  -- Due Process Clause.  It wouldalso be unlawful under --          QUESTION:  -- if it's unlawful under the DueProcess Clause, why do we even have to get into this1 not only are we not going to fund that, but we're going to2 pull the money, and -- but you didn't explicitly argue 3    that, and I wondered why. 4              MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, I was going to answer5 Justice Breyer along those terms. There is a powerful --6 entirely apart from viewpoint discrimination, there's a7 very powerful, really two-pronged unconstitutional 8    conditions argument. 9              The first prong of the unconstitutional10 conditions argument says that what's happening here is,11 the Government's conditioning the formation of an12 attorney-client relationship, not only that, the formation13 of an attorney-client relationship of great intensity,14 because it looks forward to actual litigation in court.15 It is welfare litigation that's being funded here.16 So that the Government is funding this intense17 associational relationship, but it is imposing a condition18 in which you waive the ability to make certain arguments19    under it.  In other words, you can only have --20 QUESTION: And what constitutional provision21    does that violate?2223    --24    anyway.25MR. NEUBORNE:  Freedom of association.  It's aQUESTION:  All right, so it's a free speech caseMR. NEUBORNE:  Well, it's a First Amendment                  381 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9case, but it doesn't require Justice Breyer's concern about dealing with forum analysis. It is a First Amendment case.          The other argument that --QUESTION: Before you get off of unconstitutional conditions, it seems to me you can convert Rust and, indeed, every Government-funding case into an unconstitutional condition case if you're of such a mind.          MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, I --QUESTION: The Government decides to fund art. Well, you know, as a condition of your getting this money you have to produce art. You can't produce, you know, history or something else. Every funding you could character -- it doesn't seem to me to advance the ball a10111213141516    bit.17 MR. NEUBORNE: Well, that's a fair critique, but18 what's different here from, say, an art funding case, or19 something like that, is here you're funding an intense20 associational relationship that this Court has already21 held is entitled to protection against Government22 manipulation. It's the language, it's the dictum in Rust23    itself that said, if this were a traditional24 doctor-patient relationship, if this were a traditional25 relationship between a university teacher and a student,39 9101112131415161718192021222324251234567    dictum.8and I believe certainly a traditional relationship between a lawyer and a client, that the First Amendment guarantees a degree of autonomy to that relationship. The Governmentsimply because it's paying for the relationship -- QUESTION: Well now, Rust did not say that.MR. NEUBORNE: No, it was dictum. It was          QUESTION:  Well, it was not only dictum, but itsaid it might be a different case.          MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  It didn't say that the opposite rulewould prevail.MR. NEUBORNE: Yes, that's absolutely true, Your Honor. I'm not suggesting that Rust --          QUESTION:  I thought you were.MR. NEUBORNE: -- demands this. I was simply saying that in Rust you alluded to it in your opinion and said it might be a different case, and I'm suggesting this is that different case.QUESTION: Mr. Neuborne, I don't quite understand your answer to Justice Scalia, because I would have thought you would have said about the art is, sure, the Government doesn't have to buy a painting that it doesn't like.          It doesn't have to buy an indecent painting, but                            40cannot,1 it can say to this artist that's painting on Government2 funds, it's a lovely portrait, but with your -- in your3 own -- for your own collection, or for your other gallery4    owner, you can't do indecent art, and that's --56 certainly7 condition8 on an art9    condition here.MR NEUBORNE: No, I was certainly not -- I didn't intend to suggest that you could restrictions on the use of private money based subsidy, and that's the other unconstitutional10 1112 condition13 must disagree with the Solicitor General. It takes very14    substantial private resources.15              There are State resources, but there are also16 very substantial private resources donated to Legal17 Services offices to enable them to provide certain service18 to the poor. It takes that money, and it essentially19 says, you can't use that money to advance these arguments20 unless you set up an enormously expensive, enormously21 burdensome separate facility from which to carry out the22 entity, so that it essentially places a huge burden on the23 use of private money, and it's a burden different from24 Rust, because the burden in Rust that was justified25 because it was the Government speaking, and because it was41QUESTION:  Yes.MR. NEUBORNE:  The other unconstitutionalhere is, it takes the very substantial -- and I 1    the Government speaking -- I'm sorry, sir. 2              QUESTION:  Rust did not say it was the 3    Government speaking. 4              MR. NEUBORNE:  No, sir, but I'm trying to5 distinguish Rust. In Rust, as Justice Kennedy and as the6 Court has indicated on a number of occasions, there were7 at least three cases in which Rust has been explained as a8 Government speech case, not necessarily the Government9 itself.10 QUESTION: No. What Rosenberger said, which11 perhaps you're referring to, is that the Government used12 private speakers to transmit specific information13    pertaining to its own program.14              MR. NEUBORNE:  That's what --15 QUESTION: It didn't say that the Government was16    the speaker.17              MR. NEUBORNE:  I stand corrected.18 QUESTION: Even Rosenberger didn't say that.19              MR. NEUBORNE:  That's what I meant.  When the20 Government has a substantive message that it wishes21 conveyed, and it either uses its own employees or private22 people to do so, the Government then is essentially acting23 as a participant in the speech process and can engage in24    viewpoint discrimination.25 That is clearly not the case here. Here, no one42 1    could argue that a lawyer for the poor is somehow2 disseminating a Government-approved set of information 3    pursuant to some substantive approach.4 QUESTION: Unless you say the Government here,5 acting through Congress, wants everybody to say the 6    welfare laws are fine as written. 7              MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, and that's exactly what -- 8              QUESTION:  That's the message. 9              MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes.  That's exactly what --10              QUESTION:  And that's kind of close to Rust.11              MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, but it's also kind of close12 to Barnetti. If -- to Barnett -- that the Government13    cannot -- West Virginia v. Barnett.14 The Government simply can't compel everyone to15 say that the welfare laws are fine as written, and they16    can't use the sub -- a subsidy to breach that.17              QUESTION:  Well, Barnett was where you18 required someone to affirmatively say something they19 didn't believe. I don't see any requirement of that20    degree here.21 MR. NEUBORNE: Well, if you're a Legal Services22 lawyer, you either stay out of the case if there's an23 important constitutional question, or, if you're going to24 take the case, you have to take the case on condition that25 you don't raise certain arguments about the validity of43202122232425          MR. NEUBORNE:  If it --QUESTION: It may be a lot of trouble to sort out those cases that the Government wants to subsidize and those cases that it doesn't want to --          MR. NEUBORNE:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- maybe it's too much trouble.441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the Government's program. That essentially silences -- QUESTION: Oh, I don't think that's an option. I think given professional responsibilities, the only optionis the first.          MR. NEUBORNE:  Well --          QUESTION:  They cannot take the case.MR. NEUBORNE: The option of not taking the case is very difficult, first because Legal Services clients, or welfare clients don't appear on your doorstep, Justice Scalia, color-coded by argument. When you enter the relationship of attorney-client in these cases, you do so with someone that appears, you have to -- you speak to them, you have to interview them, you have to investigate the case. It is --QUESTION: It may be an unintelligent law, then, but I don't know that that --10111213141516171819    unconstitutionality.MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, but it --QUESTION:  -- has any bearing upon its1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MR. NEUBORNE: Can I suggest a very bright line, and it may be too bright a line, but the line is this, and I think it's the line that emerges from the Court's cases.When it is a private speaker, speaking on behalf of a private person, and the speech is directed to a forum, in this case a courtroom, which is important for the clash of ideas, the Government may not use viewpoint as a criteria for determining how the funds are going to be used.10111213141516171819202122232425    Court?QUESTION: Suppose I told you that I begin with the premise that the restriction on lawyers lobbying for legislative changes or writing legislators, et cetera, is valid. How could I reach that conclusion and adopt the premise you just suggested to the Court?MR. NEUBORNE: Well, I -- under those circumstances -- you mean the lawyer lobbying on behalf of a client --          QUESTION:  I want you to assume that that's avalid statute and a valid restriction.MR. NEUBORNE: Yes, and the lawyer can't lobby on behalf of a client as well as on his own -- on behalf of his own beliefs.QUESTION: Could I reach that conclusion and still adopt the premise that you just suggested to the451 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes, I believe you could.  Ibelieve you could first because of the --QUESTION: Then why isn't the Congress a forum, et cetera, or a legitimate place to petition, et cetera? MR. NEUBORNE: Well, it is, and I believe thatthat would be an unconstitutional statute. But I believe that that statute does not require you to lobby on one side of the issue and not lobby on the other.In other words, if the restriction were written, you can't lobby to change the status quo, but you can lobby to somehow cement the status quo, that would be a viewpoint-based discrimination.          QUESTION:  But --MR. NEUBORNE: If it is simply a categorical ban on all types of conduct, regardless of whether it is viewpoint-based or not, that's a very different story.QUESTION: But your status quo argument is a very fast, you know, moving target too. You can certainly say that an attorney who goes into court and urges that his client receive a welfare benefit is -- argues to change the status quo. The status quo is that the Government now has the money. He wants to change the status quo, have his client get the money.          MR. NEUBORNE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  So it's not just all --46 1              MR. NEUBORNE:  In fairness, though, it's the 2    legal status quo.  It's the legal -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, yeah, but, sir, that is just a 4    question of how you define the thing.5 MR. NEUBORNE: Well, but that's what the statute6 says. The statute says you can't go into court, and you7 heard today the Legal Services Corporation concede the8 enormous reach of it. You cannot go into a court and9 challenge whether or not a particular regulation or10 statute is or is not a valid regulation or statute. You11    must take it as written, and apply it as written.12              That, I suggest to you, is a core13 viewpoint-based discrimination, and a core interference14 with what attorneys ordinarily do for clients, and so it15 is an interference with the autonomous relationship,16 because it tells the lawyer what arguments the lawyer is17    allowed to make and what arguments he's not.18 Now, if --19              QUESTION:  Mr. Neuborne --20 MR. NEUBORNE: -- it is not the viewpoint --21              QUESTION:  -- suppose during World War II -- I22 don't know if the Government did this, but suppose it23 decided to subsidize patriotic films. It wanted to give24 Hollywood producers money to produce films that would buoy25 up the spirit of the American people during the war. We476 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425don't want Ginger Rogers, we want Humphrey Bogart and Casablanca and all the anti-Nazi --          MR. NEUBORNE:  Well, Ginger Rogers could be          QUESTION:  Okay.  Is that okay?          MR. NEUBORNE:  It might be, sir, yes.          QUESTION:  But you can't do Ginger Rogers andFred Astaire, just Bogart, or you know, otherpatriotic-type films.MR. NEUBORNE: Well, that's very close to the hypothetical that you used on a number of occasions about the National Endowment for Democracy. We don't claim -- it is not our argument that just because you fund the National Endowment on Democracy you have to fund the National Endowment on Totalitarianism.Where the Government sets up a program to express its own views, the Government has broad power to do so, and during the war, to set up a program to help patriotism --QUESTION: It's not expressing its own views. I mean, it's just a particular category of views that it wants to subsidize. These aren't -- it's not writing the movies. It wants patriotic views subsidized.MR. NEWBORN: Well, but with respect, Your Honor, that is precisely the kind of program in which the481234    patriotic.51 Government -- it's like Rust. The Government says there2 are a series of ideas we want to get out there. Those are3 good ideas, and we're prepared to pay for them, and we are4 prepared to in a sense subsidize people to speak for us,5 for the Government. If that's what's happening, then its 6    constitutional.7 If, on the other hand, what they're doing is8 subsidizing large numbers of private individuals to speak9 without creating a Government program -- and the big10 difference here is Pope v. Johnson. Pope v. Johnson says11 you can't think of a subsidized lawyer as someone who is12    simply parroting the Government's line.13 QUESTION: Yeah, but why can't the Government14 say the things we're interested in subsidizing here is,15 where someone has been denied benefits to which he's16 entitled under the text, we're not going to get into, you17 know, whether the regulations are okay, or the statutes18    are okay.  It's just this one thing we want to19    subsidize.202122232425          MR. NEWBORN:  No, because in order to --QUESTION: Just like we want to subsidize patriotism, we don't want to subsidize Ginger Rogers, we want to subsidize, you know, making -- defending claims under the text of a statute. We just don't want to go beyond that.491 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. NEWBORN: Because they're speaking through a person who cannot possibly be thought of as expressing the Government's view, and if what it wishes to do is speak through someone who does not express the Government view, it cannot use viewpoint-based criteria for allocatingthe subsidies.QUESTION: Well, I don't think Humphrey Bogart would want to be thought of as being a mouthpiece for the Government's view --          MR. NEWBORN:  Well, he would be.          QUESTION:  -- or the producer of the case forthat matter --          MR. NEWBORN:  He would be.          QUESTION:  -- of the movie.          MR. NEWBORN:  He would be, if he was fundedpursuant to a Government program that was designed to foster patriotism during war as part of the Government's propaganda apparatus.          Now, he may not like being called that, butthat's what he is.          QUESTION:  Well --MR. NEWBORN: And -- but that's very different from saying they're going to fund a bunch of university professors to conduct some research and then say to the university professors, the only kind of things that you501 could say are things that support the status quo, not2 things that don't support the status quo, because the3 university professors cannot be perceived as speaking for4 the Government under those circumstances, any more than5    the lawyer here can be seen as speaking for the6    Government.7 8 9set out --The bright line, the test that this Court hasQUESTION:  Well, it can --10111213141516171819202122232425    remaining.          MR. NEWBORN:  -- is a good test, it works.  I'msorry, Justice O'Connor.          QUESTION:  I didn't notice your light was on.I'm not going to ask you.          MR. NEWBORN:  Thank you.The test that this Court has set out is not a perfect test. It's hard to decide whether or not someone speaks for the Government or does not speak for the Government. In Rust, I think the Court got it wrong. The Court treated the doctors as though they were speaking for the Government, which means that the principle withRust --QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Neuborne. MR. NEUBORNE: Thank you, Your Honor.QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, you have 5 minutes511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER           ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES          MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.It's important to bear in mind that what we have here is what type -- is a question concerning what type of professional services is the Government going to pay for under a Government program which is neither a regulation nor is it a funding restriction that affects private expression of the sort that was involved in NEA. It is funding professional services.I also take substantial issue with respondent's claim that all that Rust covers is Government speech. As the Chief Justice pointed out, Rust itself did not say that, and this Court's subsequent cases have not said101112131415    that.16              In the Rosenberger case, for example, in17 addition to the passage the Chief Justice quoted about18 using private persons to deliver a message pertaining to19 the Government's own program, on page 630 -- or 834, the20 Court further said, it does not follow from the Government21 speaking -- where the Government itself speaks, that it22 does not follow that viewpoint-based restrictions are23 proper when the university does not itself speak, or24 subsidized transmittal of a message that it favors, but25 instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views52 1    from private speakers.2 The dichotomy that was created in Rosenberger3 was one where the Government is subsidizing essentially a4 forum where the Government gives money to a forum and asks5 the private speakers to have at it with one another for6 the benefit of the public at large, which is different7 from subsidizing a message the Government favors. 8              Here, although the Legal Services lawyer 9    opposing a State agency may not be advancing the10 Government's speech, the Government has decided that when11 it comes to a challenge of a State welfare regulation,12 that is not a message that the Government favors within13    the meaning of Rust.14              And again, NEA and the Wisconsin case last term15 did not suggest that Rust was limited to situations where16    it is the Government's own speech.17 One way in which this case raises even less of a18 First Amendment question than Rust is the fact that in19 Rust the doctor was not even permitted to advise the20 client where other services could be obtained. Under this21 program, the Legal Services lawyer, if he or she22 identifies a possible challenge to a statute or23 regulation, may tell the client that, may refer the client24    to another agency, to a pro bono list.25              Every LSC recipient is required to have a531 private attorney involved in the program with a list of2 attorneys to whom cases may be referred, so there is no3 gagging of communications at all. Even though there's no4 attorney-client relationship, the LSC fund recipient can 5    refer the client. 6              Also, in the context of litigation, to the7 extent the courtroom is a forum, it's a forum that exists8 independent of the Legal Services Corporation. What the9 Legal Services Corporation does is decide what sorts of10 cases are going to be funded, and there isn't enough money11 to go around. Congress had to decide how those moneys12 should be allocated. Lawyers do this all the time. Legal13 Services recipients do this all the time, in terms of14    setting their own priorities.15 With respect to issues concerning challenging16 the Government's position, one need look no further than17 sovereign immunity on the State level to the Eleventh18 Amendment to recognize that there are many situations in19 which the Government may decline to allow challenges in20 court to its own positions and, by the same token,21 Congress could certainly choose not to -- could repeal the22 Equal Access to Justice Act and not provide attorney's23 fees to people who want to sue the Government, even though24 it may provide attorney's fees for suits against private25 parties.541 And as we point out in our brief, Congress has2 provided differential standards for the award of3 attorney's fees, favoring plaintiffs in certain types of4 cases like environmental cases or civil rights cases, but 5    not favoring the defendants in those cases.6 As Justice Scalia pointed out, all litigation 7    has two sides, and in one respect could be viewed as8 viewpoint, but this Court has never analyzed regulations9 on attorney conduct or the attorney-client relationship in10 that way.11              Also, with respect to the argument that this is12 an anti-Government -- a prohibition against13 anti-Government speech, this is -- there's not a14 monolithic Government here. This statute prohibits an LSC15 recipient from taking on a case where what she would be16 doing would be challenging a State regulation as being in17    violation of Federal law.18              In other words, it would be a situation where19 the lawyer might even be trying to vindicate, in her view,20 what Federal law says on the subject, but still the client21 is not, or the attorney is not permitted to take that on.22 Congress could reasonably determine in the allocation of23 scarce resources that that was a better allocation of the24    resources.25              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mr. Kneedler.  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)56
