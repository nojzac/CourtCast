GELLER                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The plaintiffs in this case are people whounderwent back surgery in which particular medical deviceswere used.  They brought this suit under State law torecover for injuries allegedly caused by their -- by thesedevices, but this is a very unusual form of State lawproduct liability action.  The plaintiffs don't claim thatthese devices were in any way defective.  There's no claimhere of manufacturing defect.  There's no claim here ofdesign defect.  The plaintiffs also don't claim that thesurgeons who used these devices did anything wrong.There's no claim here of medical malpractice.          Instead, the plaintiffs' sole claim in this caseis the following.  They assert that the Federal Food &Drug Administration was deceived into giving regulatoryclearance to these devices, that, absent this deception,3                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    these devices would never have been on the market, and 2    that, if the devices had never have been on the market, 3    they wouldn't have been used in their surgeries and they 4    wouldn't have suffered any injuries. 5              So this lawsuit is, in other words, a direct 6    attack under State law on the decision of the Federal Food 7    & Drug Administration applying Federal law to allow these 8    devices to be marketed in interstate commerce and, if this 9    suit is allowed to proceed, it means that a jury applying10    State law would have to decide such issues as, what sorts11    of disclosures have to be made to the Food & Drug12    Administration in the context of seeking 510(k) approval13    for a device?  What did the FDA know about these specific14    devices and their intended use?  Was the FDA deceived in15    any way in granting regulatory clearance?16              QUESTION:  Do they really have to get into all17    of those issues, because I thought at least one theory of18    the plaintiffs' case was simply representation as19    determined on an objective basis and the only thing the20    jury would have to decide was whether, on an objective21    basis, the representation that the devices were intended22    for, what was it, long bone surgery, something other than23    spinal surgery, was true or false?  Why would they have to24    go beyond that?25              MR. GELLER:  Justice Souter, they would have to                                   4                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1    do that because there's a fraud claim and if you look at2    the complaint --3              QUESTION:  Well, that would be a question of4    intent on the part of the company, but it --5              MR. GELLER:  It would --6              QUESTION:  I'm sorry, go ahead.7              MR. GELLER:  It would be more than that, Justice8    Souter.  If you look at the complaint, for example, at9    page 21 of the joint appendix, paragraphs 131 and 13210    allege not only that a false statement was made but11    reliance and causation and all the things that you have to12    prove in order to prove a State law cause, State law fraud13 action.14              So it's not enough simply to prove that a15    misrepresentation was made in order to recover on it.  You16    would also have to prove whether the misrepresentation was17    material, whether the FDA knew what was allegedly not told18    to it, whether the FDA thought that it was relying on the19    absence of the information, relied on the20    misrepresentation and then finally, what would the FDA21    have done if it had been told the truth, the causation22    theory.2324255                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, why wouldn't it beadequate to show that, that there had been two priorapplications that were rejected for use of this device for 1    spinal surgery? 2              MR. GELLER:  Your Honor, the -- what the 3    manufacturer has to show in seeking 510(k) is, in addition 4    to showing that the device has the physical technological 5    characteristics of the predicate device the manufacturer 6    also has to put down what the intended use of the device 7    is.  It's -- the manufacturer under the law is entitled to 8    put down any intended use it wants, as described in the9 labeling.10              What the plaintiffs seem to claim here is that11    the FDA, is that the manufacturer had to allege not simply12    that the intended use was for the long bones, which was13    the manufacturer was entitled to allege, but also,14    according to the complaint, that once the device got on15    the market the manufacturer intended that it be used for16    spinal applications, and that our -- and therefore a State17    jury would have to determine what would the FDA have done,18    if it had been told, as the plaintiffs allege the19    manufacturer should have told the FDA, that once this20    device gets on the market the intent was to see it used21    significantly for spinal applications.22              QUESTION:  But my point was simply that we do23    have two applications that said the intended use is for24    spinal surgery and both of those applications were turned25    down.  Isn't that enough to infer that if they had for a6                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    third time said the same thing they'd be turned down 2    again? 3              MR. GELLER:  Well, I think the opposite, Justice 4    Ginsburg. I think it shows that the FDA was well aware of 5    the possibility of using these devices for spinal 6    applications and when the manufacturer came in, as it was 7    entitled to do, and that now we want to seek 510(k) 8    approval to label these devices for the long bones of the 9    arm and leg, the FDA was well aware that the devices had10    some possibility of being used for spinal applications.11    After all, I think the mistake here --12              QUESTION:  So you're saying in effect that there13    would be an issue of whether the FDA was complicit in the14    deception itself?15              MR. GELLER:  Absolutely, what did the FDA16    actually know about the use of these devices, and that's17    in our view not an inquiry that should be made under State18    law.  In fact, one of the --19              QUESTION:  We know -- I mean, as Justice20    Ginsburg's question suggests it would be fairly easy to21    prove what the FDA knew about possible applications, but I22    think, if I understand your answer to her, your answer is,23    well, that still doesn't simplify the case, because the24    issue then would become, even on that assumption, did the25    FDA understand perfectly well that this fraud was nothing7                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    but a fraud, and they winked at it and said, sure, this is 2    an easy way of letting them do what they want to do even 3    though we've said before that we won't let them do it.  In 4    other word -- is that in effect what you're -- 5              MR. GELLER:  In effect, although whether it was 6    even a fraud at all -- you see, I think one of the 7    problems here is in viewing the intended use statement 8    under 510(k) as a factual representation at all.  It's not 9    a factual representation at all.  It's simply a request10    for marketing clearance.11              The manufacturer decides by its labeling what12    sort of marketing clearance it seeks for its devices.  The13    FDA's role is simply to look at the labeling and determine14    whether there was a device on the market prior to 197615    with those physical characteristics and that labeling.16              QUESTION:  It's really a misnomer, then, if17    they're going to use it the way you say they have been and18    ought to use it, they shouldn't call it intended use.19    They should have -- it should be called permitted use, or20    approved use, or something like that.21              MR. GELLER:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia.  I22    think intended use is a misnomer.  It's a term of art in23    the food and drug law, and I think the statute and the24    regulations are as clear as can be, it is simply a request25    for marketing clearance by describing how you intend to8                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    label your device.  It is not at all a factual 2    representation as to how that device will actually be used 3    off-label once the device is on the market, which is, I 4    think, one of the many problems with the plaintiffs' claim5 here. 6              But the point that I was simply making is the 7    sorts of inquiries that a State judge or jury would have 8    to make if this State law claim were allowed to proceed 9    are inquiries that would delve heavily into the10    intricacies of the Federal regulatory process and, in11    addition, in addition to prevail on their claims the12    plaintiffs would have to convince a State jury that these13    devices should never have been on the market and were not14    lawfully on the market, even though the FDA has decided as15    a matter of Federal law that the devices are lawfully on16    the market, so to rule for plaintiffs, a jury under State17    law would have to essentially disregard and nullify a18    binding decision of the FDA.19              Now, our position is that a claim such as this,20    which essentially amounts to an attack under State law on21    a binding determination by a Federal agency is both22    expressly and impliedly preempted by the Federal food and23 drug laws.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I'm sorry, may I ask you25    just to go back one step, and that is to the issue of9                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether the plaintiffs' cause of action really is anattack, at least on its face, on an FDA decision, becausethe FDA decision, as I understand it, is a decision toallow the devices to be marketed for the long-bone use,and their cause of action, as I understand it, is that infact, as a result of this lie, this fraud on the FDA, itwas, in fact, allowed to be used, or it was possible touse it, I guess is the neutral word, on the spine.          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  But that is not attacking a decisionof the FDA because, in the sense that the FDA, as Iunderstand it, says yeah, we'll permit it for the purposesof long-bone use.          MR. GELLER:  No, I think --          QUESTION:  And that's as far as the FDA decisionwent, wasn't it?          MR. GELLER:  That's a mis -- I think that's amisunderstanding --          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. GELLER:  -- Justice Souter, of the process.What the FDA does is permit it to get on the market, andit can only be marketed for long-bone use.  It can only bemarketed for the intended use described in the labeling,but once it's on the market, it's quite clear thatsurgeons are entitled, in the exercise of their medical10                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425judgment, to use those devices for --          QUESTION:  Oh, it's true, and the surgeons arenot liable to the FDA --          MR. GELLER:  That's --          QUESTION:  -- but is it fair to characterize theFDA decision as being a decision to permit it's use forthe spine --          MR. GELLER:  The FDA --          QUESTION:  -- as opposed to permit its use forthe intended purpose?          MR. GELLER:  The FDA decided that these deviceswere entitled to be on the market, labeled for long-boneuse.  There's no question that they were lawfully at alltimes on the market, labeled for long-bone use.          QUESTION:  And labeled for long-bone use means,doesn't it, that the -- or implies, doesn't it, that theFDA's approval was for long-bone use --          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- and only for long-bone use?          MR. GELLER:  No.  It means it could only be --          QUESTION:  It may not have had a right to goafter the doctor who used it for some other purpose, butthe extent of the FDA approval didn't go beyond longbones, did it?          MR. GELLER:  No, Your Honor.  It means it can                            11                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    only be marketed for long-bone use.  It can be used for 2    any purpose whatsoever once it was on the market, 3    consistent with independent medical judgment.  The claim4 here -- 5              QUESTION:  Well, to the extent that it's used 6    for more than long bones, hasn't the FDA in effect washed 7    its hands of it? 8              MR. GELLER:  But it is not inconsistent in any 9    way with the FDA's decision.  The FDA decided here that10    the -- that this 510(k) satisfied the statute in the sense11    that the device was similar, substantially equivalent both12    in its characteristics and its intended use to a predicate13    device.  It therefore was entitled to be on the market.14    In fact, it had a right to be on the market.  At all times15    it was lawfully on the market.  The plaintiffs --16              QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, is it -- explain to us,17    if you would, the practice of the FDA with regard to18    authorized drugs and devices.  If it is authorized, is an19    off-label use always allowed --20              MR. GELLER:  Yes.21              QUESTION:   -- by the FDA?22              MR. GELLER:  Yes.  The FDA --23              QUESTION:  In fact, it's rather common?24              MR. GELLER:  Absolutely.

GELLER:  Absolutely.  The statute is quiteclear.  Congress made it quite clear that the FDA has nocontrol over the practice of medicine.  All it does isapprove drugs and devices to be marketed for particularpurposes.  Once they're on the market, physicians andsurgeons are entitled to use the devices for any purposeconsistent with their own medical judgment, and off-label --          QUESTION:  Now, I assume these plaintiffs wouldhave a cause of action against the physicians who made thejudgment that it's okay to use them for the spine?          MR. GELLER:  If that failed --          QUESTION:  If, indeed, they're not safe for the          MR. GELLER:  If that fails to satisfy some Statelaw duty of care.          In fact, Justice Souter, you can imagine asituation where a manufacturer here sought approval forthese devices for a purpose of labeling them for longbones, and had absolutely no intent that they be used foranything else, a manufacturer with a perfectly clear heart13                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO101112131415161718    spine?19202122232425 1    here, contrary to what they allege about these defendants. 2    The device would have been on the market in exactly the 3    same way these devices would have been on the market.  The 4    physicians and surgeons would have used them in exactly 5    the same way these devices were used.  The plaintiffs 6    would have suffered exactly the same injuries. 7              So the flaw here is that these devices were 8    entitled to be on the market.  Once the intended use that 9    was described in the 510(k) application was consistent10    with an intended use for devices such as these prior to11 1976 --12              QUESTION:  No, I think -- I mean, I think I --13              MR. GELLER:  Okay.14              QUESTION:  -- get your point.  The only issue15    that I was trying to raise was how we ought to16    characterize it.  Should we characterize it as -- should17    we characterize their intent as inconsistent with the FDA18    approval, as distinct from consistent with a use that the19    FDA would not affirmatively take steps to stop, and20 that --21              MR. GELLER:  It is consistent --22              QUESTION:  That characterization might have an23    effect on the way we view --24              MR. GELLER:  My view, Your Honor, it -- what25    happened here was perfectly consistent with the FDA --14                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1    with the scheme and the FDA's decision here.2              The FDA's decision here was that these devices3    had a right to be on the market because they satisfied4    510(k).  What happened thereafter, it may have been a5    marketing violation if they were marketed for other6    purposes, but it was in no way a fraud on the FDA, which7    is the allegation here, to seek approval.  It is perfectly8    lawful -- let me say it this way.9              It is perfectly lawful, perfectly consistent10    with the statute, perfectly protective of the public11    health, to seek approval under section 510(k) for a device12    by saying it has intended use A, even though you hope,13    expect, intend that once the device gets on the market it14    would be used primarily, or even exclusively, for use B.15    That's perfectly consistent with the Federal statutory16    scheme.17181920212223242515                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO          Now, what you can't do is market it for use B,but it's perfectly appropriate, under the statute, torepresent to the FDA and put in your labeling that it hasintended use A.          QUESTION:  And the marketing, you can't marketit for use B.MR. GELLER:  You cannot market it.QUESTION:  That's part of which statute?MR. GELLER:  That's part of the food and drug 1    laws.  That may well be misbranded or adulterated if you 2    market it for use B when it only has intended use A, but 3    when you do that you violated the marketing regulation. 4    It's in no way a fraud on the FDA, which is what the 5    allegation is here. 6              QUESTION:  If it helps bring you to the argument 7    on implied preemption, which I'm anxious to hear -- 8              MR. GELLER:  Yes. 9              QUESTION:  -- let me just ask you this question.10    Suppose a consultant like your client here, in assisting11    the labeling of a drug or device, does not disclose a side12    effect, and the side effect is not on the label, and13    somebody's injured because they have the side effect, and14    the allegation is that they knew about the side effect and15    deliberately withheld it.  Is there a cause of action16    under some States, under this State?17              MR. GELLER:  No.  I --18              QUESTION:  Is there implied preemption --19              MR. GELLER:  Our position --20              QUESTION:  -- and if so, why should that be?21              MR. GELLER:  I think it should be, Justice22    Kennedy, because Congress ultimately made a decision that23    there is not to be a private right of action for violation24    of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that all25    violations of the act or suspected violations are to be16                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1    enforced by the Food & Drug Administration in its ultimate2    discretion.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          This is section 336 and 337 of the act.  The FDAis to decide whether there is a violation and, if there isa violation, the FDA is to decide whether it's asignificant enough violation to cause some sort ofpenalties to be imposed, and this was a very, veryimportant part of Congress' scheme.          Unlike many other regulatory statutes, thesecurities laws, the antitrust laws, Congress here decidedthere should not be a private right of action and thereason is because you're dealing here with the publichealth.  There may well be misrepresentations to the FDAin an application and yet it's important to have thedevice remain on the market for the public health.          QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, suppose the case was onein which the FDA decided that the misrepresentation,assuming there was one, was sufficient to justify takingit off the market.  Would a person who was injured duringthe period it was on the market have any remedy at all,either State or Federal?but --MR. GELLER:  Well, obviously it's not this case,QUESTION:  No, I understand that.MR. GELLER:  -- I would say no because of the17              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.              SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005              (202)289-2260              (800) FOR DEPO 1    Congress' decision not to provide -- you cannot bring a 2    cause of action that enforces the Federal Food & Drug 3    laws.  Now, there may well be a State -- as in 4    Medtronic -- 5              QUESTION:  Even though the Federal agency might 6    have found there was, in fact, exactly the violation? 7              MR. GELLER:  Absolutely, because there's too 8    great a danger I think, Justice Stevens, that a State 9    court might impose a remedy that is completely10    inconsistent with the remedy that the FDA itself would11    have decided was appropriate in that situation.12              And here, you know, this is a -- this is the13    contrasting situation, if I could, and I'd like to save14    some time for rebuttal, but this is a situation in which15    all of the allegations of so-called fraud in the16    plaintiffs' complaint here were presented to the Food &17    Drug Administration not on one occasion but on at least18    two occasions.19              Thousands and thousands of pages of documents20    that allegedly documented this fraud were presented to the21    FDA in a citizens' position, and when the FDA was22    reclassifying bone screws.  The FDA decided not to do23    anything.  It obviously didn't feel itself defrauded.  It24    decided not to take these devices in any way off the25    market, and yet the plaintiffs' fraud claim here would18                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1    have the potential to completely undermine this entire2    statutory scheme by allowing State courts and juries to3    second-guess the decision of the FDA to allow these4    devices to remain on the market to protect the public5 health.6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          If there are no further questions, I'd like toreserve the balance of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Geller.          Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN    ON  BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The respondents' fraud on the FDA claim isimpliedly preempted for two reasons.  First, it conflictswith the Federal Government's exclusive authority toenforce the act's prohibitions against fraud on the FDAand second, it conflicts with the FDA's decision clearingthe devices at issue here for marketing.          Now, as to the first point, the act expresslygives to the Federal Government exclusive authority toenforce the act's prohibitions against fraud on the FDA,and the claim here conflicts with that allocation ofauthority because it asks the States to impose on an19                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    individual an obligation not to defraud the FDA. 2              Now, in this area of preeminent Federal concern, 3    there is no room for that State rule.  It is up to the 4    Federal Government to decide whether the FDA has been 5    defrauded and, if so, what to do about it, and that is 6    particularly true when the question is whether the FDA's 7    own internal decision-making process has been corrupted 8    through an act of fraud. 9              Now, as to the second point, the --10              QUESTION:  And would you give the same answer11    Mr. Geller did?  Assume the FDA concluded that its12    processes had been corrupted by the acts of fraud, and so13    forth and so on.  Is there any way the FDA could give a14    remedy to people who were injured by that fraud?15              MR. GORNSTEIN:  The people who were -- there16    would not be an injury for the fraud, but there would be17    whatever other claims --18              QUESTION:  You mean, there would not be a remedy19    for the fraud?20              MR. GORNSTEIN:  For the -- there would not be21    private damage actions for the fraud on the FDA.22              QUESTION:  So the category of people who might23    exist -- I'm not suggesting that's this case, but who24    might have been injured by that fraud would have25    absolutely no remedy?20                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GORNSTEIN:  The only remedies they wouldhave are the other remedies that State laws affords if theproduct was --          QUESTION:  But I -- they're preempted.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, let me just continue.  Thefraud claim is preempted, but if there is negligentdesign, negligent manufacturing, failure to warn, commonlaw malpractice, all of those claims are available, butinsofar as they would be asserting an essential element ofthe claim would be that the FDA was defrauded, that is anarea of exclusive Federal concern, and the State commonlaw cause of action would be preempted.          QUESTION:  What happens if the --          QUESTION:  What's the Federal provision on fraudon the FDA?  What is that?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  331(q)(2) is the prohibitionagainst fraud, 21 U.S.C. 331(q)(2), which I don't think isincluded in any of the materials here.          QUESTION:  That's --          MR. GORNSTEIN:  And the exclusive enforcement is21 U.S.C. 337(a), which with certain limited exceptionsgives the Federal Government exclusive authority toenforce the act's prohibitions.          QUESTION:  What would happen if an expert gavefraudulent or negligent, two different hypotheticals,21                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    information to an attorney, and the attorney then made a 2    submission to the court, and the court makes a ruling, and 3    the ruling is against the adversary party, can the 4    adversary party then sue the expert just under State law, 5    and does this happen all the time, or would the courts 6    have in -- throughout the States the same argument that 7    you're making here, oh, we don't want a lot of satellite 8    litigation, we don't want to be deluged?  Are there cases 9    on the books that tell us about this, or --10              MR. GORNSTEIN:  I'm not aware of cases, but we11    think the same general principle, if a court is defrauded12    and its judgment permits certain conduct, then the method13    to go about getting relief from that is to go back to the14    court and say that that judgment has been secured by15    fraud, and the same thing is true here.16              QUESTION:  This theory hasn't been tried?17              MR. GORNSTEIN:  I have not seen that theory18    tried, Justice Kennedy.19              Now, the second reason that there's preemption20    here, and this is a second and independent reason, is that21    the State law common law claim conflicts with the Federal22    clearance decision, and the reason --23              QUESTION:  The what?24              MR. GORNSTEIN:  The FDA's decision clearing the25    devices at issue for marketing, and the reason that it22                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    does is that an essential element of this claim is that 2    the devices never should have come to market under Federal 3    law, whereas the FDA has determined that they should, and 4    the fact that there is an allegation here that that 5    decision was secured through fraud does not avert the 6    conflict, because the FDA can reconsider its decisions and 7    withdraw them if it determines they've been secured by 8    fraud, but unless and until it does that, those decisions 9    remain binding and authoritative, and they preempt any10    conflicting State law claims.11              QUESTION:  But you're going further.  You're12    saying even if they did find it was procured by fraud,13    there would still be preemption.14              MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, Justice Stevens, but that's15    under my first argument and not under my second argument.16              QUESTION:  Well, you'd say there would be17    preemption up to the point when the FDA reviews the matter18    and concludes that it has been defrauded.  Then would you19    say -- I'm just trying to follow Justice Kennedy's20    judicial analogy.  If you went back to a court and the21    court concluded it had, indeed, been duped, you'd probably22    then have a private lawsuit.23              MR. GORNSTEIN:  You probably do, Justice Scalia,24    and there may not be a perfect analogy here, because --25              QUESTION:  Because you don't think there would23                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    be a private lawsuit, even after the FDA came to the 2    conclusion that indeed -- 3              MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct, because the 4    second theory of preemption would be gone, but our first 5    theory of preemption, which is that this is a matter of 6    exclusive Federal control over the decision as to whether 7    there's fraud and what the remedies for that should be, 8    would still be in effect. 9              QUESTION:  In other words -- I'm sorry.  In10    other words, the FDA can do its own fraud prosecution and11    the FDA can withdraw the drug from the market.12              MR. GORNSTEIN:  It can.13              QUESTION:  I mean, those are the reasons.14              MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.15              Now, finally, the final point I wanted to make16    is that the --17              QUESTION:  Excuse me.  And if that happened, you18    would not object to a fraud suit at that point.19              MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  We --20              QUESTION:  Under --21              MR. GORNSTEIN:  There would still be a --22              QUESTION:  Under the implied preemption theory.23              MR. GORNSTEIN:  On the second implied preemption24    that I've given, which is that an outstanding Federal25    clearance decision, there would not be preemption, but --24                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    because that would have been withdrawn, but on the first 2    theory preemption I'm giving, which is that the decision 3    about whether there is fraud and what the remedies for 4    that should be, there would still be preemption of that 5    claim.  Now, either one of those theories is independently 6    sufficient to resolve this case. 7              Now, the final point I wanted to make is that 8    the respondents say that this case is just like Medtronic, 9    and the claims here shouldn't be preempted for the same10    reasons the claims in Medtronic were not preempted, but11    there are three basic differences between the claims in12    Medtronic and the claim here.13              The claims there, the State was performing its14    traditional role in enforcing ordinary duties of care15    running from the manufacturer to the consumer, whereas16    here it's seeking to impose an obligation on somebody not17    to defraud a Federal Government agency.  The claims there18    had an existence that was completely independent of the19    Federal scheme.  This claim is entirely derivative.20    Without this Federal regulatory scheme you could not have21    a fraud on the FDA claim.22              And finally, the claims there were not preempted23    by the Federal clearance decision.  They all assumed that24    the devices had been permissibly cleared under Federal25    law, whereas here, the claim conflicts with the Federal                                  25                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    clearance decision. 2              If there are no further questions -- 3              QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Gornstein. 4              Mr. Fishbein, we'll hear from you. 5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D. FISHBEIN 6                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 7              MR. FISHBEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 8    may it please the Court: 9              We're here to determine whether or not the Food,10    Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the medical device amendments to11    that act, prevent the States from recognizing and awarding12    damages for -- which flow from allowing a device to enter13    the market through fraud on the FDA.  I would suggest to14    the Court the answer to that question comes from the15    unanimous -- the unanimous portions of this Court's16    decision in Medtronic.17              In Medtronic the Court was confronted with the18    question about whether or not the Food, Drug and Cosmetic19    Act and the medical amendments to the Food, Drug and20    Cosmetic Act preempt State common law claims which are21    founded on a violation of Federal requirements, and what22    the Court said, and said so unanimously, was that there is23    nothing in Federal law which prevented the States from24    affording a private damage remedy, one not given by25    Federal law at all, for violations of the Food, Drug, and26                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    Cosmetic Act, or the medical device amendments to that 2    act, and that was not limited to negligence cause of 3    actions.  It was focused on violations of the act. 4              In the present case, our claim does not derive 5    from some newfangled principle of tort law.  Our claim 6    derives from a longstanding principle of tort law which 7    has been in force in this country, in the States, in 8    various forms since they became States, and that is the 9    principle reflected in section 536 and 557(a) of the10    Restatement of Torts Second --11              QUESTION:  May I just --12              QUESTION:  But that's an extraordinary -- this13    is an extraordinary application of that principle.14              MR. FISHBEIN:  I don't believe so, Mr. Chief15    Justice, and I say that for this reason.  The tort law16    does not only go to negligence per se, but tort law says17    that where one is required to file, furnish, or publish18    information by statute or regulation for the protection of19    the public, and makes a misrepresentation in doing so and20    harm follows from that, that you're entitled to recover21 damages.22              QUESTION:  From whom?23              MR. FISHBEIN:  That is true --24              QUESTION:  From whom?25              MR. FISHBEIN:  You're entitled to recover27                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    damages from the maker of the misrepresentation, because 2    that is where the culpable conduct lies. 3              Now, of course, it's true that that principle is 4    not frequently invoked, because in many cases it's easier 5    to go more directly through other tort principles, but 6    that doesn't change the fact that that is a principle of 7    tort law which is independent of the Federal scheme. 8              QUESTION:  It is, but in ordinary tort law the 9    third party who has been defrauded does not have the power10    to say authoritatively in any sense, I have not been11    defrauded.  It will be up to the court to say whether he's12    been defrauded or not.13              But here the alleged defraudee is a Federal14    agency that is empowered to decide authoritatively whether15    it's been defrauded or not.16              MR. FISHBEIN:  I agree with that statement,17    Justice Scalia, and I think that one of the important18    distinctions here is that this agency never said one way19    or the other whether they had been defrauded.  There has20    never been a factual finding, either in connection with21    the 510(k) clearance premarket notification or22    subsequently, in which the FDA say we either were or were23    not defrauded, but if there was --24              QUESTION:  If the FDA --25              MR. FISHBEIN:  -- I would agree with you.28                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  If -- supposing the FDA had openedthe matter up, said we find we weren't defrauded, wouldyou then have no claim?          MR. FISHBEIN:  I think that that presents a moredifficult question to --          QUESTION:  Well, I'm asking you to fish or cutbait, so to speak.(Laughter.)          MR. FISHBEIN:  I would argue, Your Honor, evenunder those circumstances, unless we were party to theadjudication, or that was made through a formal notice andcomment proceeding, that we were not bound by that.However, I believe that at least in that circumstancethere's the argument that allowing a jury to find acontrary fact cuts against what the FDA decided.          QUESTION:  Suppose you get a judicialdetermination that in fact the FDA has been defrauded,does that have any effect on the FDA's approval for themarketing of this device?          MR. FISHBEIN:  You mean in private litigation,Justice Scalia, or --          QUESTION:  You win this suit, and the basis foryour winning it is a determination by the Court that theFDA has been defrauded.  Does the FDA have to withdraw themedical device from the market?29                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. FISHBEIN:  No, Your Honor, and that's one of 2    the points that we make here, is that -- 3              QUESTION:  This produces a very crazy system, 4    doesn't it, where you have a bunch of State courts going 5    around saying that the FDA has been defrauded and has been 6    duped into approving this and the FDA continuing to allow 7    it to go out there?  Why would we want a system that 8    allows these contrary authoritative determinations to 9    bounce around?10              MR. FISHBEIN:  Your Honor, I think we have such11    a system.  Indeed, it's common in our system.  Just to use12    a basic analogy, if I could, the State establishes a law13    saying you can't -- we're going to put a stop light up at14    the corner, and you can't run the stop light.  The State15    has the power to enforce that through criminal sanctions16    and administrative sanctions.17              You run through the stop light, the State can18    either choose or not choose to prosecute you, they can19    choose or not choose what remedy to afford, but there's no20    doubt, we all know this from our basic tort law, that the21    injured individual, notwithstanding the potential exercise22    of State power, has the right to go into court and recover23    damages for that violation.24              QUESTION:  Yes, but this is not that.25              QUESTION:  That example is quite different.  Can30                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    I just suggest why, and I would really like you to focus 2    on it.  Here, your claim is not only that they were 3    defrauded, but that the fraud was sufficiently serious, 4    that's responsible for the item being on the market, and 5    so if they keep the item on -- say the FDA had an 6    investigation, you had a jury, everybody agreed there was 7    fraud, but everybody also agreed the fraud was not 8    sufficiently serious to take the item off the market, it 9    was kind of immaterial, that's quite a different case from10    the red light case.11              MR. FISHBEIN:  Your Honor, I do not believe that12    a determination has ever been made that the device should13    not be kept on the market, and I think that goes to what's14    involved in a so-called 510(k) clearance.15              QUESTION:  Well, no.  It's involved in your16    lawsuit, as I understand it.  One of the steps in the sort17    of, the change of causation is that in your argument --18    your complaint, if I understand, is, but for the fraud,19    this item would not be on the market.  Is that correct?20              MR. FISHBEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor.21              QUESTION:  Okay.22              MR. FISHBEIN:  And the point I want to make here23    is simply this.  When the FDA receives a 510(k)24    notification it has to determine -- it only has the power,25    not to clear the device for the market or not clear the31                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    device for the market.  Under 21 C.F.R. section -- I think 2    it's 807.100, the FDA has three choices when it gets a 3    510(k) market, premarket notification.  It can either say 4    that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate 5    device for the use intended by the applicant, it's not 6    substantially equivalent, or it can ask for more 7    information. 8              Now, what the FDA did here was exactly what they 9    typically do.  They looked at the proposed labeling they10    were given, which was not accurate labeling because it was11    not truthful reflection of the intended marketing for this12    device, which is required under the regulations, but the13    applicant --14              QUESTION:  Excuse me.  No, you can't say that,15    that it wasn't a truthful reflection of the intended16    marketing.  I think it's been conceded by Mr. Geller that17    if they marketed this for the use that you claimed harmed18    your clients they would have been in violation, wouldn't19 they?20212223    use.24              MR. FISHBEIN:  I agree with that, Justice25    Scalia.32                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPOMR. FISHBEIN:  Yes, sir.          QUESTION:  So it isn't a matter of what's theintended marketing.  The issue is what is the intended 1              QUESTION:  And the intended use, according to 2    Mr. Geller, is a term of art, which means the use for 3    which you want FDA approval. 4              MR. FISHBEIN:  I disagree with that, Justice 5    Scalia, and I think that it's clear, and the Government 6    agrees with this position, that intended use not only in 7    this section of the statute but every other place is 8    defined objectively by the manner in which the proponent 9    of the device intends to characterize the device in the10 market.11              And I think it's significant that in the12    regulations governing 510(k) disclosure -- I believe it's13    807.87(e) of title 21, or of 21 C.F.R. -- what the FDA14    says is, don't just give us the label that's going to15    accompany this product.  You are obliged to give us the16    labeling sufficient to describe the intended use of the17    device, and labeling through a series of case law and18    decisions says that it is not only -- and in your decision19    in Cordell, in fact, it is not only what is on the20    product, it is the promotional materials which accompany21    the product which demonstrate how the product will be22    characterized in the marketplace which determine intended23    use, and that is consistent with the legislative scheme.24    Congress --25              QUESTION:  Are those promotional materials                                  33                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    attached to the application to the FDA? 2              MR. FISHBEIN:  Frequently they are, Justice 3    Ginsburg.  In this case they were not, and my point is 4    simply that it is not sufficient to come to the FDA and 5    say, here is a screw, I'm going to use this as a screw to 6    build crutches, when you know darned well that you're 7    never going to characterize it that way in the market. 8    It's not a crutch screw, it's a bone screw, and -- 9              QUESTION:  But the thing that makes this case so10    peculiar is, a Government agency, a private Attorney11    General coming in to say that the agency has been12    defrauded.  I don't know of any precedent for a private13    citizen coming in and saying, Government agency, I'm going14    to be your champion, you have been defrauded.15              It's not like in the SEC.  The SEC says, yeah,16    we need people to help us enforce because we can't go17    after all those bad actors, quite different from here,18    saying, agency, you've been defrauded, and we private19    citizens are going to decide.  Is there any precedent,20    anything like this?21              MR. FISHBEIN:  I believe that there is, Justice22    Ginsburg.  I think, in fact, your opinion in Medtronic, at23    least the unanimous portion, says that private plaintiffs24    can rely upon violations of food, drug, and cosmetic law25    if they can otherwise do so under State law to recover34                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1 damages. 23 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I don't mean the FDA, because as faras I know this is a novel claim.  Is there any case wherecitizen X has successfully maintained a claim for fraud onany three- or four-letter agency that you want to pick?          MR. FISHBEIN:  I believe in the securities areathere is, Your Honor.  I can't cite the case, but your --this Court's recognized --          QUESTION:  Where there's a claim for fraud onthe SEC?10111213141516171819202122    situation.23 24 25          MR. FISHBEIN:  It is not fraud on our clients,Justice Scalia, but the common law does not require as atort matter fraud on the clients.35                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          MR. FISHBEIN:  Sure.  Where you have a falsefiling with the SEC and people purchase in reliance on thefalse information contained in that filing, I think it isactually a statutory cause of action.          QUESTION:  That's a -- but that's --          QUESTION:  That's fraud on them.  I mean, onceyou have a false -- you made a false statement in a filingthat you know is going to be presented to -- in aprospectus that you know is going to be presented tobuyers, that's fraud on them, but this is not fraud onyour clients.  I mean, this is quite a different 1              QUESTION:  Do you have another example besides 2    the SEC filings, which are, of course, meant to be 3    presented to the investors and therefore constitute fraud 4    on the investors themselves? 5              MR. FISHBEIN:  There was a case, an important 6    case decided by the Third Circuit, not by you, by Justice 7    Becker, called Stanton By Brooks v. Astro Pharmaceutical, 8    which held in the early 1980's that the failure to 9    discharge duties of disclosure in connection with a drug10    or device rendered the product defective per se under11    section 402 of the Restatement, and allowed a court to12    award damages based on the theory that the FDA, had they13    received appropriate disclosures, would have acted14    differently and would have protected the plaintiff from15    injury and therefore which allowed recovery.16              There are also other appellate cases within the17    appellate system which are cited in our brief, Learjet v.18    Spindlauer, which I think is a Fifth Circuit case, and19    there are a few others which recognize -- and that case20    was an aviation case, where a fraudulent -- a license was21    obtained fraudulently from the FAA, also a case called22    Hawkins, cited in our briefs, where the -- again a Federal23    court case, an appellate case, where the court recognized24    that that kind of misrepresentation changes the whole25    regulatory calculus, deprives the public of an informed36                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    decision with respect to the product, and that could 2    render the product dangerous and people can recover based3 on that. 4              So there is a recognition both in the common law 5    of that, and what I would suggest is that in Medtronic, 6    both explicitly and as a matter of implied preemption 7    which is not dealt with directly in Medtronic, that States 8    are not foreclosed from doing that, because there is no 9    impact here on any function with which the FDA is10    entrusted.11              QUESTION:  Well, I found it rather hard to find12    that in my opinion in Medtronic, which was a separate13    opinion.14              MR. FISHBEIN:  Your opinion, Justice Breyer, was15    the one opinion which didn't go off on the distinction16    between remedies and requirements and the State --17              QUESTION:  I mean, I would find it surprising,18    wouldn't you, that if you have a private right of action,19    to say in any of the thousands and thousands of State20    agencies or Federal agencies that what the State did, you21    see, what these people did is, they got their brief in22    late.  They got their brief in late, violating the23    Federal -- violating the agency rule, and if they -- doing24    that, they wouldn't have gotten the approval.25              MR. FISHBEIN:  Well --37                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1              QUESTION:  There would be no cause of action2    there.3456 it? 7              MR. FISHBEIN:  No.  I would have a different 8    reason for that, Your Honor, and the reason I would 9    advance for that --10              QUESTION:  Is?11              MR. FISHBEIN:  -- is that in that particular12    circumstance the failure to follow Federal law was not13    something that had to do with the safety of --14              QUESTION:  No, no, no.  Whether it's Federal or15    State, I don't care.  I mean, take any agency you want.16    Take a municipal council, I don't care.  It would just be17    amazing to me that you'd find somebody getting a private18    right of action based upon, under ordinary tort law19    principles, based upon the agency not following its own20    procedural rules, that the person violated some procedural21    rule, because you'd say that's up to the agency, and of22    course my question is, how is this any different, and of23    course my opinion in Medtronic says that we look to see24    what the agency wants and if the agency thinks it's25    preempted, good-bye, and that seems to me in essence what38                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPOMR. FISHBEIN:  No, there wouldn't be.          QUESTION:  No, all right, so -- and because itwould be up to the agency to enforce its own rule, isn't 1    you have here. 2              Now, I'm putting it that to you to get an 3    answer, not because I'm wedded to it. 4              MR. FISHBEIN:  There's a couple of embedded 5    questions in there, Your Honor.  One, I do believe it's a 6    traditional principle of tort law, not as a matter of 7    implying cause of action but as a matter of negligence per 8    se, or liability per se, that where somebody violates a 9    statute or regulation, regardless of who's in charge of10    administering that statute or regulation intended for the11    protection of the public, any harm caused by that is12    actionable under State law, not because you're implying a,13    in the case of Federal law a Federal cause of action, but14    just as a matter of negligence per se.15              So the question then is, is this a substantive16    safety regulation that we're talking about here, or is it17    a procedural regulation, and I say it's a substantive18    safety regulation, because the heart of the Federal19    scheme, and there's hundreds of cases on this regulating20    food, drug, and cosmetics, is, you are only regulating21    by -- with respect to what the device or drug is, and that22    is a function of two things, both what it physically is23    and what it's conceived to be for marketing purposes, and24    if you misrepresent to the public what it is, or you25    misrepresent to the agency what it is, you're undermining                                  39                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    the central safety aspects here. 2              For -- it's easy to see that in this case, 3    because when the agency was told this was a spinal 4    fixation device and that that's what it was, they said, 5    you can't put that on the market. 6              QUESTION:  There are a number of things.  We're 7    on precisely the same track, because in my mind I was 8    thinking substantive/procedural, something like that, and 9    what's fraud, and then if I push it towards -- I can be10    elliptical because I think we're thinking alike.11              The -- if you push it towards the substantive12    side, then I get into the problem of the agency having a13    bunch of powers.  They could enforce it through injunctive14    relief, monetary penalties, seizure, criminal15    prosecutions, withdrawal of market clearance.16              And then I think, well, shouldn't that be up to17    them?  I mean, after all, their job is to protect the18    public from monopoly, and if they think that really this19    particular misrepresentation is not that serious in light20    of their basic job, shouldn't it be up to them to decide21    how to enforce it rather than up to a jury?22              MR. FISHBEIN:  We don't know here whether they23    think it's serious or not, so that's the first point, but24    more fundamentally, insofar as the remedies that you've25    enumerated are concerned, I do believe that the FDA has40                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    exclusive prosecutorial discretion.  I do think that 2    section 337 of title 21 does preempt the ability of States 3    to give, for example, injunctive relief, civil penalties, 4    and to suspend somebody's license to sell these products. 5    I agree with all that. 6              But what the Federal law doesn't give, and what 7    Congress reserved to the States when it passed the Federal 8    law, it doesn't give anybody the ability to compensate the 9    victims that I represent for the damages that he's10    sustained as a result of the fraud.11              QUESTION:  That's because the FDA doesn't want12    them compensated for this kind of thing because it's13    decided that the harm to them, which they're not14    understating, would be outweighed by the need to get this15    drug on the market to fight the monopolistic advantage16    that people would have without it being there.17              MR. FISHBEIN:  Your Honor, they made no such18    determination in this case.19              QUESTION:  No, no, that's true, but they say,20    the way we make these determination is by deciding which21    remedy to pick, and we pick the lesser ones when we think22    we want this thing on the market.  We pick the greater23    ones when it should be gotten rid of, and if you leave it24    up to the jury, of course, that's the same as getting rid25    of the product.41                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. FISHBEIN:  I disagree that it's the same as 2    getting rid of the product.  What happened is, the product 3    as bone screws entered the market, I say unlawfully.  Now, 4    if the FDA has not revoked the 510(k) clearance it's 5    because the product is still legitimately on the market as 6    a bone-screw product.  The problem is here, we have an 7    illegitimate pretextual application which the Government 8    concedes was pretextual and would be improper if the facts 9    we allege are true.10              QUESTION:  Mr. Fishbein, may I stop you there --11              MR. FISHBEIN:  Certainly, Your Honor.12              QUESTION:  -- because I didn't realize that was13    the Government's concession, and Mr. Geller told us that14    there was indeed an effort to go to the FDA to complain15    about this and it was unsuccessful.16              MR. FISHBEIN:  The F -- we have gone to the FDA17    and they have not ruled yea or nay, and I believe that18    their brief concedes that they have not made a19    determination as to the lawfulness of this conduct in any20    context, both when the application was received by them,21    or subsequently, and they take the position that when22    someone applies for 510(k) clearance they cannot simply23    list a use, an intended use, in quotes, which is24    pretextual.25              The Government's position, and I think it's42                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    right, is that the use must be bona fide.  You must 2    intend, the product must have an intended use, meaning you 3    intend to characterize it in the market for that use.4 Now, true -- 5              QUESTION:  Shouldn't there be some, even a 6    notion of -- assuming that there could be such a complaint 7    at all, of primary jurisdiction, or exhaustion or 8    something, to let the agency speak for itself?  If it 9    doesn't think that it's been defrauded, that should be the10 end of it.11              MR. FISHBEIN:  The doctrine of exhaustion I12    think does not apply here, because that presupposes that13    the agency has the power to give a remedy that the14    plaintiffs want and in this case that would be damages,15    and the agency clearly does not have that power.16              The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is a17    doctrine which enables a court to make a referral to an18    agency to make a determination of some issue of fact19    that's germane to the case.  Of course, nobody asked for20    such a referral here and, looking at your recent case,21    Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gissone and Rider v. Cooper, it22    seemed to me that if there was no primary jurisdiction23    asserted in those cases, one, for example, whether someone24    had Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Compensation Act25    status or seaman status, that was not to be referred to43                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    the agency there, that this seemed to me to be an 2    inappropriate case for the exercise of primary 3    jurisdiction. 4              QUESTION:  Mr. Fishbein, even if you say in this 5    case the agency hasn't ruled yea or nay on the particular 6    facts here, do you have at least some other case where the 7    FDA, which has this authority to find that it has been 8    defrauded, has withdrawn something from the market or has 9    imposed some other penalty because the application did not10    contain uses that were anticipated, although they were not11    set forth in the application?12              MR. FISHBEIN:  I know of no such case, Justice13    Scalia, but that's not our position.14              QUESTION:  Don't you think that's significant?15    Doesn't it tend to support Mr. Geller's contention that16    all the FDA cares about is what use do you want authority17    to market for, and so long as you set forth that use,18    you'll have authority to market for it, and anything else,19    you may anticipate it's going to be used for other things,20    but that's all we're approving, is this marketed use?21              MR. FISHBEIN:  But Justice Scalia, that's not22    the agency's position and that's not what its regulations23    say.  They say that you must furnish the agency with a24    bona fide intended use, not a pretextual one, meaning that25    at least as to the use that you're listing to the agency,44                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1234567    Scalia.8you intend to characterize that device in the marketplacein that manner.          QUESTION:  You intend to market it for that use,and there is no allegation here that it was marketed foranything except the approved uses.MR. FISHBEIN:  That's not correct, JusticeQUESTION:  It isn't?910    here and the factual support here indicate that this11    device was never, never marketed for long-bone use.  It12    was only marketed for spinal application, and it was13    marketed -- in fact, the president of AcroMed within a few14    days of this clearance told somebody that this was --15    their application to the FDA was a labeling sleight of16    hand which in no way changes the intended use of the17    product.1819202122232425                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPOMR. FISHBEIN:  The allegation to the complaint          There virtually is fraud conceded here by virtueof the circumstances.  It's an unusual circumstance, Igrant.  There's not too many people that would be thisbrazen, but that's what happened here.          QUESTION:  There is a contest on that point, asto whether it was marketed improperly.  Mr. Geller says itwasn't.  Your cite says it was.MR. FISHBEIN:  It was not marketed properly.  It                  45 1    was -- in fact, it was -- we contend that this fraud did 2    not occur by itself but occurred as part of a deal, or a 3    concocted scheme between Buckman and AcroMed as a two- 4    step process.  First, they couldn't get it on the market 5    as a pedical screw fixation device, which is all it ever 6    was.  So they lied to the FDA, then they got clearance, 7    meaning, it was found substantially equivalent for long- 8    bone use, but they knew they were going to market it the 9    second it got approved for -- not for long-bone use.10    There's not a person in the United States that ever11    received this, as far as we can tell, for long-bone12    application, and --13              QUESTION:  Mr. Fishbein, are there other State14    causes of action that your client could pursue that don't15    raise this problem of having to establish that the FDA16    called it wrong, a failure to warn, or some other kind of17    negligence cause of action?18              MR. FISHBEIN:  The answer to your question,19    Justice O'Connor, is, as to Buckman, no.  As to other20    defendants, yes, but as to other defendants, why would we21    bring Buckman in this if we had other solvent defendants?22    The principal defendant here was AcroMed Corporation.23    AcroMed Corporation was basically insolvent with respect24    to this liability and we ended up settling our claims25    against AcroMed on a limited --46                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  So Buckman is the one that has the 2    assets and therefore you need a different cause of action. 3              MR. FISHBEIN:  They have additional assets, 4    that's correct, and we are attempting to try to recover 5    for our clients all the damages to which they're legally 6    entitled.  I suspect even Buckman does not have sufficient 7    assets, because this fraud and its consequences were so 8    widespread and caused so much injury that there's simply 9    not enough money with the potential culpable defendants.10              QUESTION:  But the cause of action does require11    the jury to decide, in effect to second-guess the FDA?12              MR. FISHBEIN:  I disagree with that, Justice13    O'Connor, and here's why.  The FDA did nothing wrong, or14    nothing that needs to be second-guessed.  They were15    told -- if we look at page 58 of the joint appendix, the16    FDA asked Buckman, what is the intended use of this17    device?  Page 58 is a letter from Buckman back to the FDA,18    because the FDA had reviewed this and seen it was a spinal19    device before.20              Now it's being presented as a long-bone device,21    and Mr. Shlerf of Buckman said, for purposes of this22    510(k), this is a long-bone fixation device, and as a23    long-bone fixation device, the FDA was correct in24    determining that there were predicate devices on the25    market which had the same technical characteristics as47                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this device, and it was okay.          There's nothing about our claim that wouldrequire a jury to say the FDA was wrong.  In fact --          QUESTION:  Well, except section 132 of thecomplaint says, were it not for these fraudulent acts andstatements the FDA would not have issued the 510(k)clearances for the screw for any purpose, the deviceswouldn't have been introduced into interstate commerce,and plaintiff wouldn't have been exposed.          MR. FISHBEIN:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I mean, that looks pretty much likesecond-guessing to me.          MR. FISHBEIN:  Actually, it's enforcing what theFDA had previously determined on two occasions, one ofwhich was about 3 or 4 months before that.  The FDA made aspecific determination that these devices were notsubstantially equivalent for pedical screw use or spinaluse twice, and the consequence of that was that theydidn't belong in the market.          So what we're doing here is simply vindicatingan explicit regulatory determination made to protectpersons in the position of the plaintiff from the kind ofharm that occurred here.          QUESTION:  But you're also something of aninterloper.  I mean, under the Government's view the FDA48                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9has various authorities to follow this thing up and maychoose not to follow it up.          MR. FISHBEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor, butthe Government's authority is in its capacity to protectthe public through the remedies given to it, and mycontention is, and I think --          QUESTION:  Well, the Government's authority isalso to limit those remedies if it so chooses.          MR. FISHBEIN:  I would suggest, Your Honor, thatthe Government has no power to limit the availability ofdamage relief and that Congress did not want it to limitthe availability of damage relief.          QUESTION:  Well, if you say Congress didn'tintend to limit damages you're probably right, but theGovernment -- assuming if Congress felt otherwise it wouldbe true, too.10111213141516171819    that.20              QUESTION:  No, but specifically, assuming what21    you say is right, after the event the FDA finds out about22    this, it says, we want to leave this stuff out there,          MR. FISHBEIN:  Oh, if Congress said no damages?There's no question that Congress has the power to do23    because it's more helpful than it is harmful, and24    therefore we give you a wrist slap, you see, and why are25    they doing that?  Because they want the drug out there to49                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    lower price. 2              Now, you come along and say, I'm going to a 3    jury, and that will make sure it can't be out there. 4              Now, why doesn't this range of remedies give the 5    FDA just the authority that I mentioned, an authority that 6    you'll take away from them if you go to the jury, however 7    meritorious your case might be here? 8              MR. FISHBEIN:  I think, Your Honor, that 9    Silkwood basically answers that question both in terms of10    the majority and the dissent in Silkwood, which said that11    there is an independence here of regulatory restraint and12    damage recovery which can and should and must peacefully13    coexist with one another, so that the FDA, or in that case14    the nuclear regulatory authorities, regulate -- from a15    public regulatory standpoint they do what they do and the16    State courts administer a remedy system which may, in17    fact, have penal aspects to it, because in Silkwood,18    remember, there was an award of punitive damages.  We're19    not asking for that here.20              So I think that the two can peacefully coexist,21    and it's up to the State system applying State rules --22    there are some States that would not allow us to recover23    here, but there are many others that would, and there's --24    I think what Congress made clear in enacting both the25    Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the medical device                                  50                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO8 9101112131415amendments to that act, was that empowering the FDA tohave certain nondamage remedies should not usurp theState's power to provide remedies for people who are hurt.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Fishbein.          MR. FISHBEIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, you have 2 minutes          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Justa few things.          First, in response to Justice Scalia's question,there is no precedent for this cause of action.  Everycourt of appeals, with the exception of the court below,has held that the so-called fraud-on-the-agency claims are1234567    remaining.16    preempted.17              Secondly, I want to address Medtronic, which is18    the centerpiece of the plaintiff's argument here.  This19    case is completely unlike Medtronic, in part for some of20    the reasons Mr. Gornstein was getting into.  Medtronic was21    a garden-variety product liability claim under State law,22    design defect, failure to warn.  There was no requirement23    in Medtronic that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act be24    construed, there was no suggestion that you had to inquire25    into any agency determinations, there was no fraud-on-51                              ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                              1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                              SUITE 400                              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                              (202)289-2260                              (800) FOR DEPO 1    the-agency claim in Medtronic, and there was no claim of 2    implied preemption in Medtronic. 3              In fact, the existence of Medtronic suggests, 4    the decision in Medtronic suggests that the plaintiffs 5    have many common law claims available to them if these 6    products were defective, so it's not a case that the Court 7    was confronted with in Medtronic, where the argument of 8    preemption would have wiped out many preexisting State law 9    claims.  Here, no claim -- the States would not be ousted10    of any claim that would have existed prior to the11    enactment of the medical device amendments in this case.12              Third, I just want to focus for the Court's13    attention at, if you look at page 136 of the joint14    appendix there's a strong suggestion here that what the15    plaintiff's label as fraud on the FDA the irony here is,16    actually was an idea that originated with the FDA to break17    up this one device into its two constituent parts and to18    seek 510(k) approval for each, so the notion that a State19    court years later could conclude this was a fraud on the20    FDA and enter a judgment that would -- might have the21    effect of removing the device from the market is22    completely inconsistent, we think, with Congress' scheme23    here, which is to centralize enforcement authority with24 the FDA.25QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I don't understand one                  52ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.SUITE 400WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005(202)289-2260(800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9thing about your case.          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  I don't want to eat up your time,but do you contend that your client must -- that a bonafide intended use is at least an intended use that youintend to market?  Do you --          MR. GELLER:  No.          QUESTION:  What is bona fide --          MR. GELLER:  No, there's absolutely no10    requirement.111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  You don't even have to intend tomarket it?          MR. GELLER:  You do not have to --          QUESTION:  What does bona fide mean, then?          MR. GELLER:  It's not our -- it's not our word,it's the plaintiff's word.  What you have -- you'reseeking approval to market for a particular -- for aparticular use.  You can't market for some other use, butthere's no requirement under the law that you market forthat use.          Many devices and drugs are on the market --          QUESTION:  Then why do we have a fraud cause ofaction, as opposed to a cause -- on the part of theagency, as opposed to a cause of action for failing toabide by the terms of your regulatory applications?53                        ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                        1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                        SUITE 400                        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                        (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GELLER:  Well, Justice -- if I may answerthe question, Mr. Chief Justice.          Justice Souter in making a 510(k) application,you not only have to provide the intended use, you alsohave to provide many details about the physical ortechnological characteristics of the device.  There may betest results that are presented.  There are many occasionswhere you might actually present fraudulent informationbut it doesn't relate to the intended use.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you.  Thank you,Mr. Geller.
