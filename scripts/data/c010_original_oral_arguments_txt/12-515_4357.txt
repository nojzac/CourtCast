Bay Mills Indian Community.      Mr. Bursch.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCHON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      After Bay Mills' concession on the firstquestion presented, the only issue is whether Bay Millsenjoys blanket immunity from suit when it engages inillegal, off­reservation, commercial conduct.  And theanswer is no, for at least two reasons.      First, it makes no sense that Congressintended States to have a Federal injunctive remedy forillegal gaming on reservation, but no injunctive remedyif that gaming takes place on land that is subject tothe State's exclusive jurisdiction.      Second, a tribe should not have greaterimmunity than foreign nations.  There's no dispute that,if France opened up an illegal business in Michigan,casino or otherwise, it would have no blanket immunity.3Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 on, could you address the jurisdiction question for me?2 I'm not sure why you're here. The only injunction that3 I see was entered on behalf of Little ­­ Little4 Traverse's and not on behalf of the State.5 But ­­ and so, the counts that you're6 arguing about were added after the injunction was7 issued. How do you have jurisdiction to act ­­ to argue8 someone else's injunction?9 MR. BURSCH: That's not quite correct,10 Justice Sotomayor. Originally, this case was filed as11 two separate lawsuits. Michigan was a plaintiff, and12 then the other tribe was a plaintiff in the separate13 case. Those cases were consolidated, and then when the14 motion for injunction was filed, Michigan joined in that15 motion, filed a brief supporting it, and everyone16 proceeded under the assumption that both the tribe and17 the State were asking for the injunction.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That, in fact, is not19 what the district court said. The district court20 explicitly said in its order granting the injunction21 that the State hadn't filed an injunction, hadn't22 intervened, and had only filed supporting papers in23 support of Little Traverse's case.24 I'm a little ­­ I'm very, very confused as I25 look at what the district court said. It explicitly4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 said you weren't part of the order.2 MR. BURSCH: Well, again, they were3 consolidated cases. We were supporting the4 injunction ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think "consolidated"6 can have two meanings and ­­ and ­­ to be heard together7 or to be joined together. I don't think the district8 court understood that this was going to be joined9 together. Why did it say what it did?10 MR. BURSCH: Well, I think it was11 everybody's understanding that these were joined12 together because the parties were pursuing the exact13 same issues. And so then, once this went up to the14 Sixth Circuit, there was no question in the Sixth15 Circuit's mind ­­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn’t you file an17 injunction ­­ why does your brief say that you filed it18 only in support of Little Traverse and not on your own19 behalf?20 MR. BURSCH: Because, once the cases were21 consolidated ­­ and at that point, we were even using22 the same docket entries, there was already a motion on23 file, so there was no need to have a second motion. It24 was clear to everyone that the State of Michigan and the25 tribe were both pursuing that injunctive relief5Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425together.  And that's exactly the way the Sixth Circuittreated it.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'll ask ­­ I'll ask your opposition, but I don't see why the district court would have made the point it did, if it believed that it was dealing with both of you as parties.MR. BURSCH: Well, everyone has proceeded up the chain, including in the Sixth Circuit opinion, on the assumption that it was consolidated, that Michigan was requesting an injunction and, in fact, that kind of a procedural objection has never been raised by anybody, certainly not at the petition stage.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but we have to ­­ we have to, if we're not sure, raise any jurisdictional issue.MR. BURSCH: Sure. But I think it was eminently clear to the Sixth Circuit, if you read its opinion ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it wasn't eminently clear to the district court who entered the order.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a jurisdictional objection or a procedural one?MR. BURSCH: Your Honor, it's a procedural objection. The only jurisdictional question in this6Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 case is whether there's Federal question jurisdiction2 under 1331, which has been conceded, and the United3 States agrees to that, and so I'm not going to spend my4 time on that. Where I would like to spend my time is on5 the scope of tribal immunity.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that, can7 you tell ­­ tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the8 dispute resolution means that the compact provided? The9 compact said, if there's a dispute, it'll be decided by10 arbitration. Michigan bypassed that.11 MR. BURSCH: That's correct, Justice12 Ginsburg, and there were two reasons for that. The13 first is that that provision was only discretionary, as14 we explain in our reply brief. But even more important,15 the compact also makes clear that the tribe did not16 waive its sovereign immunity for purposes of17 arbitration.18 So if we had gone to arbitration and19 prevailed, if the arbitrator had reached the same result20 as the Federal government did, as to the status of these21 lands being not Indian lands, then ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. Could you23 explain that? Because I thought that the purpose ­­24 that the whole point of the C&L Enterprises case is to25 say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that2 proceeding. Are you saying that there was something3 special in this agreement?4 MR. BURSCH: I am, Justice Kagan, and I'm5 glad you brought up C&L because, there, you had a6 construction contract where there was invocation of an7 arbitration remedy and it didn't specifically preserve8 tribal immunity.9 Here, we have the exact opposite. In the10 same paragraph 7 of the compact where we have the11 arbitration provision, the tribe and the State agree12 that, notwithstanding the arbitration provision, both13 parties' sovereign immunity is not waived and that14 it's ­­ it's preserved.15 So, if we took a successful arbitration16 judgment and then tried to reduce that to a Federal17 judgment in court, they would have asserted immunity and18 we would be in the exact same procedural posture that we19 are right now, talking about the scope of tribal20 immunity involving illegal off­reservation gaming.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why ­­ why did ­­22 along the same lines, why did you assert sovereign23 immunity as a defense when the tribe brought a24 declaratory judgment action concerning the status of25 those lands?8Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BURSCH: Because, again, it wouldn't have done any good for us to stipulate to jurisdiction on the tribe's claim about the status of the lands because simply having a declaratory judgment wouldn't have given us any relief. We would have had to file a counterclaim for injunctive relief and the tribe,undoubtedly, would have filed ­­ or              would haveasserted a tribal immunity there as well.      So, really, all roads lead to tribalimmunity, no matter how ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All roads lead to oneissue, I think.  If you had gotten a declaratoryjudgment, they would have had to stop their gamingactivity.MR. BURSCH: No ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:gotten their property; isn't that what this suit isabout, you trying to take over the ­­ the casino?MR. BURSCH: No, we don't want to take over the casino. We want to stop illegal gaming on lands, subject to Michigan's exclusive jurisdiction.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why not Ex Parte Young? You point to one or two cases in the lower courts that suggest there not might be Ex Parte Young jurisdiction, but those cases are distinguishable. So9Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyBut you wouldn't have1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425why not go after just the officials?MR. BURSCH: Two responses to that, Justicethat.MR. BURSCH:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Well, it's not clear ­­       You would have gottenOfficial￼Sotomayor, one, kind of a practical considerationthen one a broader federalism principle that I ­­want to emphasize.  The narrow practical point isEx Parte Young is an imperfect remedy for lots ofreasons, as we express in the brief.andthat Ithat      It's well settled that you can't getspecific performance on the contract, you can't enforcea State law in Federal court, you can't get money orseize assets in an Ex Parte Young action.  And that'swhy lower courts ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But all you wanted to do was stop them from doing the gaming casino.      MR. BURSCH:that we would be able to get that relief, based on thelower court holdings.      Now, the bigger sovereignty point is that,if a foreign country, if France or Haiti came in andopened the same casino, the State would have the fullpanoply of remedies available to it.  And it should havethose remedies because any additional immunity you give10It's not clear at all to usAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to the tribe, when it's engaging in illegal conduct on2 lands subject to Michigan's exclusive jurisdiction, you3 are necessarily taking away from the sovereign authority4 of the State of Michigan. That's a lesser remedy.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's ­­ all that ­­ the6 enigma that you pointed out ­­ or the anomaly is ­­ is7 certainly clear. But what about Kiowa? This Court8 seemed to say that the tribe is immune on reservation,9 off reservation, commercial activity, government10 activity, it is immune, blanket immunity.11 So how can you prevail without having this12 Court modify Kiowa.13 MR. BURSCH: Here's how, Justice Ginsburg:14 Because Kiowa involved a private party plaintiff. It15 did not involve a sovereign State. And this Court has16 stated, repeatedly, that States are different. We are17 constitutional sovereigns, and so we aren't treated like18 ordinary business plaintiffs.19 In that case, the fact that the plaintiff20 could not enforce his promissory note did not directly21 implicate a State police power. Here ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best23 authority ­­ what's your best case for that proposition?24 MR. BURSCH: For the proposition that States25 are different?11Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:lesser burden when they're faced with a sovereignimmunity defense?MR. BURSCH: I wouldn't say that it's a lesser burden, but I think you need to analyze this as a zero sum gain, that when you're talking about activity taking place on sovereign State land and you're not allowing the State to have its whole panoply of remedies, that you've taken away an attribute of sovereignty that ­­ that would have existed.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best case for that?MR. BURSCH: I would basically just cite all of the cases this Court has decided over the last quarter century involving the ADA, the ADEA, where this Court has consistently recognized that States are different. Sovereigns ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: You know, that's ­­ that's a big reading assignment.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: The question is this: Three situations ­­ I think it's the same question Justice Kennedy was driving at.

BURSCH:And, Justice Kennedy, hopefully, this will reduce thereading assignment.      The case that says we can sue France isAlfred Dunhill, which was this Court's decision thatfirst recognized the commercial distinction for foreignnation immunity.  Now ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Now, was that a statute or common law?MR. BURSCH: That was common law, common law development in Alfred Dunhill.      Now, shortly after that, Congress did enactthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which essentiallycodified this Court's common law rule, and once that13    Two, California opens up aYes.    Three, an Indian tribeCorrect.    Now, what is it that sayscasino is located can suesays it can sue California?What is it that says it can sueThank you, Justice Breyer.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9111213141516171819202122232425happens, then the common law development ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. California?MR. BURSCH: So California, the case isNevada v. Hall in which ­­ this case said that a State'ssovereign immunity from suit does not extend when it'sgot actors in another State.  There, Nevada's agent wasacting in California, and the Court held that that actorcould be liable for suit in California.JUSTICE BREYER: 10 law.

BURSCH:or Kiowa did not involve a State as sovereign.  Itinvolved a private business plaintiff, and it'sdistinguishable on that basis.      And if you disagree with me and you thinkthat sovereign States should be treated the same way asprivate party plaintiffs, then we would ask you tooverrule that part of Kiowa which suggested that tribescan engage in illegal commercial conduct on land subjectto exclusive State jurisdiction without any ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: But I think this is what Justice Kennedy was ­­ was getting at, when he asked you14MR.

BURSCH: This Court's case that would suggest that is the Oklahoma Tax Commission case because that was a case where a State, not exercising a police power, but one of its lesser powers, the power of taxation, was attempting to tax cigarettes that were being sold on Indian trust land by a tribe.      And in that case, the Court acknowledgedthat, even on trust lands ­­ so this isn't on landthat's subject to State exclusive jurisdiction, that theState would be able to tax those cigarettes being soldto non­tribal members.

BURSCH: Yes.MR. BURSCH: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: And I had assumed ­­ but maybe I was wrong to assume ­­ that when I read those cases, I will see, although a State can sue France, although Nevada can sue California, a private individual could not. Am I going to find that when I read those two cases?MR. BURSCH: Well ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I think the answer to Justice Kagan is I'm not going to find it. So we're looking for authority, back to Justice Kennedy, that will support your proposition that the State could sue France, Nevada could sue California, but a private individual could not.MR. BURSCH: I think the Oklahoma Tax Commission case would be the closest because, even if you had a private individual who was trying to sue a tribe for conduct that was taking place on trust land, they would not be able to do it. What ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what you're asking us to do then, if the answer is what I now think you're16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 saying, is to say it's awfully complicated that,2 although a State could sue an Indian tribe for something3 that is outside the reservation, the State ­­ it's so4 complicated that I'd like some good authority for it,5 because a private person couldn't, but a State could6 sue, and it's only in certain places.7 MR. BURSCH: Well, there ­­ there's lots of8 places that you could draw the line in this case.9 JUSTICE BREYER: How about drawing the line10 with Kiowa?11 MR. BURSCH: Here's what I'm going to12 suggest: Nine justices in Kiowa, both the majority and13 the dissent, recognized that there were substantial14 issues with applying tribal immunity on or off15 reservation in the commercial context.16 This Court had done away with that for17 foreign nations in Alfred Dunhill. It decided to give18 Congress one more chance in ­­ in Kiowa, but ­­ but left19 the question open for further common law development.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But once the Congress21 didn't respond, the majority opinion in Kiowa ­­ I don't22 know whether it's "Kiowa" or "Kiowa" ­­ said ­­ you23 know, this is an unfortunate result, but Congress can do24 something about it. Well, now Congress hasn't done25 anything about it, and you are asking this Court,17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 essentially, to modify the ­­ that precedent.2 MR. BURSCH: I am. I mean, I don't think3 you need to modify it. I think you could distinguish it4 based on the fact that there's a private party plaintiff5 there. But if you feel otherwise, that you need to6 modify it in order to rule in our favor, it's ­­ it's7 totally within your power.8 As we explained, at length in the context of9 foreign nation sovereign immunity, it's a body of common10 law that this Court is free to modify as appropriate.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is the ­­ why is12 that important? Why is the issue that you've brought13 before us important? In addition to the possibility of14 an Ex Parte Young action, you could certainly arrest15 people who are running what you believe is an illegal16 casino in the State, can't you?17 MR. BURSCH: Well, there are ­­ there are at18 least two reasons why that is also an imperfect remedy.19 The most obvious one is that it creates exactly the kind20 of inter­sovereign conflict that Congress was trying to21 avoid when it allowed, under IGRA, for States to get22 injunctions, even for on­reservation conduct.23 JUSTICE ALITO: But, in addition to that,24 couldn't you have stopped this before it even started by25 insisting in the compact that the tribe waive sovereign18Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE ALITO:Well, that's a moreOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425immunity?MR. BURSCH: Well, that's ­­ that's a greatquestion, and the answer to that is twofold.  First,when the compact was negotiated back in 1993, this Courthad not decided Kiowa.  That came five years later in1998.  And so Congress and the States reasonably assumedat that time that, if a tribe was engaged in illegalcommercial conduct off reservation, that, of course, aState would have the ability ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Going forward then ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why couldn't you atleast ­­ I think this is Justice Alito's question. I don't mean to interrupt. But why couldn't you say that it's a matter of compact interpretation whether these are Indian lands?MR. BURSCH: A matter of compact interpretation whether these are Indian lands?JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. So you go to Federal court to interpret the contract. There's no ­­ immunity has been waived, and you say these are not Indian lands. I think that's what Justice Alito was asking. I didn't mean to interrupt him.MR. BURSCH: I ­­ I didn't get quite the same question from Justice Alito.19Alderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE ALITO:      MR.

BURSCH: Right. Well, if I can finish answering Justice Alito's question. You asked why we can't just go in and arrest. And ­­ and the second answer to that, besides the ­­ the conflict of going in with armed police guards and arresting tribal officials and hauling them off to county jail, which Congress tried to avoid when it enacted IGRA in the first place, it's what everybody wanted.      Again, it's limiting State sovereignty ­­MR.

So the State says, fine, if you want to do that, you have to waive20Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sovereign immunity?MR. BURSCH: Well, we had a compact in placein 1993 that limited their casinos, so that thiswouldn't happen.  Going forward ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I ­­ but I mean, when will ­­ when will this compact expire?MR. BURSCH: Right. Let me give you a very practical answer to that question. This compact, in 1993, had a 20­year term on it. And so it essentially expired at the end of ­­ of November, just a few days ago, although it has an evergreen clause that allows it to continue while the parties try to negotiate a new compact.      And, as you would imagine, the very firstthing Michigan asked for in its proposed amended compactwas to waive tribal sovereign immunity to deal withissues like this.  And, unsurprisingly, the tribe said,we're really not interested in that; we kind of like theway the sovereignty issue is preserved in the existingcompact.      Now, the question about whether this has animpact beyond tribal gaming, the answer is ­­JUSTICE ALITO:MR. BURSCH: Sure.JUSTICE ALITO:So the compact has expired,Official￼21Alderson Reporting CompanyIf I could just pursue that?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and there's ­­ so then how can they operate the casino?      MR.

BURSCH: No, it's not determined by the compact. It would be determined as a matter of Federal law. That's the Federal question in this case. And ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you a question?JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the compact refers to Indian lands. Surely, you could take the position that there is a waiver of immunity to determine whether or not these are Indian lands under the compact.MR. BURSCH: I don't think we could, respectfully, Justice Kennedy, because the compact does not envision that the tribe has waived immunity for any purposes. If you look at Section 7 of the compact, it's ­­ it's really unequivocal about the tribe not waiving immunity.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Could I ask you a22Alderson Reporting CompanyMR.

If these are Indianlands, then it's permissible under IGRA and under thecompact for them to have and operate a casino.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. The issue ofwhat constitutes Indian lands is between the Federalgovernment and the Indians, pursuant to the Land TrustSettlement, correct?MR. BURSCH: I disagree with that because ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I know you do, and I know why you do. But ­­ but what defines the lands is the Settlement Trust, correct?MR. BURSCH: Federal court interpretation of the Michigan Indian Land Claims Settlement Act, yes, would determine the status of these lands. The reason why it's not just between the tribe and the Federal government is because Michigan has a huge interest in having lands that are currently under its exclusive23Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sovereign jurisdiction be determined to be Indianlands ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Put ­­ put this aside of gambling. Let's assume that it was just their buying this land.MR. BURSCH: Yes.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:the buying of this land or unravelled it?  Didn't wehave a recent decision that said no?Official￼      MR. BURSCH:the Patchak case ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:      MR. BURSCH:plaintiff could, quite a bit after the fact, file alawsuit to unravel that transaction, if the lands werenot eligible for Indian gaming, if I'm remembering theholding correctly.  And ­­ and Michigan does have asubstantial interest, not just in the gaming context.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, wouldn't you have had to follow ­­ if you were going to object to this land being taken into the land trust, wouldn't you have had to follow the administrative process?MR. BURSCH: We would, but the land has never been taken in trust. Even the Federal government, the National Indian Gaming Commission, has concluded24Could you have stoppedIf you're referring to the ­­       Yes.In that case, you held that theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that these are not Indian lands for purposes of the2 Settlement Act. And so we never got to the point where3 they got in Patchak, where they went through the4 administrative process to take the lands in trust.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, if ­­ if I could6 assume that this is not Indian lands and just ask why7 you need for sovereign immunity to go away? And ­­ so8 you have the ability to arrest people. You have the9 ability to bring Ex Parte Young actions.10 Presumably, you have the ability on11 non­Indian lands simply to shut down a casino.12 Presumably, you have the ability on non­Indian lands to13 condition any licensing of the casino on whatever you14 want.15 I guess the question is: On non­Indian16 lands, you have a thousand ways to stop a casino that17 you don't want. Why do you need the abrogation of18 sovereign immunity?19 MR. BURSCH: Because we tried to take the20 least intrusive means necessary to stop the casino, to21 not go in with the billy clubs and the guns and to22 arrest tribal members, but to ask for a Federal civil23 injunction.24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think that all of25 our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not2 nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity. And so you can3 say, well ­­ you know, that would be less intrusive than4 all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits,5 arresting people, just ­­ you know, conditioning the ­­6 a license, stopping the casino from operating.7 But ­­ you know, I suspect that the8 sovereign tribe here would say that, no, it's ­­ it's an9 affront to their sovereignty to take ­­ to strip them of10 sovereign immunity, and ­­ and none of these other11 options that you have are that.12 MR. BURSCH: Right. But, again, arresting13 the other sovereign's officers is, with all respect, not14 respectful to the tribe, which is why that's the course15 we've pursued. And the change we're asking for here is16 not as big as the tribe makes it seem because, in IGRA,17 Section 2710, we have the ability to get an injunction18 to stop illegal gaming taking place on reservation.19 And so it's really not that big a leap to20 say, if they're engaging in illegal gaming off21 reservation, likewise, there, we should be able to get22 the least intrusive remedy, the one that is most23 respectful of the tribe's sovereignty.24 And, frankly, we're kind of surprised that25 the United States would take the position that we're26Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425better off going in and arresting or suing individualofficers because that's not the way sovereigns aresupposed to interact.      And it would be a big deal if France openedup a casino in Michigan and, rather than seeking a civilinjunction, we tried to arrest the French president andthrow them in a Michigan County jail.JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, is ­­ is it not correct that the people who work in these casinos are just employees? They have no other connection with the tribe? Am I wrong on that?MR. BURSCH: I believe some of the employees are tribal members, some are not. And we cite a number of cases in our reply brief where tribal immunity has been extended to tribal employees whether they are members of the tribe or not.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you prosecute people who frequent this illegal casino?MR. BURSCH: Sue Michigan citizens?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.MR. BURSCH: Yes, we could do that. But ­­you know, again, I want you to understand the scope ofthe invasion of the State's sovereignty here.  If anyother entity, foreign nation, another State, anindividual, set up an illegal business, whether it's27Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 prostitution, underage drinking, gaming, you name it, we2 would have the full panoply of State civil and criminal3 regulatory remedies available to us and could pick the4 most appropriate one.5 And, somehow, because this is a tribe, even6 though they are operating on Michigan's land, where we7 have exclusive regulatory jurisdiction, somehow, all8 those remedies are circumscribed to imperfect remedies,9 like Ex parte Young, which may or may not be successful,10 or arresting our own citizens, and that's not respecting11 the constitutional sovereign that Michigan represents in12 this case.13 And to get back to a question a number of14 you had about the implications of this aside from15 gaming, this happens in all kinds of other contexts off16 reservation. You just had a case in 2011 involving the17 Oneida tribe in New York, where they failed to pay their18 property taxes in New York. And so the State moved in19 to foreclose for nonpayment of taxes those20 off­reservation properties.21 And the Second Circuit, interpreting Kiowa,22 reluctantly concluded that the State did not have23 ability to enforce by foreclosing on that property24 because the tribe had immunity and invited this Court to25 review Kiowa. This Court granted cert. Eventually,28Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE SCALIA:So you think CongressOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cert was dismissed because the tribe waived immunity,and they were able to go forward and pursue that remedy.      But ­­ you know, whether it's in the taxcontext, whether it's the gaming context, whether it'sthe criminal context ­­ you know, the amici briefs ofOklahoma and Alabama are replete with the issues thatthey are having as sovereigns in running up against thetribal sovereign immunity when it comes to thesecontexts.      If there are no further questions, I willreserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Katyal.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYALON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      I would like to begin where my friend didnot, with the text of the statute.  Congress enactedSubsection (A)(ii), like the rest of IGRA, to addressgaming solely on Indian lands.  In fact, Congress usedthat phrase "on Indian lands" a whopping 24 times inIGRA.  By contrast, IGRA says not a word aboutoff­Indian­lands activity.29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 really wanted the States to have power to stop illegal2 gambling on Indian lands, but not to have the power to3 stop illegal gaming on State lands? Is that ­­ is that4 the law you think Congress wrote?5 MR. KATYAL:6 say first of all ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA:8 a ­­ such a disposition?9 MR. KATYAL:I do think so, and if I could    Why would anybody want suchTwo reasons, Your Honor, why I 10 think Congress made the choice they did. But, even11 before that, I don't think that's the proper inquiry for12 this Court. The proper inquiry for this Court, as C&L13 and other cases have said, is it requires an unequivocal14 expression of purpose of Congress before tribal immunity15 is abrogated, and we don't get into this kind of16 question of what Congress might have thought, which17 creates a guessing game.18 But, just to answer your question, why would19 Congress have thought that ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you think that rule21 would apply even when, at the time the statute in22 question was enacted, there was no belief that there was23 tribal immunity on State24 MR. KATYAL:25 friend on the other sidelands?Well, Your Honor, I know myhas said that.  That is just30Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425flatly wrong.  Puyallup, in 1977, Your Honor, preciselysaid that it involved both on­ and off­reservationactivity, it was commercial activity, it was fishing,and this Court said that tribal immunity protectedagainst that.      And so ­­ so I do think ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was just on reservation. You think that was off reservation as well?MR. KATYAL: It is. At page 167, Your Honor, it says that the injunction was both on and off reservation. And then, in Kiowa, at page 754, this Court made clear that that's how it read ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Kiowa was later, of course.MR. KATYAL: Of course, but I think that Congress, in enacting IGRA in 1988, certainly was under the same set of assumptions as this Court in 19 ­­ in the Kiowa ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You think they read Puyallup that closely?MR. KATYAL: I ­­ well, I think it's several places in Puyallup, and certainly, that's what this Court in Kiowa said.JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.MR. KATYAL:And I do think the text is the31Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 best guide to what Congress wanted, and the text uses2 "on Indian lands" 24 times. And the reason for that,3 the reason why there's not an absurdity, is twofold:4 First, Congress, in IGRA, was reacting to this Court's5 decision in Cabazon the year earlier, which had ousted6 State court ­­ State regulatory jurisdiction entirely7 from on­Indian­lands activity, so it changed the game8 entirely.9 Cabazon did nothing with respect to10 off­Indian­lands activity. It left entirely intact all11 the remedies we've been talking about, Justice Alito's12 remedy about criminal sanctions ­­13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You agree with that, that14 they could ­­ the State could go in and arrest all the15 customers that are gambling there? Could it seize the16 slot machines?17 MR. KATYAL: Well, it certainly could arrest18 the customers, the employees, and so on. And that's why19 we would not operate this casino without a square20 ruling. It is shuttered, Justice Alito, right now,21 because we need a square ruling that says this is22 on­Indian­lands activity. And we would like that ­­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't24 it ­­ You don't have a square ruling, so I want to make25 clear, because both you and the Solicitor General have32Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 suggested this as an option: You think it is all right2 for the State to go in and arrest every employee,3 management ­­ you know, labor, who is participating in4 this casino and subject them to criminal sanctions,5 civil penalties and an injunction. You have got no6 problem with that?7 MR. KATYAL: We think that that's a8 consequence of tribal immunity, that when you ­­ when9 they are seeking relief qua tribe, that's a different10 thing, and that's, I think, a standard principle ­­11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You, as a tribe ­­12 you, as a tribe, would have no objection to that action?13 MR. KATYAL: Well, Your Honor, I think, if14 that sort of circumstance unfolded, we might say let's15 try and figure out a different way to deal with that.16 First, of course, the most primary way is the compact17 itself, and many compacts, for example, have arbitration18 clauses ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, you20 could suggest different ways, and the State could tell21 you ­­ you know, go fly a kite, we are prosecuting these22 people. And you'd have no objection to that?23 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. We are not24 trying to say that we want to evade the law. We25 ruling ­­ a definitive ruling. We believe, very33Alderson Reporting Companyhere, want aOfficial￼1 squarely, that this is on­Indian­lands activity.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. What about Ex3 Parte Young? Are you willing to waive the tribe's4 sovereign immunity in an Ex Parte Young action?5 Because, in your opposition to the complaint in this6 case, you raised sovereign immunity as an objection to7 the Ex Parte Young ­­8 MR. KATYAL: Sure. Sure. As part in the9 district court, as part of ordinary ­­ as part of10 ordinary litigation, we said that Ex Parte Young wasn't11 applicable. But we do think ­­ and our brief in12 opposition says this, our merits brief says this, the13 United States' brief says this, that Ex Parte Young14 actions are available against tribes, just as ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just are16 available; that you would not assert sovereign immunity17 if they brought an Ex Parte Young action.18 MR. KATYAL: Well, Your Honor, we would not19 assert it to the limits of Ex Parte Young. So, for20 example, Ex Parte Young doesn't ­­ doesn't permit21 reaching into the State coffers, and here, Count 5 of22 the complaint tries to reach into the tribe's coffers.23 So we do think that that type of Ex Parte Young ­­ that24 is not permitted by Ex Parte Young, and that would be25 impermissible.34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 If I could return to the second reason why I2 think what Congress did wasn't ­­ wasn't ­­ you know,3 creating any sort of anomaly like my friend says, the4 reason is this: All IGRA did in (A)(ii) is empower5 compacts. It didn't abrogate immunity by itself6 directly; it requires the tribe to affirmatively buy7 into the idea of State law applying on the reservation.8 So if we could, just imagine a casino,9 Justice Scalia, opened blatantly on a reservation, a10 casino without a compact that was absolutely illegal.11 We will call it "Casino Red." (A)(ii) would not12 abrogate immunity in that circumstance. The State would13 have no remedy.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought the statute says15 that there is Federal court jurisdiction over any cause16 of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin17 gaming activity that is conducted in violation of the18 compact.19 MR. KATYAL: Yeah, on Indian lands, exactly.20 And so my example of the casino here would be ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why couldn't this ­­22 MR. KATYAL: If there is no compact,23 Justice Kennedy, there is no abrogation. And so what24 (A)(ii) does is it empowers the tribe and the compact,25 and it requires the tribe affirmatively to come in. And35Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE SCALIA:But he says that, if theyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that's why, off Indian land, there is standard tribalimmunity because the tribe hasn't said anything one wayor the other.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you don't think that 1166 abrogates the immunity, which provides that, for purposes of Federal law, all State laws are applicable?MR. KATYAL: Yeah, not at all, Your Honor. All 1166 does is bring Federal ­­ that's about Federal enforcement, not at all about State enforcement. Indeed, Michigan's own position and Michigan's supreme court said 1166 does says nothing with respect to States ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you do not take the position that this casino in this case is part of a compact?MR. KATYAL: Which casino?JUSTICE KENNEDY: The casino in this case, in your view, is not subject to any ­­ is not covered by any compact?MR. KATYAL: No, we do. We think that the proper remedy here, if they had an objection, would have been to arbitrate and say this is not Indian lands. Petition Appendix 77A and 78A lay out the terms of the compact and what gaming is allowed.36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 arbitrated, when they tried to enforce the arbitral2 judgment, you would assert sovereign immunity.3 MR. KATYAL: Well, two responses to that,4 Your Honor. First, of course, that is the remedy they5 agreed to in the compact itself, and, of course, they6 should try. And second ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's not an8 answer.9 MR. KATYAL: Well, it is an answer in the10 sense that, Your Honor, had they asked we ­­ and I can11 tell you I've discussed this with the tribe ­­ that they12 would, of course, not ­­ they would, of course, not13 assert sovereign immunity to enforce the arbitration14 agreement. We have ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you win in an16 arbitration when the gaming commission has said it's not17 Indian lands? I mean, I actually am not sure that the18 ruling of the district court was right on this, okay?19 But putting my own beliefs ­­ or questions about that20 ruling, how do you win if the Federal government has21 said it's not Indian lands?22 MR. KATYAL: Well, we think that that isn't23 a final decision and is wrong for any number of reasons24 on the merits that ­­ you know, laid out in the Joint25 Appendix, and so we do think that would be the argument37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that we would make to the arbitration board. That2 should have been the remedy ­­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But how does the4 arbitration board change the mind of the gaming5 commission? Aren't they the final deciders of whether6 this is trust land or not?7 MR. KATYAL: Well ­­ no, I think that ­­ I8 think that that isn't, itself, a final decision, and9 there are any number of mechanisms that may be available10 to try and get the issue properly teed up to the NIGC.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how an12 arbitration works. The Federal government has a very13 keen interest in whether this is Indian land or not.14 And the arbitrator is going to decide that in a way15 that's going to bind anybody?16 MR. KATYAL: Well, it would bind, I think,17 the parties before it, and that's what the parties18 agreed to. In many compacts ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ongoing, as far20 as the tribe and the State is concerned, they proceed21 from then on as if this is Indian lands, even though the22 Federal government is saying, no, it's not.23 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that we would24 still have to persuade the Federal government in one25 way, shape, or form because of the NIGC's authority in38Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this area, so I think that's two separate questions. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. So thearbitration doesn't get ­­ so the arbitration doesn'tget you anywhere at all.MR. KATYAL: Well, it at least resolves the issue with respect to Michigan. Our central point here is that there's lots of different ways to deal with this question, including the question you asked earlier, the declaratory judgment action, which we brought against Michigan. There's lots of ways to resolve the underlying Indian lands question.      The last thing I think this Court needs todo is entirely change the rules of the game with respectto tribal immunity.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so we understand ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be the big ­­ what would be the big change, other than modifying Kiowa, which is a divided opinion, and was dealing with a money claim. It wasn't dealing with injunctive relief.MR. KATYAL: Well, certainly, this Court's decision in Puyallup, as well as Oklahoma ­­ Oklahoma Tax Commission, both did deal with injunctive relief, and both were against States, to deal with his argument.      Now, he has said ­­ my friend on the other39Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 side has said, we'll look to the foreign sovereign2 immunity context, and that's what's giving him his3 reason for saying that it wouldn't be such a big change,4 and we think that's wrong for two reasons.5 Number one, Kiowa itself, at page 759, dealt6 with this and said that it was the political branches7 that led the change on commercial immunity, not this8 Court. And, number two, my friend has quoted Alfred9 Dunhill, and I think that everything ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But – Mr. Katyal, is that11 right? The distinction between commercial and12 governmental, it was court made in the first instance,13 and then the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act codified14 law that was court made. So it was the courts that made15 the distinction between acting in a commercial capacity16 and acting in a governmental capacity.17 MR. KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, the majority18 of Kiowa, on page 759, responds to that and says that it19 was actually the political branches that led with the ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but he was wrong on21 that, apparently, if that's what he says. He was wrong,22 that, if we look at the cases, what we will see is it23 was the courts that said there's a common law abrogation24 of France's sovereign immunity, when they go into25 business in downtown Iowa somewhere.40Alderson Reporting Company17 don't 1819 about20 State21command a majority of the Court.They're about not commercial ­­ they're notforeign sovereign immunity.  They are about activeimmunity.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. What about theOfficial￼1 MR. KATYAL: And Justice Breyer ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER: The same thing ­­ same3 thing with the State, he says in Nevada and California,4 and then he says it would be totally anomalous to think5 that an Indian tribe could go into downtown Des Moines6 and open up a clearly illegal business, and you could7 sue France ­­ the State, which was not Kiowa ­­ they8 could sue ­­ France could ­­ the State could sue France,9 it could sue California, but it couldn't sue the Indian10 tribe.11 MR. KATYAL: Justice Breyer, we would12 encourage the Court to look at precisely the case he is13 citing for this proposition, which is Alfred Dunhill,14 because, as the case was vigorously argued by a Justice15 Department attorney, and what ­­ and what my friend16 doesn't tell you is that the pages he is citing actually22 California and Nevada?23 MR. KATYAL: In the California v. Nevada, I24 think this Court dealt with in Kiowa itself because in25 Kiowa ­­ because that's about basically the State ­­41Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE BREYER:it Kiowa? ­­ is about individuals who are not the State.MR. KATYAL: Yes, exactly. But I think this Court has recognized in Blatchford and in Kiowa that, in Nevada v. Hall situations, which is what the dissent in Kiowa raised and what my friend is trying to resuscitate, that's a difference in circumstance because there was a mutuality of concession.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll look at those with care. But, now, assuming you are right on that, is the question in front of us, on the assumption that these are Indian lands, does the Indian tribe have sovereign immunity? Is that the question you want answered?      MR. KATYAL:      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. KATYAL:lands, yes, there is ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:We think that ­­    Yes or no?­­ that if they are on IndianOfficial￼                             Do you want us to say onthat assumption ­­ now, on that assumption, I look at iand number ii under a, 7(a), and a quick reading of themsuggests to me that they're in parallel, that the Indiantribe can sue the State when the State won't opennegotiations, and the State or an Indian tribe can suethe Indian tribe when the Indian tribe refuses to follow42Alderson Reporting CompanyNow, Kiowa is about ­­ isOfficial￼1 the compact.2 Now, what's your answer to that?3 MR. KATYAL: When it's on Indian lands,4 exactly.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know, but you said6 to decide this on the assumption that it's on Indian7 lands. If I make that assumption and then I look over8 and read i and ii, it sounds as if, as I said, i, the9 tribe can sue the State to get the compact; ii, the10 State can sue the tribe when it violates the compact.11 MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, I may have12 misunderstood your earlier question, but, certainly, our13 position is that you can look to our answer to determine14 whether or not there is tribal immunity in the case.15 That is not something my friend has argued. It's16 outside of the questions presented entirely, which both17 proceed on the assumption that this is off of Indian18 lands.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, for purposes of20 sovereign immunity, does it make any difference that you21 have at least a colorable claim that this is on Indian22 lands?23 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that it ­­ I ­­ I24 don't think it matters either way. Our position is one25 way or the other.43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112   trying to get what question I'm supposed to answer.  If13   I'm supposed to answer the sovereign immunity question14   on the assumption that these are Indian lands, contrary15   to what was decided below, I might get one answer.  But16   if I'm ­­ supposed to do it on the assumption that17   they're not Indian lands, I might get a different18 answer. What assumption am I supposed to make?19 MR. KATYAL: The latter, Your Honor, for two 20 reasons. Number one, that's what the questions21   presented say; and number two, one of the most venerable22   precedence of this Court is the ­­ is Justice Holmes'23   opinion in Kohler Die ­­ which says you don't look to our answer to24   determine ­­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens if you44JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. So if your ­­ if your client or another tribe just decided to go into the gaming business all over the country and began opening casinos in places that clearly are not Indian lands, you still would have sovereign immunity.MR.

But, if the20 Federal government has said it's not Indian lands,21 that's what I'm asking.22 MR. KATYAL: Right.

I think that13 that's ­­ I think that that's underlying some of this,14 absolutely.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe that's an important16 difference. I mean, maybe we should give the State the17 ability to collect damages.18 MR. KATYAL: Well ­­ well, I certainly would19 disagree with the idea that you, the Court, should. I20 think the proper response would be exactly what this21 Court said in Kiowa, which is, if there's a dispute22 about the contours of immunity, commercial, off land,23 State is plaintiff, all of that, those are all things24 that Congress is well­suited for dealing with.46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 to say that when this is the Court ­­ the doctrine of2 tribal immunity is something that was announced by this3 Court. Congress never passed a law that said the tribes4 have immunity. It's all this Court. And then you say,5 what this Court made, only Congress can unmake. That6 seems strange to me.7 MR. KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, that was8 precisely the argument that was made in Kiowa, was9 accepted by the dissent in Kiowa. But what the majority10 said is, really, Congress is best able to balance the11 rights, remedies, and reliance interests on the parties.12 And I'd note, picking up on your question to my friend13 earlier, that, after Kiowa, Congress hasn't been silent.14 Congress has reaffirmed tribal immunity in15 the Patriot Act extension in 2005 and the SIGR Act of16 2009. They've cut it back in the Arizona Water Act and17 the Zuni Acts of 2003.

We are going to hear fromMr. Kneedler first.      (Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He might have something you would like to respond to.      Mr. Kneedler.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,       SUPPORTING the RESPONDENTSMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:    I would like to respond, at the outset, to thesuggestion that this Court might modify the categoricalrule in Kiowa that an Indian tribe is subject to suitonly if Congress unequivocally consents in order toallow suits by States.      First of all, both Puyallup and Pottawatomiwere suits by States for prospective injunctive relief,and the Court found them barred.  Puyallup was offreservation.      But there's another point that I think tiesin with the questions about foreign sovereign immunity.In this Court's decision in Blatchford, the Court held50Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that the State of Alaska could not be sued by an Indian2 tribe complaining about the distribution of State ­­3 some State funds in Alaska, which does not have Indian4 country. The Court held that the suit was barred.5 In doing so, the Court recognized that the6 Eleventh Amendment had originally been understood to bar7 suits only by individuals. But relying on this Court's8 decision in Principality of Monaco, the Court said that9 the Eleventh Amendment also barred suits by foreign10 sovereigns.11 And the Court's rationale in Principality of12 Monaco was that foreign sovereigns were not parties to13 the convention. There was no reciprocal abrogation of14 immunity between foreign sovereigns and States. And, in15 fact, the Court specifically pointed out that the State16 of Mississippi could not sue Monaco, and, in this case,17 Monaco could not sue Mississippi.18 The Court applied that very same reasoning19 in Blatchford to an Indian tribe. The Court said, we20 have held in the past that Indian tribes may not be21 sued. And they cited Puyallup, which was a suit by a22 State. And the Court said, logically, it follows that a23 tribe may not sue a State ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: So you are prepared to live25 with the following: Is it the case that if California51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 opens a business in a commercial activity in 20 other2 States, at least one of which it is totally illegal,3 this other State, say, Utah, cannot ­­ can sue4 California or not? What's the answer?5 MR. KNEEDLER: The State where that gaming6 occurs can be, but that's because of Nevada v. Hall7 where the Court ­­ where the Court drew a distinction8 between ­­ for States. In the States there was a ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: So what the opposition10 says, in your view, is absolutely correct, that a11 foreign nation opens up an illegal business in a State.12 The State can sue them, now, because of a treaty, but13 previously, because of the common law.14 If California opens up an illegal business,15 the State can put them out of business by bringing a16 suit. But an Indian tribe, they can't? That's the17 United States' view?18 MR. KNEEDLER: California ­­ in the19 State­to­State situation, it's because of the20 reciprocity ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm saying that is your22 view, though? I just want the bottom line.23 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but let me ­­ if I may24 explain? It's important to understand the25 reasoning. The reasoning why a suit by a State against52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the sovereign would now be okay is because of the2 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. As I mentioned with3 the Principality of Monaco, part of what the Court said4 there is the State could not sue the Principality of5 Monaco because, at the time, there was no abrogation of6 immunity.7 Foreign sovereign immunity ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That ­­ that statute was9 based upon judicial decisions that had ­­ had already10 held that.11 MR. KNEEDLER: With all respect,12 Justice Scalia, it was based upon the Executive Branch's13 determination in the Tate letter. In this Court's14 decision in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman. The Court15 said it is not for the Courts to deny an immunity that16 the government recognizes.17 Prior to 1952, when the United States18 adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,19 foreign sovereigns were absolutely immune from suit,20 unless the political branches said otherwise.21 In the Tate letter, the Executive Branch22 adopted what was the developing body of international23 law for foreign sovereign immunity and said that24 commercial activities could be the subject of suit.25 That was codified, but the Court did not take it upon53Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425itself to modify that foreign sovereign immunity.  Andthis is ­­ this is the point that the Court made in Kiowa.JUSTICE SCALIA: Took it upon itself to accept the Executive's determination of how it ought to play out?MR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes, but it didn't treat it just as a matter of common law, like a maritime common law claim or something like that. It treated it as structural under the Constitution, and the same thing is true of Indian tribes.      The Constitution refers to Indian tribes ­­Worcester v. Georgia announced that Indian tribes aresovereigns.  We’ve made treaties with sovereigns.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they are quasi ­­ quasi­sovereigns, which means ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Dependent sovereigns.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Dependent sovereigns, which means the ­­ it is surprising that the scope of their immunity exceeds that of States or foreign sovereigns.MR. KNEEDLER: They ­­ they are dependent sovereigns, but they are dependent upon the plenary power of Congress, not the plenary power of this Court.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the ­­ so the Federal government can certainly take enforcement action54Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425against this casino.MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Federalgovernment, the Solicitor of Interior has said these arenot Indian lands, the NIGC has adopted thatinterpretation.  The NIGC has said, but we can't doanything because they are not Indian lands, and we workon Indian lands.  And then they've referred, as Iunderstand, the matter to the United States Attorney whohas, thus far, not done anything, right?MR. KNEEDLER: Well ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, basically, as I see it, the Federal government is saying, States, you can't take action against this illegal casino. We're the only ones who can. We agree that it's illegal, but we are not going to do anything.MR. KNEEDLER: We are ­­ first of all, by ­­ the casino was promptly closed. And whether it would have been a prudent exercise of Federal criminal prosecutorial authority or civil action under 1955, is committed to the ordinary prosecutorial discretion of the United States government.JUSTICE SCALIA: Who made these Indian tribe sovereign? Was it Congress?MR. KNEEDLER: The Constitution.55Official￼Alderson Reporting Company4 MR. KNEEDLER:5 JUSTICE SCALIA:6 sovereign?7 MR. KNEEDLER:8 JUSTICE SCALIA:9 MR. KNEEDLER:10 JUSTICE SCALIA:11   could also determine the scope of their sovereignty.12 MR. KNEEDLER: But this Court didn't do it13 as a matter of common law. It did it by looking at the 14 Constitution. We have treaties with Indian tribes, we 15 have the Commerce Clause ­­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: We do virtually nothing as 17 a matter of common law. We do virtually everything on 18 the basis of the Constitution or statutes. I don't19202122   sovereignty is for the political branches.

This case has tremendous2 implications, if we follow your approach. It seems to3 me well beyond anything to do with gaming. My belief is4 Indian tribes all over the country operate businesses5 off the reservation, and businesses all over the country6 are regulated.7 And does the State, I guess, in your view,8 does not have the power to enforce the regulation9 against the Indian tribe.10 MR. KNEEDLER: Not against ­­11 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is that ­­ not against12 the tribe itself. Why is that in the Indian tribe's13 interest? And is it a trap for the unwary lawyer? And14 how is this supposed to work out, in your view?15 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, Congress has addressed16 this problem in numerous ways. For example, the ­­ and17 in deciding whether to abrogate immunity, they're18 complex decisions. Should it be under tribal law?19 Should it be under State law? Should it be under20 Federal law? Should the suit be in Federal court?21 Should it be in State court?22 JUSTICE ALITO: What about ­­ what about23 private individuals who may have a claim against ­­ as a24 result of the operation of the casino? Vendors who want25 to be paid, somebody who slips and falls. That's all57Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 barred by sovereign immunity?2 MR. KNEEDLER: Unless ­­ unless the tribe3 consents. As the ­­ as two of the amicus briefs point4 out, a number of the tribal compacts provide for waivers5 of sovereign immunity for tort claims that may arise out6 of ­­ out of the gaming operation.7 Contract claims could be ­­ could be brought8 in tribal court ­­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Alito's question10 was the Kiowa case. It was off reservation, the tribe11 owed money on a contract, which it refused to pay, and12 the Court said sovereign immunity.13 MR. KNEEDLER: Exactly. And I should also14 point out that the Court said in Kiowa, in addition to15 reaffirming this analysis that I described from16 Blatchford and Coeur d'Alene Tribe v. Idaho, the Court17 reaffirmed that reciprocity and Principality of Monaco18 point.19 But it also pointed out the tremendous20 reliance interests that have grown up on ­­ the basis of21 foreign sovereign immunity. It pointed out that, for22 example, 450n of Title 25, which specifically preserves23 immunity, something that was reiterated in the No Child24 Left Behind Act.25 But it also specifically pointed out that58Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Congress has sometimes created narrow exceptions to the2 immunity. And critically, one of the ones it cited was3 the very one on which Michigan is relying in this case,4 2710(d)(7)(A)(ii), that is a limited exception for5 injunctive actions by a State against a tribe. Congress6 addressed ­­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, you went8 through the development of the foreign sovereign9 immunity and whether the courts were influenced by the10 government. It was the courts that recognized this11 distinction between commercial activity and governmental12 activity.13 Why couldn't the Court extend that same14 distinction to Indian tribes and say, it makes sense in15 the foreign country context, it also makes sense in the16 context of the tribes, to distinguish commercial from17 governmental?18 MR. KNEEDLER: It may well not make sense,19 or it may not lend itself to one answer, for the reasons20 that I said. Congress, for example, when it comes to21 tort claims against tribes, adopted a provision making22 the United States liable for tort claims and not ­­ and23 not others.24 It may not lend itself to one principal25 answer, which is why the Court, in Kiowa, said it's up59Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to the legislature, the Congress, to weigh the variouspros and cons or up to the tribe itself in decidingwhether to weigh it.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.      Mr. Bursch, you have five minutes left.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCHON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to clarify just two things about theCourt's precedent and then get back to the remediesissue, which has taken up so much of our time thismorning.      First, the state of the law, when IGRA wasadopted in 1988 ­­ again, that was before Kiowa, I heardmy friend on the other side talk about Puyallup and howthat was an off­reservation case.  And what you need tounderstand was that Puyallup was the third in a seriesof three opinions that this Court issued.  And it's truethat some of the earlier cases involved on­ andoff­reservation conduct.      But as we point out in our reply brief ­­this is at pages 167 to 68 of that opinion ­­ here, thetribe's contention was that the fishing activities onits reservation were immune, and Justice Stevens wrote60Official￼Alderson Reporting Company25 JUSTICE SCALIA:If we modified it to makeOfficial￼1 that opinion, and then, only a few short years later, in2 Kiowa, wrote his dissent, where he said we've never3 before drawn that on/off­reservation distinction. So4 that's what Puyallup says.5 With respect to Alfred Dunhill and the6 evolution of foreign sovereign immunity as a common law7 doctrine, four Justices agreed ­­ or signed on to the8 entire opinion where that discussion was held.9 One Justice agreed only with parts one and10 two, but part two, on page 694, draws the commercial11 line and says the problem here is that the district12 court found the only evidence of an active state, as13 opposed to a commercial act, was a statement by counsel14 that the Cuban government and the intervenors denied15 liability, and that's not enough.16 And ­­ and the Court did reference the Tate17 letter, but that's not why the Court changed the common18 law of foreign nation sovereign immunity. It ­­ it gave19 respectful consideration to the Executive Branch's20 views, and then it reached its own conclusion about what21 the common law should say.22 And, Justice Ginsburg, you are exactly right23 to say, if it makes sense in the foreign nation context24 and it makes sense here, apply it to both.61Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 an exception for commercial activities off reservation,2 could Congress reinstitute sovereign immunity if they3 wanted?4 MR. BURSCH: No question they could. Just5 like when this Court in Cabazon said that States didn't6 have the regulatory authority they thought they did to7 regulate illegal gaming on reservation, and this Court8 said ­­ you know, States can't really touch that.9 Congress immediately jumped in and corrected course.10 You know, conversely, with Alfred Dunhill,11 when this Court drew the line at commercial conduct,12 Congress immediately jumped in. And it put its stamp of13 approval on that, and essentially adopted the line ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, there seems something15 sort of strange about that, General, because as I read16 Kiowa, what it was, was an invitation to Congress. It17 was saying ­­ you know, we have some concerns about18 this, we're not sure it makes sense, we are dropping a19 very broad hint that Congress should change it.20 And, 15 years later, Congress has done21 nothing. And then to come back 15 years later and to22 say ­­ you know, Congress didn't really accept our hint,23 so we'll just do it ourselves and make Congress reverse24 it. Wouldn't you think that that's a strange procedure25 to use?62Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BURSCH: Actually, Justice Kagan, I think that's the way that the common law works, that the Court does extend invitations to the Legislative And Executive Branches.JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we've learned something in 15 years, such as the fact that ­­(Laughter.)JUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe we learned that Congress thought that this did make sense.MR. BURSCH: I think you could draw the conclusion either way. And the suggestion by the tribe and the government that somehow this Court lacks the power to define common law tribal immunity, we think, doesn't hold water.JUSTICE KAGAN: But I would have thought, General Bursch, that one of the principles behind Indian law in this country goes something like this: Congress can do pretty much whatever it wants with respect to Indian tribes, but we will not likely assume that Congress means to undermine tribal sovereignty. Wewill ­­ we will insist that Congress says that before we put it into effect.      And, here, it's not just ­­ I mean, Congresshas given every indication that it does not wish tochange this, notwithstanding our hints that it should.63Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BURSCH: I respectfully disagree. And the best evidence of that congressional intent is in IGRA itself, where Congress abrogated immunity, even for on­reservation conduct.      Think about what an extraordinary remedythat is, that, even on the reservation, a State wouldhave the ability to go into court and get a Federalinjunction, rather than send in police to arrest ­­JUSTICE BREYER: He's adding one thing, which is, as you've just heard, that the Indian tribes are in the same Eleventh Amendment type position as the Principality of Monaco before the treaty.MR. BURSCH: Right, but ­­JUSTICE BREYER: They didn't participate in the convention and the Principality of Monaco was held to be immune, presumably, even from commercial activity. Let Congress change it. That's what Kiowa says. And that, I think, is their basic argument.      And if it's a wash ­­ I mean, I hate to putit this way because it sounds like a joke, but it isn'tmeant to be ­­ in this case, if it's a wash, follow theprecedent.MR. BURSCH: I think Alfred Dunhill makes clear that this Court can change the stream of the common law when it comes to ­­ to immunity.64Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Really quickly on ­­ on these remedies ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then go back to the beginning question. You have remedies you don't like, but the waiver under IGRA is not for damages. It's only for injunctive relief. You have that in Ex Parte Young. Why are you asking us to waive sovereign immunity with respect to damages?MR. BURSCH: I'll explain why, if I may answer the question. With respect to arresting, Ex Parte Young remedies, enforcing the arbitration and having them waive immunity, all these things are unclear whether they're available to us. And if this Court issued a definitive opinion that said, we have each one of those remedies, that would do great good in this area.      But the reason why we think that you shouldgo farther than that is because, if sovereignty meansanything, it means allowing people to define what isillegal on their own lands, whether it's prostitution,gaming, or underage drinking, and being able to use thefull enforcement power of the sovereign State, civil andcriminal, to enforce those laws.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
