ATES:  In that instance, the "some 4   success on the merits" is the finding of the ERISA 5   violation in this instance. 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I believe that this 7   circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held, 8   but that's because there was a cause of action under the 9   complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act.10   But here there wasn't.  Here, there was a claim for11   benefits only, and you didn't get benefits.  That was12   the circuit's reasoning.  So tell me where they erred￼13141516   Justice Sotomayor.  We are claiming a claim for17   benefits.  As part of that claim, we asked for equitable18   relief for the ERISA violation.  The heart of ERISA is19   the full and fair review process in 1133 of the statute.20   Because without a full and fair review by the plan21   administrator, that fiduciary cannot get to the right22   result.  It violated that obligation here.and how we go back to defining "some success on themerits" in light of that position by the circuit?MR. ATES:  They misread the complaint,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   at the apple; get it right this time.  That's success on￼2345   essence was an equitable-type relief:  Do it again.  We6   asked for that in the complaint.  We asked for equitable7   relief.the merits under ERISA, because they must abide by theirfiduciary obligations, and they breached it here.The relief the district court formulated in 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you think 9   our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice10   Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a11   procedural victory is not some success on the merits.12   How do you differentiate what he meant by a --13   some procedural victory is not enough?14               MR. ATES:  I think it foreshadowed the15   Hanrahan-type case, and we are miles apart from16   Hanrahan.  Hanrahan, which Respondent is relying upon,17   was the circuit court reversing the district court on a18   pure civil procedure issue.  Here, there is a -- a19   right; it is a process right.  So when the process right20212223   Hanrahan.  There was a right to a certain process in the24   lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved25   reversal.

ATES:  But, in Hanrahan, there was no3   finding of a violation of law, Justice Scalia.  Here we4   have a violation of ERISA, a violation of a fiduciary5   obligation by the plan administrator.  The relief￼6789   Hanrahan.  In Hanrahan, there was no finding of aaccorded for that violation was a remand back to theplan administrator to get it right.That's the difference between our case and10   violation of law.  No one was found to be a legal11   wrongdoer.  We have that here.  The fiduciary breached121314151617181920212223   a motion for judgment as of law at trial.  The -- the24   court of appeals reversed that.  What we have here is a25   prodding from a court, but moreover a finding of a6its obligation.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying that inHanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, andhere there is?MR. ATES:  I'm sorry --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Hanrahan, there was noprod from the court; the court didn't say anythingthat -- it was the filing of the complaint that led tothe action, wasn't it?            MR. ATES:  Well, what happened was thedistrict court, I believe, granted a motion to dismiss orAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   violation by a court.  The court found Reliance violated2   ERISA.  That's the key distinction between here and3   Hanrahan.  And --￼4567   proved.  Then there would be no fees, right?8               MR. ATES:  No.  Under our position, the --9   Ms. Hardt is eligible for fees and the district court            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose now, in responseto "Do it right," Reliance on a complete record and verycareful review finds that total disability was not10   can take into account trust law principles which are11   embodied in what we call this five-factor test to12   determine whether to award fees.

Suppose the district court said:  All you came to21   me for was an order for remand.  I give you the order22   for remand.  Case ended.  At that point, he doesn't know23   how it's going to come out.  At that point, can he --24   can the district court award attorney's fees?25               MR.

ATES:  The only way it's going back,1213   we -- we meet even Buckhannon and beyond.  But in the14   case where the district court is sending it back, it15   must be sending it back for a violation of law, save one16   instance.  The claimant comes forward and says:  I have17   additional evidence that I didn't -- I didn't submit18   below.  I've got an equitable ground to -- to convince19   the court to, in essence, reopen the record.  I want --Now, here certainly she got the benefits, soAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   violation here.  What I was trying to articulate 9   earlier, perhaps inartfully, was that she -- she’s10   eligible for fees under the five-factor test, but in11   that instance the district court is not likely to use12   its discretion to grant fees in that instance.

ATES:  Maybe I am, Mr. Chief Justice.But my point is to try to distinguish Hanrahan, in thesense that we have a judicial finding of a legal13141516   doesn't know what's going to happen on remand?  You17   know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it18   out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you19   lose.  And the district court says you can't throw itnot --get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the courtCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if you20212223   going to happen.  Does she get fees or not?24               MR. ATES:  It -- it depends on what the25   district court does with it.  But she has to prove aout on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter.And it goes back.Now, the district court doesn't know what’s9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   violation of ERISA for it to go back.  And if she proves 2   that, she’s eligible for fees.  And the district court 3   in its discretion can take all these factors into4 account. 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is the district 6   court -- is the district court supposed to wait until 7   the whole thing is over before deciding the fee 8   application? 9               MR. ATES:  I think the better practice is10   for the district court to hold the case over and11   supervise the remand.  But if the district court enters12   judgment at that point, then -- then under Rule 54 or13   the -- they have to come in and apply for fees within14   14 days of that judgment.  But this case does not give15   this Court an opportunity specifically to give the16   courts, district courts, guidance whether to keep these17   cases open or not, much like the Social Security cases18   that happened in the late '80s and early '90s.19               But to get back to our main point, which is20   this is not a prevailing party statute, that was the21   fundamental error by the Fourth Circuit in imposing a22   prerequisite to determining whether a claimant is23   entitled to fees.  Section 502(g)(1) is not a prevailing24   party statute for three primary reasons:  first, the25   language and structure of the statute.  The words10￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   "prevailing party," a term of art that has been used for2   hundreds of years, is not within section 502(g)(1), but3   it is in other sections of ERISA.4               Its statutory sibling, section 502(g)(2),5   contains a judgment requirement.  Another provision of6   ERISA, 1451(e), uses the terms "prevailing party."7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How could somebody have8   some success on the merits if they don't achieve a￼ 9   judgment of some sort?10               MR. ATES:  This case -- in the -- in the11   Bradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you12   have many final orders in a case, and if the court13   determines an issue of -- a particular issue in a14   case -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation --15   and as relief for that they are issuing an order16   requiring Reliance to act within 30 days,17   let's say the case settles at that point.18   That's enough for fees to issue should the parties not19   be able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement.20   It's the judicial act in finding the violation that21   triggers -- triggers the success on the merits.22               And this case was on the merits.  As we23   pointed out in our very yellow brief, the district24 court --2511JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But under your theory,Alderson Reporting Company21 22 23 24 25a barrier to getting into an eligibility question.            So she's eligible for fees in that instance,but what those fees should be is at the district court'sdiscretion.Official - Subject to Final Review 1   presumably no relief has to be granted? 2               MR. ATES:  Relief does not have to be 3   granted.  The district court -- 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But then what -- what's 5   the difference -- is it your theory that if the district 6   court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA 7   case where a remand -- or where the court said they did 8   violate, but I’ve now looked at the evidence that you’re 9   proffering, the new evidence they did not consider,10   and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it.  Is11   your argument that you are entitled to fees because they12   decided there was -- the court decided there was a13   violation of ERISA?14               MR. ATES:  Yes, it is.  My argument is you’re15   eligible for fees, and the amount of fees will be16   taken into account in determining the degree in the17   district court, taking these five factors into account,18   taking into effect your position on the merits, the19   defendant's position on the merits, and determining what20   that fee award should be.  But it should not operate as￼JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Going back to12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between2   Hanrahan, where there’s a violation of the civil3   procedure code which is an entitlement to process?  Why4   aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation,5   merely for a finding that the district court acted￼ 6   improperly? 7 8   party who is violating.  Here it’s the party who’s 9   violating the law.  It's a party to the suit who is10   violating the law.  That violation is found in Hanrahan.11   It's a civil procedure.  The district court didn't --12   didn't do something right.13               Here -- and that's not a violation of the --14   of law.  That's a -- that's a misapplication of a15   civil -- of a rule of civil procedure.  Here we have a16   violation of law by a party.  That's the fundamental17   difference between us and Hanrahan.18               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask -- ask this19   question?  The question here is whether there was20   eligibility for fees.  Could the district judge in your21   view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for22   fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue,23   and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so24   I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any25 fees?13MR. ATES:  Because you have to look at theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. ATES:  The district court can exercise 2   its discretion and not award fees.  I think, however, 3   that the better result is when a violation of law is 4   proven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or 5   beneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees 6   because the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in 7   the statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants 8   and have access to the Federal courts. 9               If every case is a close case and you’re10   not giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with11   limited means.  These are folks by definition cannot12   work when they are disabled, and you are eating up their13   benefit through attorney's fees.  And that cannot be the14   point of the statute when Congress enacted this.  It is15   to protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give16   appropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal17 courts.18               If I can get back to, again, why this is not19   a prevailing party statute, the language and structure20   clearly show that.  The history and context show it as21   well.  And I'm not talking legislative history.  I'm22   talking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare23   and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a24   judgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to25   remove that requirement when it originally enacted14￼Alderson Reporting Company6 7 8 9account these principles that the district courts andcourts of appeals have relied on for at least 30 yearsunder ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts’discretion in awarding fees.Official - Subject to Final Review1   ERISA.

In re Catell's Estate 2   is discussed in all the briefs.  There the plaintiff 3   brought a claim to remove a trustee, and the basis for 4   the claim to remove the trustee was a contention that 5   the trustee wasn't complying with one of the terms of6 the trust. 7               After he filed the suit -- and this was 8   before even any finding by the judge -- the trustee then 9   complied with that particular term of the trust.  And10   then what the court said was, well, because the trustee11   complied with the underlying premise or the motivation12   for your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the13 trustee --14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that seems like a15   catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta,16   rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus.

SHAH:  Your Honor, a couple of13   responses:  First of all, ERISA is somewhat unique in￼141516171819202122232425that ERISA -- first of all, this provision doesn't haveprevailing party language as -- unlike EAJA, for example.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I'm talking about otherprevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes thatdon't say "prevailing party."            MR. SHAH:  Okay.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure.            MR. SHAH:  I think still this provisionis unique in that it’s informed explicitly by trustlaw principles, as this Court has held numerous --in numerous decisions regarding other ERISA provisions.And the trust law principles depart from the American20Alderson Reporting Company4 5 6 7 8 9rule, and so when you interpret ERISA section 502(g)(1)based upon the trust law principles, I think thatsupports a different --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sureit's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provisionas having anything to do with trust law.23 24 25does not provide for -- this is not a prevailing partystatute.            MR.

ROSENKRANZ      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:No judge has ever decided the merits ofAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1234   that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said:  "Congress5   found it necessary to explicitly state that the termsome success on the merits, and under Rule 54 she mustspecify the judgment entitling her to an award.￼JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the footnote 6   'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants 7   to abandon illegal conduct" -- illegal conduct was found 8   here -- "although without a formal court order"? 9               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  Footnote10   8 of Ruckelshaus addressed one sentence of legislative11   history of a different statute, and only so far as the12   Court pointed out that the sentence was of no use to13   Sierra Club in that case.  I don't think the footnote is14151617   catalyst.  In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was18   rejected.  Here the court said:  If I were to decide19   right now -- the district court said:  I am inclined toproperly read to be a full-fledged endorsement of thecatalyst theory.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is not merely a20212223   that point as favoring Hardt.  To that extent, it wasn't24   a purely procedural ruling.  It says:  As things stand25   now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door27rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance anopportunity to respond.So the court had evaluated the evidence atAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   open.  So it wasn't just a procedural decision.  It was 2   an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't3 it? 4               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, but it 5   would be an utterly unadministrable rule to attempt to 6   weigh the inclinations of district judges in their opinions. 7   This Court's precedents have made clear that we weigh 8   success on the merits by evaluating judicial judgments. 9               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the judgment is, send10   it back.  That's what it says:  Send it back.  And the11   reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing12   terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration13   says she’s completely disabled, that she’s entitled in14   the -- on the evidence shown.  There’s no substantial15   evidence to the contrary.  But you, the company, want to16   take money from her instead of giving her the money.17               Now, I’ve read the record.  It doesn't18   support anything contrary to what I’ve said.  So now19   you send it back.  Now, what is that but a big victory20   for the other side?  Which then leaves the company to21   say:  They're right; pay them.22               Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of23   English -- if you’re -- we’re talking about partial success.24   Partial success, or not total defeat.  That is the25   language from Ruckelshaus.  Not "total success."  You28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   still get it.  Okay.  What in the English language can 2   we read in a case or a statute that would say you 3   shouldn't reach that commonsense result?  Now, of 4   course, I’m characterizing it a little bit, but it does 5   seem like a commonsense result. 6               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, Petitioner in 7   this case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court 8   requesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits. 9   Indeed, she believed she was entitled to such a judgment10   as a matter of law, and she moved for judgment as a11   matter of law for summary judgment.12               What the district court actually did was13   deny that motion for summary judgment.  Rather than give14   her the judgment she sought, the district court employed15   a particular procedural maneuver, which was to remand16   the case -- quote, "remand the case" -- to her17   litigation adversary to reconsider the question.  Now --￼18192021   requested.  It had to find some sort of violation,22   either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the23   relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the24   court.  And your adversary says the court found an ERISA25   violation.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  His point -- youradversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect thatprocedural move without taking step one in what was29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1               Now, the type of relief it grants is up to 2   its discretion.  This is an equitable situation, and it 3   exercised its discretion by doing a remand.  Why is that 4   view different than calling it a procedural step?  Isn't 5   that a substantive win? 6               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, this is a 7   purely interlocutory order.  So this was not an end to 8   the case.  This was not a decision on the merits.  This 9   was a purely interlocutory order, on the road to a10   decision on the merits, perhaps, but the district court11   denied her motion for summary judgment, did not conclude12   that she was entitled to benefits as a matter of law and,13   instead, remanded the case for further proceedings.  So --14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what is the15   impact on your position of our decision last week in16   Conkright v. Frommert?  I know you haven't had a chance17   to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.18               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, Conkright19   emphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the20   first instance and, in fact, in the second instance by21   claims administrators, that that is --22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought23   that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the24   typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending25   it back rather than making a judicial decision, which --30￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in 2   most cases, the person would prevail before the plan 3   administrator. 4               So given Conkright, your position is going 5   to severely limit the circumstances under which 6   claimants are entitled to fees. 7               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it's -- you are 8   correct that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated 9   that in most cases the district court should remand10   under circumstances like this.  You are quite correct.11   Under circumstances like this, then, there would be12   fewer opportunities for district courts to award --13   to award fees.  And that’s a correct result under￼14151617   an agreement, can be quite dramatic.  This was a very,502(g)(1), which, as informed by --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though the --as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before18192021   this should be characterized as a victory.  This is not22   a procedural maneuver that the plaintiff sought.  The23   plaintiff asked for summary judgment, and her summary24   judgment motion was denied.  And, instead, the district25   court chose to remand the case to her litigation31very significant victory for the claimant to get it sentback under those circumstances.MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm not sureAlderson Reporting Company7 8 9have obtained a victory?            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I don't think that futureOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   adversary.  Surely, at that moment at least, that surely￼could not have felt like a victory.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Future claimants will not2345   presumably, in light of Conkright.  They will ask that6   the case be remanded.  So, in future cases, will theyask for summary judgment from the district court,     claimants will ask for a remand as their final form of10   relief, Your Honor.  This was -- the relief that one asks11   for in one's complaint is the final judicial relief that12   one wants.  This is --131415161718   very bad faith.  A district court still has power to19   issue an award on summary judgment.20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The claimant doesn’t --21   doesn't really claim that.  The claimant just says this22   was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly.23   And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from24   the district court is a remand.25               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But the correct way to --32            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we've -- we'vealready told them they can't get that.            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, a plaintiffcould get an -- could get the relief of benefits if aclaims administrator had acted severely improperly or inAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he would not ask for2   money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your3   analysis.  If all he asked for was a remand, he got a￼4567   benefits.

ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  A properly10   interlocutory relief, any more than one asks --11               JUSTICE BREYER:  If someone wants a remand,12   it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a13   holding of the district court.  The ERISA administrator14   was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give15   this woman nothing.  In my opinion, she's entitled at16   least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't17   know.  So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he18   can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give19   her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.20               Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all21   the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may22   allow a reasonable attorney's fee.  Nothing more.  Now,23 24 25what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation?            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor --            JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's what you think.33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1234   was liability in the case.  So that perhaps would constitute5   success on the merits.  This resolved no substantive            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, a remand orderunder those circumstances might constitute success onthe merits because it resolves an issue in the case, which￼ 6   issue on the case.  This remand order simply says:  As a 7   procedural matter, go back and look at it again. 8               JUSTICE BREYER:  You distinguish between him 9   saying you have to give her at least 30 and his10   saying the evidence that supports giving her less than11   30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's12   the word?  Yes, worthless.131415161718192021   difficult.  Let's assume that a claims administrator or a22   plan administrator is not deciding the claim.  The party23   comes to court and says:  Under ERISA, I have a right to a24   decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus25   them to give me a decision.  The court says:  Reasonable;34            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, this Courthas -- this Court has expressly distinguished betweenjudicial --JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the line you draw?            MR.

And orders them to.￼ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   wait a minute.  Then we go back to a question that was 9   asked by one of my colleagues.  If a plan participant10   came in and said they didn't consider evidence they11   should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's12   documents, and here they are; they should consider them13   now, and the court says you're right, enters a14   remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough?15               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm not sure16   that’s a properly formatted ERISA complaint.  If the17   gravamen of the complaint is "I want my benefits" then --18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what -- what’s19   the difference between the first example I gave, a20   mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for21   benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision.  What's22   the difference between that and the second hypothetical?23               MR.

ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, in yourhypothetical the -- the remand order would presumably bea final judgment, and it might well constitute successon the merits.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're -- you're --Alderson Reporting Company9 10 11 12(Laughter.)            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and would say,and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says:Look, I don't know if you’re going to prevail or notOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   resolve that case.  A remand would always maintain￼2345   works?  Remands always retain jurisdiction?  I would --6   I would have thought the district judge would want the7   thing off his or her docket, you know, for thejurisdiction -- should always maintain jurisdiction overthe case, thus always be interlocutory and procedural.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that how it8   statistics, if anything.  And --13   on remand.  My decision actually doesn't help you much14   one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the15   other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume16   you’ll be able to work out the amount.  If you don't,17   he's done.  End of case.  Sent back to the18   administrator.19               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, on the research20   that we have done, most district courts hold21   jurisdiction on remands such as this, and we believe22   that is the proper course.  When the case -- the gravamen of23   the case is a complaint for benefits, the district court24   merely remands to the ERISA claims administrator, the25   merits of the case simply have not been decided.36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE BREYER:  That may be, but why can't2   they do this?  What would be wrong with this heretical3   idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out4   of the court, the district judge -- that group of people5   we were talking about -- has discretion to decide6   whether ultimately they got something significant of7   what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped8   them get them something significantly of what they9   wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up￼10   to the district judge as long as the district judge11   doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives12 him?1314   to an end?  What would happen that would be so terrible15   if we said something like that?16               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I believe that17   would be to embrace the catalyst theory that this Court18   rejected in 2000 --19               JUSTICE BREYER:  It didn't say anything20   against the catalyst theory.  It said you have to21   remember this is an American country, we follow the22   American rule, and there has to be something special in23   the situation.  And what would be special in this24   situation is that the judge has to decide that as a25   result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did37What would -- I mean, would the Earth comeAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1234   victory would not suffice.  Now, purely procedural5   victory may well -- may well result in success for a6   plaintiff at some later stage; it could result inget something significantly of what she wanted.            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the Court wascareful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural￼7   out-of-court success.  This Court has been crystal clear89 1013   says:  You’re right; you’re entitled to those14   documents.15               It's interlocutory; there is no decision;16   but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the17   plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents.18   The court said:  You are entitled to the documents.that we do not look for success out of court; we don’tlook for it in interlocutory orders --                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose11   the complaint was:  I asked for a turnover of certain12   documents; they refused without reason. And the court19202122232425And then it goes back, and the documents are turned overbecause the court has ordered that.            Under your theory, because there was nodetermination of benefits, even that ruling which was atotal victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door tofees.            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  On your hypothetical, Your38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   Honor, that would not be an interlocutory order.  So if 2   a plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the 3   district court awards her, her documents, that would be 4   the end of the case, and the district court would 5   properly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate, 6   compare the result that the district court gave -- gave 7   a plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked 8   for.  But this is not such a case. 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that would fall --10   even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no --11   no award is made?  No benefits are awarded?12               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it might be13   proper to frame a complaint under ERISA for a purely14   procedural remedy like some documents.  That is not the15   main run of ERISA cases.  So in the normal case, a16   petitioner arrives -- a plaintiff arrives asking for17   benefits.  And --18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- but you say --19   you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but20   that's the only thing that she asked for.  So she got it.21   So she qualifies for fees.  Even though you just￼22 23 24 25characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purelyprocedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- so she gets benefits.39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- I'm not sure that 2   a properly framed ERISA complaint would be -- would 3   be for a purely procedural result.  If one could frame 4   an ERISA claim like that, which I think is extremely -- 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I'm not dealing 6   with something obscure.  If the -- the plaintiff says, I 7   have asked for certain documents, they withheld those 8   documents with no good cause at all, and the court said: 9   You’re right; turn over documents.10               It's that hypothetical.  It's just --11   that's the situation.  There is a final order:  Turn over12   the documents.  But it's a procedural order, right?￼131415161718   procedural and interlocutory.  So it fails under both19   those grounds.  On your hypothetical, the -- the orderMR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, nonetheless, benefitswould be -- nonetheless, fees would be available?            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, our position isthat in this case the remand order was both purely202122232425   changing the answer.  The answer that you first gavewould be a final order, but presumably still purelyprocedural, and so perhaps not success on the meritseven on that hypothetical.JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You’re changing -- you’re40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   me was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes,2   qualifies for fees.  Now you’re saying no, no fees?3               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it would4   qualify in the sense that it would be a final judgment,5   not an interlocutory order.  Whether that’s properly6   characterized as a purely procedural victory or not, I'm7   not sure.  Most ERISA claims are not framed that way.￼89 1012   order them to process my application.  Right; they’re13   not doing anything; we order then to go process the14   application.  End of case in the district court.They are usually framed as claims for benefits, not forpurely procedural --                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the claim were:11   They're just not processing my application.  So, Court,1516171819   even though it’s what the plaintiff sought.  Again, in20   this case, this order was purely interlocutory, and so21   it's a much easier case.  This -- in this case, this was22   a procedural step on the road to a final judgment.  This23 24 25was not a final judgment at all and not at all what thepetitioner sought.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The government in response41Fee entitlement?            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Again, Your Honor, thatwould perhaps be best characterized as a purelyprocedural victory even though it's a final judgment andAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review12345678   don't.  The Court has oftentimes emphasized that9   fee-shifting statutes ought to be read in parallel, thatto questions about the significance and the consequencesof its position said, oh, this is a unique statute.ERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute.￼            Do you agree that if -- if we rule for you,it would be applicable primarily to ERISA and itwouldn't have an effect on these other statutes?MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Justice Kennedy, I10   we ought to have fewer rather than more fee-shifting11   standards in the world.  And so, presumably, the result12   in this case would govern any number of fee-shifting13   statutes of similar language.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the15   parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of16   questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case17   rises or falls on the discovery issue?  If we have to go18   through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than19   to pay you.  So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on202122232425discovery will decide the issue.            In that case, can the party -- can theclaimant get fees?            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Inthis hypothetical, the district court grants thediscovery order, but the -- but still holds jurisdiction42Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9over the case?            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it grants thediscovery order, and as a result, a direct result of thatruling, the plan pays benefits.            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  I believethat this Court has rejected the direct results theoryand has instructed us to look at the content of judicialjudgments, not at their ancillary effects on parties outin the world.Official - Subject to Final Review￼101112   on the merits for you?  The only difference is whether13   they won on one cause of action as opposed to four?14               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus,15   the Courts emphasized that omitting words like16   "prevailing party" or "success" from a statute is17   significant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it18   accomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success19   required -- the degree, I believe was the Court's20   language -- but not the type of success required.  But21   it was still --22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So under Buckhannon, 5123   percent only entitles you to fees.  And under your view24   of this statute, you have -- as long as you get25   1 percent order, that's enough.43            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what is thedifference between prevailing party and some successAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the -- the Court2   in Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of3   “prevailing party” that -- that held sway in circuit4   courts in the 1970s.5               At that time, “prevailing party” had been read6   quite narrowly to require substantially prevailing, and7   the Court understood Congress to reject that standard in8   adopting a statute that doesn't include language like9   "prevailing party."  Subsequently, this Court has￼1011121314151617   in type.  The result -- the success still has to be18   success that you can find in a judgment of a court.19               Your Honors, if I could -- Your Honors, as20   a matter of policy, the plaintiffs have argued that this21   will result in -- that -- I'm sorry.  As a matter of22   policy, the plaintiffs -- or the Petitioner's rule would23   result in a second major litigation over attorney's24   fees, and this Court has rejected any such rules.  The25   concern is that the fee-shifting inquiry ought to be44adopted a much more liberal understanding of the words"prevailing party," so there may not be --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you -- you see nodifference today?            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  There may still be adifference, but it will be a smaller difference and adifference only in quantity, certainly not a differenceAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   simple and easy to administer. 2               The ease of administrability of our rule is 3   that it turns on the contents of judicial judgments.  If 4   the Petitioner wins in this case, the policy result will 5   merely be stingier plans.  So these are not plans that 6   any private party is obliged to create, and this Court 7   has emphasized that the purpose of ERISA is to balance 8   the interests of beneficiaries, on the one hand, but also 9   the interest in the creation of these plans and the10   generosity of these plans, on the other.  And a fee award11   under circumstances like this would result in far less12   generous plans for -- for --13               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?14   You rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was15   a case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against16   the government.17               Is there a basis for distinguishing on a18   sort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that19   maybe there should be a stricter standard when you’re20   taking money away from the sovereign than when you’re21   taking it away from private litigants?22               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I don't think23   so.  The Solicitor General is here arguing that this24   ought to be the rule, and it would presumably be the25   same rule even in a statute that applied against the45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   government.  Again, this Court has cautioned against a 2   proliferation of different fee-shifting standards.  I 3   would think there would be a concern about having a 4   different standard applied to the government than to a 5   private party on -- on similar statutory text. 6   Certainly, no indication in this statutory text -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's a trust -- trust 8   law is at issue here, is the government's assertion. 9               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I agree with10   you that it seems artificial in a way to apply those --11   to apply -- to import those principles entirely.  On the12   other hand, this Court has emphasized that ERISA is13   informed by trust principles.  And under Sprague, the14   Court emphasized that trust principles would very rarely15   shift fees in a context like this.  So to that extent, I￼16171819   actually happened in the district court below:  So the20   Petitioners sought judgment as a matter of law fordo believe that this provision should be informed bythis Court's holding on that point.Just to re-emphasize, Your Honors, what21   benefits, and that motion was denied.  Instead, she22   received an interlocutory procedural order, a remand to23   her adversary, a private party in litigation, to24   consider the question again.25               And, as this Court emphasized, the second46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   inquiry by the claims administrator would be reviewed2   for abuse of discretion.  It could easily have come out￼3 4 5 6 7 8 9the other way, as the district court itselfacknowledged.            JUSTICE BREYER:  You also received -- shealso received a conditional judgment in her favor.            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  The district courtspecified that if Reliance did not comply with thisprocedural --10111213141516   in her favor.  It was a conditional judgment.  I mean,17   if we’re being technical, if we’re going to just do            JUSTICE BREYER:  She said:  Unless thisorder goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment willbe entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her.            MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  That'strue, but I don't think that distinguishes this from --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, she got one judgment18   this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's19   a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just20   don't want to look to the merits of it and see what21   really happened, then why doesn't she win?  Because she22   got a judgment in her favor, okay?  End of the matter.23               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, she didn't24   actually get a judgment.  She got a --25               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, let's read the47Alderson Reporting Company13 judgment --14 judgment in15 could.16it sounds to me like you could say that's a her favor. You don't have to, but youMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I think that's district court was only saying what ismost all procedural orders --JUSTICE BREYER: No. Normally, a judge -- aOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 judgment. Let's see. It says -- it says judgment. It2 says in a -- what is it called? I just saw it here.3 My colleague had it here.4 It says -- I think this it. It says “Conclusion”5 -- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and6 it says what happens. And it says it denies, denies,7 denies, denies. And then it says: "Reliance to act on8 Ms. Hardt's application, adequately considering all the9 evidence, within 30 days. Otherwise, judgment will be10 issued in favor of Mrs. Hardt."11 Now, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess.12 It's in an order. So an order saying we’ll issue a￼17 only -- the18 implicit in1920 judge doesn't say: It is ordered that if you do not21 act within 30 days, there will be a judgment entered in22 flavor of the plaintiff. That's not a usual thing.23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, if a party24 ignores the procedural order of a district court, it25 does so often on peril of default. So it --48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just saying, if we’re 2   going to be formal and we’re going to look to certain 3   words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of 4   what really happened, don't we have those words in the 5   paper that's relevant here? 6               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Again, Your Honor, the 7   district court did not decide the merits of this case. 8   The district court offered the possibility that it would 9   enter judgment if something happened in the future.10   That thing did not happen in the future.  There was11   no judgment in her favor in this case.  Again, the issue12   was remanded to a private party to determine the issue.13   The grant of benefits on remand certainly could not14   constitute success on the merits.15               That was not judicial action at all.  That16   was the action of a private party.  Purely voluntary17   action.  Certainly, couldn't constitute a judgment under18   Rule 54.  And then when the case arrived back at the￼19202122   district court took:  denying the motion for summary23   judgment and dismissing the case.  And under thisdistrict court, the district court did the only thingthat it was left to do, which was to dismiss the case.And those are the actual actions the24   Court's precedents, where we look for success is in those25   judgments.  Those judgments show us no success on the49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   merits for Ms. Hardt. 2               If there are no further questions -- 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 4               Mr. Ates, you have 4 minutes remaining. 5               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES 6                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 7               MR. ATES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 8   please the Court: 9               I have two points on rebuttal:  Under their10   we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her11   claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim12   for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this13   Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security14   claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the15   Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case16   is closed at that point.  There was no decision on the17   merits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that18   was prevailing party.19               Here, we don't need prevailing party, but20   moreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd21   results.  There is a provision in ERISA, 1132(c),22   that gives a claimant the right to seek documents.  And23   yet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly24   successful to get the plan document from which certain25   claims you don't even know if you have until you read50￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 those plans, they would say it's a purely procedural2 victory; you cannot get attorney's fees. The whole3 point of that provision was to require the fiduciary to4 give the document over so people can understand their5 rights.6 Moreover, their final judgment on the merits7 for benefits rule leads to perverse incentives under8 ERISA. The plan administrator is incented to deny the9 first time around, challenge it all the way through the10 courts, on remand maybe, if they get a conditional11 judgment, as here, that says if you don't act within12 30 days I'm giving you that judgment, they then grant13 the benefits and the court gets rid of the case, they14 have succeeded in eliminating the right15 of claimants to get to court to pursue their rights,16 because of the cost of litigation.17 But moreover, here we have a judgment. To18 be clear, that is not our argument. We had a19 conditional judgment by the district court sending it20 back: If you do not act in accordance with law within21 30 days, I will enter judgment on this case.22 We have that, but at the end of the day,23 it was not a dismissal. They overlooked district court24 docket 57. There was a judgment entered in Ms. Hardt's favor25 against Reliance in the amount of attorney's fees. The51￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review 1   original order merges into that judgment.  We have a 2   final judgment here as well.  Although we don't need it 3   under section 502(g)(1), we have it here. 4               This Court should not require a judgment 5   before fees can be awarded.  The whole -- and it 6   certainly shouldn't adopt a purely procedural rule out 7   of thin air that's not in the statute.  This is a 8   procedural statute.  The only way claimants can 9   effectuate their right is ensuring the procedure is10   followed.  That is what we have here.11               They did not follow proper procedure.
