ESTRADAON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The issue in these consolidated cases is whetherparticipants and beneficiaries of ERISA plans may seek consequential and punitive damages in state court under state tort law for the allegedly wrongful denial of ERISA health care benefits. The Fifth Circuit answered that question yes, reasoning that completely -- that the complete preemption under the Federal statute applies to contract claims that essentially duplicate what's available under Section 502 of the Federal statute, but not to tort claims, which give supplemental remedy for consequential and punitive damages.For two principal reasons, the judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be reversed. First, this Court has consistently held that all challenges to the propriety of benefit determination, whether couched in tort or in contract, are completely preempted by Section 502 and therefore are removable and governed solely by Federal law.4Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Second, the fact that the welfare plans at issue in2 these cases provide benefits for medical care, as opposed to3 disability, death, or some other welfare benefit, does not alter4 the analysis under the Federal statute or give the states any5 more power to supplement the remedies that Congress included in6 Section 502.7 QUESTION: Now just to be clear, Mr. Estrada, you take8 the position that ERISA Section 502(a) completely preempts the9 Texas scheme here?10 MR. ESTRADA: Yes.11 QUESTION: And we don't have before us any conflict12 preemption under Section 514?13 MR. ESTRADA: That is - that is right, Justice14 O'Connor. That is our position.15 QUESTION: Okay.16 MR. ESTRADA: And turning to Section 502(a) and to the17 --18 QUESTION: Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question?19 I'm sure you'll cover it in the argument and I want to get it on20 the table. On your first point, that our prior cases have said21 that 502 is the exclusive remedy for actions to acquire benefits,22 is there a distinction? Some of your opponents argued between23 denials based on the terms of the plan, that this just doesn't24 qualify for some reason, on the one hand, that you just should25 get the answer out of the plan, and denials based on a5Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 discretionary decision as to whether the medical treatment was2 appropriate or not, which would require the exercise of some kind3 of professional judgment. The nurse might think he doesn't need4 an extra day in the hospital or something like that. Is that a5 valid distinction or not?6 MR. ESTRADA: No. And let me turn to that -- that was7 my second point, but I'll turn to it now. The use of medical8 criteria, whether discretionary or not, is inherent in health9 care coverage and usually is also inherent in - - in disability10 coverage. Yet, last Term, in the Black & Decker case, this Court11 held that the -- that a claimant's treating doctor gets no12 special deference in a claim for the benefits where the issue is13 whether the medical factors warrant a disability finding. Under14 the theory being advanced by Texas and the respondents in this15 case, however, Black & Decker needn't, and maybe even couldn't,16 be an ERISA case because a state of the union could regulate the17 medical component of the disability finding under the guise of18 regulating the practice of medicine and could give tort remedies19 and consequential and punitive damages whenever the plan20 disagreed with the -- with the claimant's doctor.21 QUESTION: Yes, of course they could, but the fact that22 if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean23 they would win on the merits. I mean, you are -- your drug24 formulary may be absolutely defensible, even though it could be25 tested in a state court proceeding.6Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. ESTRADA: Well, I didn't understand the claim as to2 the Aetna case necessarily to be a challenge to the promulgation3 of the formulary, which is expressly authorized by the4 prescription drug writer of the plan. I understood the challenge5 to be to a particular benefits decision that was made when Aetna,6 as the insurer and plan administrator, concluded that the benefit7 was not covered in the circumstances because of the step therapy8 requirement.9 QUESTION: I don't want you to go too long on point two10 without getting back to point one, but as long as we're here, it11 does seem to me that the dichotomy, the duality you propose12 between a decision about benefits and medical treatment might, at13 the edges, blur into each other. If I say, as Aetna or CIGNA,14 you're not authorized to seek this treatment and the person has15 no other funds, basically, that is a treatment decision, in a16 sense.17 MR. ESTRADA: No, it is not, Justice Kennedy. The18 purpose of employee benefits plan -- benefit plans is to cover19 some things for the employees. If the plans in these cases said20 that the benefit was $100 for each hospital stay or that you got21 $20 for your drugs, whatever they may be, no one would deny that22 that was a -- that that was a benefit determination. As I said23 earlier, with respect to medical care, it has always been the24 case that in determining the scope of coverage, medical factors25 have always been used and that factor is imbedded into the7Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 background understandings of how this very statute works.2 For example, Section 503 of the statute allows the3 Department of Labor to promulgate regulations to deal with how4 claims are made and the like. One of those regulations by -- by5 the Department of Labor expressly contemplates that if a claimant6 has a proposed treatment turned down, he may appeal to a named7 fiduciary who is required, under the DOL regs, to consult with an8 -- with an appropriate medical hair -- care professional and -­9 QUESTION: I guess my point was, at some time, and even10 in these cases, there -- that there was a component of what we11 might call medical judgment involved.12 MR. ESTRADA: That is undisputed, Justice Kennedy, and13 I think that our position is that there is a fundamental14 difference between a claimant who has a doctor patient15 relationship with his doctor and a claimant who has an insuretal16 coverage relation with his insurer. Just to put it into context17 of legal practice, if the person reading the plan documents and18 denying a claim -- the claim, excuse me, uses medical training to19 conclude that the plan documents did not cover a treatment, I20 think few people would think that that entitled the claimant to21 sue the person who turned it down for legal malpractice.22 And the same is basically true here, too, because the23 plan's -- the plan's role, as is very clearly expressed, for24 example, in the -- in the text of the Monitronics plan, is to25 deal with the question, shall we pay or shall we not pay. And8Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that's actually precisely what Texas has targeted here.If I could direct the Court's attention to the petitionappendix in the Aetna case, 02-1885, the relevant parts of the Texas statute are set forth in page 59a and -­QUESTION: 59a of what?MR. ESTRADA: Of the Aetna petition appendix, 02-1885, Mr. Chief Justice. And as -- and there are three that are relevant here. Two of them are on page 59 and one of them is on page 58a.The first one that I want to point out is close to the top of the page. It is an affirmative defense under the Texas statute that the managed care entity did not deny or delay payment. This is not about treatment. It is a defense that it did not deny or delay payment. And of course delay may be a bid for - of what a -- of what the role of the administrator is.The second aspect of the statute is that the statute makes very clear, once again on page 59a, that the managed -­ that the liability -- oh. This is subsection d, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the next following -­QUESTION: Oh.MR. ESTRADA: -- you know, the one that I read. And it says the act creates no obligation on the part of the health insurance carrier, moving down a little, to cover a -- to provide a treatment which is not -- which is not covered by the health care plan or entity. Once again, this is targeting the coverage9Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425aspect, not the treatment.QUESTION: Yes, but let me just focus on the caseinvolving the woman who may have needed a second day in the hospital. Is it correct that they -- an agent of the HMO had discretion to grant that second day if the nurse thought it was really medically required?MR. ESTRADA: I don't -- I don't know if there's anything in the record about that. What is clear from the record and from Federal law, Justice Stevens, is that somebody in the plan would have discretion to hear her appeal, even if the nurse that -- that turned the request down -­QUESTION: So the decision as to whether she would have the second day in the hospital would depend on a medical judgment made by an agent of the plan. Is that correct?MR. ESTRADA: It would -- it would ultimately -- it would ultimately turn on -- on a coverage decision that may include medical criteria.QUESTION: But the coverage is if it's medically needed, it would -- she would get the second day. But whether or not it's covered then turns on a medical judgment, does it not?MR. ESTRADA: But the question of medical necessity is a coverage term. It is not a medical term, Justice Stevens, and --QUESTION: Yes, but is not correct, to make the coverage decision, one has to make a medical decision?10Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. ESTRADA: It -- one has to make -- one part of the2 coverage decision is the medical decision. In the Aetna case,3 for example, the plan sets forth a definition of medical4 necessity which -- which sets forth, I do point out, is that you5 have to need it -- to need the care -­6 QUESTION: Well, I was focusing on the CIGNA case,7 because it seemed to me that it's a little clearer there that8 there would be a medical judgment required.9 MR. ESTRADA: Well, once again, Justice Stevens, we do10 not contend that health insurance does not involve the11 consideration of medical factors. And, as I said, it is almost12 inherent in the nature of the product that it would, just as I13 never had car insurance before I actually owned a car.14 QUESTION: But it's a little -- it's a little like -­15 if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the16 plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of17 medical care, in a way.18 MR. ESTRADA: That is not right, Justice O'Connor, for19 the following reason. The plan documents here, and the20 background understanding of all of the parties, is that it is for21 the treating doctor to chart the course of treatment for the22 patient and, in fact, under the AMA's old code of ethics, which23 we cite on page 6 of the Aetna reply brief, a physician is not24 allowed to sway his judgment as to treatment by the existence or25 non-existence of coverage. In many cases, unfortunately, there11Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 will be people who have no coverage or no insurance, or may be2 under-insured.3 But just to bring back the case to what the statute is4 about, this statue is about encouraging employers to make hard5 choices to give coverage to employees to the extent they can.6 There is no requirement in Federal law that requires employers to7 give -- there are very few requirements in Federal law that8 require employers to give particular benefits if they choose to9 have a plan. And, as this Court has said, most recently in the10 Rush case, this is about a bargain with employers that seeks to11 encourage the formation of these plans and the provision of12 benefits to the extent possible by assuring employers of limited13 liabilities under predictable standards.14 QUESTION: If you are correct that Section 502(a)15 preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the16 plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and17 suffering or things like that?18 MR. ESTRADA: I would think not, Justice O'Connor. Our19 amicus, the Department of Labor, may take a slightly different20 view of that. Our reading of the Mertens case and the Great West21 case, which seemed very clearly, to us, at least, to stand for22 the proposition that equitable is to be determined by reference23 to a historical examination of all that is available in equity -­24 QUESTION: Yes, but if you make an analogy to a trustee25 in equity, I think this is a different case than Mertens or Great12Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 West, because here, the Aetna and CIGNA are fiduciaries, are they2 not?3 MR. ESTRADA: Aetna is -- and CIGNA is for purposes of4 claims processing.5 QUESTION: Yes. And so, as a fiduciary they're -- they6 are analogous to a trustee, at least, the government said, if I7 read their footnote 13 right, that back in the old days when8 there were -- was a division of the bench, that one of the9 remedies available against a trustee would be in the nature of10 make whole relief that would put the beneficiary in the position11 he would have been in if the trustee had not committed the breach12 of trust.13 MR. ESTRADA: That was the view to which I referred to14 earlier, Justice Ginsberg, and it is possible that it may be15 right. It seems to me, based on Great West and Mertens, that it16 would be a tough case to make, but it is not the issue in this17 case. Now -­18 QUESTION: No, but the whole thing would work if we19 could do that, wouldn't it? I mean, if we could get Mertens20 consistent with what Justice Ginsberg just read, then you would21 provide people who are hurt, in the way these plaintiffs were22 hurt, with a remedy. It wouldn't be punitive damages, but they23 would be made whole. So, if you are right in that this is24 basically a -- this is basically a claims decision and you25 shouldn't give punitives and others for the incorrect making of a13Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425claims decision. But the hole in this is that then the woman gets nothing or virtually nothing and, if we could reconsider that part, it would all work, wouldn't it?MR. ESTRADA: Well, it might, but it also works in the way it currently is for the following reason. The interaction of the structure of Section 502 and Section 503 is intended to set forth a mechanism, under the DOL regs under Section 503, to encourage the expedis -- the expeditious resolution of claims disagreements. And this is -- the statute contemplates litigation but is not about litigation. This is all about giving the benefit when it is needed and not about waiting until it no longer helps you, having bypassed all avenues you had at the time, external review, plan appeals, or maybe an action for an injunction and then suing for relief, make whole or otherwise.If I could, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reservethe remainder of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Estrada. Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A FELDMAN FOR UNITED STATES, ASAMICUS CURIAEQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, will you tell us what thegovernment thinks can be recovered under 502(a)(3) in the way of damages or other recoveries?MR. FELDMAN: Yes. As Justice Gin -- as Justice14Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Ginsberg said, our position, I think, is in footnote 13 of our2 brief, and it's a position the Department of Labor has taken in3 cases and number -­4 QUESTION: Pretty big point to be in a footnote.5 MR. FELDMAN: Well, it's -- it really isn't the issue6 in this case because our position in this case is that the claims7 are preempted by 502(a)(1)(B). But, in a case where there was a8 fiduciary involved, in the days of the divided bench, when a9 beneficiary sued a fiduciary, they weren't -- they could -- were10 able to get make whole relief. And the -- by the same -­11 QUESTION: Lest we be too sanguine about the12 application of that law in this context, I don't know any13 equitable cases that would consider make whole relief to be14 giving -- where what is at issue is merely the payment -- the15 failure to pay money, refusal to pay money. Make whole relief16 would give you what you would have done with that money if you17 had gotten it. That's very strange.18 MR. FELDMAN: You get -- there were -- there are cases19 that I -- I don't want to get too deeply into 502(a)(3)(B),20 because I don't think it's what's at issue in this case. But21 there are cases in which, for example, a trustee doesn't buy an22 insurance policy that they're supposed to buy and then the23 beneficiary can get, as a relief, whatever the value of that24 insurance policy would have been and -­25 QUESTION: Sure. But all that's going on here is that15Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the claimant was perfectly able to buy Vioxx with his own money,2 but when it was said by the insurer that they wouldn't pay for3 Vioxx, the claimant went and -- went with the drug that was4 covered. I have serious doubts whether we can take comfort in5 the fact that even if we deny relief here it'll all be okay6 because under traditional equity law, in a situation like that,7 you can -- you can get whatever you would have done had you been8 given the money. I don't know that that principle washes.9 MR. FELDMAN: Well, 502(a)(3) -- I mean, ERISA does set10 up a beneficiary trustee -- a beneficiary fiduciary type of11 relationship that does have analogies in traditional equity. But12 in any event -­13 QUESTION: And the government has taken position -­14 this is -- the footnote was not the easiest to read, but I take15 it the Department of Labor has taken the position, in some ERISA16 cases, that there would be just the kind of relief that Justice17 Scalia mentioned. Would this case fit that pattern?18 MR. FELDMAN: I -- it's not clear to me whether it19 would, because it's not clear to me whether there was a fiduciary20 involved in this case. Neither of the claimants in this case,21 neither they -- the people who denied the benefits on behalf of22 the plans may or may not have been fiduciaries.23 QUESTION: But, as Mr. Estrada just told us that, for24 these purposes, both Aetna and CIGNA would be fiduciaries.25 MR. FELDMAN: They -- well, whether the -- you know, I16Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 frankly haven't thought about whether the plan itself would be a2 fiduciary. Ordinarily, the way the ERISA scheme is supposed to3 work is, if you have a denial of benefit, you have a right to4 appeal to an appropriate named fiduciary, and at that stage,5 departmental regulations give you kind of very substantial6 procedural rights to make sure that benefits determination gets7 made very quickly and appropriately, in light of the medical8 exigencies of the case.9 QUESTION: I would like to hear your arguments on the10 preemption issue.11 MR. FELDMAN: Thank you. Our argument is that the12 Texas law provides an additional remedy to that in Section13 502(a)(1)(B), because respondents' right to recover compensatory14 and punitive damages in this case depends on their showing that15 they had a right to the benefits under the plan -- under the16 terms of their plan. The state law provides that plaintiffs must17 prove that the plan's failure to exercise what the state law says18 is due care, that their failure to exercise due care is the19 proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. The only way that20 that could be true is if the plan didn't pay benefits that it was21 obligated to pay under the terms of the plan. The plan -­22 QUESTION: Yes, but in the situation in the hospital23 case, there was no time to get relief. How could they -- how24 could they get relief from the denial of the extra day in the25 hospital between midnight and the next morning?17Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FELDMAN: Well, I -- in the first place, she was2 told before -- I think the complaint says she was told before she3 entered the hospital that she would have only one day in the4 hospital. But in addition -­5 QUESTION: Unless it was medically necessary to stay an6 extra day.7 MR. FELDMAN: Right. And I would just say there's8 about three backstops there. One is Department of Labor9 regulations say you have to make determ -- these determinations10 as soon as possible considering the medical exigencies of the11 case and she didn't -­12 QUESTION: And what does that mean in the hospital13 setting? And what -- was she going to file a complaint with the14 Department of Labor?15 MR. FELDMAN: These claims can be made orally, again,16 if the exigencies require, and she could -- she didn't try -- as17 far as we know, no one made a phone call to the insurer and said18 can I get the extra benefits; she needs it. We don't know what19 the results of that would have been.20 QUESTION: Well let's assume the case -- because your21 preemption argument would cover even the most extreme case.22 Assume the case in which the patient and the doctor both called23 the agency and appealed and they said we're too busy, we can't24 handle it and it later determines they were -- did not exercise25 due care.18Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

FELDMAN: But then -­QUESTION: Why are you preempting the state providing a remedy for that situation?MR. FELDMAN: That would have been itself a denial of their obligations under the Department's claim processing -­ claims processing procedures. But let me say there's also -­QUESTION: It would have been a denial, but it wouldn't have given her the extra day in the hospital?MR. FELDMAN: Right, but there are other backstops for her getting the extra day in the hospital. She is, at that point, in the same position as anyone else who can't pay for another day in the hospital but they need it.QUESTION: I understand.MR. FELDMAN: It's up to her doctor, with whom she has a doctor patient relationship that's a consensual relationship for providing medical treatment. It's up to her doctor to decide when she should be discharged from the hospital and when she shouldn't.QUESTION: But she can't -­QUESTION: But the question we really are facing is whether the State of Texas is denied the authority to provide a remedy in that situation.MR. FELDMAN: Yeah, but the State of Texas has many remedies to make sure the hospitals don't discharge people who need an extra day in the hospital and medical ethics provides19Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 additional reasons why doctors have -- cannot discharge patients2 who need an extra day in the hospital.3 QUESTION: If you take the -- the drug case, the man4 couldn't pay for the more expensive drugs. He didn't have the5 means and so he took the drug that the HMO approved with6 disastrous results. There was no -- window -- there was no time.7 He was in intense pain. He had to take something to deal with8 the pain.9 MR. FELDMAN: There was -- he took the drug, I think10 that -- the record actually shows, I think, that he took the drug11 for several weeks before he had -- before he had the problem with12 it. He could have been pursuing the plan remedies all throughout13 that. In addition, Texas law, like the law of 44 other states,14 provides for an independent review mechanism which is also15 designed to decide at the front end whether -- what benefits16 you're entitled to. And under that mechanism he could have17 sought independent review from somebody who's independent of the18 plan, not subject to any bad incentives he might have thought the19 plan might have, to make an accurate determination of what is -­20 what he's entitled to and what he's not entitled to.21 It's -- there are -- there are a number of remedies22 that people can -- that people have in order to make sure they23 stay in the hospital. What the ERISA plan is doing here is24 simply making a benefits determination. It's a pure25 determination under ERISA and it's not based on the formation of20Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 a doctor patient relationship which the patient has with their2 doctor. It's based on their determinations under ERISA, under3 Section 502(a)(1)(A) -- Section 502 of ERISA, Congress drew a4 very careful balance between the needs for a prompt and quick5 claims processing procedure that will be effective and will6 decide in advance whether you get benefits and the public7 interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefits plans8 and encouraging the provision of benefits under those plans.9 To allow states to essentially say, as the state has10 said here, well, we're going to provide an additional remedy that11 Congress rejected when it drew that careful balance, would be an12 -- as the Court said in Pilot Life, to completely undermine13 Congress's decisions about how this system should be structured.14 The state has ample authority to address medical malpractice in15 the state in between -- between doctors and patients where that16 doc -- consensual doctor patient relationship has been formed.17 What it doesn't have authority to do is to take its -- that18 medical malpractice law and extend it, not to the normal doctor19 patient situation, but to a situation that is governed by Federal20 law under Section 502 and by the remedies that Congress chose21 where appropriate.22 QUESTION: Is there any indication in the record23 whether these individuals did not have the funds to stay in the24 hospital another day or to buy Vioxx?25 MR. FELDMAN: There's -- I don't think there's any21Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 indication of whether they did or not. And, in fact, I don't -­2 I think that under the co-payment of the Aetna plan, Vioxx3 wouldn't have been terribly expensive because Aetna would have4 picked up some of tab for that. But all of those would be facts5 relating what's in the plan. I think they all just point out6 that the question in this case is what the plan provided and did7 the plaintiffs get what the plan provided. And this Court8 decided, in Pilot Life and in Metropolitan Life against Taylor,9 and it reaffirmed two terms ago in the Rush Prudential case, that10 those questions are ERISA questions and Congress decided that -­11 set in place a set of remedies that allow for very substantial12 rights to determine whether you're entitled to the benefit, but13 limited your rights to sue for pun -- for compensatory and14 especially punitive damages afterwards, because there's also, on15 the other side of the balance, the need to encourage employers to16 provide healthcare and to create ERISA plans.17 And, as I said, to allow states to interfere in that18 balance and, as Texas has done here, to create a cause of action19 which is essentially for the denial of a plan benefit, and that's20 something that the plaintiffs, I think, have to prove in order to21 prevail, is to directly interfere with that decision that22 Congress made.23 QUESTION: But is it not correct that those cases did24 not involve treatment decisions, Pilot Life and Metropolitan?25 MR. FELDMAN: Those cases involved disability22Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

YOUNG8 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS9 MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:10 I want to focus on the narrow Federal jurisdictional11 issue because this case -- these two cases come to the Court12 based on the Federal removal doctrine that goes under the rubric13 of complete preemption. In each of this Court's cases on14 complete preemption, the plaintiff's cause of action, while not15 citing to the Federal statute, almost exactly duplicated the16 Federal remedy. Here we don't have that.17 Here, what Texas has done is to fill a vacuum and say18 we are going to set out a professional medical standard of care19 when HMOs make medical necessity decisions. Under the HMO's20 position, they would be free to say we're going to use the21 medical necessity standard of a witch doctor or whatever we22 decide it is on today's basis without any reference to objective23 medical standards. Now, their medical necessity statement24 doesn't say that, but under their argument today, they would be25 free to do that.23Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: What do you mean free to do it? They would be subject to -- to an appeal and an appeal to an independent authority.MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor. They -- yes, Justice.QUESTION: And if they didn't pay up, they would be -­ would be liable to damages.MR. YOUNG: If there is time for an appeal and if the circumstances would permit an appeal. An appeal is a great thing in these cases. Independent review is a great thing -­QUESTION: No. What I'm -- I'm just speaking to your point of whether they're Scott free to do whatever they want. They surely aren't, you know. Even if the appeal comes afterwards, the claimant can get the money that's owed and the relief provided by 502(a).MR. YOUNG: But, Justice Scalia, in these two cases,the patients did what the HMO wanted and when, under their argument, if the patients do what the HMO wants and it turns out those were bad medical decisions, there is no remedy. ERISA -­QUESTIONS: They don't do what the HMO -- all the HMO said is, look, under the plan, as we understand it and as we judge medical necessity, we don't have to pay for Vioxx. Now, if you want to have Vioxx, buy it yourself, and I gather there was some co-payment that would have been given, and if their doctor thought that Vioxx was really essential, surely the doctor would have abided, you know, pony up the money.24Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

YOUNG: Well -­QUESTION: But to say that the plan condemned them to not using Vioxx is simply not true. All you're talking about here is money. The claimant didn't want to lay out the additional money for the Vioxx.MR. YOUNG: Well, the truth is, Your Honor, that neither of these claimants would have needed health insurance if they had the independent means to just whip out a gold card and pay for the drug.QUESTION: See, that's why I'm thinking that Vioxx is not that -- you know, on your argument you were just making, and I'll only lead you into this red herring once.MR. YOUNG: Okay.QUESTION: But it would all work, you see, if I have a trust, the trust is supposed to buy me an insurance policy, and through total fault of the trust it doesn't, and the house burns down, that equitable relief appropriate would be consequential damages of the value of the house. Now, if that were an appropriate case, other equitable relief, this whole thing would work and you wouldn't be having to fill a vacuum.MR. YOUNG: But under this Court's opinions previously under 502, that remedy and those kinds of relief are not available.QUESTION: So you see then the logical point where I'm ­ - I'd like to say modify those perhaps, but, well, the very fact25Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that you're trying to fill this hole here proves the point,2 because if there is a hole, it's because the court has3 interpreted this statute perhaps wrongly as the Federal relief4 beingA,B,andC. MaybeitshouldbeA,B,C,andD,andso5 what the state's trying to do here, is add D. And the one thing6 theycan'tdo,isaddDtoA,B,andC.7 MR. YOUNG: It's true, Your Honor, that there is this8 hole, but that is not the reason that we should prevail on this9 narrow jurisdictional issue, because it's the source of the duty.10 The duty that arises here is not based on what is in the plan11 document on medical necessity. It comes from the external duty12 that is imposed by Texas statute to meet the professional medical13 standard of care.14 QUESTION: Well, how different is the question of the15 merits here, whether you should prevail and the question of16 complete preemption which is raised in the removal issue?17 MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice they are different.18 Because, in this narrow issue, the complete preemption issue,19 especially when one looks at Pilot Life and Taylor. Those two20 decisions relied very heavily on section 301 cases, the Labor21 Management Relations Act cases. But if you look at those cases22 since Pilot Life and Taylor, every time the duty arose from23 something separate than the collective bargaining agreement,24 every time this Court has said that there is no complete25 preemption.26Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: So your view is you could prevail on the2 propriety of removal, because there's not complete preemption,3 and yet go back and lose on the issue of whether your claim is in4 fact preempted?5 MR. YOUNG: Yes Your Honor, that is the way complete6 versus conflict preemption can work and the way that the fifth7 circuit said it could work. Now I want to be clear, we don't8 think that we lose on Section 515 preemption either. And in fact9 every time this Court has gone through an ERISA analysis and10 found Section 502 preemption, every time, it first goes through11 the Section 514 step. Now that brings me to something that may12 be sensitive in light of one of the opinions issued today. But I13 want to talk a little bit about the insurance savings clause14 under Section 514, because it's very important. This Court, in15 Rush Prudential said, that when a state regulates medical16 necessity, as Texas does here, that falls within the insurance17 saving clause. Clearly this statute falls within the insurance18 saving clause, especially as applied in these two cases.19 QUESTION: Well that's contrary to Pilot Life, isn't it?20 MR. YOUNG: No, Your Honor, and for this reason. While21 Pilot Life has a statement in there, that --22 QUESTION: A very definite statement.23 MR. YOUNG: that 502, might trump and probably24 according to Pilot Life could trump the insurance saving clause,25 the Court also found very clearly that the insurance saving27Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 clause wasn't met in that case. And this Court has never faced2 what this Court, the majority in Rush Prudential called the3 forced choice, between an insurance saving clause and Section4 502. And it's very important to look at the plain text of5 Section 514. Because Section 514 (b) the insurance saving6 clause, says very clearly nothing in this sub-chapter can be7 construed to preempt.8 QUESTION: The strangeness of your argument is that9 you say all right, Pilot Life faced that issue, and says the10 savings clause doesn't apply in the complete preemption11 situation. Your argument is that in effect by defining the -­12 the benefit -- by Texas' act of trying to define the benefit13 denial as equivalent to the practice of medicine, it therefore14 gets us back into the insurance saving clause. It seems to me an15 irrational logical leap. 502 says we get out of the insurance16 savings clause because of complete preemption, Texas says by17 saying what you're really doing in denialing -- denying a18 benefit, is practicing medicine. We get back into the business19 of insurance, and the insurance savings clause applies. I just20 can't follow that.21 MR. YOUNG: Your Honor, the confusion arises because we22 don't write -- we don't write the terms of the HMO's coverage if23 you will. They're the ones that say, in determining what we will24 pay for, if you will, we are going to make medical decisions.25 QUESTION: Well they're the ones that -­28Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

They're giving out money.MR. YOUNG: Your Honor.QUESTION: They're not giving care at all, the caregiver was the individual's doctor who said stay in another day or take Vioxx. The care -- all this company was doing was looking at the contract, do we owe any money.MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia -­QUESTION: That's not giving care.MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia I think it would be veryhelpful to look at when a payment decision could be made and when it is made in these cases. You start an episode of care here, you finish it. The bill comes due to make the payment. Here the HMOs don't wait until the bill comes due to make the payment decision. They make the decision as part of a medical necessity determination, in here, earlier in the middle, concurrent review, or prospective review is the technical term.QUESTION: But it's a decision to pay money?MR.

Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: It's both. It's both and the trouble with it2 is, if you -- you could have marvelous laws in Texas governing3 pension trustee behavior, governing all trustee behavior. But4 Congress says well you can't apply your marvelous rules to ERISA5 plan trustees. And now it seems to have said, and you can't6 apply your marvelous medical rules, even to a doctor, where what7 the doctor is doing in that instance is not acting as a doctor8 for treating the patient, but rather acting as a determiner of9 whether he will get the ERISA plan payment. And what we have in10 your case I guess is a person who does both. He does something11 of both. But where they are inextricably mixed and where there12 is a very large share of making the benefit determination, is it13 fair to say that Congress would have wanted the Texas law to14 apply?15 MR. YOUNG: Yes, because of Pegram, this court in Pegram16 said very clearly -­17 QUESTION: In Pegram you were dealing with the doctor18 who was the treating physician, that is precisely what Justice19 Bryer has just defined as not being the case here.20 MR.

I don't think AETNA8 cared a bit. All AETNA cared about was whether it had to pay for9 it. That's all.10 MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia, if that were true then they11 would make these decisions at the end. Because by shifting -­12 QUESTION: It's important to the patient to know.13 Because the patient when -- when the patient finds out that if14 you take Vioxx, you'll have to pay for it yourself, the patient15 can then ask the doctor, look doc, is it really important that I16 take Vioxx or is this other stuff in your judgment as the17 treating physician, is this other stuff good or not -- good18 enough. It seems to me you want that decision to be made early.19 MR. YOUNG: Well, the truth is that making the decision here20 shifts the risk. If it's made at the back end the risk is21 shifted to the pharmacy, or the doctor, or the hospital. When22 it's made here, it puts the risk squarely on the patient.23 QUESTION: Well except that you say when it's made here24 it is the choice of the doctor, the pharmacy or the hospital to25 seek that judgment early, isn't it.

The doctor could have kept the patient in the hospital another day, and sent the bill in. The insurance plan didn't force an early decision. It gave an option of an early decision, so they would know where they stood.MR.

YOUNG: I guess I come back to the Chief Justice'spoint which is we could have a situation where Pilot Life preemption could occur, but the Taylor holding is the one we're most concerned about, and here we are not trying to duplicate a claim that would be made under ERISA, under an ERISA duty.And that leads me back to something else that's come up. The ERISA and it's regulations say nothing about setting a medical standard of care, when these medical judgments are made. That's an indication that it was left to the states, and should be left to the states. But this Court could certainly indicate, well this may still be preempted, but it shouldn't be removed to Federal court, under complete preemption doctrines.QUESTION: Well how would that advance the general law at all? I mean, if the merits are decided against you, you know, I don't think we took this case to decide some question of removal jurisdiction, but I -- perhaps my colleagues don't agree with me.MR. YOUNG: Well, that is the very narrow issue that in fact certiorari was granted on. And it is an issue that this Court last ruled on in the Anderson case last Term, and that case is34Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

There the majority found that the claim, while not citing to Federal usury law duplicated precisely and exactly Federal usury law. And it was in essence, a Federal usury claim. Here our claim is not one for benefits. It couldn't be, there's no claim for benefits to be made.

YOUNG: Really Your Honor, in truth these decisions are never expressed by the utilization nurse at the hospital as a payment issue. She says you've got to go home now.QUESTION: Well let's go back to my question -- I didn't mean to go off on a tangent. My question was, doesn't Pilot Life, turn on a determination which governs the payment or non payment of benefits?MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor.

Their definition of medical4 necessity, what they say they will and won't do. And still5 violate the Texas standard for medical judgments and that's the6 problem.7 QUESTION: It is indeed.

YOUNG: It would be an undisputed fact. It would be21 for example in these two cases. It's undisputed that Ruby Calad22 could get unlimited days in the hospital.

Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 defense, rather as part of the cause of action, you can avoid2 preemption?3 MR. YOUNG: No I'm not saying that Your Honor, but the4 gravamen of my case for purposes of looking at complete5 preemption, the issue you were concerned about in Anderson, is6 what are the elements of my claim. They do not duplicate an7 ERISA claim, they don't even duplicate an ERISA duty. Now it may8 be at the end of the day Section 514 kicks in.

MATTAX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the10 Court. The Texas legislature has imposed a duty of ordinary care11 on managed care entities that insert themselves into health care12 treatment decisions by exercising medical judgment to decide13 medical necessity. It is important to recognize at the outset as14 this court recognized the managed care entity is not the ERISA15 plan.16 Our statute does not impose liability on the ERISA17 plan. Our statute does not impose liability on an employer. As18 Mr. Estrada said in his argument, the whole point of the complete19 preemption and the exclusive remedies provision Section 502(a),20 is insuring employers that will have limited liabilities. Our21 statute explicitly excludes employers from liability. And22 therefore the concerns of Section 502(a) are not at play in the23 Texas statute. The reason the Texas statute was passed was24 because managed care entities, HMOs and other varieties and25 forms, had decided to exercise medical judgment. And it is that39Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 duty that the state is regulating. Which is what I think2 distinguishes this case from Pilot Life. Going back and looking3 -­4 QUESTION: How does it distinguish it from Pilot Life? I5 mean Pilot Life is talking about the insurance part, wasn't it.6 MR. MATTAX: Yes, Your Honor.7 QUESTION: And then they said that even though8 apparently on it's face had to do with insurance and you'd think9 it would have been taken out, it wasn't taken out because of the10 fact that it interfered with the basic purposes of the act.11 MR. MATTAX: Pilot Life was based on the Court's12 complete preemption decision in Allis-Chalmers versus Lueck.13 QUESTION: Uh-huh.14 MR. MATTAX: And in that case the Court recognized that the15 tort claim that was being alleged was derived from the general16 proposition to perform contracts in good faith. And the duty17 that the Court was looking at in Allis-Chalmers, and also Pilot18 Life, was the duty to enforce the contract that was the ERISA19 plan therefore implicating complete preemption. However the20 Court explicitly said in Allis-Chalmers, that Congress did not21 intend to give substantive provisions the force of Federal law,22 ousting any inconsistent state regulations, because such a rule23 would allow labor unions, and unionized employees the power to24 exempt themselves from whatever state labor standards they25 disfavored. And again the Texas statute is not imposing any duty40Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 on the plan.2 QUESTION: Yes, but is it not true that in order to3 recover under the Texas statute, not only do you have to prove a4 violation of the duty to use the due care and so forth. But you5 also have to prove a violation of the plan?6 MR. MATTAX: No I disagree. The revision in the act is7 setup such that if a managed care entity were to come in and say8 well I did not exercise any medical judgment, or I did not make9 any decisions that affected the treatment, they could come in as10 a defense and say, the reason I did not make any medical judgment11 was because the plan didn't allow me to. The plan simply12 excluded that completely in a pure eligibility decision in the13 court's words in Pegram. So the cause of action that's alleged14 in the state statute is that particular managed care entity,15 exercised medical judgment. And that medical judgment resulted16 in an injury to me, and I think -­17 QUESTION: But it's also a defense that I did not fail18 to make any delay, I did not delay or fail to make any payment19 due.20 MR. MATTAX: And if -­21 QUESTION: Isn't that a defense?22 MR. MATTAX: The statute provides that as a defense.23 Again to make a reflection of, to show that in that particular24 case, I as a managed care entity did not exercise any medical25 judgments, because that's the defense -­41Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But you exercise a medical judgment when you refuse to make a payment. You're deciding it's not medically necessary.MR. MATTAX: Correct. And if they're making a decision with regards to medical judgment. And they are exercising that judgment not according to our standard of care. We are imposing that on the managed care entity.QUESTION: No you're not. You're saying even if it's not according to your standard of care, if it is not due under the plan you're not liable.MR. MATTAX: And what I'm saying there is -­QUESTION: Have you said that?MR. MATTAX: That is a defense to the claim. And underthis Court's decision in Caterpillar versus Williams a defense being raised to a claim does not create complete preemption.QUESTION: Back to Pilot Life. In my understanding of the case, maybe I've got this wrong. Tell me if I do. There's a plan that says, an ERISA plan says we pay you for a treatment that's medically necessary. Then there's a person, it may be an insurance company, it may be a doctor, maybe somebody says it isn't medically necessary. The Plaintiff thinks it is medically necessary, so the question is whether the plan did what it said. Now you have a way of -- I mean isn't that what this is about?MR. MATTAX: There's separate duties involved here. There is a duty under the plan, and the beneficiary can go to the42Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 plan and say because you hired this managed care entity to make2 this judgment, I would like to get the benefits under the plan3 and that would be a claim against the benefit plan. What Texas4 has done has said, when a managed care entity, an HMO goes and5 sells his products to a plan, or goes and sells its services to a6 plan and is going to exercise medical judgment, then the state of7 Texas will regulate the exercise of the medical judgment of that8 managed care entity.9 QUESTION: It's not just an HMO, it's also a health10 insurance carrier. Here, AETNA.11 MR. MATTAX: It is theoretically anyone who exercises12 medical judgment that influences care. But I think it is13 important to recognize that the reasons for managed care as14 stated by both the Petitioners here, and I would briefly quote15 from a CIGNA brief, page 44. Utilization, review techniques are16 designed to ensure that quality care is delivered as cost17 efficiently as possible. The letter to Mr. Davila's doctor,18 specifically says - - this in AETNA's petition or Appendix 88 - ­19 as part of our commitment to provide access to quality care.20 What the Court needs to recognize if I may, is that prior to the21 rise of managed care, decisions were made on a retrospective22 basis. An insurer would say, well we've looked at this, we do23 not believe it was medically necessary, we're not going to pay24 for it. The difference now is, managed care has taken on the25 rubric of saying, we will manage care, we will determine what is43Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 best for the patient and we will do that by dictating what is2 going to be paid for, and not paid for.3 QUESTION: But it's just -- even at the early stage,4 it's simply a statement, we will not pay for it. That doesn't5 mean that the patient can't do it other ways. It just means that6 this particular program won't pay for it.7 MR. MATTAX: Well respectfully the statement is we don't8 think it's good for you. We don't think this care is appropriate9 for your particular situation. And there's no reason -­10 QUESTION: Well isn't it more a question of medical11 necessity. That is the plan says we'll cover it in case of12 medical necessity, and the plan says we don't think there's13 medical necessity here.14 MR. MATTAX: Well the plan itself can put in as a term15 medical necessity, but the plan is not making the determination16 of whether it's medically necessary or not. They have hired17 someone to make that determination for them. They may -­18 QUESTION: Well then it's certainly it's by the plan. I19 mean the fact that an agent makes it rather than the plan doesn't20 make any difference.21 MR. MATTAX: But the reason to make that decision is22 because the medical necessity decision is a result of a23 determination by that managed care entity that they are going to24 manage the care that's provided. Again the letter that was sent25 -­44Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well how much does that advance the argument?2 I mean it's still a decision we won't pay for it.3 MR. MATTAX: But the decision is based on a4 determination by a managed care entity that in their medical5 judgment that the care is not necessary. And what Texas has6 said, with respect to that managed care entity. Again not the7 plan. Is that when you are going to exercise medical judgment8 and that is going to -- as a matter of practical reality, impact9 the care a patient receives and potentially cause damage to that10 patient, then we will regulate that as a separate duty, separate11 and apart from ERISA.12 QUESTION: But you could say that in respect to any13 benefit of a plan. Let's imagine a plan with millions of14 different benefits. Whenever a benefit is turned down, there15 will always be a human being who told the plan manager it isn't16 called for. Now a state could come in and regulate their human17 being, those human beings in their capacity as professionals and18 say whenever they make such a mistake, they've made a19 professional misjudgment and we give you an extra remedy here.20 And that seems to be the thing that this statute forbids. I21 don't see how to get around it. I'd like you to tell me how to22 get around it. But I don't see it at the moment.23 MR. MATTAX: And I believe the answer to that question24 is what the statute is concerned about is limiting and defining25 the liability of employers and plan sponsors. And a statute that45Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425regulates the conduct of a third party who sells their services to that plan or plan sponsor, has no impact on the liability of that plan or that plan sponsor. And in this particular case, in Texas we have made a determination that with managed care entities as an entity, be it an HMO, be it a PPO, exercising medical judgment, we are regulating the medical judgment of that third party.QUESTION: You really don't think -- well never mind. CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Mattax.MR. MATTAX: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Estrada, you have threeminutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADAON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSQUESTION: Mr. Estrada, you can address what you wouldlike but there are three points that have come up during the Respondent's presentation that I'd be interested with a response to.Number one, is it true that the people who make the decisions for your client must be medical doctors in Texas?MR. ESTRADA: Well it is true by virtue of DOL regulations which provide that no claim may be turned down, without input from a medical professional in the relevant area.QUESTION: My other two points are, what is your response to the point that the plan is not liable under Texas law46Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-­MR. ESTRADA: Well -­QUESTION: -- just the insurance company here.MR. ESTRADA: That was going to be one of my points thatI deal with -­QUESTION: Just so you can -­MR. ESTRADA: That is consistent with every case, from Pilot Life, Taylor, and Ingersoll-Rand. Because in each of those cases, you were dealing with an insurance company that was acting as a claim administrator or insurer with respect to an ERISA plan. And if memory serves, the claim was made as well in Pegram, and the Court dealt with it at the top of page 223 of 530 US. by pointing out that a contract between an HMO and the plan may itself contain elements of a plan to the extent that it governs the circumstances under which benefits may be obtained.QUESTION: Lastly. Is there anything to the notion that there is no preemption when the interference with the plan, if there is any, only comes by way of an affirmative defense.MR. ESTRADA: No and in fact it is also not true in this case that that's so. Because you have been citing subsection (c)(2) of the statute, here under Section (d) it is affirmatively stated that nothing in the act shall be construed to provide -­ to require the provision of something that is not covered and that is at page -- also 59 (a) of the AETNA...Just let me take one second to make two points. It is47Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of course open to Texas to have a law that regulates the practice2 of medicine, by telling hospitals do not discharge somebody who3 needs care. And there is nothing in the Federal statute that4 would keep them from doing that. In fact we have a Federal5 statute in PALA that does something similar with respect to6 hospitals that take in medicare money. With respect to how7 quickly we could do these things Justice Stevens, the DOL8 regulations say that consistent with the urgency of the situation9 it must be done as soon as possible. It can be done informally10 and the doctor may act for the patient to pursue all of the plan11 appeals and that is at pages 17(a) and 3(a) of the Appendix to12 the blue brief.13 Brief word about the insurance savings clause, I will14 not belabor it. There is a footnote in one of the briefs in the15 Court of Appeals. It doesn't raise the clause as opposed to the16 section 502 issue, but the acid test is that there was no mention17 of the clause, in the brief in opposition. Under this Court's18 rules and Oklahoma City versus Tuttle that is completely19 reclusive. Should we need to reach it I will point out that one20 of the response -- one of the petitioners in this case is a self21 funded plan, in the CIGNA case, which would be saved by the22 Deemer clause even if the insurance clause did apply in this23 case. And that is to both of them, the question whether the24 insurance savings clause does apply was conclusively resolved by25 Pilot Life, has never been revisited by the Court, and that Pilot48Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
