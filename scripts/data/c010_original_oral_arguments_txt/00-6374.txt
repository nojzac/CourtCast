Betty Montgomery.          Mr. Sutton.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. SUTTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          There are two arguments that I would like topress this morning.  The first is that a timely notice ofappeal will never be dismissed for lack of jurisdictionsolely because it lacks a signature.  The second is analternative argument, and that's that a typewrittensignature would suffice to meet any such requirement.          Let me start with the sixth circuit's review ofthis particular case.  In their view, there is ajurisdictional signature requirement in light of thethirty-day rule under Appellate Rule 4, and in light ofCivil Rule 11, which indeed does contain a signaturerequirement.  The problem with the sixth circuit'sreliance on Civil Rule 11 is that it not only contains asignature requirement, but it also contains a remedy forthe absence of a signature.  And in this particular case,everyone agrees -- the court-appointed amicus curiae3         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    included -- that Mr. Becker was never given an opportunity 2    to correct this omission of a signature, whether at the 3    district court or the court of appeals level. 4              QUESTION:  I should know this -- when you file a 5    notice of appeal, do you file with the district court? 6              MR. SUTTON:  You do, Your Honor. 7              QUESTION:  So Rule 11 applies at that point? 8              MR. SUTTON:  It does technically.  In fact, 9    Appellate Rule 1 arguably acknowledges that when it says10    all filings in a district court -- all filings in the11    courts of appeals that have been made through district12    courts have to comply with district court rules.  So it13    does seem, as odd as it would appear, that Civil Rule 1114    does apply to a notice of appeal, keeping in mind that15    Civil Rule 11 is pretty broad in nature.  It says16    pleadings and quote other papers.  So arguably that does17    include a notice of appeal.18              QUESTION:  If I were on the court of appeals and19    I thought that Rule 11 requires a signature --20              MR. SUTTON:  Handwritten signature.21              QUESTION:  -- and I was a little fussy about it,22    what would I do?  Just under Rule 11 just say, well, will23    you please cure this non-jurisdictional deficiency?24              MR. SUTTON:  It is problematic, Your Honor, and25    I think the answer is Appellate Rule 1 which does, as I4               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425noted, make clear that you do have to comply with thedistrict court rules and the Rules of Civil Procedure.          In light of Appellate Rule 1, a court of appealsor a court of appeals clerk's office would be fully withinits rights to contact in this case Mr. Becker, saying, Mr.Becker, we see you've typed your signature.  In thiscircuit we prefer a handwritten pen and ink signature.          QUESTION:  And please clean up your act alittle, okay?          MR. SUTTON:  Well --          QUESTION:  Clean -- clean it up within thirtydays.  I mean, that's the problem.  You do have a remedy,but why doesn't the remedy have to have been appliedwithin the thirty-day time limit?          MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, the only thing that hasto be done within thirty days is to make sure you'veestablished an intent to appeal.  You can establish anintent to appeal as this Court is --          QUESTION:  Does it say that -- it says you haveto establish an intent to appeal within thirty days?  Ithought it said that you had to file within thirty days anotice of appeal which includes a signature, which I taketo mean a written signature in normal parts.          MR. SUTTON:  Well, as this Court has construedRule 4 and Rule 3 of the Appellate Rules in Smith and5         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    Torres, it has said the touchstone for jurisdiction is to2    establish the intent to appeal within thirty days.  That's3 --4              QUESTION:  I don't know how good law Smith is.5              MR. SUTTON:  You don't know how good law Smith6 is?7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yeah. There were a couple of casesdecided back in the 1960s that really stretch thelanguage, I think.          MR. SUTTON:  Well, I may be referring to thewrong Smith decision.  I'm referring to Smith v. Barry,Your Honor, which is a 9-0 decision in which the Courtsaid that a merits brief would suffice to establish a --or could suffice to establish intent to appeal withinthirty days.  That was the case in which the appellantmissed the time for filing the notice of appeal becausethey weren't sure when -- they hadn't -- weren't sure whenthe notice -- the judgment was entered.  They thenfortuitously filed their merits brief within the thirty-day period, and this Court said in a 9-0 decision that --          QUESTION:  I wasn't referring to Smith.          MR. SUTTON:  I do think there are some oldercases that aren't necessarily reflected in the currentrules, but --          QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, could we go back to your                             6         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    answer to Justice Kennedy about Rule 11 -- isn't the 2    answer on the other side that once you file the notice of 3    appeal, authority over the case passes from the district 4    court to the court of appeals, so at that point, up until 5    the notice of appeal, you're in the district court.  Once 6    you file that notice, you are in the court of appeals and 7    Rule 11 is a rule directed to district court and not the 8    court of appeals. So the cure that Rule 11 provides, at 9    least so the argument goes, would not be available in the10    court of appeals.11              MR. SUTTON:  And Your Honor, that is why I was12    relying on Appellate Rule 1 which incorporates those13    rules, and that would therefore give appellate courts14    authority to make sure that someone did correct the15    signature.  If they wanted at that point to decide, well,16    if you're not going to correct it -- you're going to be17    unrepentant when it comes to this particular requirement,18    at that point we are going to dismiss your appeal, and in19    fact will do so on the merits.20              QUESTION:  Of course, I suppose if you haven't21    filed a proper notice of appeal, you're still in the22    district court.  I mean, you could argue it the other way23    that if indeed a signature is required and you file it24    without a signature in the court of appeals, it is25    ineffective and so the case remains in the district court.7               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. SUTTON:  What the court has said and what 2    the rules reflect is that as soon as the district court 3    clerk receives the notice of appeal, it doesn't say 4    anything about validity, it is immediately sent to the 5    court of appeals. And I think -- but I think that does 6    raise a second answer to Mr. Baker's argument -- the point 7    Justice Ginsburg is getting at, it is true that to find a 8    notice of appeal immediately vests jurisdiction in the 9    court of appeals over the merits of the case, but that10    doesn't preclude district courts from acting on collateral11    matters; that's when they can act on stay motions, bond12    motions, attorney fee motions. This arguably could be such13    a collateral act.  It wouldn't go to the merits of the14    case.  It would, however, and I think there would be one15    problem here, and that would be interpretation.  The16    district courts would have authority to enforce this as a17    jurisdictional rule, and you would have district court18    judges dismissing appeals of their own cases.  That seems19    problematic, and I think kind --20              QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Sutton, the Federal Rule21    of Appellate Procedure 3 does say that a pro se notice of22    appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer --23              MR. SUTTON:  Yes.24              QUESTION:  -- which gives some indication that a25    signature is expected.8               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, and if Icould answer this question, it may be helpful to belooking at the rules.  I am looking at the State of Ohio'sred brief, I'm at 5(A) where they've got a helpfulcollection of what I think were pertinent rules.          QUESTION:  What page?          MR. SUTTON:  5(A).          QUESTION:  5(A).          MR. SUTTON:  I'm at the Appendix -- so it's thevery back.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. SUTTON:  And Justice O'Connor correctly ispointing to what I think is the best argument that hasbeen made -- the amicus curiae argument -- and that'sAppellate Rule 3(C)(2) which does refer to the wordsigner, and it does come out of nowhere -- that there isnothing else in the Appellate Rules that refers to theverbs sign, or the noun sign, or a signature, and suddenlyin 1993 they do this.          Well, I guess one quick question is if Mr.Baker's interpretation is correct, how in the world wouldyou enforce it?  Put yourself in the position of the poorclerk of, let's say, the sixth circuit.  They get, let'ssay, Mr. Becker's notice of appeal but instead of atypewritten signature, it just says Becker in the caption,9         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    Becker in the body, blank -- we'll say for the sake of 2    argument -- signature line.  How would you know whether 3    the person is represented or not?  You would have no way 4    of knowing whether the attorney -- you don't have to sign 5    rule -- or the pro se -- you do have to sign rule,6 applies. 7              Indeed, the only way to enforce it would have 8    the clerk do what I think they should be doing in these 9    cases, which is picking up the phone and calling and10    saying you need to be signing, you need to include that11    appellant.12              Of course if the question under Mr. Baker's rule13    was the clerk now calls and says are you represented,14    well, there is a good answer and a bad answer to that15    question.  If you say you're represented, you're okay.16    Jurisdiction vested, you didn't have to sign, and if you17    say you're pro se, you're gone.  So I can't imagine that's18    what they meant, given that particular problem.19              The only problem with it -- there is actually a20    few -- is if you turn the page to 6(a) and look at Rule21 3(C)(4) --22              QUESTION:  Let me interrupt you for a second23    with that first hypothetical, you're assuming that he24    calls a person up and he says he is represented, but then25    everything is okay?10               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1 2 3 4 5 6    anything. 7              MR. SUTTON:  Exactly, which does happen.  Some 8    of the lower court cases are cases where even the attorney 9    didn't sign -- in other words, you don't have to be a pro10    se litigant to make a mistake.  I mean, many of the lower11    court cases involve non-pro se situations.  You've got a12    caption, notice of appeal, no signature at all.13              QUESTION:  And your position is that if there's14    an unsigned notice of appeal, it vests jurisdiction if the15    man has a lawyer, but it does not if the man does not have16    a lawyer?  I mean, you're saying --17              MR. SUTTON:  That's Mr. Baker's -- that's Mr.18    Baker's -- excuse, me that's not his position.  That's a19    consequence of his position in my view, and I'm making the20    point I can't imagine doing that.  I mean, that's utterly21    bizarre.  But I think it's confirmed -- this, the reading22 --23              QUESTION:  Well, maybe the answer is that there24    shouldn't be jurisdiction in either case if nobody signed25 anything.11               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          MR. SUTTON:  Because Mr. Baker, I think, as hehas to say --          QUESTION:  But no lawyer signed anything. Youare assuming that there would be appeals in which thelawyer signed them -- filed them without ever signing1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  Well, that may be the right res -- the best policy, but there's nothing that supports thatview.  There is nothing in appellate rules that says as toindividuals represented by counsel -- they must sign.That requirement doesn't exist anywhere, so that we wouldbe making up after the fact, right now, just for DaleBecker's case.          QUESTION:  Well, while you're on that, I knowyou want to read number 4 which says if you make amistake, it's a stupid mistake; it doesn't count.          MR. SUTTON:  And 3(A)(2) while we're at it.          QUESTION:  I realize.          MR. SUTTON:  Yes, yes.          QUESTION:  All right.  That says that at the topof page 6(A).          MR. SUTTON:  Exactly.          QUESTION:  But I did have a question direct --          MR. SUTTON:  Justice Breyer, can I just add one?You're doing a very good job for me, but I just want toadd this point -- the clause you are relying -- you arepointed out was added in 1993.  In other words, it wasadded the same time Appellate Rule 3(C)(2) was added.These were all post-Torres amendments liberalizing, makingit easier to indicate an intent to -- I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  I mean, just while you were on the                            12         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    jurisdictional mysticism of, you know, whether it 2    dissolves or where the jurisdiction is, as I read this, 3    and tell me if this is correct or not, whether it supports 4    you or not, I want to know if it is right. 5              As I read it, if your notice complies with all 6    the conditions of Rule 4, it is valid.  Nowhere in that 7    does it say that you actually have to sign.  So suppose 8    you don't sign it?  It's still valid. 9              MR. SUTTON:  Right.10              QUESTION:  It still does everything the thing11    does, but under Rule 11 if you didn't sign it, it could be12    stricken.  It doesn't say it wasn't valid; it says13    specifically what you do.  You failed to sign it;14    therefore the valid notice would be stricken if somebody15    discovers it wasn't signed. But before you strike it, you16    give a person a chance to sign it.17              MR. SUTTON:  Yes.18              QUESTION:  Is that right?19              MR. SUTTON:  Yes.20              QUESTION:  So all this jurisdictional stuff is21    beside the point, because the rules are fairly clear that22    there is just -- even if it isn't signed, it acts just23    like it was signed, but it is subject to being stricken.24              MR. SUTTON:  In the first respect and that25    respect you've made the argument that --13               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, let me go back --          MR. SUTTON:  That's right.          QUESTION:  That's right.          QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, we go back to the problemthat you and discussed before in relation to JusticeBreyer's question.  The argument that Rule 11 is out ofit.  Once you file the notice of appeal, authority passesto the court of appeals; therefore, the part of Rule 11that says you can hear it is no longer operative becausethat rule is directed to district courts and not court ofappeals, and it sets the argument.          MR. SUTTON:  And you're in this -- you know --metaphysical netherworld where you can never correct andyou can never appeal.          QUESTION:  But in the real world I'm wonderinghow this mistake -- who caught it?  Because there wasalready a briefing schedule when this turned up.  Whofound that the notice of appeal hadn't been signed?          MR. SUTTON:  I have no idea.  I mean, beforethis, before Mr. Becker's case the sixth circuit had ageneral rule that they'd applied only in multipleappellant pro se cases where the absence of, quote, asignature created this jurisdictional defect, and that's,they dismissed the appellants who had not signed.  And Iassume what happened, but again, I am assuming, I have no14         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    idea what happened.  All I know is that it took seven 2    months for the appeal to be dismissed.  So that leads me 3    to believe this went to the section of the sixth circuits 4    that handles those types of appeals. 5              Someone, at least partly correctly, realized 6    their Mattingly Rule, saw that you had the typewritten 7    signature, and I guess in an act of, you know, precision, 8    at least in their view, thought that didn't count, but 9    didn't give Mr. Becker an opportunity to argue otherwise10    that, you know, his typewritten signature would suffice11    or, for that matter, to make the point you should never12    apply this multiple party rule on the contest of a single13    appellant who's put his name on the notice of appeal three14 times.15              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton -- oh, excuse me.  You16    mentioned the multiple appellants, and that was the17    problem of one person filing a notice of appeal, putting18    down a lot of other names, and you didn't know whether the19    other names really wanted to appeal. How is that situation20    handled today?21              MR. SUTTON:  Well, this is division that really22    -- that did exist in the lower courts.  There was not a23    division on the single appellant problem -- they've all24    ruled our way.  But in the lower courts you've got some,25    take the seventh circuit as an example, that said it's15               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    nonjurisdictional and they say they just simply ask 2    someone to correct it and clarify whether all three 3    appellants meant to appeal, even though only one of them 4    hand-signed the notice. 5              And others say, no, that's jurisdictional. They 6    look at this Court's decision in Torres and say you've got 7    to establish within the four corners of the document 8    within thirty days a, quote, intent to appeal.  I think 9    the seventh circuit view is the better view.10              I mean, this is a minimalistic requirement.  In11    fact, it all comes from a statute.  The Rules aren't12    allowed under Rule 1 to expand or shrink the courts of13    appeals' jurisdictions; the only statutory requirement is14    28 U.S.C. 2107, and that just says just get your intent,15    just file the notice of appeals within thirty days.  And16 if you --17              QUESTION:  Are you suggesting that the Rules18    could not put conditions on what you have to do to file a19    notice of appeal other than this statute?2021    Honor.2223    for that?2425    Enabling Act says that you can only create these rules for16               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR. SUTTON:  Not jurisdictional ones, YourQUESTION:  Why is that?  What is the authorityMR. SUTTON:  The Rules Enabling Act.  The Rules 1    the purposes applying and implementing these Court 2    decisions and the administration of the lower court.  It 3    doesn't allow this Court or the lower courts or advisory 4    committees to create rules that expand or shrink this 5    Court's jurisdiction.  Let me give you an example -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, that doesn't shrink the 7    jurisdiction.  You mean that a court would have, must 8    under the statute accept a notice of appeal that consists 9    of somebody coming in and singing it?  It's not even in10    writing?  I mean, surely -- surely the statute envisions11    that the court is going to set forth the procedures for12    effecting a notice of appeal.13              MR. SUTTON:  There's no doubt.  You can set up14    procedures, and you can set up consequences for failing to15    follow those procedures.  That's not this case.  This is a16    case about the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, and17    I'm not sure I really want to answer your question or some18    others going down that road, because I've got a lot of19    angry mail from the court of appeals clerks, but I don't20    know why you can do that.21              Let me give you an example in response to Mr.22    Chief Justice's question.  I mean, I don't know why, in23    Rule 3 this Court can't promulgate rules that are then24    ultimately approved by Congress that say -- silently25    approved by Congress -- that says in order to have                                  17               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, you must have your 2    facsimile number on the notice of appeals.   How -- where 3    do they have the authority to shrink the jurisdiction of 4    that court of appeals?  They could say you need to put 5    your facsimile number on the notice of appeal as a rule, 6    and then enforce that rule however they wish. 7              QUESTION:  Well, how about the simple pro -- 8    does the statute say it has to be in writing? 9              MR. SUTTON:  No.10              QUESTION:  Well, then how -- why not -- Answer11    the implied question from Justice Gin -- can a court say12    the notice of appeal must be in writing and have it13    jurisdictional?141516171819202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  I think that probably is not aproblem.  I mean, I think all you've got to do isestablish an intent to appeal within thirty days, and itwould seem -- the assumption there is that it is inwriting, and I am sure that's what Congress assumed; I'msure they didn't --          QUESTION:  I'm interested in this statute.  Now,what is that statute?          MR. SUTTON:  28 U.S.C. 2107.          QUESTION:  2107.          MR. SUTTON:  That's the 30-day, it's in the backof our brief, the blue brief.                            18         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  I know. 2              MR. SUTTON:  If I could turn to this -- to the 3    quote signature requirement, which is an alternative issue 4    here, and as I think everyone knows, if you look at JA12, 5    that is Mr. Becker's notice of appeal, and you will see 6    he's got his name in three places, including on the, 7    quote, signature line where he typed rather than hand- 8    wrote his signature.  And the question is whether the 9    Appellate, Civil Rules or any other rules somehow require10    a pen-and-ink signature.  There is no definition of the11    verb signed or the noun signature or signer anywhere in12    the Rules; that's not of much help.13              The dictionary definition circa 1938 or even14    1993 are equivocal -- they go both directions -- so that's15    not of much help.  And you've got the very real problem -16    - not in Mr. Becker's case but surely in the case of some17    appellants -- that some individuals may well not be able18    to, quote, pen and ink a notice of appeal.19              You could imagine someone with a disability that20    could only type a notice of appeal; you could imagine an21    individual in a maximum security prison -- a pro se22    appellant -- where that particular warden doesn't allow23    the inmates to have --24              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, do you think if somebody25    said would you please sign this check and I typed my name19               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    on it that I would have signed it? 2              MR. SUTTON:  Well, some of our cases actually 3    are bank note cases, Your Honor. But I do think the answer 4    to your question is most people would pen and ink it.  I 5    agree with you.  But that's also why most banks have on 6    hand a copy of each client's signature.  We don't do that 7    in courts of appeals. 8              QUESTION:  Is pen and ink it a term you have 9    coined for this case?10              MR. SUTTON:  That's a fair criticism, Your11    Honor.  I have.12              QUESTION:  Although you do say that the bank13    keeps a record of each client's signature, by which you14    mean pen and ink, right?15              MR. SUTTON:  I do mean pen and ink.  I think16    everyone ought to have some liberty to coin phrases here17    since there are no definitions at all, and I think the18    advocates are stuck a little bit for that reason.19              But there doesn't seem -- I mean, form follows20    function here.  There's no reason which it comes to a21    notice of appeal why it has to be in pen and ink.  The22    point is to establish an intent to appeal.  It is a23    minimal threshold.  At that point, any doubt about who is24    involved and who's not can be readily clarified by the25 court --20               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  It's just that the argument that you 2    could just type it in, rather than to the problem with 3    multiple parties again.  The one appellant can just type 4    in the names of a lot of people who don't want to appeal. 5              MR. SUTTON:  That is true, but Your Honor, that 6    is assuming that pro se appellants and pro se appellants 7    only are more likely to commit fraud. I don't think that 8    that's a fair assumption.  I mean, the notion of an 9    impostor appellant --10              QUESTION:  Well, I'm not just saying anything11    about pro se -- just someone types in his own name and two12    other names of people who were parties in the district13    court but who haven't signed it.14              MR. SUTTON:  My point is the only reason to15    require a pen and ink signature requirement is because16    you're fearful that the individual that did the typing is17    somehow misleading the court and pulling a fast one on his18    or her co-appellants.  That is not confirming they do19    indeed want to appeal.20              I think it's a fair assumption when you see in21    the body of the notice of appeal all three parties listed,22    or for that matter in the caption as the Rule allows --23    that's enough.  I mean, I don't care whether it has one24    signature or no signatures -- you've conveyed an intent to25 appeal.21               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, what about filing by e-e-mail?  Do you think that would be okay?          MR. SUTTON:  Well, it's an interesting point. Wedo have a situation where some district courts areallowing e-mail type signatures --          QUESTION:  On notices of appeal?          MR. SUTTON:  Well, they're allowing -- I don'tknow whether the Northern District of Ohio is doing that.I know they're doing that generally when it comes to casesin their courts, and I think that --          QUESTION:  They don't have to allow it.  You'retelling us they have no power to forbid it.          MR. SUTTON:  A less common --          QUESTION:  Under the statute, I mean, that'syour position under the statute, isn't it?          MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, of all people, this -- I mean, we've got a separation of powers problem here.Congress says there is -- there is a thirty-dayrequirement in the statute, and that's all it says.  Andsuddenly the courts are allowed to decide who to push outand who to include in?          QUESTION:  But the Congress had used the wordnotice of appeal, and the notice of appeal, as theunderstanding has been, means a document that says noticeof appeal, and I hereby, and then it has a signature which22         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    you sign or counsel signs. 2              MR. SUTTON:  And I think that is the best 3    argument when it comes to interpreting the Congressional 4    statute -- that in other words, the notice of appeal does 5    come with certain assumptions.  There is nowhere, though, 6    that that assumption has to include the handwritten 7    signature.  There's no assumption on that? 8              QUESTION:  Shouldn't -- 9              MR. SUTTON:  Based on the law or the cases?10              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, you reach an interesting11    conclusion if you put together the first and the second12    parts of your argument.  In the first part you assume that13    a signature meant a written signature and you said, well,14    you know, if it isn't written but so long as your name is15    there, that's good enough -- it's properly filed.  In the16    second part of your argument you're now assuming that17    signature just means a typewritten signature, so I assume18    it would follow that if you left that out, it will also be19    properly filed.  So I could file a sheet of paper with no20    name on it and I've filed a proper appeal.21              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, I --22              QUESTION:  Not even a typewritten name, because23    in the first part of your argument you say you don't need24    the signature, so if I apply that to your second part of25    the argument -- we have appeals, we don't know who has23               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425appealed.  We know somebody has filed a notice of appeal,but --          MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, I'm not sure -- firstof all, I'm not entirely sure I understood the way youcharacterized the first part of my argument, so let metell you how I have been trying to argue it which is thatyou don't need anything.  That is my point.  The firstargument is that you don't need a typewritten,handwritten, an X, anything.          QUESTION:  Not even a name?          MR. SUTTON:  Yes, you do need a name.          QUESTION:  Why do you need a name?  It is onlythe signature requirement that says you need the name.          MR. SUTTON:  Look at 12 -- look at 12(A).  Lookat 12(A) which is the joint -- in the Joint Appendix --and this is the sample notice of appeal that Mr. Beckergot from the sixth circuit and he used, and this is whatmost notice of appeals look like -- they are one page.What you do have to do is within thirty days convey anintent to appeal.          You can do that without any signature at all.You can do that with your name in the caption.  In fact,Rule 3 says that.  You can --          QUESTION:  You're saying intent includes who -- who intends.  That's your answer to these questions.24         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  Exactly.          QUESTION:  But what if you have a multi-partycase, and no signature at all on the appeal?  That doesn'ttell you who is appealing.          MR. SUTTON:  Sure it does, Your Honor.  If inthe, it says notice is hereby given that blank -- and itsays Dale G. Becker, John Smith and John Moore -- and thenyou've got a blank signature line.          QUESTION:  But the courts made up those forms,no?  I mean -- you say that, you know, you could draftyour own form, right --          MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  -- under the statute.          MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  And we're exceeding -- we'redestroying the separation of powers if we stick to thatform, right?          MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, I'm not saying theforms are jurisdictional.  I'm using the forms to try tovisualize the issue.  I'm not making any concessionthey're jurisdictional -- I'm just trying to help usvisualize it, and you were suggesting you've got the poorclerk at the sixth circuit gets a notice of appeal with nosignature, and they don't know what to do.          That's just not true.  Whether it is one                            25         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    appellant or fifty-five appellants.  If in the body of the 2    notice of appeal or the caption, as the rules say, the 3    appellants are all listed, how can there possibly be any 4    jurisdictional doubt as to who is trying to appeal?  There5 is no doubt. 6              QUESTION:  Except that when you sign something, 7    you give your own individual imprimatur to what is said in 8    the text that you're signing, and to simply have your name 9    incorporated in the text that you have indicated no10    approval of, I think, falls short.11              MR. SUTTON:  But, Your Honor, that's one12    possibility, and your suggestion is that when they don't13    sign, they somehow decide at the last second -- I'm going14    to put my name in the pile --1516 it. 1718    that goes back to my response to Justice Ginsburg.19    Somehow the assumption that there's someone committing20    fraud or there are impostor appellants out there -- that's21    not a problem that exists.22              QUESTION:  But certainly if you're not judgment-23    proof, you don't likely undertake an appeal because you24    can be assessed for costs if you lose it.  But if you are25    judgment-proof, presuming there's no real harm, you're not26               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOQUESTION:  For all I know, they've never seenMR. SUTTON:  That's possible, Your Honor, but 1    going to suffer anything if you do appeal. 2              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, the reason this lenity 3    exists is not because people decide, oh, boy, I'm having 4    doubts at the last second whether to put my signature 5    here, it's because they make mistakes.  And people make 6    them all the time. God knows -- I mean, I can't think of a 7    lawyer that hasn't made this kind of mistake.  It gets 8    filed without the signature, and that's exactly -- 9              QUESTION:  But isn't that -- you have gone, I10    think, a lot farther than you need to go.  All you needed11    to do was just say the signature is curable after the12    thirty days, right?13              MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.  And that's what Rule14    3(C)(4) means exactly.  So any doubt about this problem15    can be resolved after the thirty-day window which is the16    jurisdictional window.  If I could save the rest of my17    time for rebuttal.18              QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Sutton.19              Mr. Baker, we'll hear from you.20                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEWART A. BAKER21                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT22              MR. BAKER:  Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may23    it please the Court:24              I would like to just correct one point that25    Petitioner's attorney made -- the Sixth Circuit has27               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    applied their jurisdictional rule excluding unsigned 2    notice of appeal to single appellants.  They've done so in 3    numerous unpublished opinions.  The fact that they're 4    unpublished, I think, suggests that they don't believe 5    that there is any difference between single or multiple 6    appellants, and that distinction has been introduced by 7    Petitioner's attorney at this stage, and this stage only. 8              QUESTION:  Mr. Baker, are there not courts where 9    something like this would come into the clerk's office,10    the signature is lacking, the clerk would say, well, it11    was filed within the ninety days, so we'll send it back12    with the letter, very much as this Court does.  When13    something is filed in this Court -- a cert petition and it14    is deficient but it is on time -- our clerk will send it15    back for the deficiency to be cured.16              MR. BAKER:  Yes.  The -- the difficulty with17    that is that Rule 4 sets a thirty-day limit on filing of18    proper notice of appeal, and therefore if you can correct19    it within the thirty days there is not a problem, but if20    you can't correct it within the thirty days, there is a21    jurisdictional issue that arises.  It arises --22              QUESTION:  Well, why should that be so if the23    intent to appeal is clear from the face of what was filed?24    We have spoken, I guess, in the Torres case that the25    touchstone is the clear intent to appeal, and if the28               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    document is clear as it was in this case, who the 2    appellant is and that it was timely filed and so on, why 3    should that be jurisdictional and not correctable later? 4              MR. BAKER:  The signature requirement is part of 5    expressing the intent of the party to appeal.  It's -- 6    since 1980, the courts of appeals have said that specify 7    the party or parties taking the appeal includes in a pro 8    se context the signature of the party who intends to take 9    the appeal.  Even in a single --10              QUESTION:  Well, there is no clear statutory11    rule requirement that it be signed.12              MR. BAKER:  I think that Rule 11 clearly13    requires that it be signed.  I -- Rule 11 is incorporated,14    at least as far as the form of the filing, into the15    Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  And then Rule 3(c)16    clearly references an expectation that there will be a17    signer in every pro se notice of appeal.18              QUESTION:  There is.  There is.  But Rule 1119    says that you have to sign it, so if it's not signed,20    here's what we do.  We strike it, but before we strike it21    we give the person a chance to sign it.  That's what it22 says. 2324 25          MR. BAKER:  It says it shall be struck unlessit's been cured after notice, which I think is a slightlymore emphatic statement than --29         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  So all right, all right, it says we 2    really, really, really will strike it unless you sign it. 3    Now, I think that that is -- I think it is hard given that 4    to say that, you know, it will go through this 5    jurisdictional thing or anything.  I take it the problem 6    here is he wasn't given a chance to sign it. 7              MR. BAKER:  Well, the difficulty with taking 8    that approach is first that Rule 11 is a district court 9    rule; it sets form requirements and it tells the court10    what it can do in response to an unsigned notice of11    appeal.  A portion of that comes to the Federal Rules of12    Appellate Procedure but simply the form requirements --13    not the authority to take action -- it would be very --                QUESTION:  Why?  I mean, why do you draw that                MR. BAKER:  Uh --1415    line?16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  If the one is incorporated, why isn'tthe other?          MR. BAKER:  Well, the legislative history forthat says that in some instances the Federal Rules ofAppellate Procedure provide that a motion must or may befiled in the district court -- I'm reading from ourfootnote on page seventeen in the green brief.  And thenit goes on to say the proposed amendment would make itclear that when this is so, the motion or application is30ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    to be made in the form and manner prescribed in the 2    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In other words it says 3    that if there is a form and manner requirement, you must 4    meet it in the district court. 5              I think it would be unusual for the Federal 6    Rules of Appellate Procedure to say, and by the way you 7    can borrow whatever authority the district court may have. 8              QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't it authority 9    that goes to the satisfaction of a form and manner10    requirement?  Sure it is.11              MR. BAKER:  Well, it says -- but the requirement12    is that it be signed.  I think the requirement is not that13    it be signed if you've gotten a notice from the court.  It14    simply says it must be signed; it shall be stricken unless15    certain -- certain things have happened.  Those --16              QUESTION:  It says it must be signed, and if it17    isn't signed, you have to sign it if you get a notice from18    the court.  And if you don't do that, we strike it.19    That's what it --20              MR. BAKER:  If -- if we were only borrowing Rule21    11 here, I think this argument would be much stronger, but22    we -- the Advisory Committee has gone over this territory23    already, the courts of appeals, as I said, since 1980 have24    found that the jurisdictional language of Rule 3 includes25    the signature requirements -- not all of them, but the31               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    Fourth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, and others.  And the 2    Advisory Committee, which addressed this question after 3    Torres made it quite clear that specify the parties is a 4    jurisdictional requirement, had in front of them language 5    that would have gotten rid of the signature requirement, 6    and instead modified that language to make it clear that a 7    signature was expected from every pro se party filing a 8    notice of appeal. 9              QUESTION:  Well, again, that's -- that's not --10     that's really not clear.  I mean the one thing that rule11    -- that thing does is to say that the widow or the wife12    and the child can come along without signing it, I mean,13    we know that when they made that change in Rule 3, what14    they wanted to do is enable people to be parties who15    hadn't signed, and then to say, well, now, that instituted16    for the first time a -- a statement in the Rules that the17    pro se litigant must sign is kind of a backdoor way to18    create a signing requirement.19              MR. BAKER:  It's -- it's -- it's obviously not20    perfect, Your Honor.  On the other hand, I have difficulty21    reading it as only saying that the signature requirement22    for the spouse and children which would be the result of23    saying, well, this -- this says there's a signature24    requirement of the spouse and child but it's met by the25    signature of the pro se party.  I -- I'm not sure that32               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    produces a more sensible rule than one that says it treats 2    the pro se party and the pro se party's family members all 3    the same.  They are -- 4              QUESTION:  It may be it had in mind Torres and 5    the problem of the person other than the one who files the 6    notice, adding names.  So that I think that the -- that 7    that problem of the multi-party of appeal is what prompted 8    -- prompted the change in the Rule. 9              MR. BAKER:  I think that that's -- that's10    plausible if it were not for the fact that the Advisory11    Committee had in front of it language that would have12    achieved that without introducing a signature requirement13    or any notion of a signature requirement provided by14    public citizens.  The -- the language provided by public15    citizens would have clearly undone the signature16    requirements that had been imposed by some of the courts17    of appeals.18              QUESTION:  Maybe they thought the signature19    requirement was there but non-jurisdictional.  I mean,20    take a look at Rule 1 -- it says when these rules provide21    for filing a document in the district court, the procedure22    must comply with the practice of the district court.  So23    it seems to me that if you file a -- perhaps a Rule24    (1)(a)(2), then you pick up all of Rule 11 and not just a25    piece of it.33               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. BAKER:  That may well be, I -- but I think 2    that it's -- it's impossible to pick up that Rule -- the 3    -- the -- the Civil Rule of Procedure -- without taking 4    into account Rule 4 which says the Notice of Appeal has to 5    be filed within thirty days. 6              There is clearly a signature requirement under 7    Rule 11; there is no doubt about that. 8              QUESTION:  Why doesn't that mean that defects 9    can be cured after the thirty days, just as it does in10    this Court?11              MR. BAKER:  I think the reason that it can't be12    is that the signature requirement has been pulled into13    Rule 3 for pro se parties by the direct reference to an14    expectation that the pro se party will sign the notice of15    appeal.  It is hard to read that language without coming16    to the conclusion that there is something about the notice17    of appeal, and the standards for notice of appeal, that is18    --that requires a signature from pro se parties, and there19    are good, obviously policy, reasons for wanting to do20 that.21              QUESTION:  So then you are making the22    distinction that -- that Mr. Sutton suggested you were --23    that this is a requirement -- the signing requirement --24    this jurisdictional signing requirement applies only to25    pro se litigants and not to litigants with counsel.34               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. BAKER:  I think though that the principal 2    problem that the signature requirement addresses is the 3    risk that someone is practicing law -- probably without a 4    license -- on behalf of a party who may or may not 5    understand what is being done in his name.  The signature 6    requirement allows the court to be sure that the party who 7    is nominally appearing pro se in fact has had a chance to 8    think about what he is doing, and to examine the contents 9    of what has been filed in his name.  That is the reason10    that in multiple appellant cases -- this rule has been11    applied without controversy, yet because it is obvious12    there that one party may be proceeding to draft pleadings13    that the others may not have seen. But in the context of14    single appellants as well, there are numerous areas of law15    where there is an active cottage industry of assisting pro16    se litigants -- not just prison cases but bankruptcy17    cases, immigration cases, where people who hold themselves18    out as grievance consultants or other forms of quasi-19    lawyer, have taken to filing pro se papers on behalf of20 parties.21 22 23 24 25          The signature requirement at least requires thatthose pro se parties have a chance to see what has beendone in their names.          QUESTION:  But you agree that it's -- that it'snot jurisdictional with regard to -- to an attorney?35         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. BAKER:  I -- I do agree with that.  I think 2    that if one reads this as narrowly as possible, that the 3    signature requirement does not apply to represented 4    parties.  It applies, but the attorney -- 5              QUESTION:  Under the jurisdictional -- 6              MR. BAKER:  Right.  And -- and there are reasons 7    for that.  If an attorney says I represent these parties 8    and they're taking the appeal and he's not telling the 9    truth, he's subject to a wide variety of sanctions that10    would not apply to a non-lawyer who made that same11    representation and therefore, it's a -- it's a plausible12    distinction to -- to draw.13              QUESTION:  Mr. Baker, one of the problems since14    we're dealing with a pro se litigant, gets this form from15    the Sixth Circuit, and it doesn't say, as the -- the16    sample attached to the Rules do, S with a signature.  So17    then he gets a document from a court that doesn't even18    warn him that a signature is required, and then he's out19    the door because he -- he did everything that the -- that20    the document he got from the court called for.21              MR. BAKER:  I -- I -- think that's a difficulty.22    I -- I would suggest -- I don't know how Mr. Becker got23    that form.  I -- I think it would be useful to take a look24    at the yellow brief pages of A-2 and A-3 because, in fact,25    the form that Mr. Becker got is outdated even by the sixth36               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    circuit standards.  If you go to the sixth circuit 2    website, you go to the notices and download the forms, the 3    form you will get is the form on page A-3 of the yellow 4    brief, not on page A-2 which is the form that Mr. Becker5 submitted. 6              Indeed, if you look at the -- at the lower 7    lefthand corner of each of those documents, you'll see 8    that each of them is labeled 6CA3, which is the name of 9    the -- the number of the form.  Each of them in fact on10    the originals has a GPO designation, but the notice on11    page A-3 is dated January '99 as opposed to August of '79,12    and this is the pages -- the form on page A-3 is the form13    that is available to litigants, and that should be sent14    out, and it certainly calls for a signature, has the15 little s.16              So there may well have been a mistake here in17    Mr. Becker's case, but I think it would be going beyond18    the facts that we have in the record to assume that this19    is a policy on the part of the Sixth Circuit to send out a20    notice of appeal when it's not --21              QUESTION:  The whole problem is that he wasn't22    given an opportunity.  The Sixth Circuit said, thirty days23    are up, no signature, that's it.  Nothing else is24    relevant.25               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR. BAKER:  Mr. Becker has filed nearly twenty                  37 1    cases in the Federal and State courts in Ohio; he has 2    signed practically every paper he's filed in practically 3    every one of those cases, including all of his notices of 4    appeal to the Sixth Circuit in past cases.  Rule 11 says 5    sign everything you file in the district court. I -- I 6    think it would be aggressive for him to suggest that 7    simply because the s was missing from this form, he 8    doesn't have to pay any attention to those -- those rules. 9              QUESTION:  Well, again it's not a question of10    not paying attention; it's a question of whether it can be11    cured, whether we know that the thirty days can't be cured12    once that runs, but the -- the question is whether13    something like the signature shouldn't be curable, when14    everything is there, his name is -- is in the caption, his15    name is in the body of the notice.16              MR. BAKER:  But when one has that one is17    confronted with a notice of appeal, as is the typical case18    -- and here we've had a half a dozen substantive motions19    and briefs, and so we're starting to get a feel for Mr.20    Becker and what his intent was -- but the purpose of the21    requirement is to know immediately, and in a way that's22    not easily deniable by the appellant -- what his intent23    is, that he actually intends to file this appeal and be24    bound by the consequences, even if they're bad, as they25    may well be for a frivolous appeal.38               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              If I could touch briefly on the question of 2    whether the Rules Enabling Act prevents the application of 3    this rule, I think it is answered by the Torres case which 4    said, after all, that even though it was perfectly obvious 5    in that case that all of the plaintiffs who had lost 6    intended to seek the appeal, the fact that one of the 7    plaintiffs' names had been left off of the document meant 8    that there was no notice of appeal as to him, and that the 9    requirements of the parties be specified with a10    jurisdictional requirement.  I don't think the Rules11    Enabling Act said, wait a minute, you're narrowing the12    scope of the notice of appeal.13              QUESTION:  But there was a total absence of the14    name any place, and I think  -- if I understand you right,15    Mr. Baker, you are asking us to equate the lack of a16    signature with the total absence of the name of the would-17    be appellant any place in the notice.18              MR. BAKER:  Yes, I am, because that was the19    position since at lease 1980 of some of the courts of20    appeals and the position that we believe was adopted by21    the Advisory Committee in 1993.22              QUESTION:  It is one thing to say, look, you --23     you weren't even named any place in this notice within24    the thirty days, so we're not going to let you -- you25    can't become an appellant after as opposed to yes, you're39               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    named in the caption, yes, you're named in the body, all 2    that's lacking is the signature.  That we can let you do 3    after the thirty days. 4              MR. BAKER:  Of course, one could draw the 5    distinction -- I'm not sure that the Rules Enabling Act 6    would say that that distinction is the -- is the limit of 7    what the Court's authority is.  I think the Court has the 8    authority to say we want you to specify the party -- the 9    party taking the appeal in a manner that leaves the party10    no room to back out later.11              QUESTION:  Have the courts of appeals which you12    say have applied this Rule since 1980, have they applied13    it only to pro se filings, or do they apply it to --14              MR. BAKER:  The cases that I have seen apply it15    to pro se pleadings.  I have not seen it applied16    jurisdictionally to represented parties.17              QUESTION:  Mr. Baker, let me just ask you, one18    of the tough things about your -- your position, of19    course, is this contrast between the pro se litigant and20    the represented litigant, and your response, in part, is21    that while there are disciplinary sanctions on the lawyer22    who doesn't -- who actually fails to sign and so forth,23    but does that -- is that really a complete response24    because isn't there still the danger that a representative25    -- a represented appellant might have some friend who,40               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9without authority, went ahead and filed a notice of appealwithout even the lawyer knowing about it.          MR. BAKER:  Well, if he -- if he did then itwouldn't have the lawyer's signature on it. It would havesomeone else's signature on it.          QUESTION:  Well, but I thought -- I thought youwere saying even if the lawyer had not signed it, it wouldnot be jurisdictional.          MR. BAKER:  Even if the lawyer had -- if he wasa represented party, he filed pro se?          QUESTION:  No, a represented -- my hypotheticalis a represented party on whose behalf a typewrittennotice of appeal is filed without the knowledge of eitherthe lawyer who represents him or the man himself -- theman or woman himself.  That's not a jurisdictional defect,is it?          MR. BAKER:  I would say it was because itdoesn't have a signature from the pro se party, and it'snot -- you haven't specified the party's intent to --          QUESTION:  Well, then there isn't thisdistinction between representative and non-representative10111213141516171819202122    parties.2324 25          MR. BAKER:  I -- I -- I -- if I have thought ofit in terms of a represented party where the lawyer isactually pursuing the appeal.41         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  But am I correct then -- maybe I 2    don't have the facts right in my mind. Assume a 3    represented party who has a lawyer -- a paper is filed 4    which purports to be a notice of appeal on behalf of that 5    person and not signed by anybody. Is that a jurisdictional 6    defect or is it not? 7              MR. BAKER:  It may not be a jurisdictional 8    defect, but it is obviously easily struck because it 9    doesn't represent the intent of the party.  If it -- if it10    purports to be a pro se petition, notice of appeal, then11    it's jurisdictionally deficient.  If it purports to be on12    an attorney notice of appeal, then it's fraught.13              QUESTION:  Even though, in fact, it was not14    prepared by the attorney?15              MR. BAKER:  Yes.16              QUESTION:  Okay.17              I would like to take just a minute on the18    question of the -- whether a typed name can constitute a19    signature. I think that's been addressed at considerable20    length already.  My first point, and I apologize for21    raising it at this stage, is there is a question whether22    this is fairly covered by the question presented, but the23    Court drafted a question presented that presumes there has24    been a failure to sign here.  It did so after the25    petitioner had filed a petition that made reference to                                  42               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    some of the cases that address the question whether a 2    signed notice of appeal could be -- whether a signing 3    constituted typing.  So there is a real question whether 4    the Court in framing this question didn't exclude this5 issue or -- 6              QUESTION:  You're saying we've proceeded on the 7    assumption that there was a failure to sign. 8              MR. BAKER:  Exactly, and therefore either you've 9    already decided this, which I suspect is not the10    appropriate answer, or it's not part of the case because11    there was no conflict in the circuits on that question.12              If I could turn also to the question of a lawyer13    not signing -- I think Mr. Sutton made the argument that14    an attorney -- if you were a represented party and you did15    not sign, it would not be jurisdictional.  If you were a16    non-represented party and you did not sign, it would be17    jurisdictional, and that there would be some doubt about18    that possibility raised the prospect, I think, of people19    trying to game the system by rushing out and hiring20    lawyers or having lawyers submit things that weren't21 signed.22              I think it's worth remembering this is not a23    difficult requirement to meet.  Signing the notice of24    appeal is an easy thing to do; it provides useful25    confirmation to the court that every party who is part of                                  43               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    the notice of appeal actually has seen and has willingly 2    joined in it.  And so the likelihood that people will game 3    this system in order to avoid signing the notice of appeal 4    I think is -- is highly unlikely. 5              QUESTION:  Mr. Baker, is there anything in your 6    view that is quote jurisdictional, other than the one 7    thing we all agree, is the thirty days is jurisdictional. 8    Now you say the signing requirement, at least to a pro se 9    litigant, is.  Is there anything else that you would rank10    as jurisdictional so you would be disqualified as an11    appellant?12              MR. BAKER:  This Court has -- has tended to say13    that Rule 3 is jurisdictional in general terms.  Certainly14    I would say that Rule 3(c) and its provisions which say15    that you must specify the party or parties taking the16    appeal -- that's what the Torres case held, that failure17    to specify is a jurisdictional fault, designation of the18    judgment appealed from, designation of the court appealed19    to.  And as I said, most -- many courts had held that to20    specify the party included a signature requirement as part21    of determining intent to appeal.22              QUESTION:  But is anything other than naming a23    person as a party that couldn't be cured after the thirty24    days are up, and some of the other things that you25    mentioned?44               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. BAKER:  None of those things can be curedafter the thirty days has -- has run, and I believe that'sestablished law.          I would like to --          QUESTION:  I know that the Torres establisheslaw, but I don't know that any of the others say that youcan't cure a defect.  As long as something is clearlyidentifiable as a notice of appeal, what is it that saysthat errors in designating the, the details, are10    incurable?11              MR. BAKER:  The -- the court in Smith against12    Barry, and to a degree in Torres, suggested that the13    functional equivalent of a notice of appeal is all that is14    required, but by functional equivalent the -- the Court15    has essentially treated the three elements that must be in16    a notice of appeal as what must be conveyed in one form or17    another.  It doesn't have to be in the form of a notice of18    appeal, but that information has got to be part of the19    notice of appeal or, in the absence of one of those20    elements, it's jurisdictionally --21              QUESTION:  And the elements are who is22    appealing, and what else?23              MR. BAKER:  What he's appealing, and where he's24    appealing to.25              QUESTION:  Yes.  And all of that is in this45               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    notice -- who is appealing, what he's appealing, and who 2    he's appealing to. 3              MR. BAKER:  I -- I -- I would -- I would argue 4    that in fact when the Advisory Committee -- the only 5    substantive revision of Rule 3(c) that's been made was 6    made in 1993 by the Advisory Committee.  When they made 7    that change, there was none of this division into sub -- 8    separate subparagraphs of 3(C).  There was a requirement 9    to do the three things -- to specify the three things.10    The first was specify the parties, and what the Advisory11    Committee did was insert this reference to a signature by12    a pro se party directly after the requirement that the13    party taking the appeal be specified, and I think the only14    conclusion you can draw from that is they believed that15    they were providing a gloss on how to specify the party or16    parties taking the appeal.17              QUESTION:  And yet there's not one word from the18    Advisory Committee that suggests this is quote19    jurisdictional.202122232425          MR. BAKER:  Torres had already done that mostemphatically --          QUESTION:  With respect to a party not beingnamed at all.          MR. BAKER:  Yes.  But as I said, the entireeffort by the Advisory Committee was to insert -- it was46         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    to clarify what it meant to specify the party so people 2    wouldn't make mistakes in the future. 3              If I could make one point in closing, it's that 4    I was struck as I was reading the cases that we've been 5    talking about here, such as Torres, the Foman case from 6    the '60s, Houston and Flack -- all of the cases that 7    construe the rules of the court -- of the appellate courts 8    -- that almost none of them have survived in terms of 9    their holdings.  Almost every one has been modified by the10    Advisory Committee and the rules process.11              Given the number of problems we've turned up in12    this area, I think that it's inevitable that this issue is13    bound for the Advisory Committee one way or the other, and14    yet we still cite all those cases, and we cite them not15    for their particular holding, but for the way they16    analyzed these problems.  If they say, well, you know, the17    rules can be bent to achieve a certain aim, then that's18    what they stand for.  If they say the rules should be read19    in as straightforward and lawyerly a way as one can and20    take the consequences, then that's what those rules --21    those cases stand for.  I would submit that if you take22    the latter course, the Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.23 Thank you.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Baker, you served as an amicus25    for the Court in this case, and we thank you for your47               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    rules. 9              Second, the notion that prison inmates should be10    consulting websites to get the forms doesn't seem to me11    plausible.12              Third, when it comes to the forms that Mr. Baker13    has relied upon, if you look at our yellow brief, there is14    a great irony here to his argument that this signature15    rule only applies to pro se appellants.  Every one of the16    forms refers to signatures for attorneys.  If you look at17    the one that's attached to the Federal Rules -- that's at18    A-1 -- it's clear the signature requirement is not for the19    pro se -- it says the s and then attorney. And then you20    look at Mr Becker's -- Baker's -- Becker's form, it's21    counsel for appellant.  You then look at the next one and22    it has attorney.  Every single one of them, if there is a23    signature requirement at all, it's referring to attorneys.24    There is no indication that pro se litigants and pro se25    litigants alone are expected to sign these things in48               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOservices.  Mr. Sutton, you have four minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SUTTON:  A few brief points.  First of all,in defense of Dale Becker, the form he used is actuallythe form that's now attached to the Sixth Circuit rules.It is not outdated.  It is attached to their current1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whatever manner.          Every other point that Mr. Baker has raised --and there are many policy problems out there -- they areall problems that show at most there is a signaturerequirement, not a signature jurisdictional requirement.          Every single one of those issues can be curedand addressed after the thirty days.  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Sutton.The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 10:56 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)49ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO
