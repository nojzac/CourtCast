United States.Mr. Gordon.ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:When this Court construes a statute, thewords of the statute matter, the purpose of the statute matters, and the results produced by that construction matter.When Congress defined in the Armed Career Criminal Act a "serious" drug offense as one for which a State penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed by law, it meant for Federal courts to look to the law presently in effect in that State. This is the most natural reading of the statute, and words matter. It is also consistent with ACCA's purpose, which is punish the Federal firearms offense, and if we are going topunish -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I have just one problem, which is under your theory, I3Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 understand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes2 what would have been a penalty3 felony, then that defendant is4 your logic.5 MR. GORDON: Uh -­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:7 thought that at the time they committed the crime they8 were committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is9 that your theory of the case?10 MR. GORDON: If -- if a State were to11 increase a penalty -- say from originally it was 512 years, increased it to 10 years, the defendant was13 convicted at a time when it was 5 years -- if the14 legislature increased the penalty, if the defendant15 possessed a firearm, yes, he would be facing -­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what -- what17 logic do you think there is in that, why Congress would18 want to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity19 that they thought was lesser, and the State thought was20 lesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible?21 MR. GORDON: Because the purpose of the22 Armed Career Criminal Act is not to enhance a sentence23 because of the prior conviction. It is because the24 Federal firearm offense at the time it was committed is25 more serious based on -- based on its repetitive nature,4for a misdemeanor now a a career criminal, bySo the person who￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 as this Court has said. So therefore looking to, when2 the defendant commits the offense, what his status is at3 that time under the law we think makes sense and is4 consonant with the purpose of what ACCA is trying to do.5 ACCA is not trying to punish the State offense at the6 time.7 And of course the converse, Your Honor, is8 that by adopting the government's reading, is9 individuals who at a time committed an offense when a10 State at that time viewed an offense as more serious but11 now has changed its view of the offense, does not view12 it as being as serious, that person also would receive a13 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon, the State15 does regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this16 defendant because it's made a -- made the change not17 retroactive. So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for18 Mr. McNeill, and all others who committed the offense19 priortothechangeinlaw.Soitis--itisthe20 State's current position that for this offense the21 maximum is 10 years.22 MR. GORDON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's23 correct. Where we fundamentally disagree with the24 government and with the Fourth Circuit is on the25 significance of retroactivity. We -- the statute5￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 requires -- or the statute directs us to look at the2 penalty that is prescribed for3 in its generic context. It --4 circumstances of the defendant5 particular conviction for him.6 No one who commits7 that Mr. McNeill committed today is going to be facing a8 10-year sentence. It's not going to happen to anyone9 who commits the offense from today forward. And we10 think that is where the statute directs us to look:11 What is the penalty for the generic offense?12 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- what would happen13 in this situation? A defendant is convicted under a14 State statute that says that anybody who sells between 115 ounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular16 controlled substance is guilty of a felony and may be17 punished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time.18 And then the State repeals that provision19 altogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody20 who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is21 punishable by a certain penalty. And now the question22 comes up what -- what penalty does the court look at23 with respect to the earlier offense that no longer24 exists for which the defendant was convicted?25 MR. GORDON: There -- there are two possible6the offense, the offense it is not about what the were that produced thethe trafficking offenses￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 answers, Justice Alito. First, the court could look to2 what the offense is now, could look back to what the3 defendant did consistent with Shepard and so forth, and4 see if the defendant's conviction contains the element5 of the -- the elements that apply to the present6 offense.7 If the court could not do that, then the8 conviction would count for purposes of the defendant's9 criminal history. It would not count as an ACCA10 predicate, and the district court would then be limited11 to a 10-year sentence as opposed to a 15-to-life12 sentence.13 So consistent with -- with its purpose, we14 think that the statute should be read as speaking to the15 time, not of the State conviction -- not of the State16 sentence.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mis -­18 MR. GORDON: Yes?19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon, is this -- is20 this essentially an academic question? Because this21 district judge said that he would impose the22 sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do23 the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect24 calculation. He said: This criminal record25 and astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the7￼Alderson Reporting Companysameit underis violentOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 book at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if2 that's no -- if there's no other way.3 So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an4 exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if5 your -- your client would end up in the same place?6 MR. GORDON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it may7 be an academic exercise for Mr. McNeill or for the Mr.8 McNeills of the world. The judge would -- if this Court9 were to agree with us, the judge could impose10 consecutive sentences on a remand and still achieve the11 same sentence, yes.12 For someone whose only offense, however, is13 a 922(g) conviction, then it makes a huge difference14 because, rather than looking at a 15-year mandatory15 minimum penalty, the defendant would be looking at no16 more than 10 years. So, the judge's -- it would be17 significantly cabined in -- in that sense.18 And the other, with respect to the Mr.19 McNeills of the world, the judge on a remand is still20 going to be required to calculate the guidelines21 correctly. And so if the guidelines change, if they go22 down in this case, for the judge to achieve a 300-month23 sentence, the judge is going to have to state reasons24 again and arguably more significant reasons to -- to25 achieve that same level if he's working from a lower8￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 guideline range.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gordon, there are other3 provisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense4 in circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the5 statute truly means the present tense. So, a violent6 felony is one that "has as an element the use of7 physical force, is burglary, arson, or extortion,8 involves use of explosives;" and so on and so forth.9 But we would not look as to -- in interpreting that10 provision to the present day, would we?11 MR. GORDON: Justice Kagan, I think you12 would, in this sense: For the violent felony provision,13 there is a generic offense. Let's take burglary. There14 is this existing thing right now called burglary. What15 a Taylor analysis does is it looks backward to what the16 defendant did. It looks to see what those elements are.17 It takes those elements and brings it forward, and if18 those elements fit in the box, then what he did is a19 burglary. If it does not, then it is not a burglary.20 The -- so, that's my essential answer to that. Is it -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is -- why is -- why is22 the present tense inadequate for the -- for the23 government's position in this case? Once it is conceded24 that the North Carolina law is not retroactive, the law25 reducing the number of years, it is the case that what9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that2 he committed -- how many years ago was it, whatever -­3 MR. GORDON: Early '90s, Your Honor. Yes,4 '91, '92.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the maximum6 punishment for that offense which occurred at that time7 is the longer period. Why is -- I don't see why your8 argument requires us to ask what would be the term if he9 had committed the offense at a later date. The maximum10 term for his offense when he committed it is those years11 because the State did not retroactively reduce his12 sentence.13 MR. GORDON: That's correct for Mr. McNeill.14 The penalty for him -- he would be facing an exposure of15 10 years. The penalty, however, that everyone else -­16 the penalty that is currently prescribed in North17 Carolina for someone who commits McNeill's offenses is18 not 10 years and, and depending on where they fall in19 the prior record level, their maximum sentence is20 considerably less than 10 years.21 So we do not think it's consonant with the22 statute to look to the circumstances of the individual23 defendant. Congress easily could have said "for which a24 penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed for the25 defendant." We think that would be a different case.10￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just for the2 defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to3 the -- prior to the amendment of the statute.4 MR. GORDON: That's correct.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anybody that committed it6 then, the -- the -- it is an offense "involving7 manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent8 to manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a9 maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is10 prescribed by law." It is prescribed by law for any of11 those offenses that occurred between whenever that old12 statute was enacted and whenever this statute was13 enacted.14 MR. GORDON: It is prescribed only if you15 take the offense out of the category of a generic16 offense. It is not -- it is -- it is not prescribed for17 the generic offense. It is prescribed for particular18 defendants who committed the offense at a certain point19 in time.20 And, Justice Scalia, I think it raises a21 rather fundamental question, which is if we're going -­22 if we really are punishing the Federal firearm offense23 and we are not punishing the defendant for the prior24 conviction, and we have two individuals who commit a25 922(g) offense and they have similar records, but they11￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sustain their State convictions on different days, do we want to treat them the same for purposes of where they -- of the Federal offense or do we want to distinguish them on the basis of the State convictions? Do we want the State convictions to really -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State -­ MR. GORDON: Yes, sir.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the Statechange is to abolish the offense altogether? Do we -­ do we not have any predicate offense for the defendant who committed the crime prior to the abolition of the State offense?MR. GORDON: Your Honor, yes. If -- if, as I said earlier, you could not determine from the prior conviction whether there is any present State offense that might be called something different, but that has those drug trafficking elements that the statute requires, if you cannot determine, you know, from Shepard-approved documents and so forth, yes, we think for purposes of the armed career criminal enhancement only that that would disappear. That's correct.I do want to stress, because I think it's important to stress, that -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That's -­ MR. GORDON: Yes?12Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's correct? You're2 happy with that? The person committed a felony when it3 was a felony, and the State later no longer makes it a4 felony, and it isn't counted for purposes of the Armed5 Career Criminal Act?6 MR. GORDON: Only for purposes of the Armed7 Career Criminal Act, yes. It certainly would count as a8 prior conviction. It would count as a prior conviction,9 for example, for 922(g) purposes. This person could10 still be prosecuted for being a felon in possession,11 yes.12 So, we do not -- our reading is not opening13 the jail house door for anybody. They are still facing14 a hefty 10-year sentence. The question is, in a statute15 that defers to the judgment of the States to determine16 seriousness, are we going to defer to the current State17 assessment of what seriousness is or are we going to18 look back to repeal the discarded judgments?19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it strikes20 me that there's really no change in the State view of21 how serious it is. It was just an overall change in how22 they're going to look at sentencing. Under the prior23 regime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in24 fact you serve a lot less. With the new treatment in25 sentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a13￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 smaller term, but you in fact are going to serve the2 whole thing. At the end of the day, there's no real3 change in how they view the seriousness of the offense.4 MR. GORDON: That's correct, Mr. Chief5 Justice, arguably yes. But for purposes of the serious6 drug offense definition, what we have to use is the7 penalty. We have to look at the penalty as the State -­8 as the State's proxy, if you will, for seriousness.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we looking at it10 because we want the States to determine the Federal11 sentence or12 evil of the13 how much of14are we looking at it because we evaluate the particular defendant on the basis of how -­ a crime he was willing to commit?And so long as it was a serious felony when￼15 he committed it, this is a bad actor. I don't care if16 the State changes its view. At the time, he was willing17 to commit a felony that put him in jail for 10 years,18 and that's what we're looking to, it seems to me, how19 bad an apple is this fellow that -- that we're talking20 about putting away? And that doesn't change simply21 because the State decides in the future that that same22 act will not be a felony. Well, people who perform that23 act in the future aren't so bad; they're just -- you24 know, just normal not-so-good people -­25 (Laughter.)14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but they're not the kind2 of a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that,3 you know, puts them away for 10 years.4 It seems to me that that's what the Federal5 law is looking to. We're not giving over to the States6 the decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate7 somebody in89 were indeed10 written the11 something in that definition about the defendant, and12 there's not. It's about the offense. So the -- the13 judgment that the State is making is about the14 seriousness of the offense itself, and as we made an15 effort to argue in our briefs, State views of drug16 offenses change.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree, it does refer to18 the seriousness of the offense. But it refers to the19 seriousness of the offense at the time the offense was20 committed in order to determine how bad a fellow this21 is, not -- not because we want the States to determine22 how long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in23 prison.24 MR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, respectfully,25 I -- I don't agree with that. Respectfully -­15a Federal prison.MR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, if -- if that what Congress wanted, then it would have statute differently. There would be￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the issue, though,2 really.3 MR. GORDON: That is an issue, yes, Justice4 Scalia. But the issue is, do you look at the defendant.5 Do you say Congress was really talking about trying to6 get the Mr. McNeills any way we can or we are -- we are7 interested in people who commit an offense that the8 State currently regards as serious.9 You will capture Mr. McNeills; you will also10 capture people who, you know, under the old Texas law11 that, you know, prescribed 99 years for someone who12 might have sold one or two marijuana cigarettes as well.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you'll -- you'll put14 away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad15 a guy. He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State16 later makes it a felony, you -- he suddenly comes under17 ACCA. And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's18 what -- what Congress had in mind just because the State19 now thinks that it's more serious. Who cares what the20 State thinks? We -- we want to know how bad an actor21 this particular defendant is.22 MR. GORDON: In the case of a misdemeanor --23 Justice Sotomayor asked earlier about misdemeanors and24 felonies -- there may be some additional constitutional25 issues in terms of whether if it's a misdemeanor16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 conviction, even statutory reasons, if it's a2 misdemeanor conviction, whether it should count. I3 think it works that way in the violent felony prong, for4 example, where the term that you look at is was it 15 year.6 But that is -- that is not the proxy for7 seriousness because there is another provision, 188 U.S.C. section 921(a)(20), that exempts 2-year9 misdemeanors. So -- so, the 1 year in the violent10 felony provision is not serving the same purpose that -­11 that the 10 years is in the serious drug offense.12 A reason that Congress may have had for13 doing that is to say that if we are going to hit14 somebody with 15 years, we want to make sure that they15 had their constitutional rights at the time they16 sustained the predicate conviction, had a right to17 counsel, indictment, jury, and so forth.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm not sure what19 you're urging now. Are -- are you modifying or20 retracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor,21 that is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but22 then at the time of the Federal offense the State has23 changed it so it's 10 years?24 I -- I think you answered her question that25 it would work the same way, that what mattered is how17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the State currently ranks the offense, not the offender.2 But now you seem to be saying there might be a different3 answer when the State increases rather than decreases4 the penalty.5 MR. GORDON: What -- what I meant to say,6 Justice Ginsburg, is that if you are -- if you continue7 to be talking about a felony offense, if it goes from8 5 years to 10 years, it went from a felony to another9 felony, in that circumstance I -- I -- I will concede10 our reading of the statute would work to the detriment11 of that defendant, that -- that's correct.12 What I was simply trying to say about the13 misdemeanor-felony is that there might be some14 additional constitutional issues that would not be15 present in -- if it went from 5 years to 10 years.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in the hypothetical17 where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex18 post facto problem?￼1920 there would21 notice that2223 were between the time that he commits the 922(g) offense24 and the time of the sentencing, yes, I think you have ex25 post facto concerns there. I think if you're talkingMR. GORDON: Your Honor, I don't believe be. The defendant presumptively is on the law has changed.Now, if -- if the increase in the penalty18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 about between the time of the State offense and the time2 of the commission of the firearm offense, I don't think3 it raises the ex post facto concerns. Again, the4 defendant is on notice, he's presumed to know what the5 law is at the time he commits the Federal offense, and6 that's what we care about here.7 I -- I would also like to return to the8 question of retroactivity for just a moment and note9 that in terms of the administerability of the Armed10 Career Criminal Act, the question of retroactivity would11 introduce, if the government's reading is adopted,12 problems that do not exist under reading ACCA speaking13 in the present tense. Under the government's approach,14 it is not simply that you can look at what the sentence15 was that the defendant received in State court. The16 government says retroactivity matters.17 So you would still have to go to the present18 penalty, and then you would have to conduct an inquiry19 into what the, you know, what changes occurred in the20 law, were any of them retroactive, were they retroactive21 for a certain period of time, et cetera. So, it -­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, how do you23 see that? I thought the government had two alternative24 positions, the first being that you look at the time -­25 at the time of the offense, at the conviction or,19￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425alternatively, it was arguing the way to take the position of the court below. But if you're going to use the present tense then you look retroactively to see -­ then you look to see whether the State would retroactively apply the new sentence.MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You understood their brief differently?MR. GORDON: Your Honor, I read the brief differently? If -- and if my reading is incorrect, I apologize.you.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure they'll tell(Laughter.)MR. GORDON: Yes, I'm sure they will.If there are no further questions, I wouldOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼like to reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,Mr. Gordon.Mr. Gannon.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNONON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Petitioner was convicted under North20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Carolina law of multiple offenses subject to a 10-year2 maximum term of imprisonment, and he actually received3 10-year sentences for his drug crimes. He now claims4 that those convictions are not ones for which the5 maximum term of imprisonment is at least 10 years for6 purposes of ACCA's definition of serious drug offense.7 That result is incorrect, because the8 sentencing court should consider the offense and the9 punishment as they were defined by the body of law under10 which the defendant was convicted and sentenced.11 This is the simplest approach, because the12 Court is already looking to the statute at the time of13 the underlying conviction in order to evaluate whether14 it satisfies the substantive component of the definition15 of a serious drug offense. And if I can start where16 Justice Sotomayor finished with my friend, we have one17 footnote in the first part of our argument, footnote 5,18 which clarifies an issue that isn't at stake here, which19 is that when we say that you need to look to the time of20 the underlying conviction, that that includes the time21 of the sentencing which could include some sentence22 modification proceedings.23 If the State had amended the law in the24 meantime, made it retroactively applicable and the25 defendant were able to get his judgment or conviction21￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 modified, then we would not insist that -- that he still2 had an offense that was subject to a 10-year maximum3 term of imprisonment. And we think that this approach4 is consistent with what the Court said in Rodriguez,5 where it was also evaluating the serious drug offense6 under ACCA and pointed us to the documents associated7 with the judgment of conviction.8 It recognizes that the relevant question9 here is the body of law that applied to this particular10 defendant in his offense. And -- and it's the term11 "conviction" that actually points us to that in the12 statute. The question is what is the sentencing regime13 associated with the14 the government's -­15 JUSTICE16 clarify your point.17 law that would have18 in his sentence, although I'm not quite sure how that19 works, because if there's a modification, I thought it20 would only apply to a defendant who had committed the21 crime at that earlier time but was convicted at the22 present time. This defendant wouldn't have his sentence23 modified.24 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that this would25 be a highly extraordinary circumstance. There may be an22defendant's actual conviction, and￼SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- just toIf there's been a modification ofentitled him to a retroactive changeAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 instance where the State legislature has actually2 amended the law, made it retroactive and said that it's3 applicable to people who had final convictions4 beforehand I -­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's my6 question. Is your footnote related to that kind of7 individual only or are you saying -- or are you8 accepting your adversary's argument that the circuit9 below got it right? You look at the is as to what the10 sentence would be today -­11 MR. GANNON: The footnote -­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if this person had13 committed the crime?14 MR. GANNON: The footnote in part A of the15 government's brief is -- is not consistent with the16 court of appeals approach. We're saying that under our17 principal reading which is at the relevant time, at the18 time of the conviction, that that includes the19 sentencing associated with that conviction; and in20 certain unusual circumstances that may well include a21 sentence modification proceeding that occurred sometime22 after the fact. But in any event it's going to be a23 previous conviction that needs to be on the books at the24 time of the 922(g) offense.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm just trying to23￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425clarify whether you mean that the -- the modification had to have occurred, meaning that he was convicted, he got 10 years, and somewhere for some State reason, that actual final judgment was amended to include 5.about -­MR.

GANNON: It -- in -- we think that it has to be under the documents associated with his judgment of conviction. So it would matter that he had been successfully able to obtain modification of the -­ the judgment associated with his conviction. In those circumstances it would be appropriate to say that the body of law that applied to his conviction was one that specified only the lower punishment.That's obviously not an issue here because the State hasn't made any of these relevant changes retroactively applicable to any offense that was committed before the first of October in 1994.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this the first time you're advancing the argument, the first part of your argument?24￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR.

In the court of appeals,9 Petitioner relied upon the Sixth Circuit's decision in10 Morton, and we -- we responded the essentially the way11 the Fourth Circuit did, which is to say the Fifth12 Circuit has distinguished instances like that when the13 court has not -- when the State has not made the -- the14 intervening decrease in the sentence retroactively15 applicable. That's the interpretation that the Fourth16 Circuit adopted.17 But the government has made this argument18 before in -- in the Second Circuit in Darden, in the19 Fifth Circuit in Hinojosa, in the -- in the Sixth20 Circuit in Morton in the 1994 decision. The government21 has made this lead argument that we're making today in22 addition to the fallback argument that the -- that the23 Fourth Circuit adopted here, and that the Fifth Circuit24 adopted in -- in Hinojosa.25 But I would note that the lead argument that25It doesn't appear as you I correct?we did not advance this￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 we're making today has several advantages that make it2 preferable to the fallback argument. Some of them have3 already been brought up today. I already mentioned the4 fact that this is simpler, because it requires the judge5 to just look to one time to evaluate the substantive6 component of the definition and the -- the sentence7 component of the definition.8 But this also prevents the types of problems9 that Justice Alito addressed earlier that may arise when10 the State has amended the definition of the offense. If11 you just look to the -- the actual offense at the time12 of the conviction, then you don't run into those sorts13 of problems, and the Fifth Circuit recognized this in14 its Allen decision and therefore ended up having to15 adopt what is essentially the government's lead argument16 here.17 The Sixth Circuit which generally follows18 Petitioner's rule also ended up adopting the19 government's lead argument in the context of a20 guidelines determination, because it recognized that it21 -- it was unwilling to assume that a conviction simply22 disappears when the State has modified the definitions23 in such a way that you can't precisely translate into24 current terms what the underlying offense of conviction25 is.26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 The government's reading avoids that problem2 because it doesn't require you to recharacterize the old3 offense at all. It just says what was he convicted of?4 What was the maximum sentence associated with that5 offense at the time he was actually prosecuted? There's6 nothing hypothetical about it. And as the -- as the7 Court pointed out in Rodriguez, we would expect a lot of8 the documents association with a judgment of conviction9 to make this a relatively easy inquiry to answer what10 was the maximum sentence at the relevant time.11 This -- the reading also avoids the12 difficulty that Justice Sotomayor pointed out that -­13 that is associated with later increases in -- in the14 sentence. Under the government's view, if you committed15 an offense at a time when it was subject to a 10-year16 punishment, Congress has reasonably assumed that you are17 a dangerous person; but that Congress could also18 reasonably assume that there's a distinction between19 somebody who commits an offense at a time when it's20 subject to a 10-year term of imprisonment and someone21 else who commits that offense at a different time when22 it's subject to only a 30-month term of imprisonment.23 And so under North Carolina law, for instance, the -­24 the felony of manufacture of methamphetamine went from25 being a class H felony which is subject to a 30-year27￼Alderson Reporting Company8 subject to a 30-month maximumsentence is not aswilling to commit the same subject to a 19-yearOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 maximum term of imprisonment to being a class C felony2 -- excuse me, a 30-month maximum term of imprisonment,3 to a class C felony, which is subject to a 19-year4 maximum term of imprisonment on December 1st, 2004. And5 we think it's reasonable for Congress to assume that6 somebody who committed the crime of manufacturing7 methamphetamine in North Carolina at a time when it was9 dangerous as somebody who was10 offense at a time when it was11 maximum term of imprisonment.12 And the government's approach by -- by13 requiring the court to look to the time of the￼14 underlying conviction and sentencing unifies the inquiry15 across both components of the definition of serious drug16 offense and the definition of violent felony that17 Justice Kagan alluded to in the earlier part of the18 argument, that the definition of violent felony includes19 present-tense references to whether a crime is burglary,20 the question of whether it is punishable by a -- by a21 term exceeding 12 months, which is necessary to22 establish that it's a felony is one that -- that we23 believe needs to be made at the time of the underlying24 conviction.2528JUSTICE ALITO: What if the legislatureAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 decreases the penalty because it really has taken a2 different -- a new look at the nature of the offense and3 has come to the conclusion that this really is not4 nearly as serious as we -- as we previously thought? So5 why should the prior judgment about the severity of the6 offense be taken into account under ACCA?7 MR. GANNON: Well, Congress has given us a8 very objective and simple yardstick to look to and9 that's just what the maximum term of imprisonment is.10 And if -- if the State actually thinks that the previous11 offenses that were committed were less serious, then it12 could make the decreased maximum term of imprisonment13 retroactively applicable if -- if it wanted to14 demonstrate that -- that it really thought that those15 were mistakes. But that's not the approach that South16 Carolina has taken -- that North Carolina has taken17 here.18 It has said that for crimes that were19 committed before October 1st, 1994, the prior sentencing20 regime still applies. And as the Chief Justice pointed21 out before, the State has not repudiated the judgment22 that these were serious offenses, not -- not -- not only23 with respect to when they were committed, but the entire24 shift to structured sentencing Petitioner25 acknowledges -­29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 2 34 their prior5 if they even had made it -- made the new sentence6 retroactive, but a particular defendant was no longer in7 prison, so wasn't on parole, so there was nothing -­JUSTICE ALITO: But what if -­MR. GANNON: -- wasn't intended -­JUSTICE ALITO: What if they had repudiated normative judgment? And -- and even -- what8 there was no way that this could have any effect on that9 person?10 MR. GANNON: Well, it's possible that the11 State could -- could provide a mechanism by which he12 could have the documents associated with his prior13 judgment amended to reflect the fact that he -- he ought14 not to have been subjected to the -- to the greater term15 of imprisonment.16 I think that that's probably the hardest17 case, somebody who once upon a time actually, like this18 Petitioner, did a 10-year term of imprisonment for -­19 for the sentence, the State in retrospect concludes that20 the offense had not been that serious even at the time,21 and if he had been prosecuted today he -- he should have22 received only a 5-year maximum term of imprisonment.23 I think -- I think that that's -- that's an24 instance where it -- it might be difficult to -- to -­25 to find a way in the statute to say that ACCA doesn't30￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 apply to him, that he did not have a previous conviction2 at the relevant point in time.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's so hard.4 I -- I could find my way clear to saying that if it has5 been retroactively made a -- a -- a lesser offense, that6 that would qualify under -- under the statute. I don't7 know why you insist that his actual conviction be -- be8 altered.9 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that we10 would obviously still prevail under an approach like11 that. It would be an expansion of what we proposed in12 footnote 5. We think that the relevant inquiry starts13 with the conviction, but if -- if the court were to ask14 in the context of the body of law that applies to his15 offensive conviction, whether the State has changed its16 mind by doing -- by altering the precise yardstick that17 Congress has directed the court to look to, then -- then18 I think that -- that that would be an appropriate way to19 deal with it.20 I'm not exactly sure how you get it out of21 the words of the statute, but it -- it would solve the22 problem for -- for cases like this of somebody who had23 been unable to take advantage of a sentence modification24 type of proceeding.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell us whether31￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 changes in State sentences -- do the States routinely2 address retroactivity? Or do they leave it to their3 general common law? Or do you have any idea of what -­4 MR. GANNON: Several States have specific5 saving statutes like the Federal Government does in6 1 U.S.C. 109. At least three States have constitutional7 provisions that effectively are something like a saving8 statute. Sometimes they have background common law9 principles.10 In any instance, these types of general11 provisions, except where the constitutional provisions12 exist, could be overcome by the State legislature in a13 particular statute, just as is the case with the Federal14 savings statute. A State legislature, if it wants to be￼15 express about the retroactive applicability of16 would be able to do that.17 There may be limitations under the18 facto clause of its increasing the severity ofa change, ex post there -­ we wouldCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,Mr. Gordon, you have 6 minutes remaining.32but for something like a decrease, be fewer limitations.If there are no further questions,19 punishment,20 there would2122 urge the Court to affirm the judgment of the -­2324 Mr. Gannon. 25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER3 MR. GORDON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.4 First, the government talks about, again,5 the problems arising if -- if a statute is amended, and6 so forth. Again, I would like to analogize that to the7 violent felony prong of ACCA. Predicate convictions8 disappear. Things that were predicate convictions cease9 to be when this Court interprets a particular offense as10 not qualifying as a violent felony, then -- then11 individuals who had committed that offense it disappears12 as -- as a predicate. So it is -- it is not anomalous13 for that to happen.14 The government speaks about looking to the15 time of the State proceeding. It is -- that -- that -­16 that approach overlooks that changes to drug laws very17 well could reflect a normative judgment on the basis of18 the -- of the legislature, and the question is19 whether -- whether in the way it wrote the statute,20 Congress wanted -- wanted to defer to those State21 judgments.22 Texas and New York changed their sentencing23 laws because they judged them to have been too harsh,24 that -- that they treated as more serious offenses25 than -- than those offenses actually were.33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 We see that today with the issue of -- of2 crack cocaine. And under the government's reading,3 individuals may be hit with -- with an ACCA mandatory4 minimum on the basis of crack convictions sustained at a5 time when, you know, the view of crack is very, very6 different from what it is now. So we think that is an7 important consideration as well.8 The question of retroactivity, again, as we9 have argued in our brief, it does not -- the savings10 clause in North Carolina was a general savings clause,11 it applied to every single offense in the -- in the12 State. It was not a reflection of the -- of the13 legislature's judgment of seriousness. And if I -- if I14 may end on a point that I made earlier, the question for15 this Court really is when do you want to treat two16 individuals -- when do you -- when do you want to look17 at them?18 Do you want to look at them at the time of19 the Federal offense or do you want to look at them in20 terms of their prior State convictions and come to a21 conclusion that although they did exactly the same thing22 in the State court, one committed a serious drug23 offense, one did not. We think that is an absurd24 result. It's not a fair result, and we would ask the25 Court to reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.34￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
