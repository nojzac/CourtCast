Tennessee.          Mr. Rogers.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. MARK WARD                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WARD:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleasethe Court:          In two cases, Bouie v. City of Columbia andMarks v. United States, this Court stated that ex postfacto principles apply to judicial decisions under verynarrow circumstances, and that's only when those judicialdecisions are unexpected and indefensible based upon thelaw that's been expressed at the time of the conduct in10111213141516    question.171819202122232425          This case involves a misapplication of this ruleof law by the Tennessee Supreme Court.  In this case, theTennessee Supreme Court held that its decision to overruleitself and to overrule a 700-year-old rule of law was notunexpected and indefensible based upon this test that thisCourt adopted.          QUESTION:  Has the Supreme Court of Tennesseeever applied the year-and-a-day rule to a case?          MR. WARD:  The court has recognized it since                             3 1    1907, Your Honor. 2              QUESTION:  I -- that wasn't my question, because 3    I think your opponent says it was dicta.  Do you say it 4    was not dicta, that it actually let somebody off on that5 basis? 6              MR. WARD:  It was not dicta in that case.  In 7    1907 in Percer v. State, if I could explain -- 8              QUESTION:  Yes. 9              MR. WARD:  -- the court reversed in Percer v.10    State for numerous reasons.  Among those, they tried the11    defendant without the defendant being present.12              One of the reasons they reversed was because13    they put on proof during the trial as to the date of the14    death of the deceased, the witness said that it happened15    sometime in July, but never testified as to what date,16    what day of the month in July, or what year in July.  The17    court in -- the Tennessee Supreme Court referenced the18    year-and-a-day rule and reversed the case, because absent19    some evidence of what date and year there was a death,20    then there could be insufficient evidence.21              QUESTION:  Well, was it reversed because the22    case shouldn't have been brought, or because the testimony23    was not relevant?24              MR. WARD:  The court -- the Tennessee Supreme25    Court in 1907 listed numerous reasons and said for all of4123456789    when.10111213141516171819202122232425these we reverse.  It's not like they said --          QUESTION:  Yes --          MR. WARD:  -- specifically, this is the onewe're going to reverse on.          QUESTION:  Well, but they didn't then analyzeseparately the year-and-the-day rule, or -- you -- Ithought you'd said that a witness testified, and thewitness said something happened in July but she didn't say          MR. WARD:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And I'm curious whether the SupremeCourt of Tennessee in invoking the year-and-a-day rulesaid it made the witness' testimony irrelevant, or didit -- does the year-and-a-day rule mean that the entireprosecution shouldn't have been brought?          MR. WARD:  Well, what the court stated was thatabsent the -- they -- it was really a very --one-paragraph opinion, a very short opinion.  They --          QUESTION:  The whole opinion was one --          MR. WARD:  No.  Most of the paragraph was -- theopinion was taken up with the discussion of trying the manin abstentia.          QUESTION:  Absentia.          MR. WARD:  Then there was about a half-a-pageparagraph that dealt with two issues.  One was, was this5 1    indictment returned before the date of the offense or not? 2    The other one was the year-and-a-day rule, and absent this 3    testimony there was insufficient proof before the court as 4    to either fact, the year-and-a-day rule or when the 5    offense was occurred, so I contend it was not dicta in6 that case. 7              And in this case, Your Honor, State v. Rogers, 8    the court, the Tennessee Supreme Court said, we have 9    recognized the year-and-a-day rule in Tennessee since10 1907.11              QUESTION:  Mr. Ward, there -- this case has an12    aura of unreality about it.  Your client apparently13    attempted to murder the victim by stabbing him in the14    heart with a butcher knife.  Now, he didn't have any15    settled expectation that he wasn't going to be accused of16    murder, and yet he wants to take advantage of this17    year-and-a-day rule.  I mean, what does it serve?18              It's some concept of fair warning or19    expectation, but at the time the crime was committed, I20    guess he hoped the victim would die, and I don't see that21    your client has been deprived of any kind of an22    expectation.23 24 25          MR. WARD:  Well --          QUESTION:  Regardless of what we do with theyear-and-a-day rule.6 1              MR. WARD:  Well, with regard to fair warning my 2    client was entitled objectively. 3              Subjectively, I have to admit it is very 4    difficult to ever prove that any criminal defendant relies 5    upon the state of the law at the time that he or she 6    commits an act, but objectively he was entitled to rely 7    upon the year-and-a-day rule if the victim did survive. 8    But more importantly than that, after the fact, after he 9    was charged, fair notice and reliance applies after the10    fact also, not just at the time of the act; otherwise, a11    defendant who is approaching trial is never going to know12    exactly what are the elements of the offense, or what is13    the punishment that I'm about to face.14              We don't just say you're entitled to fair15    warning of the punishment at the time you commit it, but16    you're also, based upon that time, are allowed to rely17    upon that as you're approaching trial.18              QUESTION:  Well, I guess we wouldn't allow a19    court, any more than we would allow a legislature, to20    change the law so that attempted murder now becomes21    murder.  That is, so long as you intend to kill, dispense22    with the requirement that the victim actually die.  You23    could say, gee, his expectations weren't disappointed.  He24    intended to kill.  It just so happened the person didn't25 die.7 1              And we certainly wouldn't uphold a State supreme 2    court judgment that, well, you know, that's a 3    technicality, we're not going to insist that the victim 4    have died, we're going to get you for murder anyway.  I 5    guess you could likewise say no disappointment of 6    expectations. 7              MR. WARD:  Well -- 8              QUESTION:  I don't see why this is terribly 9    different from that.10              MR. WARD:  Well, it's not.  Under the State's11    theory in this case, as long as the defendant had the same12    mens rea, same actus reis, the fact that the result13    occurred or didn't occur would be irrelevant, and under14    the State's theory you could eliminate the requirement15    that there be a result and there would be no problem with16 that.17              But the problem is that as a matter of18    fundamental fairness and fair warning as to punishment19    deals with not just at the time of the act.  If we allow20    courts to retroactively alter the elements of an offense21    or to retroactively enhance punishment, what I have to do,22    what I have to tell my clients when we're getting ready to23    go to trial is, I can tell you what the law was at the24    time you committed your crime, and I can tell you what the25    law is today, as we get ready to go for trial, and you're8 1    innocent of the law as we have it today.  In some cases 2    I'm going to get to tell them that.  But I can't tell you, 3    because the courts can change after the fact.  They can 4    eliminate this element of the offense. 5              QUESTION:  Mr. Ward, let's assume that the 6    Tennessee Supreme Court had simply affirmed the lower 7    court that said the legislature made this change, and they 8    made it long before he committed the crime.  You would 9    have no issue at all.10              MR. WARD:  I wouldn't be here, and that would be11    a matter of statutory interpretation.12              QUESTION:  Now, suppose the State is one, and I13    don't know if this is so, where you couldn't have purely14    prospective overruling because that would be considered an15    advisory opinion, so here's the Tennessee Supreme Court16    saying, gee, it was our mistake in not getting rid of this17    obsolete rule.  It's our rule, not the legislature's rule,18    so we want to get rid of it, but we can't.19              We're saying it's our fault, not the20    legislature's.  We can't change, however, because if we21    apply it to this case it's going to be ex post facto, and22    we can't simply prospectively overrule without being an23    advisory opinion.  So is your -- is the -- at the end of24    the road, is your argument one that a court can't cure its25    own error of this nature?91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WARD:  No, Your Honor.  The Tennessee courtcould have abolished this rule and applied itprospectively, and probably, and we contend was requiredto do that if it wanted to abolish the rule because of theex post facto due process requirements.          QUESTION:  So it can give -- the Tennesseecourts can give an advisory opinion in that respect?  Imean, they can --          MR. WARD:  Tennessee courts, I have nocitations, but they frequently make rulings prospectively.          QUESTION:  Well, but Justice Ginsburg'shypothetical, and the point interests me as well, it'sactually to assume the opposite, that a court is in asystem where it is improper to give an advisory opinion.Then what would happen?  The court's hands are tied.          MR. WARD:  Well, I think that the court couldgive some indication, and could voice some discomfort withthe rule short of an advisory opinion.          QUESTION:  But it could never change it, unlessyou're saying that the dictum would provide sufficientbasis for a subsequent case.          MR. WARD:  It would --          QUESTION:  Then we have an incrementaloverruling process that you would allow?  They're stillchanging the law.101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WARD:  I think the dictum in the case wouldthen be such that when a court came along later it wouldbe able to say, this was expected and defensible becausewe criticized the rule in a previous case.          QUESTION:  Well --          QUESTION:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- a moment ago you were saying howyou had to have certainty in advising your client, but ifthat is permissible in a gradual overruling, surely thecertainty is gone.          MR. WARD:  Well --          QUESTION:  You don't know what the TennesseeSupreme Court is going to do the next time it comes up ifin the interim it has criticized the rule.          MR. WARD:  But I would be fairly confident, ifthe Tennessee Supreme Court had criticized the rule inadvising my client that there was a substantial likelihoodthat the rule would be changed.          QUESTION:  Well, suppose 10 State supreme courtsin other jurisdictions -- that didn't happen here -- hadcriticized the rule and Tennessee was just quiet about it.You've got the same problem.          MR. WARD:  Well --          QUESTION:  Plus -- plus we know that the day,year-and-a-day rule is an outmoded relic anyway.111234 States.5              QUESTION:  Mr. Ward, you seem to accept it as6    unthinkable that the Supreme Court of Tennessee should be7    unable to alter a rule of criminal law by judicial          MR. WARD:  Well, with regard to other States Ithink it's asking too much of our citizens to ignore arule of the Tennessee Supreme Court and look to other 8    decision.  Do you think it was unthinkable at the time the 9    Federal Constitution was adopted?10              Do you think that common law courts, which had11    much more rigorous notions of stare decisis than we do12    today, do you think they would have thought it unthinkable13    that a court should not be able to suddenly make a crime14    of what had not been a crime at common law?15              I mean, I don't know why you accept that,16    especially when you're dealing with a State that has a17    constitutional provision adopted in 1870 which reads, all18    laws and ordinances now in force and use in this State not19    inconsistent with this constitution shall continue in20    force and use until they shall expire, be altered, or21    repealed by the legislature.  I don't think it's22    unthinkable at all, the Supreme Court of Tennessee23    shouldn't be able to alter the criminal law.24              I mean, if you want to accept it, fine, but I25    don't know --121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011    Tennessee.12              QUESTION:  The question didn't assume that it13    was unthinkable.  The question was simply putting it to14    you, is this the end result?  That is, that the Tennessee15    Supreme Court cannot itself change its rule, only the16    legislature can?17              MR. WARD:  Well, the Tennessee Supreme Court can18    change the rule, and I have no problem with the court19    changing the rule.  The problem that I'm talking about is20    the retroactive --21              QUESTION:  But they can't change it, because22    there'll never be a case in which they can change it.  In23    other words, the court in this situation, we can't change24    it prospectively because it would be advisory.  We can't25    change it in this case because it would be ex post facto.13          MR. WARD:  I'm not sure --          QUESTION:  -- why you would accept it.          MR. WARD:  -- that the Tennessee Supreme Courtcan alter the -- I'm not sure I understand -- let -- well,maybe I should continue.          QUESTION:  The question to you, assume that itwas unthinkable that the Supreme Court of Tennesseeshouldn't be able to change the criminal law, why itshould be able to do that, but that's certainly not whatis envisioned by the constitution of the State of1    One answer that you could give is yes, that's right, only2    the legislature can change it, but you're not giving that3 answer. 45 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  No.  How do you explain the provisionof the Tennessee constitution that I quoted?          MR. WARD:  That provision, my interpretation ofthat provision is it refers to statutory laws and not tojudicial decisions of the courts, would be myinterpretation of that.          QUESTION:  May I ask you this further question?Suppose we -- it's so, and we tell the Tennessee SupremeCourt, you're wrong, this would be an ex post factoobligation.  It would still be open to the TennesseeSupreme Court, would it not, to say, gee, we have torethink what that lower court did, and we now decide thatthey were right after all, that the legislature made thatchange long before this crime was committed.          It would still -- no matter what we say here, itwould still be open to the Tennessee Supreme Court to saythe change was already made by the legislature and thatreally ended the case, and all this has been kind of anacademic exercise.          MR. WARD:  Well, the Tennessee Supreme Court hasalready said that the legislature did not make a change in14MR. WARD:  No, I'm -- 1    it, and the year-and-a-day rule is -- 2              QUESTION:  But they could change their mind, 3    better enlightened by what's happened since then.  There 4    are highest courts who concede from time to time that they 5    are fallible, that they may have made a mistake. 6              MR. WARD:  So if this Court was to reverse, the 7    Tennessee Supreme Court then would change its opinion? 8              QUESTION:  I asked if that would be something 9    that would be open to the Tennessee Supreme Court to do.10              MR. WARD:  I guess the Tennessee Supreme Court11    could do it.  They could certainly try it, and I would12    certainly try to think of some way to come back to this13    Court, but --14              QUESTION:  Well, can you think of one?  The15    Tennessee Supreme Court says, gee, we got it wrong, that16    court of criminal appeals, they had it right all along.17    The legislature took care of it.  We don't have any more18    year-and-a-day rule, haven't had one for 5 years.19              MR. WARD:  I guess I have to concede that that's20    always possible, but the Court has made a detailed21    analysis, the Tennessee Supreme Court, they've rejected22    that, and I believe that I would stand behind them that23    they would not change their mind in midstream simply24    because this Court sent the case back and said they erred25    on another point.15 1              But I'm not contending the Tennessee Supreme 2    Court can't change the rule.  The rule is dead in 3    Tennessee.  The year-and-a-day rule has been done away 4    with.  The question is whether or not they can apply it to 5    an offense that was committed 5 years prior to that, and 6    it gets back to the basic principle of legality.  Do we 7    try defendants based upon the law that's in existence at 8    the time of their conduct, or do we change it after the 9    fact, and the problem with changing it after the fact is,10    what it's going to do is, it's going to undermine the11    presumption of innocence.12              QUESTION:  I could understand very clearly,13    Mr. Ward, the argument if you were saying that they added14    an element, or they subtracted an element from the15    offense, or something like that.   You used to have to do16    it intentionally, but you don't have to anymore, and it's17    a much different -- but here you have something that18    really is quite peripheral, out on the fringes, that19    doesn't govern the substantive criminal law at all.  It's20    almost like a statute of limitations.21              MR. WARD:  Well, I disagree, Your Honor.  I22    believe that this is a material element of the offense as23    the Tennessee Supreme Court has interpreted it.  They have24    said that you must prove death within a year and a day in25    order to convict of any homicide offense in Tennessee,161 and --2              QUESTION:  But that would be true of a statute3    of limitations too, would it not?  If the statute of4    limitations from -- say, supposing Tennessee had a statute5    of limitations for robbery, 10 years.  The Supreme Court6    of Tennessee would say you have to bring an action within7    10 years in order to convict of robbery, but that doesn't8    really make it an element of the substantive criminal law.9              MR. WARD:  No, because it doesn't deal with10    anything with regard to the -- it doesn't deal with11    anything but a time period that they're required to bring12    an action in.  This is a time period that they must prove13    certain facts occurred in.14              QUESTION:  With a statute of limitations your15    argument would go, you are guilty of the crime but can't16    be prosecuted for it after the 10 years, whereas with a17    year and a day, your position is you're not guilty of the18    crime unless the death occurs within a year of -- within a19    year and a day.20              Now, your opponent says it's just evidentiary.21    What's your response to that?  It's just a question of22    evidence.23242517          MR. WARD:  Well, it's -- as interpreted by theTennessee Supreme Court, it's not just a question ofevidence.  It's a material element that's required to be 1    proven by the prosecution, and there is nothing else -- if 2    it was a rule of admissibility of evidence, there would be 3    something else that could prove this point, or prove the 4    conviction of -- prove the elements of the crime, but this 5    is an element that, it must be proven. 6              There's nothing else available.  If you don't 7    prove this element, you don't prove your case.  It's a 8    sufficiency of the evidence rule.  If you don't prove 9    this -- and this is -- you lose.  And now we say after the10    fact I can't prove it, we'll just eliminate it.  Any11    element of the offense I can't prove, we have the power to12    retroactively eliminate.13              QUESTION:  I guess one of the questions I have14    is whether we gain anything by characterizing it as an15    element.  If you go back to Bouie, Bouie was concerned16    with, let's say, the elements that refer to the conduct of17    the defendant, didn't it?  And Bouie was concerned about18    fair notice to an individual about what he could and could19    not do at the time he acts.  And so even if we say, well,20    the year-and-a-day rule is kind of like an element, it's21    not the kind of element, it's not the kind of fact that22    Bouie was concerned with, was -- is it?23              MR. WARD:  It's not a fact that would deal with24    the first Calder category, whether something was criminal,25    made criminal after the fact, no more than whether or181 not -- 2              QUESTION:  No, but I -- I think I agree with you 3    there.  I mean, if we assume that Bouie stands for the 4    proposition that the ex post facto clause and all the 5    Calder analytical framework is subsumed into due process, 6    I'll be candid to say I think you win this case, and my -- 7    I guess my question was really aimed at, or premised on a 8    different assumption, and that is that Bouie really does 9    not stand for wholesale incorporation, and what Bouie10    actually held, the point as to which Bouie made a11    difference, was a point about altering elements that12    describe the criminal act itself as opposed to conditions13    that may or may not occur subsequent to that.14              MR. WARD:  I agree with Your Honor.  The cases15    that come before this Court for the most part have dealt16    with the first Calder category.17              QUESTION:  Yes.18              MR. WARD:  But if this Court --19              QUESTION:  But I guess if you don't use an20    elements test for Bouie, I guess you have to reach the21    conclusion -- and you say it's only those things that22    affect the conduct at the time of the offense, regardless23    of whether it's an element or not.  Then you would have to24    say that you could change the law and not require for25    murder in the first degree that the victim had died.191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That's a subsequent event.  You knew you shouldn't stabhim with a knife, intending to kill him, and the fact thathe died should make no difference.  I --          MR. WARD:  I believe --          QUESTION:  I can't imagine that you're allowedto do that.          MR. WARD:  Well, that's not my argument.          QUESTION:  I know it isn't.          MR. WARD:  That's my opponent's.          QUESTION:  But that's what you should have saidin response to the Bouie argument just raised.          (Laughter.)          MR. WARD:  But if this Court applies one Caldercategory there's no reason not to apply them all.  Ifthere's some concern about whether due process principlesshould incorporate -- ex post facto principles shouldapply --          QUESTION:  What is your authority, Mr. Ward, forsimply suggesting that all of the Calder categories arecarried over into this ex -- like ex post facto -- clearlythis is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.  It'sgoverned by Bouie, which said some of the sameconsiderations applied.  You're talking as if everythingis carried over bag and baggage.          MR. WARD:  Well, I submit it's carried over with                            20 1    the Bouie limitation that the judicial decision has to be 2    unexpected and indefensible, but what I'm suggesting is, 3    there's no reason to distinguish the first Calder category 4    from any of the others as far as ranking them in some 5    priority that -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, but then you're acting for -- 7    asking for an extension of Bouie, which clearly didn't 8    cover these others. 9              MR. WARD:  Yes.  I'm asking -- in one sense I'm10    asking for an extension.  In the other sense I'm asking11    the Court to say that it meant what it said, that ex post12    facto principles apply through the Due Process Clause.13              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Ward, with respect to that,14    Calder was itself dicta, because the case came out the15    other way, and there was something said by a justice and16    it has become venerable over the years just because it's17    been repeated and applied as law by later courts.18              But then, when you're thinking of extending it19    under a due process label, wouldn't you want to take into20    account its origin, and the compartmentalization has been21    criticized?  I mean, you're not bound to take it over22    lock, stock and barrel.  Why should you, given its origin23    as dictum and its rigidity with these categories?  I mean,24    it's not Scripture.25              MR. WARD:  That's correct, and actually when you21 1    look at the definition in Bouie that was cited from Calder 2    v. Bull, the discussion talks about aggravating a crime 3    after the fact, and also making something criminal that 4    wasn't a crime after the fact, and those are the two 5    things that Bowie concentrated on in its statement or 6    definition of an ex post facto law, the first two Calder 7    categories.  And then the Court said, if it's ex post 8    facto for a legislature to do it, then due process should 9    prevent the courts from obtaining the same result.10              My suggestion is that there's just as great a11    harm from making something criminal that wasn't criminal12    before as it is to aggravate a criminal offense.  For13    instance, if you take something that's not a crime and14    give it a 2-day punishment.  It's a far greater harm to15    take something that already is a crime with a 2-day16    punishment and then aggravate it to where it has a17    20-year punishment.18              Justice Chase talked in Calder about those19    Calder categories and said they came from the same kinds20    of harm, and my suggestion is that ex post facto21    principles are fundamental concepts, fundamental concepts22    like fundamental fairness.  It's fundamentally unfair to23    alter the elements of an offense after the fact, or to24    aggravate it.  It's fundamentally unfair because it25    undermines the presumption of innocence.                                  221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  So everything under the Ex Post FactoClause would be subsumed under due process vis-a-vis thelegislature too, is it, and in fact that's what you'resaying, isn't it?          MR. WARD:  That's the rule I'm asking, but onlyunder the limited circumstance when the ruling isunexpected and indefensible under the test this Courtadopted in Bouie and Marks.  This test was developed fromJerome Hall's principles of criminal law, and it's to takeinto consideration the fact that all opinions in one wayor the other are retroactive.  How do we treat theseopinions that are grossly retroactive, that change a clearline of authority in a jurisdiction?          If there's no further questions, I'd like toreserve the remainder of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well.  Very well, Mr. Rogers.          Mr. Moore, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          GENERAL MOORE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The decision below did not deny petitioner dueprocess of law because it did not deprive him of fairwarning that stabbing another person in the chest with abutcher knife risked prosecution under Tennessee's231    homicide statutes.2              The statute under which petitioner was convicted3    defines the crime of second degree murder as the knowing4    killing of another.  The -- a conviction under that5    statute does not require that the victim die within any6    particular period of time, it does not require that the7    defendant know that the victim will die within any8    particular time.9              QUESTION:  But statutes often -- I'm sorry,10    Chief.  Go ahead.11              QUESTION:  Well, I was just going to say, wasn't12    it assumed by the Tennessee Supreme Court that this was a13    substantive rule of law, and that you agreed that it was14    but argued that it had been repealed by the 1989 revision15    of the statute?16              GENERAL MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor, our position17    below was that the rule was a substantive principle of law18    that had been abolished by operation of our Criminal Code19    of '89, which said that unless conduct is described as an20    offense by statute it is no longer an offense, and we21    argued that the evident purpose of that provision was to22    abolish all common law crimes, common law elements of23 crimes --24 2524QUESTION:  And the court rejected that argument.GENERAL MOORE:  -- but that position was 1    rejected, Your Honor. 2              QUESTION:  But is it still not correct that you 3    would agree that it's a substantive principle of law, or 4    are you taking a different -- 5              GENERAL MOORE:  Our position is that for due 6    process purposes the label one attaches to the rule, 7    whether one calls it a substantive rule, a procedural 8    rule, an evidentiary rule, an elemental rule, whatever 9    label one attaches to it really doesn't make any10    difference, because the touchstone of due process fair11    warning in this context, in the retroactivity context, is12    the violation of a reliance interest of some sort, and13 because --14              QUESTION:  Let me ask you just a little15    refinement of the question.  Supposing you had prevailed16    on the view that the 1989 statute had discarded this or17    changed this substantive rule of law, would you think that18    you could then have prosecuted someone who had committed19    the crime before the 1989 statute went into effect?20              GENERAL MOORE:  Your Honor's hypothetical is if21    we had prevailed and the '89 act had --22              QUESTION:  And then you wanted to indict someone23    who had committed the same kind of offense prior to 1989.24              GENERAL MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor, it is.  What25    Your Honor's question essentially is, if the legislature251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      had effectuated this change, would this be a prohibited ex      post facto law.  Our contention is that no, it would not      have been, although I must concede that if the rule had      been a definitional element of the crime, that would have      been an ex post facto violation.                QUESTION:  But there you're placing a label on      it, and I thought the label didn't matter.                GENERAL MOORE:  Right, and I think labels do      make a difference for Ex Post Facto Clause purposes, if      in --                QUESTION:  But not for due process purposes.                GENERAL MOORE:  But not for due process                QUESTION:  So your position is, in the15    hypothetical that I raised with your colleague over there,16    your position is that if the legislature changed, or our17    Court changed the law so that the victim no longer has to18    die, you're guilty of murder, your reliance would have19    been just the same.  You intended to kill the person.  You20    struck him with a knife.  He just happened, through your21    good luck, not to die.  No reliance interest at all.  Do22    you really think the court could say, we no longer require23    the victim die for murder?24              GENERAL MOORE:  I do not.25              QUESTION:  Why?2610111213    purposes.14 1              GENERAL MOORE:  But I think -- 2              QUESTION:  I think it's because it's an element 3    of the crime, but why do you think it is? 4              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, I -- certainly the death 5    of the victim is an element of the crime. 6              QUESTION:  Yes. 7              GENERAL MOORE:  The timing of the death of the 8    victim is not an element of the crime. 9              QUESTION:  Ah, so we do come down to the debate10    over whether this timing thing here is an element of the11    crime or not.   You've just said that it's irrelevant for12    due process purposes.13              GENERAL MOORE:  I think the due process14    violation in Your Honor's hypothetical would be that --15    well, I think first of all, Your Honor's hypothetical16    assumes that a court may rewrite a statute.   Homicide in17    Tennessee is not a common law crime.18              QUESTION:  All right.19              GENERAL MOORE:  It's a statutory crime.20              QUESTION:  Change the hypothetical so it isn't a21    statute, it's a common law crime.  It doesn't matter.  I22    mean, the fact is, you have to come back -- in order to23    avoid my hypothetical you have to fall back on the fact24    that this is not an element of the crime in this case.  If25    it's an element of the crime, I think you're going to27 1    lose, unless you're willing to accept the hypothetical I 2    gave you that you can change the law through judicial 3    decision to dispense with the death of the victim. 4              GENERAL MOORE:  I think the change, the 5    alteration in the law posited by Your Honor's hypothetical 6    would be unconstitutional, but not because it violated 7    Bouie's fair warning principle. 8              QUESTION:  That's right, so there must be 9    something beyond Bouie's fair warning principle.10              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, there is substantive due11    process.  If it is a wholly irrational change, that indeed12    would be unconstitutional for that reason, but I think the13    retroactivity problem here that is the subject of Mr.14    Ward's client's complaint is that somehow the retroactive15    alteration of this principle of law deprived him of some16    form of fair warning.17              QUESTION:  You're careful to say that this is18    not a substantive due process violation, and that's the19    way the question presented is.  I -- the ex post facto law20    applies to the States.  Can we consider this as an ex post21    facto case without any prejudice to your position?22              GENERAL MOORE:  No, Your Honor, I do not think23    the Court may consider this to be an ex post facto case,24    because the ex post facto --25              QUESTION:  No, no, no.  Can we debate this case28 1    under the Ex Post Facto Clause, or does that depart2 from -- 3              GENERAL MOORE:  Certainly Your Honor may ask me 4    questions concerning whether the Ex Post Facto Clause 5    would be violated if this alteration had been effectuated 6    by the legislature, yes.  Is that Your -- is Your Honor's7 point -- 8              QUESTION:  Suppose the Court thinks that it's an 9    ex post facto violation for the legislature to repeal10    the -- pardon me, for the Court to abrogate the11    year-and-a-day rule.  That's really what's before us,12    isn't it?  Isn't this an ex post facto case rather than a13    substantive due process case?14              GENERAL MOORE:  I would disagree with Your15    Honor, because it would be an ex post facto case if the16    alteration of the law here had been effectuated by the17    legislature.  Now, Mr. Ward's argument is that the18    technical restrictions of the Ex Post Facto Clause have19    been imported into the Due Process Clause, but there are20    numerous reasons why we contend that would be imprudent21    and, as a matter of history, incorrect.22              QUESTION:  I see.  And this is the way you read23    Bouie.  Of course, Bouie does have language to the effect24    that if the legislature can't do it under the Ex Post25    Facto Clause, neither can the courts, and I would assume29 1    that the Court in Bouie would have said, because of the Ex 2    Post Facto Clause itself, as well as because of the 3    substantive Due Process Clause, or was it restrained from 4    doing that just because we've always said that ex post 5    facto is for legislatures, not courts? 6              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, I think a combination of 7    the two, but I think Bouie cannot be read to have already 8    accomplished this importation that Mr. Ward suggests this 9    Court ought to adopt in this case.10              QUESTION:  Well, I think if we prevail for your11    position we do have to cut back on some of the language in12    Bouie, do we not?13              GENERAL MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  Because there is the fact, if we say15    well, the legislature can't do it under the Ex Post Facto16    Clause, neither can the courts.17              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, I think candidly the18    language to which Your Honor refers is properly19    characterized as dicta, because in the Bouie opinion20    Justice Brennan quite clearly located the doctrinal source21    of his ruling in this Court's Bouie for vagueness22    jurisprudence.23 24 25          QUESTION:  I think that's a fair argument, butwe have to at least cut back on the dicta.          GENERAL MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.                            30 1              QUESTION:  If that's what it is. 2              GENERAL MOORE:  The State of Tennessee would not 3    object to Your Honors clarifying that point, and I think 4    the point is well taken in Justice Brennan's opinion in 5    that case, is that both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the 6    Due Process Clause of course spring from a common core of 7    concerns about fairness, but obviously the purpose of the 8    Ex Post Facto Clause is as really a structural restraint 9    on the power of the legislative branch.10              Now, clearly --11              QUESTION:  May I just interrupt you there for a12    second?  The clause itself doesn't speak about the13    legislative branch.  It speaks about, a State may not pass14    such a law, and it's true, of course, that a court15    normally looks to the past and decides what the law has16    always been, even though a question has never been17 decided.18              But here, however, it's unusual, because the19    Tennessee Supreme Court expressly says, we're going to20    change a substantive rule of law, and is that any21    different than if it had been exercising, say, its22    functions to make court rules, or had said, we are now23    going to pass the following rule, that in murder cases the24    victim does not have to die within a year.  If they'd25    written it out as a rule to be applied in the future, and31 1    somehow had authority to do that and comply with the 2    Tennessee constitution, how would we treat that, as a 3    court rule, or as a legislative rule? 4              GENERAL MOORE:  I think, under this Court's 5    first ex post facto case, Calder v. Bull, the action would 6    still be a judicial act and therefore beyond the scope of 7    the Ex Post Facto Clause. 8              If Your Honor will recall, in that case three of 9    the four justices posited the possibility that the10    resolution under review there had been adopted by the11    Connecticut legislature in the exercise of that body's12    historic powers to operate as a court, and all three of13    those justices said that if we decide this is a judicial14    act rather than an act of legislation, it is beyond the15    words of the Constitution.16              But in that day of rigorous stare decisis, what17    they may have meant by a judicial act was a court18    announcing that this rule of a year and a day was never19    part of Tennessee law, that our past opinions were20    erroneous.  At most they meant that, and maybe they meant21    simply affirming an ambiguous rule.22              I mean, I think you have to read Calder in the23    time frame in which it was pronounced.  You didn't have24    courts who suddenly just jumped up and said oh yes, that25    used to be the criminal law, but we are changing it.32 1              GENERAL MOORE:  I would still argue, Your Honor, 2    that the Tennessee Supreme Court's decision in this case 3    is in the tradition of the -- of a common law court.   The 4    common law does evolve, and the first principle of that 5    evolution is that where the reasons for a rule fail, the 6    rule should also fail, and so this -- 7              QUESTION:  It really didn't evolve very much at 8    the time of Calder v. Bull.  I mean, the courts -- or to 9    the extent it evolved it, it evolved the good10    old-fashioned way.   They lied about earlier cases.11              (Laughter.)12              QUESTION:  But they certainly didn't just stand13    up and say, you know, we're changing the law.  That was14 very rare.15              GENERAL MOORE:  Right, but of course it is our16    contention, Your Honor, that Calder v. Bull is really17    beside the point here, because this is a due process case,18    not an Ex Post Facto Clause case.19              QUESTION:  May I pursue that just for a second?20    Assume for the sake of argument here, and you will be21    willing to do this, I guess, that the year-and-a-day rule22    is not an element, and assume that the Ex Post Facto23    Clause has not been totally incorporated and applied to24    judicial acts.  One line of analogy that has been25    suggested here this morning, it's not a perfect analogy,331    but it goes part of the way at least, is an analogy with2    sort of a statute of limitations.3              What is the rule under due process if a statute4    of limitations is modified to a defendant's disadvantage5    after the limitation period has run?  Can a legislature do6 that?7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          GENERAL MOORE:  I believe, insofar as thisCourt's jurisprudence is concerned, that the questionremains open.  I would argue that --          QUESTION:  What's the general rule in the Statecourt, sitting with State due process clauses, or applyingthe Federal one for that matter?  Have they held it adenial of due process in effect to reopen the limitationperiod after it has run in a defendant's favor?          GENERAL MOORE:  I can only speak to myjurisdiction's case law, and I cannot cite to Your Honor acase that directly addresses that issue under our Stateconstitutional equivalent of the United States or theFourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.          QUESTION:  Is it acknowledged and accepted thata legislature could not alter an ex -- a statute oflimitations, after it has run for a defendant?          GENERAL MOORE:  I do not believe that is anaccepted proposition.  I believe that if a legislature didit, one would have to measure that law against each of the34 1    four Calder categories, and it's not really an easy fit 2    under any of those four categories.  A statute of 3    limitations does not render criminal actions innocent when 4    done.  It involves -- the statute of limitations doesn't 5    regulate primary conduct at all. 6              The statute of limitations also involves facts 7    which are sort of wholly collateral to guilt or innocence, 8    so I think it doesn't either aggravate the crime, it 9    doesn't -- quite clearly it doesn't increase the10    punishment, and because it involves issues that are wholly11    collateral to guilt or innocence, it's hard to argue that12    it's a sufficiency-of-the-evidence rule.  Rather, the13    remedy for a statute of limitations violation would be to14    dismiss the prosecution altogether, to dismiss the15    indictment altogether, not to enter a judgment of16    acquittal.17              So I think if I were here arguing that case, at18    least I would have an argument that would pass the smile19    test.20              QUESTION:  Yes, but even in a statute of21    limitations case, in a civil action, don't we place a22    fairly high value on the assurance that a defendant has23    that his period of jeopardy, his period of exposure to24    liability is over, and he can simply get on with whatever25    he wants to do, and I would suppose that that same value351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425applies with a greater intensity, or at least as great anintensity in the area of the criminal law, and I -- theanalysis so far doesn't seem to be giving any weight tothat interest, and I'd like to know why you think thatinterest is not sufficient to support the petitioner'sargument here.          GENERAL MOORE:  Because, Your Honor, theyear-and-a-day rule is not a rule of repose.  None of itspurposes at common law really were concerned with --          QUESTION:  Well, it functions -- it certainlyfunctions that way.          GENERAL MOORE:  Perhaps it functions that way,but its purposes at common law were wholly unrelated toconsiderations of repose, or concern with -- concerns withrepose, so I don't believe --          QUESTION:  They were essentially evidentiary.  Imean, you just couldn't prove the causation reliably afterthat period.          GENERAL MOORE:  Precisely, Your Honor, so Idon't believe that petitioner can really claim anyexpectation interest in repose that derives from the rule.          Now, the statute of limitations does protectsuch concerns but, of course, there is no statute oflimitations for murder in Tennessee --QUESTION:  I --361234567    Clause.8              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, that -- certainly that9    case law certainly would, I think, support our position10 here. 111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Why?  Suppose that if you have twostatutes in a state, the first forbids attempted murderand has lesser penalties, the second forbids murder, andhas greater penalties, and one day the State, the supremecourt decides to -- that anyone who's guilty of attemptedmurder is guilty of murder, because they say there's nodifference in the state of mind, et cetera.  They havesome reasons.          Now, could you apply that retroactively?  Iwouldn't have thought so.  I mean, it seems very unfair.          GENERAL MOORE:  I don't think so, but I --          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, I agree with you.But if that's so, how does this differ?  I mean, beforethey make the change people think, if I go after somebodyand he survives for a year and a day, it's like attempted37          GENERAL MOORE:  -- which reflects a judgment, Ibelieve, that -- by our legislature that murderers shouldnot have any repose.          QUESTION:  I think we've held, in connectionwith a civil case, that a legislature can change thestatute of limitations without violating the Due Process 1    murder.  After the change, it's like murder.  So if -- if, 2    as I agree with you completely, the first would be 3    fundamentally unfair, why isn't the second? 4              GENERAL MOORE:  Your Honor, I believe that first 5    of all the change here is a change in a rule that does not 6    address either primary conduct or -- and does not 7    eliminate the mens rea with respect to the result of8 that -- 9              QUESTION:  Nor did my example of attempted10    murder, murder.11              GENERAL MOORE:  And Your Honor's hypothetical is12    that -- that, if I understand it, that a court would13    decide that attempted murder equals murder.14              QUESTION:  You can imagine -- I mean, it's not15    totally absurd.  It depends on how they're written.  They16    have discretion as to sentencing, they say, these notions17    of punishing by effects are out of date, we should punish18    by state of mind, the state of mind is identical -- I19    mean, we can make that up.  It's not totally absurd.  It's20    just moderately absurd.21              (Laughter.)22              QUESTION:  But if it did happen -- if it did23    happen, which is the point of it, I think we'd say it was24    fundamentally unfair, and that's why I want to know what25    the difference is.  To me there is -- I can't find a381    difference.2              GENERAL MOORE:  Analytically it seems to me3    there is a large difference, since you have essentially in4    your hypothetical created or expanded the elements of the5    crime in a way that affected the primary conduct of the6 actor. 789          QUESTION:  Ah, we're back to the elements again.You ultimately were driven to the same response to myhypothetical, which was essentially the same as Justice10 Breyer's.11              QUESTION:  And it's awfully technical, you see.12              QUESTION:  Now, in the sense that from the point13    of view of fairness, really what's happened in my14    attempted murder, murder case is the difference as to15    something beyond the control of the defendant, whether the16    person happened to die, and that seems just what's at17    stake here, whether we call it an element, or whether we18    don't call it an element, and that's why it seems a19    relevant hypothetical.20              GENERAL MOORE:  I think the year-and-a-day rule,21    that it is not accurate to characterize the22    year-and-a-day rule as an element, for a couple of23    reasons.  First of all, the court below, and as a matter24    of Tennessee law, I think it is clear from its opinion25    indicated that it is not an element of homicide.  It said,391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9rather, that the effect of its elimination was merely togive the State an opportunity to prove causation, so --          QUESTION:  Is the ultimate characterization amatter for the State, or a matter for the Federal courts?          GENERAL MOORE:  I think --          QUESTION:  I mean, could a State call -- supposeyou have the State in Justice Breyer's hypotheticalsaying, well, the actual death of the victim was not anelement of the crime.  It was just -- you know, it wasn'treally an element of murder.          Now, we'd look at that and we'd say, well, yousay that, but come on, that's an element.  Isn't it aquestion for the Federal court, rather than the State,1011121314    ultimately?15              GENERAL MOORE:  I would disagree with that.  I16 think --17              QUESTION:  All right.  Well --18              GENERAL MOORE:  I think the State --19              QUESTION:  How do you distinguish the20    year-and-a-day rule from what we held to be an element a21    couple of terms ago?  I think it was a couple of terms22    ago.  That is, in a rape prosecution, the requirement that23    there be a hue and cry by the victim.  We held that was an24    element of the crime.  Like the year-and-a-day rule, it25    has nothing to do with the intent of the criminal.  It's401    after the event.  It's after the fact.  We held it was an2    element.  Why is that an element and this not an element?3              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, I would answer in two4    ways.  First of all, it is quite plainly not a statutory5    element, and it seems to me that is an issue of State law,6    and in fact the court here said, the lower court here said7    that it has never been a part of the statutory law of the8 State. 910111213141516171819202122232425          Secondly, it is not an element because it is notone of those issues that is submitted to the jury.  It'srather a jurisdictional fact.          QUESTION:  My recollection of the case JusticeScalia refers to, which I think is Carmel, is not the sameas his.  I think we were both in dissent in the case, butmy recollection is that the Court held that theparticular -- the hue and cry violated the Ex Post FactoClause.  I don't know that it said that that was anelement of the crime.          GENERAL MOORE:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, I thought -- I -- well, we'llgo and read it.  I thought we -- we said that because itwas an element.          GENERAL MOORE:  But in either case I don't thinkthe problem with Justice Breyer's hypothetical or JusticeScalia's hypothetical would be one of due process fair41 1    warning, which is the principle of due process -- 2              QUESTION:  Well, can I give you a hypothetical 3    that -- stick to the year-and-a-day rule, because that's 4    what we have before us.  Supposing just before 1989 5    there'd been a really terrible crime, he killed a child in 6    a bad situation, but the child didn't die for over a year 7    and a half, or over a year and a day, and the Tennessee -- 8    that prompted the Tennessee legislature to abolish that 9    rule, and they said in the rule, abolish it for the past10    case too, and they said well, they can't do that, and they11    say, if we can't do that because of the Ex Post Facto12    Clause we urge the supreme court to abolish it judicially,13    and remind them that they all run for reelection if they14    don't do it, so --15              (Laughter.)16              QUESTION:  And then, sure enough, the case comes17    up and they decide, well, it's a -- it was a common law18    rule but we're going to abolish it.  Now, why should there19    be a different rule when it's done by the court rather20    than by the legislature?  That's my real question in the21    case.2223242542          GENERAL MOORE:  Because of the institutionaldifferences between courts and legislatures.          QUESTION:  And what is the institutionaldifference when the court frankly says, we are making a 1    new rule of law?  What is the institutional difference? 2              GENERAL MOORE:  Because of the insulation of 3    that, of the institution of the courts from the same sorts 4    of political pressures that gave rise to the framers' 5    complete distrust of the ability of the legislative branch 6    to legislate in this particular area. 7              Courts not only are insulated from the same 8    sorts of political pressures, but they're subject to a 9    tradition of institutional --10              QUESTION:  But my hypothetical assumed that11    there was political pressure.12              GENERAL MOORE:  Excuse me, Your Honor?13              QUESTION:  My hypothetical assumed that there14    was political pressure because they have to run for15    reelection.  They can read the newspapers and see how16    outraged the public is about this particular crime.17              GENERAL MOORE:  Well, I think Your Honor's18    hypothetical posits there is political pressure, but the19    court, of course, by tradition doesn't succumb to20    political pressure.21              (Laughter.)22              GENERAL MOORE:  And in addition it operates23    under a set of institutional constraints in the way it24    goes about doing its business that it seems to me provides25    important protections here.43 1              The -- it can't initiate law reform efforts of 2    its own.  It must -- it can only act in the context of 3    cases that the litigants bring before the court.  In 4    addition, there is stare decisis, and the concomitant 5    imperative that courts justify departures from precedent 6    of the sort Your Honor's hypothetical posits, with 7    reasons, and with some neutral principles of general 8    applicability and some consideration of the impact of the 9    change they're about to make, not only on the litigants10    before them, but on all similarly situated litigants.11              I think all of those traditional restraints12    operate to justify different treatment for court decisions13    as opposed to decisions of legislatures, and certainly the14    history of the Ex Post Facto Clause indicates that the15    framers were acutely aware of those distinctions, and16    because of a well-documented history of parliamentary17    abuse involving legislation of this sort they thought it18    essential to insert a prophylactic prohibition against19    legislation of this sort without regard to -- they weren't20    going to look into the fairness of individual pieces of21    legislation and the circumstances under which they were22    passed.  They erected a prophylactic bar to legislation of23    that sort at all.24              QUESTION:  But isn't the answer to the25    institutional argument that you've been making the answer44 1    that Justice Scalia has raised a couple of times elsewhere 2    in the argument, that at the time the ex post facto rule 3    was written the way it was, common law courts, or our very 4    conception of courts, even in the Federal system, which 5    was in gestation at that time, involved a system of much 6    stricter precedent than we have today, so the likelihood 7    of a court doing what this court has done was simply much 8    less than it is today. 9              We have an entirely different concept of binding10    precedent today, and for that reason, shouldn't the Due11    Process Clause take that into consideration by being12    starchier in -- than perhaps the founders ever thought13    there would be a need to be when reviewing judicial14 change?15161718    scheme.19              As I indicated, the Ex Post Facto Clause is this20    sort of structural restraint on the power of that branch21    of Government, but Due Process, litigation under the Due22    Process Clause is by its very nature case by case, and the23    concern of the Due Process Clause is individualized fair24    treatment, so I would suggest that it would be25    inconsistent with the nature of the due process guarantee                                  45          GENERAL MOORE:  Your Honor, I think the DueProcess Clause and the Ex Post Facto Clause also are --serve very different functions under our constitutional1    to build into it some sort of prophylactic structural2    restraint on the judicial branch because of concerns that3    the judicial branch in modern times engages in too much4 law reform.5              It seems to me that due process, the Due Process6    Clause, with its concern about individualized fair7    treatment, is up to the task of protecting against8    aberrational cases in which a court is self-evidently9    engaged in some sort of arbitrary or vindictive action10    that -- of the sort that violates our notions of11    fundamental fairness and our notions about the rule of12    law.13141516171819202122232425          To close, our position is that the Due ProcessClause was not violated here, and that the Due ProcessClause is not violated by a court decision of this sortthat retroactively alters a rule of criminal law unlessthat change expands the scope of conduct covered by thecriminal prohibition issue and does so unforeseeably.          Secondarily, our position is that the Ex PostFacto Clause simply doesn't regulate judicial action atall, and that none of its technical restrictions should beimported wholesale into the Due Process Clause.Thank you very much.QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Moore.Mr. Ward, you have 4 minutes remaining.461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WARD:  Unless the Court has other questions,I have nothing else.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is -- thankyou, Mr. Ward.
