Bean. Mr. Kneedler.ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLERON BEHALF MR. KNEEDLER:may it please the Court: In each year'sOF THE PETITIONERSThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andannual Appropriations Act, Congress has prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,and Firearms from investigating or acting upon applications for discretionary relief from firearms disabilities under 18 U.S.C. 925(c.) The court of appeals held that, in the face of that statutory bar, a Federal district court could itself grant respondent relief from firearms disabilities. That holding is contrary to fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. Under the APA --QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler --MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.QUESTION: -- you call it a statutory bar. Ithought there was some difference in appropriations statutes from ordinary, ordinary laws. Are the two exactly the same? Could Congress create a substantive3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 obligation, for example, in an appropriations law, provide2 that, oh, I don't know, nobody shall sell stock on3 Tuesdays? Could they put that in an appropriations4 measure?5 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. An appropriations law is,6 for purposes of Congress's lawmaking authority, no7 different from any other sort of law.8 QUESTION: That's our holding in Roberts, isn't9 it?10 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Now, what the Court has11 said is that if a subsequent appropriations statute is12 said to repeal or suspend the application of a prior law,13 that intention has to be made clear, but here we think14 that there's no question that the annual Appropriations15 Act is clear. There's nothing implied about what Congress16 did here. There is an express prohibition against ATF17 either investigating or acting upon applications for18 relief.19 QUESTION: You call this a suspension of the20 law?21 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I mean, effectively. It's22 a suspension -- it's an annual -- a suspension for a￼23 period of 2425 I mean, I1 year.QUESTION: I suppose Congress -- well, maybe -- suppose Congress could say, this law that we4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 enacted a year ago is suspended for 10 years. It will not2 go into effect for 10 years. I suppose it could say that.3 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, absolutely. Congress could4 certainly do that.5 QUESTION: Well, that's the holding of6 Dickerson, is it not?7 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. So what we have here is an8 express prohibition against ATF exercising the power that9 Congress conferred on it. Under the Administrative10 Procedure Act, the only power a court has in judicial11 review of agency action is to review what the agency did,12 and it may only set aside the agency action if the agency13 action is 1415 the case,16 scheme, and it said that the firearms violator's license17 could be restored if he applied to United States district18 court, no agency at all, you just go to court. Would that19 be a violation of Article III?arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law. QUESTION: I don't know if it really bears on but suppose Congress had a completely different￼20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think there would be a21 question about that. As I recall, there was, and I think22 it still may be true that courts may grant applications23 for naturalization, but the court I believe concluded that24 there was at least an implicit adversarial process in the25 sense that the Government could appear on the other side5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 of the case and oppose it, but I think you raise a very2 good point in terms of what would be the traditional way3 that something like this would be accomplished, and that4 is that it would be natural, and this is what Congress did5 in 925(c), to confer this authority on the executive6 branch, and it did it in very broad and general terms and7 then provided that a person whose application is denied8 may file a petition in district court for judicial review9 of such denial.10 In other words, under 925(c) it is the denial by11 the ATF, not the application itself, that is the subject12 of judicial review.13 QUESTION: Is the refusal of the ATF to act on14 an application pursuant to this provision in the15 appropriation a de facto denial that's reviewable?16 MR. KNEEDLER: We think it is not. As we17 explained in our brief, we believe the word denial in that18 context means a denial on the merits, and this is what a19 number of the courts of appeals that have looked at the20 question have held, and what Congress said in the21 Appropriations Act is that ATF is barred from even acting22 upon the application. In other words, it can't either23 grant or deny the application for relief, and therefore24 the predicate for judicial review under 925(c) is missing.25 We're not saying that there is no judicial6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 review at all. The general provisions of the APA remain2 available and, under 5 U.S.C. 703, the avenue for judicial3 review, or the form of the judicial review is either the4 special statutory review procedure, in this case 925(c),5 or in the absence of that or its inadequacy, then another6 appropriate form, in other words, the general provisions7 of the APA.8 But once again, the power of a court under the9 general provisions of the APA is simply to review the10 agency's action and to set it aside if contrary to law,11 and here the action was not contrary to law, it was12 compelled by law. The most direct avenue that respondent13 could have challenged the agency's approach in this case,14 its failure to act, was under section 706(1), which15 provides for a court in reviewing agency action to set16 aside agency action that is -- or excuse me, to compel17 agency action that is unreasonably delayed or unlawfully18 withheld; and, again, there was nothing unlawful about19 ATF's withholding of a decision on respondent's20 application for relief, because Congress compelled that21 withholding.22 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, there was an alternate23 argument that a foreign conviction shouldn't count for24 this purpose. Has the United States ever taken a position25 on that?7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, we have. It is the2 position of the United States that foreign convictions are3 covered by the act. Now, that is not before the Court.4 The -- in fact, below respondent conceded that a foreign5 conviction is a proper predicate under 922(g)(1), and the6 Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to reach that7 question. It wasn't presented in the petition and it's8 not before this Court.9 Indeed, the question of whether a foreign10 conviction would be a proper predicate is something that11 would be raised under 922(g) in a prosecution. As we12 point out in our brief, there is a circuit conflict on13 that question, but that conflict has arisen in cases,14 criminal prosecutions brought under 922(g), and that would15 be the proper place to begin to make that claim.16 Neither the general provisions of the APA nor17 925(c) provides someone who is wondering whether he may or18 may not be covered by a provision of the Federal criminal19 laws to bring a declaratory judgment against the United20 States to determine whether conduct he hopes to engage in21 would be covered by a particular criminal statute. So22 even though it -- it isn't before this Court, but we also23 believe that this would not be the proper avenue in which24 to raise such a claim in any event.25 Respondent has argued that what is going on here8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 is an implied repeal of the judicial review provisions or2 the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to act in a case3 such as this and, as I've said, there's nothing implied.4 What Congress did was expressly bar ATF, and it otherwise5 left the court's authority unaffected. 925(c) remains in6 effect. It's just that, by virtue of Congress's7 prohibiting ATF from acting on applications for relief,8 there is no denial which could be the predicate for review9 under that, under that special statutory review procedure.10 QUESTION: Well, do you think that that's 10011 percent clear? I mean, in Robertson, the amendment of a12 prior statute was affected not by the simple means of13 withholding appropriations. I mean, it set forth14 different language that was going to govern the matter.15 Here, the only thing that has happened is16 they're not given any appropriations, and you think it is17 not a matter -- you think it's entirely clear that when18 the Secretary receives an application and says, I cannot19 act on this application because the appropriations rider20 forbids me, do you think it's entirely clear that that21 does not amount to a denial of the application?22 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's the better reading23 of the statute.24 QUESTION: Well, it may be the better one, but25 is it clear? I mean, the law is that unless you make it9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 quite clear in the appropriations statute that you are2 intending to amend the prior law, the prior law is not3 amended.4 MR. KNEEDLER: Again, the -- our position is not5 that Congress amended the judicial review provision of6 925(c). What it did was prohibit ATF from acting.7 925(c)'s judicial review procedure is still in effect.8 The question is whether the -- whether Congress's9 directive to ATF not to even act upon applications for10 relief constitutes a denial and, as I say, ATF is barred11 from either granting or denying relief, and I would refer12 the Court also to the general definition of agency action13 under the APA, which we cite in our brief. This is 514 U.S.C. 551(13). It defines agency action as an agency15 rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent,16 or the denial thereof, or a failure to act.17 So under the APA, which is the general statute18 governing traditional review of agency action, Congress19 itself has defined a denial of relief as something20 different from a failure to act, and I think there's every21 reason to look at 925(c)'s reference to a denial as being22 consistent, rather than inconsistent with the general23 definitions that Congress has applied under the APA.24 I would also add, though, that it doesn't25 matter, that even if the ATF's decision were viewed as a10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 denial within the meaning of 925(c), the general APA2 standards for reviewing that denial still apply. As we3 point out in our brief, this Court's decision in Zurko and4 the prior decision in the Brotherhood of Locomotive5 Engineers both make clear that, even where you do have a6 special statutory review procedure that establishes the7 form for judicial review, the nature and character, as the8 Court said in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of that9 judicial review is defined by the general provisions of10 the APA, section 706; and again, under those provisions11 the court can only set aside agency action that is12 contrary to law; and again, here, the ATF's action was13 compelled 1415 have been16 district court to grant relief at all, and we also think17 that that is entirely consistent with the Congress'sby law, not contrary to it.So whichever avenue this suit was thought to brought under, there was no basis for the￼18 purposes in enacting the appropriations bar.19 The legislative history which respondent has20 produced as an appendix to his brief explains that21 Congress had become concerned about the inherently22 subjective nature of the inquiry that ATF was undertaking,23 and the severe consequences that could result if ATF had24 made a mistake, and also that Congress believed that the25 money that was being spent for that purpose, $4 million a11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 year for 40 positions at ATF, would be better served --2 QUESTION: Why didn't it just repeal the thing,3 then, because it didn't have the votes?4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, what it decided to do is to5 proceed on an annual basis. It would -- which means it6 could be subject to revision each year. It was a7 practical compromise. The Third Circuit explained in8 Pontarelli that the same people who were supporting a9 permanent repeal in 1992 were also the movants for the10 annual appropriations rider on the theory that it11 accomplished essentially the same thing on an annual12 basis.13 QUESTION: This was in the appropriations law14 just for the ATF, or for the whole Treasury Department?15 MR. KNEEDLER: It's in the provision for ATF.16 QUESTION: Suppose that the Secretary had some17 other agency -- the Secret Service didn't have much to do18 that month; could he direct them to process some of these19 applications?20 MR. KNEEDLER: I think not, for there is another21 sentence in the appropriations provision for ATF which22 says that no money may be spent to transfer functions from23 ATF to another department or agency, and I think the24 reference to agency in that provision would probably25 include other provisions -- or excuse me, other agencies12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 within the Department of the Treasury, and the Secretary2 of the Treasury personally couldn't be expected to act on3 applications like this. The Secretary, as this Court4 pointed out in the Dunne decision, has --5 QUESTION: Well, would he abuse his discretion6 if he took that function away from ATF? You say that7 there's a8 Secretary9provision in the statute that he -- that the himself cannot transfer the function?MR. KNEEDLER: It says, no funds shall be10 spent -- I believe it says, under this act, to transfer11 functions 1213 would the14 transferring a function?15 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the clear import of what16 Congress directed is, the function shall not beto another agency within ATF.QUESTION: Well, how much money does the -- Secretary spend if he signed an order￼17 transferred. That was clearly what Congress was driving18 at.19 QUESTION: It wouldn't be a transfer to another20 agency if the Secretary did it himself.21 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, but the Secretary -- first22 of all, as Congress well knew when it passed this23 appropriations rider, the Secretary has delegated the24 authority for acting on these applications to ATF. That25 is the legal framework against which --13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: What he gave he could withdraw. QUESTION: He could revoke.MR. KNEEDLER: Perhaps he -- I mean, hepresumably could, but the proper avenue for a respondent to pursue in that situation would be to request ATF -- or excuse me, the Secretary to revoke the regulation that produced the delegation, and then if the Secretary declined to do that, to seek review of that under the APA on an arbitrary and capricious standard.Respondent has not pursued that avenue, and we think it would manifestly not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to withdraw that delegation and take on that function himself with all the other functions that are before the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the Nation's economy and banking and all those other matters, and in particular it would not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to decline to do that in the face of the appropriations bar that Congress has enacted, with the -- again, with the clear understanding that it didn't want these applications to be acted on administratively, but in any event --QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler --MR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry.QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, if we shift the focusfrom the agency to the court, is it your essential14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 argument that Congress provided for an appellate,2 essentially an appellate role for the district court and3 not a first instance role?4 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that --5 QUESTION: So that the only authority the court6 would have would be to review a decision made by an7 executive official, but there is a provision in this law8 for the district court to take additional evidence.9 Usually when a court is performing a review function it10 doesn't take any evidence.11 MR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me. That's correct, but12 it would -- but even the admission or acceptance of13 additional evidence would be in aid of the APA review,14 which is, again, of the agency's decision. A court15 receiving evidence is not unheard of under the APA, even16 under the arbitrary and capricious standard. As this17 Court pointed out in Overton Park, occasionally there will18 be situations in which additional evidence or an19 explanation from the agency could be received in judicial20 review, but that's only supplemental of the record that21 was before the agency.22 QUESTION: Well, but the agency doesn't always23 have to make a record. I mean, suppose the agency just,24 you know, just makes a decision. Why can't this Court25 treat it as a matter of review? That is, the issue before15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Court will be whether the action here, assuming it's a2 denial, was unreasonable?3 MR. KNEEDLER: The question before the Court4 would be whether it was arbitrary and capricious or5 unlawful, and again, it wasn't unlawful because Congress6 compelled it. Congress compelled the Secretary or ATF not7 to act on the application. Now, whether or not that's8 called a denial, the bottom line, the failure to afford9 any relief, was compelled by Congress, so the agency could10 not set -- or, excuse me, the court could not set that11 aside.12 Looked at another way, the only relevant13 evidence that would be introduced in court would be14 evidence of the fact that respondent had applied during a15 time when the statutory bar on ATF's action was pending.16 That is the only relevant evidence that --17 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a18 question? Supposing the Secretary or the head of the ATF,19 either or both -- say they spent the weekend together20 sometimes. They read through the papers on their own time21 on a Sunday afternoon and said, gee, this is a case of￼22 rank injustice, I think we're going to23 and they entered some kind of an order24 that have violated any statutes?25 MR. KNEEDLER: It would. It16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005grant the petition, granting it, wouldwould violate this1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425statute. The order, whatever they might have read on their own time the order would be taken in their official capacity, and the -- and --QUESTION: But suppose they drafted it on Saturday and signed it on Saturday?MR. KNEEDLER: It would still be a -- the second --QUESTION: It would be in their official capacities but it wouldn't have cost the Government a dime.QUESTION: Doesn't -- the statute doesn't say, official capacity. It says, expend funds.MR. KNEEDLER: It says expend funds, but it means to act -- but it says, to -- it is directed to the actions of the ATF in its official capacity. Only an official act of ATF could relieve someone from firearms disabilities.QUESTION: I suppose the argument is that the -- certainly the Secretary, and perhaps all Federal officials, don't get paid by the hour, they get paid for all the official actions that they take during the year, so that even if they take it on a Saturday they're being compensated for it.MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct, and -- QUESTION: Minimally, but compensated.17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

KNEEDLER: They are paid for the office, not for the work that they are performing, nor could the Secretary direct ATF to grant it, because again he would be directing an unlawful act.If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Congress, in section 925(c), provided individuals like Respondent Tommy Bean two rights vis a vis the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America. Individuals may apply to, quote, unquote, "the Secretary" for relief from firearms disabilities and, if the Secretary denies that application, they may secure judicial review. The obvious flaw in the Government's position this morning, as several of the later questions identified, is that Congress has never, expressly or impliedly repealed those rights vis a vis the Secretary. The appropriations statutes that are before you address only the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Congress has set aside a separate and special budget for2 the Department of the Treasury generally, which is under3 the control of the Secretary, it's for $123 million, and4 the right to proceed before the Secretary is unaffected.5 QUESTION: Well, now, did your client seek to6 proceed before the Secretary?7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Page 27 of the joint8 appendix is the application. It's directed to the9 Secretary of the Treasury, care of BATF. We went, as the10 statute directs, to the Secretary of the Treasury. The11 Secretary of the Treasury told Tommy Bean that he was not12 going to restore firearms rights.13 QUESTION: Well, this was not a personal14 conversation between the two, I take it.15 (Laughter.)16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't have his number.17 That's right. We wrote him a letter, as the statute18 requires.1920 said, I'm 212223 Administrative Procedure Act would be to sue in district24 court for agency action unreasonably withheld.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: With respect, the premise and19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: Well, he didn't say, denied. He not going to act upon it.MR. GOLDSTEIN: And that --QUESTION: Whereupon, your remedy under the1 the conclusion are not -- of your question are not2 correct. The ATF on behalf of the Secretary said, I'm not3 going to grant you this relief. The definition of4 denial -- the statute does not say, denial on the merits.5 The definition of denial is a refusal to grant the6 requested relief. That's --7 QUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, may I back you up just8 a bit, because I'm looking at the letter you cited. It is9 addressed to the Secretary, but it's care of Director of10 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Congress11 passes all kinds of laws giving the Secretary authority to12 do this or that, which the Secretary invariably delegates,13 and I can't think of an instance where a regime of this14 order is taken over by the Secretary herself, rather than15 by some delegatee, but this is the kind of thing that's16 made to order for, not the top person, but for it to be17 delegated.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I address both the question19 of whether there are other examples of the scheme we've20 described, which is to say, the agency head does it, and21 then the question of whether or not, if this were a novel22 scheme, it would matter?23 The premise that there aren't parallels for this24 is not correct. I can give you three examples. The25 Attorney General is required to personally certify any20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 person who's going to be subject to the Federal death2 penalty. That's 42 U.S.C. -- 18 U.S.C. 3593. Under the3 Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, which is4 42 U.S.C. 1997(a), the Attorney General is required to5 personally certify a prosecution, and there are various6 Federal criminal prosecutions for civil rights violations,7 which are 89 that it'sat 18 U.S.C. 245.QUESTION: How does the statute make it clear a personal obligation or a nondelegable10 obligation? What are the words that it uses, or that11 those statutes use?12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's the two in combination.13 925(c) says the Secretary. 921(a)(17) defines the14 Secretary to mean that individual or the delegate. Then,15 what Congress did is, it came along in the appropriations16 action, act and said, we recognize -- well, I'll give --17 the literal language is that the ATF may not investigate18 or act upon --19 QUESTION: No, no, I'm sorry, my question wasn't20 clear. I want to go to the examples that you were giving21 of personal obligation.22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize.23 QUESTION: And you used the adverb,24 personally --25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: -- certify, et cetera. How do they provide for that so-called personal action?MR. GOLDSTEIN: They generally say, the Attorney General shall certify, and the courts have interpreted that -- I believe there is an example that says, personally.QUESTION: Which we don't have here.MR. GOLDSTEIN: We definitely do not have here, but we have the equivalent, and then I'll get to Justice, the underlying question of Justice Ginsburg's, and that is, does it matter if this is done in a different way.We have here the parallel, because what happened is that Congress defined the Secretary to be that individual or the delegate, and in the appropriations laws has told ATF, as the delegate, that they may not act on anything else, and the parallel provision that Mr. Kneedler pointed to, which is that the Secretary may not transfer to any other division or agency.What Congress did not say -- and this is extraordinarily important. It's the key to the entire case. Congress did not say that no funds in this or any other act, or no funds in the subsection dealing with the budget of the Secretary of the Treasury, may be used. Now, it is that --QUESTION: Well, maybe it didn't say that22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because it thought it was perfectly clear that if it didn't want public money used under -- by the delegate, it presumably wouldn't want public funds used for the same purpose by everybody else, which seems like a fairly reasonable assumption.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Maybe --QUESTION: I mean, why isn't it a reasonable assumption?MR. GOLDSTEIN: It may be, but what --QUESTION: Well, if it is a reasonable assumption, haven't we got to take that into consideration in interpreting the annual bar, and hold against you, otherwise we'll be clearly -- we would clearly be going against the intent of Congress?MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, and that's the underlying point to Justice Ginsburg's questions. This Court --QUESTION: My first question started out, it seems that you in the beginning of this process understood that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was the relevant actor, because you addressed the Secretary care of that agency, not the Secretary --MR. GOLDSTEIN: And let me explain why. The 27 C.F.R. 178144(a), which has never been repealed, required us to send it to ATF. We had no choice. There's a regulation on the books that says we have to submit it to23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Director. We didn't have a choice, but to make2 perfectly clear that it was directed to the Secretary we3 say, we send it to the Secretary care of ATF.4 But I need to return to Justice Souter's5 question, which is, is it good enough in this case, as in6 many other instances of statutory construction, to say, we7 get the general sense of what Congress was trying to do?8 The answer is no. In this area of law uniquely, Congress9 has to turn square corners. The relevant text of any10 statute is section 925(c). It's never been repealed. It11 says --12 QUESTION: What you're saying is that Congress13 was just wasting its time here. It was trying to do14 something. It just didn't accomplish it.15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Mr. Chief Justice, and let16 me get to that point, and that is, I agree with you that17 it would be foolish to say that the appropriations acts18 are completely ineffective, and if our interpretation were19 to deprive them of any value, we agree it would be highly20 questionable. It is not.￼The scheme that results is clearly one under Secretary will grant only those applications right to relief is perfectly clear. Where, as2122 which the23 where the24 in this case, it is --25 QUESTION: How do you know that? You say the24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 scheme that results, I don't see how you can see that from2 the enactment in question.3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because, Mr. Chief Justice, what4 Congress did is, it created a system under which the5 subdivisions underneath the Secretary may not investigate6 or act. It's left to the Secretary, and now it is --7 QUESTION: But the -- that just doesn't fit with8 the real world. The idea that the Secretary on his way to9 the International Monetary Fund meeting is going to10 address an application like this just doesn't make sense.11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, with respect,12 we -- well, first of all, the text of the statute we think13 is enough on its face, but on the question of whether or14 not it makes sense, we think it does, because -- and I15 will point you to several other examples in Federal16 firearms law where Congress has adopted categorical rules17 allowing felons to have their rights restored.18 We believe this is a safety valve. We're not19 saying that the Secretary has to grant any particular20 application. What we're saying is that Congress21 recognized that there would be extraordinary cases. What22 Congress was faced with was that ATF had spent $20 million23 granting 3,000 applications, and that's what the24 legislative history shows that Congress was trying to cut25 off. What we are describing is a very different animal.25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 It is an animal that's in the text of the statute, and2 that is, the Secretary is still empowered to grant relief.3 Now, Justice Ginsburg, one of the premises of4 your question was that there's a delegation here. The5 delegation here is not exclusive. The delegation here6 provides that -- and this was in 19 -- when the BATF was7 created, the Secretary provided that the Director shall8 act under the general supervision of the Secretary and9 under -- excuse me, and under the supervision of the10 Assistant Secretary.11 The parallel that's drawn by the Solicitor12 General is to United States v. Nixon and to the Accardi13 case, and those were exclusive delegations. In United14 States v. Nixon this Court said -- and this is at page 69515 of the opinion -- that the special prosecutor had plenary16 authority, and the regulation provided that the Attorney17 General shall not interfere with the special prosecutor's18 decision, and in Accardi, and this is at page 266, the19 Court said that -- the scheme in Accardi was that the20 Attorney General would act only after the Bureau of21 Immigration Affairs, and that clearly contemplated that22 the AG would stay out of the process.23 In any event, not only is this not an exclusive24 delegation, but our fundamental point is that it's an25 illegal delegation.26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, I would -- you are2 concentrating on the agency end of it. Looking at it from3 the perspective of a court, you seem to be making of the4 district court an entity that doesn't exist in the U.S.5 system. You're having the district court in effect being6 an examining magistrate. There is no adverse party.7 You're having the district court determine whether there's8 sufficient evidence to warrant restoring the license.9 We don't have district judges performing that10 kind of mixed function, proceeding in that ex parte way.11 It would be extraordinary for Congress to make such a12 provision, and yet you want us to infer it.13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Ginsburg. Here's14 how it works. The statute contemplates when there's a15 denial, and we will take up, probably, the question16 further of whether or not there's a denial here, but to17 focus only on the judicial review aspect, when there's a18 denial, you file a petition with the Federal district19 court.20 What happens in all the cases would be what21 happened here, and that is that the district judge orders22 the United States and the Secretary made the party23 defendant. They come into the case, and they have the24 opportunity to put on evidence, to examine the25 witnesses -- that happened here --27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But the United States came in and said, we are disabled. Congress doesn't want us to play a part in that. It seems to me then the -- you fight that out, and if the agency isn't disabled, the district court orders the agency to act. But that's not what you asked for. You asked the district court to restore this person's license, and that's the relief you got.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, you are correct what we asked for. You are, with respect, not correct about what the Government said in this case. The Government did not come in and say, our hands are tied. The Government did press its argument that there wasn't jurisdiction, but it absolutely did participate on the factual side of the case. I can give you examples.J.A. 51 is the examination of Tommy Bean, and then the cross-examination by the Assistant United States Attorney. J.A. 55 is the opportunity given to the United States to cross-examine the chief of police. We --QUESTION: Did the United States take the position that this license shouldn't be restored?MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. Precisely the opposite. J.A. 37 is the United --QUESTION: I don't understand how there was an adversary proceeding, then.MR. GOLDSTEIN: What happened is, they came28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 in -- I'm -- I've confused you with the timing. On2 January 20, 199 -- on 2000, there was a hearing held3 before the Federal district judge, Judge Fisher. The4 United States participated.5 It did not say, we are prohibited from6 participating. They had been given the opportunity to7 take witnesses, and let me detour very briefly, and that8 is to say that while the appropriations statutes prohibit9 ATF from acting on applications, we are now talking about,10 as you've pointed us to, the petition, and there is11 nothing -- and that's the distinction drawn in section12 925(c). ATF is not disabled from participating in the13 district court.14 To return. There was this hearing on January15 20. The United States was given the opportunity to16 evidence and cross-examine witnesses, as I was just17 describing. Immediately afterwards, the Respondent18 submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions19 after that adversary proceeding. At J.A. --put onBean of law￼20 QUESTION: In what sense it was adversary?21 Usually, if the bureau hadn't been disabled by Congress it22 would say, deny an application, and then there would be a23 determination on the merits, but here, apparently there24 was no position taken on the merits.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm almost there. There was.29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 J.A. 37 is the United States' response to our proposed2 findings of fact, and they conclude at J.A. 37 that our3 proposed findings of fact are supported by the evidence.4 Finding of fact 27 is that petitioner -- that -- he -- we5 were the petitioner there. Petitioner, based on the6 circumstances of his disability and based on his record7 and reputation, would not represent a threat to the public8 safety, and finding of fact 28 that they conceded was that9 granting petitioner the relief he requested would not be10 contrary to the public interest. What happened here is11 that the evidence was so overwhelming. We had six chiefs12 of--13 QUESTION: Well, why -- if the United States was14 a party, as I suppose is the purport of what you're15 saying, why isn't that a violation of the appropriations16 rider, so that we must disregard it?17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because, Justice Kennedy,18 nothing in the appropriations rider prohibits either of19 the two following things: First, the United States20 Attorney showing up and representing the United States,21 relatedly the Secretary of the Treasury showing up; or the22 ATF participating at the petition stage, as opposed to the23 application stage.24 I think it's very important to recognize here25 that this case has proceeded up until today on the30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 understanding of the parties that the evidence about Mr.2 Bean's entitlement to relief was overwhelming. Six chiefs3 of police, a priest, a local --4 QUESTION: I don't know that that's an argument.5 I mean, I concede that. I'm still left back at Justice6 Scalia's question, because I thought in response to his7 question you -- I had the impression you were suggesting8 that the Secretary had somewhere written a piece of paper9 that in effect denied10 through this appendix11 listening12 13 141516 something17 ATF, and what that says is, because of the restriction we18 are returning Mr. Bean's application for restoration.19 That's the end of that. He can apply again.the application, and I looked -- I've been doing that and time --at the same(Laughter.)QUESTION: -- and I cannot find that letter. MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.QUESTION: All I find in the appendix is written by Ms. Pamela Potaczek, who is from the￼202122232425 of paper,Now, is there some other piece of paper?MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.QUESTION: No.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Our position is --QUESTION: Well then, if there is no other piece what is the response to Justice Scalia's31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 question, which was simply that there has been no denial?2 They return the application, and if your client felt that3 they should have acted on it, he should file a request in4 the district court for -- of course, as soon as you do5 that, the Secretary will come in and say, of course I6 didn't act on it. That's what Congress meant. And then7 the question will be whether that's a reasonable8 interpretation of this statute, and then, of course, the9 Government thinks of course it's a reasonable10 interpretation, and even if it's an incorrect11 interpretation, at least reasonable.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.13 QUESTION: Now, that's where I am, which is, I14 think, what Justice Scalia was raising.15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, you have several16 questions. Let me deal with them in the following terms:17 was there a denial here, second, does it matter whether18 there was a denial here, and third, is it sufficient that19 the Government's position and interpretation is20 reasonable, as opposed to compelled by the statutory21 language?22 The plain meaning of the word denial is a23 refusal to grant the relief requested. Our position is24 that when ATF turns around and sends us a letter saying,25 we're not going to act, that is -- it's not a failure to32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 act, it's a refusal to act. That is a denial, and I can2 point to their own regulation that means it must be so.3 Under subsection (i)(1)(3) of the governing4 regulation, which unfortunately is not reproduced in any5 of the documents -- we do cite it, I apologize, but it is6 not quoted in any of the appendices. Under that7 provision, ATF said that any person who is a firearms8 licensee -- let me briefly draw the distinction here, and9 that is, there are people who are allowed to have firearms10 under State law, but there are federally licensed dealers,11 importers, collectors.12 In the latter class, any person who submits an13 application to ATF is allowed to continue operating for 3014 days, until 30 days after the denial. If the Government15 is -- and that's a quote, of the denial of the16 application.17 If the Government is correct here, it18 the profoundly -- have the profoundly illogical19 consequence that no licensed collector has ever20 denied, and they all have the right to continue21 QUESTION: Well, that's true if we assume your22 first premise, that a failure to act is a denial, and23 that's the question.24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, no, just the reverse,25 Justice Souter. Let me be clear. The regulation says33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼would makebeen operating.1 that you get to keep operating under your license until 302 days after the denial. What I'm saying is, if you accept3 Mr. Kneedler's premise that all these letters that ATF has4 been sending out are not denials --5 QUESTION: No, but the -- that provision assumes6 that there is going to be action upon the request, that7 the ATF or the Treasury will take it under advisement and8 in effect say, yes, we'll tell you yes or no when we've9 had time, and that's not what is happening here, and if10 that, in fact, is a fair distinction, then the statute11 you're just referring to doesn't even apply.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, if the13 Government is correct -- and I won't belabor this point.14 If the Government is correct that the ATF letters don't15 count as denials, then every licensed dealer in the United16 States can continue operating indefinitely.17 QUESTION: Well, once again, we're just going18 around in a circle. If we accept your premise, sure. If19 we don't accept your premise that a refusal to act and, in20 fact, a very candid refusal to act is tantamount to a21 denial, then your conclusion doesn't follow and the22 statute that you refer to doesn't apply.23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'll move on, then. I24 respectfully disagree, but I -- and I think the language25 will track in our direction, but let me move on, because34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Justice Breyer had two subsidiary questions. QUESTION: In respect to that, is there an instance where they sent a letter back to a firearmslicensee saying, well, we aren't going to process this because of the statute, and then the firearms licensee said, well, you haven't denied it, I'll stay in business, and then they went to the firearms licensee and said, no, you can't stay in business?MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know the answer to that question.QUESTION: All right. Well, if we don't know the answer to that, we don't know, in other words, whether or not this reg does or does not stand in the way.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, my impression -- QUESTION: So I understand --MR. GOLDSTEIN: My impression is that it's aform letter that goes out to everyone.QUESTION: Uh-huh.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Now, you -- I had promised to come back to the question of whether, in this case, it matters that we didn't get what this Court would conclude to be a technical denial letter, notwithstanding if you accept the rest of our argument that we have the right to compel the Secretary to give us one, So to play this out, our position is that the Secretary had the duty to act.35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The question back to us is, well, maybe the Secretary2 didn't act here.3 My point is, that doesn't matter. The question4 presented by -- before this Court, if I could take you to5 it, is that -- is fundamentally, and this is the text of6 it, whether a Federal district court has the authority to7 grant relief. The Government has never contended, again,8 in the district court that there was an insufficient9 premise for us to be in district court.10 The question before this Court is whether or not11 the right -- excuse me, the provision for judicial review12 in section 925(c) has been repealed, and that takes us13 back to your third question, Justice Breyer, or third14 subsidiary one, and that is, is it enough -- and this is15 Justice Souter's point. Isn't it enough for us to16 recognize basically what Congress was after here, and I17 will turn to the answer. It is no.18 TVA v. Hill, Will, Robertson, many other,19 Dickerson, of this Court's precedents make perfectly20 clear, and this was the question that Justice Scalia21 started out with, that an appropriations repeal has to be22 categorical. The conflict between the two statutes,23 section 925(c) and the appropriations law, have to be24 irreconcilable, and that is not the case here.25 QUESTION: I don't know that that was the36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 holding of Dickerson. I mean, they went into legislative2 history -- you couldn't just say it jumped out at you.3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, then I4 will take you to TVA v. Hill, which does address this5 issue. The Court has made perfectly clear that the kind6 of legislative history here is the kind of legislative7 history that would draw Justice Souter and possibly8 Justice Breyer to the conclusion that we know basically9 what Congress was trying to do. Those are Appropriations10 Committee reports, and this Court could not have been more11 clear that those are not an accurate indicia of12 congressional intent. There are --13 QUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, before we get into14 legislative history and how it bears on this, I see15 Congress having established traditional roles where the16 executive was going to be the investigator, the court was17 going to be the reviewer. The agency says, we have no18 authority to act. When a court says, we don't have19 authority to act, it's not granting or denying the relief20 requested, so isn't that the proper way to look at what21 the agency is doing? When it says, we have no authority22 to act, it isn't granting or denying.23 And then on the court, the court said, Congress24 set us up to be a court of review, not first view. The25 agency hasn't looked at it because it says it has no37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425authority to do it. Congress did not give us the authority, ever, to take a first view of this.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, let me -- can I start at the end of what I think is the consequence of several of these questions, and then come back to the difference between administrative review and judicial review, and whether this would just be unknown to American law?The very best we think that the Government can get out of this argument is a judgment of this Court that says we were entitled to a remand to the Secretary. When we came to Federal district court and asked for relief, the best the Government could do was an order that says, no, you should have acted.What can't be the case, we believe, is that the Secretary would be able to just let these things pile up on his desk and say, I've never denied them, tough.Now, the -- what we take --QUESTION: He didn't deny them. He said the agency has no authority to rule on these applications.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right, and if we conclude that's not a denial, we can't get into court.The Government's answer, I think, if we move down the road, will be that we should file another lawsuit, an APA lawsuit that says, to compel agency action38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 unreasonably withheld, and if you take that position, if2 you conclude that this is agency inaction instead of an3 agency refusal to act, the surreply to that, the answer is4 that you should treat this as an APA action. The5 provision that Mr. Kneedler is quoting to you, 5 U.S.C.6 703, says that the form of an action under the APA shall7 be the special review provision provided by statute, and8 that's section 925(c).9 If we were required to file under the APA we10 did. That's --11 QUESTION: The serious underlying question here12 is, I agree with you that you found a literal way around13 this, and so you're saying, well, if there's a literal way14 around it, and you have a statute saying do it, that you15 ought to do it, whatever the form of the action is to get16 the case here, and I guess the underlying thing is, well,17 my goodness, everyone knows what Congress wants here.18 It's perfectly obvious.19 And so a Secretary who said, I'm not going to20 enforce this statute because Congress doesn't want me to21 even though there's a literal way I could do it without22 technically violating the actual language of the23 prohibition, does the Secretary have the right to do that?24 Well, I would think the answer to that question's yes.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer --39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Because otherwise Congress can'twork.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the answer to the question is no, and let me explain why.(Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Kneedler -- thankfully. Mr. Kneedler framed the question as whether ornot the Secretary abused his discretion by not withdrawing the delegation, by saying, I knew what Congress was up to, this is my agency, I know how this thing works.The answer is that this is not a question of abuse of discretion. It is a question of a clear statutory command. Section 925(c) says, we can apply to the Secretary, and clearly contemplates that the Secretary will act on these things. It's not an option.QUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, let me just be sure thing. Is your submission limited to cases that are totally clear on their face, or does it￼about oneyou thinkcover cases when there are marginal issues of fact?MR. GOLDSTEIN: The right to apply to the Secretary would remain. We think it's clear that the Secretary, once his obligation to act is recognized, will set up standards. He'll say things like, I'm only going to grant relief if it's an -- the legislative history refers to a technical or unintentional violation where40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 there are2 perfectly34 will get to decide, and if he's granting too many5 applications, Congress will come along and say, no funding6 under this or any other act shall be expended tosworn statements in front of me that makeclear this person is no threat whatsoever.That will be up to the Secretary. The Secretary7 investigate or act on appropriation, on 925(c)8 applications.9 The critical thing, and the -- is that the10 Government does not dispute that this appropriations rider11 ever since 1993 is in the subdivision that applies only to12 ATF. If you want to talk about Congress working, they13 need clear instructions. We can't have the executive14 branch out here saying, I don't really like this statute,15 and so I'm going to infer that it's been repealed, and we16 can't have the courts doing that, too. It will take no17 effort whatsoever, if this is what Congress really18 intends, to strip away the statute and to do it in19 appropriations law.￼QUESTION:I'm stillthe courthave the Secretary make the decision.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. We have a, now, I think,So I'm still left with -- assuming left with the problem that you've to make the decision rather than2021 all that,22 asked for23 asking to2425 a different question of administrative law, and that is41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 the fundamental principle, in the APA context or a2 parallel like 925(c), is it only the court that can enter3 the order saying, you have a right to relief? Or does --4 where's the proper order, send it to the Secretary and5 saying, it would be an abuse of discretion, it's6 absolutely clear under the statute you're entitled to it.7 Now, the court here did the latter. If this8 Court decided that was technically incorrect, it could9 reverse on that ground and say, no, no, no, the correct10 technical judgment is to put it back in the hands of the11 Secretary.12 QUESTION: But you didn't ask for it to be put13 back in the hands of the Secretary.14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And neither did the Government.15 QUESTION: You're saying that the court had an16 obligation to give you something you didn't even ask for?17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Justice Scalia, they gave us18 what we asked for. I apologize for that. If --￼QUESTION: That was the wrong thing.MR. GOLDSTEIN: If they should have -- (Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN: If they should have doneelse, then this Court can tell it so, but we --19 20 21 2223 something24 I don't think it's fair to hold us to the position that25 the Government did not object, that only the Secretary --42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 in this case, when you go through the district court2 record, that the only proper remedy is an order to the3 Secretary to grant us relief, as opposed to granting us4 relief personally. Remember, as I quoted to you from the5 findings of fact, the Government left the playing field6 here. It admitted that with all of the evidence we had,7 no one could reasonably dispute that Tommy Bean was8 perfectly entitled and represented no threat. The only9 question -- they participated on the fact side of the10 case. Their only argument that they attempted to advance11 was that the district court was powerless to do anything12 at all.13 With respect, we did what we were supposed to do14 to get relief here, and if the Court decides that it only15 should have gone to the Secretary, that's a minor change16 in the judgment.17 QUESTION: I still think participation by ATF in18 the judicial proceeding is within 925(c), and Congress was19 forbidden that, too.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, let me be clear21 on what money was spent, because there were technical22 questions about this. The United States Attorney's Office23 participated here, not --24 QUESTION: There was an ATF agent who testified,25 and that's within 925 -- the purview of 925(c), and43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Congress says you can't do that.2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: With respect, there was one3 agent who was one witness. The appropriations statute4 says you may not investigate, which was not what he was5 doing, and you may not act upon, which was not what he was6 doing, upon applications, which this was not. It was a7 petition under section 925(c). There was no prohibition,8 and the ATF agent did not object that I'm not allowed to9 be there. We did -- we put the witnesses on that we were10 supposed to.11 QUESTION: Can I ask, under your view of things12 can the Secretary use assistance, or would that constitute13 a delegation?14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: He can. What he can do is, he15 can take and is required to take up into his own hands, as16 the three examples I gave to Justice Ginsburg, the17 responsibility. He can detail. He has a budget of $12318 million, $141,000, and he can take them up into his hands19 and say, look, I've got these sworn statements, and he20 could require, I want 10 sworn statements. He could21 require, I want 20, and he can have someone confirm that22 that's the right person. But what we do think, and this23 goes back to the Chief Justice's question, is that we do24 not think that Congress contemplated that the Secretary25 would spend $20 million granting 3,000 applications. If44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, you have 10 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, the argument that the Secretary could have granted relief was never raised below in this case. It was not raised in the court of appeals, it wasn't raised in the brief in opp, it was raised for the first time in respondent's brief, and again if -- we think the proper avenue for that would be a suit to the -- suing the Secretary under the APA or --QUESTION: No, but his point, and actually although he raised it late, is certainly a factor. That seems to me the most powerful argument, that there's no point sending it back to the Secretary, really, even though that's the correct procedural route, if the Secretary under the law has no choice, and what he's saying is, the Secretary under the law has no choice, and the reason is because literally this appropriations measure doesn't cover the Secretary's action.And given the absence of that, the Secretary's under a statute that tells him, act, and moreover, he45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 adds, this is a very bad way to repeal a statute, that2 really under normal legislative principles if they want to3 repeal it, repeal it; and therefore it isn't wrong for us4 to consider this literally in this circumstance. So that,5 I think, is -- that's an argument that's worth hearing6 what the reply is.7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- first of all, I think8 it is wrong. It would be a different disposition of the9 judgment, 10but with respect --QUESTION: Well, maybe we'd reach a different -- MR. KNEEDLER: Right.QUESTION: The disposition would be one thing -- MR. KNEEDLER: Right.QUESTION: -- but he's11 12 13 1415 what the heart of this is about.16 MR. KNEEDLER: There's17 make another point which I think18 Secretary's authority. We point19 our reply brief general principles of appropriations law20 that are really a particular application of the general21 principle that the specific governs the general, and under22 appropriations law, when Congress appropriates a pot of23 money for a particular task, that's all that can be spent24 for that task. Money can't be drawn from some other pot25 to perform that task.saying, that's really-- first of all, let me goes very much to the outonpage4and5of￼46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 We think that principle should apply a fortiori,2 or at least it's a reasonable interpretation for the3 Secretary to make, that when Congress has prohibited the4 expenditure of any funds by the agency to whom the5 Secretary has delegated that authority, that Congress did6 not expect money to be drawn from some other pot. That is7 a general principle of appropriations law. At the very8 least, the Secretary should be given the opportunity --9 QUESTION: What is the authority for saying10 that's a general principle of appropriations law?11 MR. KNEEDLER: There are a number of Comptroller12 General opinions that we cite at the bottom of page 4 of13 our reply brief, and it's against principles like that14 that agencies always act in deciding how they're going to15 spend money. But if this argument was going to be made,16 the right disposition would be to present it to the17 Secretary, so the Secretary can construe this statute,18 just like all the other statutes that need to be19 administered, and the way to do that --20 QUESTION: It's one thing to say that when21 Congress says we give $500,000 to subunit B to perform22 this function, you cannot use $2 million from somewhere23 else to perform the same function. That's one thing.24 It's something quite different, however, to say that when25 you have forbidden one unit from doing something, and47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 there is a general statute which allows the Secretary to2 do it, that that prohibition also applies to the3 Secretary. I just don't think it's parallel.4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, at the very least it would5 not be arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to6 decline to withdraw the delegation. That, we think, is7 the question that would arise in that situation, because8 the Secretary now may not act on these applications.9 He -- the ATF acts under the general direction of the10 Secretary, but if the Secretary directed ATF to grant one11 of these applications, he would be directing an illegal12 act. He would have to withdraw the delegation. He hasn't13 been asked by respondent to do that, which would require a14 petition for rulemaking.15 The Secretary, in deciding whether to take this16 power back to himself, could at the very least take into17 account what Congress has said about not wanting these18 applications to be acted upon by ATF, and also the reasons19 the Congress gave, which is that this is a very subjective20 undertaking, with high risk, and Congress decided, we21 don't want this function being performed because of the22 potential consequences. We want this money to be used for23 other purposes in fighting crime. All of that would make24 it entirely reasonable for the Secretary not to take on25 this function himself.48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

KNEEDLER: I was just going to --QUESTION: -- which has not been canceled by the appropriations law.MR. KNEEDLER: He does not -- nothing in the statute says that the Secretary must act on applications. It says the Secretary may grant relief. It does not require him to grant relief, and the Secretary could very easily withhold action, which is, after all, what Congress required ATF to do.QUESTION: What, on the ground that it's like the pardon power, it's like a matter of grace, or something like that?MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, very much so. It's -- it's, or, as the Court said four or five terms ago in the Yang case that we cite in our brief with respect to relief from deportation, it is exactly like the pardon power, and it's written in very broad terms. It establishes several preconditions, whether the person would be dangerous to the public safety, and whether granting it would not be contrary to the public interest, and even then the Secretary is not required to grant relief.This is a very broad discretionary power, and I49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 think it ties into what Justice Ginsburg was asking2 earlier, wouldn't this be an extraordinary power to give3 to the Federal district courts. Indeed it would, because4 the question is not just whether the person might be5 dangerous, but whether granting relief would be contrary6 to the public interest. That's not the sort of7 determination a court can make in the first instance.8 It's something that Congress has assigned to the9 Secretary.10 In this case, even if respondent is correct that11 he wouldn't be dangerous, it doesn't follow that12 restoration of firearms abilities would be consistent with13 the public interest. That's a judgment that Congress14 invested in the Secretary, not in the courts, and as15 Justice Kennedy pointed out, ATF could not investigate an16 application for relief in connection with a judicial17 proceeding any more than it could in an administrative18 proceeding.19 The ATF agent who testified in this case was one20 of respondent's witnesses. He was not called by the21 Government.22 QUESTION: Is testifying investigation?23 MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?24 QUESTION: Is testifying investigation?25 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that would be -- we did not50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 object, the Government did not object in the district2 court to his testifying. He was just testifying as to3 what he had looked up in the records, but an investigation4 involves far more than that.5 In fact, the AUSA in this case cross-examined6 Mr. Bean and a couple of other witnesses, but that's far7 short of the investigation that Congress expected ATF to8 undertake when it was performing these functions, and that9 it did undertake, which involved an investigation of the10 crime, neighbors, not just the people whom respondent has11 put forward, but ATF would go out and develop its own12 independent leads. None of that capability exists when13 the Government is responding to an application filed in14 court.15 So for these reasons we think it is --16 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler --17 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.18 QUESTION: -- if you've had a chance to complete19 your rebuttal, I had one question. Do you think the20 Secretary's authority under the statute is broad enough21 so, even without any act of Congress or anything in the22 appropriation, the Secretary could have adopted a policy,23 we would rather use our money on other purposes and so24 we're not going to process any applications?25 MR. KNEEDLER: I do believe it's -- it is broad51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 enough. I think the Secretary -- all it says is, the2 Secretary may grant relief. I think the Secretary could3 decide, and in fact the regulations, 144(d) has some4 categorical exclusions that the Secretary had adopted but5 the district court in this case ignored. Even -- we think6 the court couldn't act at all, but it even ignored the7 standards that the Secretary had adopted in the public8 interest to implement what would be a public interest9 standard under the statute. The district court ignored10 them, so we think that the Secretary could make a11 categorical determination not to grant relief.12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.13 Kneedler.
