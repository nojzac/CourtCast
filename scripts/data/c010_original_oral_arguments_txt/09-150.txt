Bryant. Ms. Palmer.ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. PALMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Formality is indeed essential to testimonial utterance. So said this Court in Davis, which dealt with two related situations: On-the-scene questioning by police officers and questions by 9-1-1 operators. This Court noted that such questioning may often lack the formality essential to testimonial utterance, as officers called to investigate need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess a situation, the threat to themselves, and the potential danger to possible victims.The question here is whether those same assessing questions -- what happened, who did it, where did it happen -- asked by police officers who, upon receiving a radio report of a man shot, found a wounded man lying on the ground next to a car at a gas station, bleeding, visibly in pain, and having trouble talking -­3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 were made in a formal context sufficiently similar to a2 magisterial examination so that the answers by the dying3 -- by the dying victim are testimonial.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it can't all5 be the formality of the context. I mean, if the police6 came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I7 guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was8 the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the9 answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same10 lack of formality.11 MS. PALMER: Which is where the ongoing12 emergency test from Davis comes into play. The13 questions need to be -- the primary purpose needs to be14 to meet an ongoing emergency. So assessing the risk,15 assessing the danger to others. And any questions16 beyond that could arguably be testimonial, while -­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we -­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Forget about formality, in19 other words. Formality or no formality has nothing to20 do with it.21 MS. PALMER: Well, under Davis, you said22 that was how you tested the formality. If -- the Davis23 test is a gauge of formality. If there are questions24 that respond to ongoing emergency, then this Court has25 said that that is an indicator that it lacks the4￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 formality.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we tell that?3 Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what4 happened, you'd ask the very same questions. You're5 saying the6 situation.7 you ask if8 was the past -- what were the past events?9 I mean, I'm trying to understand how youquestions are relevant also to securing the But what -- what different questions would you wanted to find out what happened? What10 take these questions and say we can put a label on them11 here that says, well, this is to control an emergency12 situation versus we want to know what happened13 historically.14 MS. PALMER: Well, I think that what you15 have to do is look at the -- I mean, obviously, things16 can have dual purposes and often will. You need to look17 at the primary purpose here. And you said in Davis it's18 an objective -- what would an objective person19 viewing this test -­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But whose primary21 purpose is it?22 I mean, the victim here knew that the23 incident hadn't happened there. There was nothing he24 had to share with the police, because they could see he25 was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot. He5￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat to him. He had driven away. Rick didn't know where he had gone.So what's the ongoing emergency to thevictim?MS. PALMER: Well, I think here -- which is why in Davis you said is the primary purpose of the questioning, is what you look at in Davis. And we're not asking you to overrule that.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, wait a minute. What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant is what is at issue?says.JUSTICE SCALIA: That is -- that is what itMS. PALMER: What -­Official￼JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the -- it's the -­ it's the purpose of the declarant, not of thequestioner.MS. PALMER: But the formality indicators that the Court delineated in Davis did not include whether the answers to the questions were for the purpose of establishing past events, but whether the primary purpose of the questions were for those ends.6Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425The -- the question is one of context, not content, as you noticed in -- as you said in Crawford.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in Davis, the issue is why was the declarant talking? What you were trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested. That's how I read the situation.The questions provided context for that. Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you talking about an event, attempting to get the police to intercede and arrest the person?Isn't that a fair reading of that case?MS. PALMER: Yes. And in Davis, you said also that there comes a point where courts can tell when the questioning takes on a different tone and the answers might become testimonial.When the questioning seeks answers that go beyond meeting the emergency, then courts can properly find there's a point where the nontestimonial statements end and the testimonial statements -­JUSTICE ALITO: In a situation like this, do you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary purpose of the victim was when he responded to the police and said who shot him?You have a man who has just been shot. He7Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and2 he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and3 he says: My primary purpose in saying this is so that4 they can respond to an ongoing emergency. No, but I5 also have the purpose of giving them information that6 could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's7 a little bit less my purpose than responding to the8 ongoing emergency.9 It seems like it's totally artificial.10 MS. PALMER: Yes. And I think it -- any11 time you ask the courts to delve into the subjective12 intent of someone who is not present and cannot testify13 and cannot tell you, it necessarily complicates things.14 And I think it would -­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What possible response to16 an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind? What17 possible response to an ongoing emergency?18 MS. PALMER: He did ask for EMS -­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: He was bleeding to death,20 and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death.21 Now, that statement would -- would be, you know,22 suggesting an ongoing emergency.23 But giving the name of the person who shot24 him, where he was shot, what does that have anything -­25 how does that have anything to do with an ongoing8￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425emergency?MS. PALMER: Well, the police, upon responding to the scene, don't know that this emergency is limited -­JUSTICE SCALIA: But he does.MS. PALMER: -- to that person.JUSTICE SCALIA: But he does.MS. PALMER: Which is why you have to lookat the entire context.JUSTICE SCALIA: He knows -- he knows thathis -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near there. He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far away was it? Six blocks or -- a good distance from where the shooter was. He knows all of that.The only reason he could be giving the name of the person who shot him is so that person could be apprehended and punished.MS. PALMER: And yet that subjective mindset doesn't affect the formality. It doesn't change the fact that this is an informal situation. You don't have the -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he had -- suppose he had survived. Suppose Covington had survived -­MS. PALMER: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- instead of died. And9Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 then the prosecutor says, I want to introduce this2 evidence against Bryant. Would you say that, yes, it's3 nontestimonial, so it comes in?4 MS. PALMER: He would have to be unavailable5 for it to come in.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why, if it's7 nontestimonial?8 MS. PALMER: Well, under -- the way the9 current jurisprudence is, he would have to be10 unavailable. If it's not testimonial, I do not think it11 would offend the Confrontation Clause for it to come in.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you said -- you said13 it's -- you're typing it nontestimonial. It goes to14 emergency situations. So I'm saying: Would that carry15 over to the man survives and the prosecutor says, I16 don't need to put him on the stand so he can be17 cross-examined; I've got nontestimonial evidence that I18 can put in?19 Would it become testimonial, then, if he20 survived?21 MS. PALMER: No, I don't think it would22 change the nature of what happened at the time. I do23 think, though, that is why we have said the24 Confrontation Clause is not some sort of super-hearsay25 rule and that we will allow the Government -­10￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then -- then your answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in.MS. PALMER: As long as it was not somehow barred by the rules of hearsay, which I believe it would be.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm confused ofwhat -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on. Is it the purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the declarants?We say the statements are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events. The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the interrogation, which seems to be the question of what the police thought, not what the -- the person dying thought.MS. PALMER: That's correct. And I understand there is the footnote stating that,obviously, the declarant's statements are at issue. If there were no declarant, then -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I mean -­MS. PALMER: -- there wouldn't be an issue. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what the11Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the2 footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the3 declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question,4 that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.5 So which -- I guess, which is it?6 MS. PALMER: Well, I think what happens is7 the -- the interrogator's statements are not what are8 going to be determined to be testimonial or9 nontestimonial. They provide a glimpse into the context10 so we can determine whether those statements that are at11 issue are testimonial or nontestimonial. They are one12 way to determine the formality of the situation.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: One way to evaluate those14 statements is what they are made in response to. If15 they are made in response to a certain type of police16 inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial. And17 another kind -- you know, are you dying? They are more18 likely not to be testimonial. But it is ultimately the19 statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether20 they are testimonial or not.21 MS. PALMER: Correct. But as -­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then, how does23 that apply? The officer says, what happened? And24 the -- the declarant says, Rick shot me.25 Now, is that testimonial or not? Because12￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the declarant knows he's 6 miles away. It's not going2 to help them solve an emergency, but the police don't3 know that.45 look at6 respond7 know -­8MS. PALMER: Right, which is why I think you the purpose of the questioning -- here, toto an ongoing emergency. The police don'tJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it was an9 emergency, he wouldn't have asked, what happened? He10 would ask, what is happening?11 MS. PALMER: I don't -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: To ask what happened is to13 ask the declarant to describe past events, which is14 testimonial.15 MS. PALMER: I don't think that you can make16 that kind of bright-line rule. I think here when you17 have a man bleeding out on a sidewalk and you don't18 know -- is there an assailant behind him; is there -­19 are there victims somewhere else; is, you know, this a20 wanted felon -- I think there is an ongoing emergency21 until you can determine -­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you -- you do not know23 if the man is running amok and threatening to shoot24 other people or if -- if he's drunk, if he's on a25 rampage, if it's a college campus, then it's -- it's -­13￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 it's a sniper. You just don't know.2 MS. PALMER: Right. But -­3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if you're worried about5 that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on6 the ground or do you examine the gas station first,7 rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter8 that you think is still in the gas station?9 The -- the behavior of the police here gave10 no indication that they thought they were in danger11 immediately and were interrogating this person in order12 to assess the danger to them. That wasn't what they13 were after.14 MS. PALMER: Well, to be fair, this was15 before Crawford was answered. The questions were asked16 were to determine whether this was an excited utterance,17 and the questions that we would like to know now were:18 What did you do for your safety? How were you worried?19 What were -- that was not at issue, and that was not20 asked.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not -- I'm not22 sure that policemen should read Crawford before they23 perform their -- their peacekeeping duties. The -­24 no -- no one questions the right of the police to -- to25 ask these questions and to use the word either "happens"14￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425or "happening" or "happened."The question is whether the -- the answersare later admissible. Those are two different inquiries.MS. PALMER: Correct. And I was simply saying the record would have been available to check -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, Crawford rejects reliability as a criteria.MS. PALMER: Yes. So our position here simply is that you cannot evaluate an ongoing emergency from hindsight.When police -- you know, arrive on a scene and find a wounded man bleeding, they don't know the circumstances until they can find out what happened, who did it, and where did it happen, and try to assess the risk of harm, as you said in Davis, to themselves, to the victim, and to others.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have to do -- we're back to the reliability test, really, because they didn't do anything wrong. They were trying to assess the situation. But that's what they do when any report of criminal activity occurs. That's a different inquiry than the inquiry of why should that statement be permitted to be introduced at trial?It goes to the very essence of reliability.15Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Was the statement made under circumstances that would2 suggest an intent to testify? That's really what you're3 getting at, isn't it?4 MS. PALMER: No. No.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you are, because6 you're trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing7 emergency that suggests that in those situations,8 whatever the person is saying is okay because it was9 done to assess an emergency situation and not done for10 purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of11 catching somebody.12 MS. PALMER: Which is what this Court said13 in Davis, and said that that was not related to14 reliability but to formality there, and that that was15 not a formal thing akin to magisterial examinations.16 We're not trying to question or in any way17 change the test already set forth by this Court in18 Davis. We agree with that test. We simply disagree19 with the application by the lower court of that test20 here and the limitation it put on it.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So are you saying that22 the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be23 in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent24 emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what25 had -- the nature of the crime?16￼Alderson Reporting Company20 admissible? 2122 designed to23 and -­24 25MS. PALMER: It is preliminary questions assess the risk to themselves, the public,JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. MS. PALMER: So, yes.17Official1 MS. PALMER: We're not saying that any time2 there is a perpetrator at large, there is automatically3 an ongoing emergency until that person is caught.4 What we are saying is that preliminary5 inquiries on the scene to try to determine who the6 perpetrator is and where it might be would be -- would7 be nontestimonial -­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For all crimes, or only9 for shooting crimes or knifing crimes? For explosions?10 What kinds of crimes would qualify?11 MS. PALMER: I think, obviously, violent12 crimes raise ongoing emergencies, emergencies to13 which -- more than others. There could also be contexts￼would apply to other crimes.JUSTICE SCALIA: So at least whenever the upon somebody who has been the victim of a14 in which it 1516 police come17 violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could18 plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not19 still nearby, and that testimony will always beAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Strike "designed to assess the risk." You don't know what they're designed to do. These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk. They just asked the questions. And that's what is going to happen in future cases.And you're saying, whenever policemen come upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it, what's his name, all of that will always be admissible because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?MS. PALMER: I think if the context shows that's the primary purpose, then, yes, that will often be the case.JUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean? How could it possibly be admissible?First, there has to be a degree of formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay tests. So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, it is not admissible.MS. PALMER: Well, here, for instance, it was admitted as excited utterance.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course, there are exceptions. There could, in fact, there could be a co-conspirator exception. There could be a dying declaration exception. But what we're talking about is18Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception -­ would permit it in.So the answer is no, it's not the case that whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him questions, it's going to be admissible. It depends.The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon.JUSTICE SCALIA: Only when he's excited, right? Only when the victim who has been the object of a violent crime is excited.Or if State law doesn't apply and we're dealing with a Federal crime and Federal officers, right, and trial in Federal court? And in that case, what Justice Breyer just said would not apply.MS. PALMER: That's correct. And I -­JUSTICE BREYER: It would not apply? There are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule? And there are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?MS. PALMER: Your -- I -­JUSTICE BREYER: I thought there were, in my copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence.MS. PALMER: Yes. And I did misspeak. What I meant to say was that it would be nontestimonial, not that it would always be admissible.19Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- if you had thebenefit of hindsight, and this trial Davis, and so the prosecutor went on would you have instead tried to makeoccurred before excited utterance, a case that thiswas a dyingleft.declaration?MS.

KRUGER,OfficialON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:As we understand the rule ofDavis v. Washington, it is a rule that focuses on the primary purpose behind police interrogation, because it's designed for a particular purpose: Not to provide a comprehensive definition of the term "testimonial," but rather to identify those statements that are testimonial because they are made in response to police interrogation.When the objective primary purpose of that interrogation is to enable police to meet an ongoing20￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425emergency, rather than to collect evidence for future possible prosecution, the statements that are given in response to that interrogation are nontestimonial. That was-­JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you distinguish between collecting evidence for a future prosecution andcollecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the felon? Do you distinguish those two?And you can say these police -- these policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter was and where he was so they could go get him. Would that -­MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that not be collecting evidence for a future prosecution?MS. KRUGER: I think that there are often multiple reasons, particularly in the wake of a violent event like a shooting, why -­JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it has to be for the purpose of a future prosecution. Just -- just in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who committed this crime, that doesn't qualify?MS. KRUGER: I think that what would qualify under the Davis test is if police need to apprehend the21Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425person, not for purposes of bringing the person into the criminal justice system, but rather to neutralize an ongoing threat that they present to the community at large, as is often the case when somebody has just proven themselves both capable and -­JUSTICE SCALIA: When does that not exist in the case of a violent crime?

KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think it makes a significant difference whether we're talking about a -- an act of violence like a shooting, somebody who has used a weapon that's capable of inflicting deadly harm on multiple victims in a short period of time, or someone who has used their fists, like the alleged perpetrators -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So if you use a gun, a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets admitted into evidence, because the police could -­ could be not -­MS.

KRUGER: I don't think that we woulddraw the rule that broadly, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's how youjust described it.MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that in thissituation, we have police arriving on the scene to discover a man who has been recently shot; as it turns, fatally.situation -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.MS. KRUGER: They need to find out in thatJUSTICE SCALIA: Who did it.Official￼MS. KRUGER: They need to find out who did it so that they make sure that person isn't continuing to threaten other people on the scene.JUSTICE SCALIA: That's always the case. That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of the testimonial rule is. That's always going to be the case, at least when there's a violent crime.MS. KRUGER: Well, I think -­JUSTICE SCALIA: And you may as well take Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of serious cases, if that's going to be your rule.MS. KRUGER: I don't think that that's the23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 case at all, Justice Scalia. I think it's actually very2 much consistent with what this Court said in Davis.3 It may very well have been that the4 subjective purpose of the 9-1-1 operator was also to5 bring the perpetrator in that case to justice. But this6 Court, I think quite properly, recognized that in an7 emergency situation, the attention of both law8 enforcement and the declarant is quite properly going to9 be focused on dealing with the emergency at hand and is10 not going to be made of the kind of focused11 understanding of -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: The crime was ongoing in -­13 in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with14 the operator. It was ongoing. She was seeking help15 from the emergency that was occurring to her at that16 moment. There's nothing like that here.17 MS. KRUGER: It's true that that is a18 factual distinction between this case and Davis, but we19 don't think that it's one that makes a dispositive legal20 difference.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the police know that22 that was the case when they began the questioning? Did23 the police know that this man was not on a rampage, that24 he was not going to act in self-defense when they came25 after him?24￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. KRUGER: No, they certainly did not know that, Justice Kennedy.JUSTICE KENNEDY: That he was not takinghostages?MS. KRUGER: That's correct. They had no way of knowing that.

KRUGER: I -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, is that -- is thatlikely not always to be the case when -- when you come upon a person who has been the -- the victim of a violent crime?You could say it all the time. No, they didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a trial.MS. KRUGER: Well, I think it's important to emphasize that what we're arguing for is not a rule that would say, as long as there's a violent perpetrator at large, as long as he is at large, any questions that police ask of -- of potential people who have25escape the scene and blocks away in no wayWill they ever know that?￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 information about the crime will necessarily be2 nontestimonial.3 Our argument is a far narrower one, and one4 that we think follows very closely from the principle5 articulated in Davis, which is when the primary purpose6 of a police interrogation is to obtain information7 that's necessary to enable them to meet an ongoing8 emergency -­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, how do you know10 that? Because they would ask the same very questions if11 what they wanted was testimonial evidence. So you12 can -- you can characterize that set of questions either13 way. What would lead us to pick one rather than the14 other?15 MS. KRUGER: I think it's actually not the16 case, Justice Ginsburg, that they would have asked the17 very same questions. We know from reading the trial18 testimony that the officers, as they appeared on the19 scene in response to the police run of a man being shot,20 asked the same question over and over again. Each21 officer, as they approached him, said: What happened?22 Where did it happen? And wanted to know how to23 recognize the shooter so when they proceeded to the24 scene, they would know who they were dealing with and25 how to safeguard themselves.26￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say -­MS. KRUGER: They weren't asking the kinds of questions -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's say that we -- let's say that we agree with you that there was an emergency and the police were asking questions in order to mitigate the emergency.What would be the rationale for admitting this statement, then? Is it more reliable? Because if we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which says reliability is not the key.What is the reason for that? Is it because the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -­ the statements and to ask loaded questions? That in itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what'sthe -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the rationale for the distinction?MS. KRUGER: We think that the principle that this Court announced in Davis and we're asking the Court to apply again today reflects two principles that underlie the Confrontation Clause as this Court interpreted in Crawford.The first is that testimony is typically characterized by the kind of focused understanding by the declarant that the person is providing information27Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 for potential use in a future prosecution. It's -- the2 petitioner in Davis, I would note, made an argument to3 this Court that whenever a person calls 9-1-1, they do4 so with an awareness that the information they provide5 may be used for prosecutorial purposes.6 But this Court rejected that argument,7 because it understood, I think quite rightly, that8 there's a difference between providing that sort of9 information to law enforcement with a sort of vague10 awareness that that might be its potential use, and11 doing so with a kind of focused understanding that has12 been characteristic of the testimonial statements this13 Court has so far identified, like Sylvia Crawford's14 stationhouse interview in Crawford or Amy Hammon's15 interview with the police officer from the safety of her16 kitchen that resulted in the execution of a formal17 affidavit in the Davis case.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we look to the19 specific situation? I mean, one of the officers zeroed20 in on the victim. No one was looking around to see if21 anybody was lurking in the bushes. Then, as far as22 protecting the public, do we take into account that this23 was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are￼24 not likely to be many members of the public around?25 do we just say you find someone who looks like he has28OrAlderson Reporting Company1 been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter2 whether the3 enough, the4 questions?5public is around or not, we -- that'svictim of a violent crime can be asked theseMS. KRUGER: To take your first question 6 first, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the trialOfficial7 testimony is not quite as clear on the question of what8 fears the officers had as I think Respondent has9 suggested in his brief. If you look at Joint Appendix10 page 136, Officer Stuglin testified that he was, in11 fact, afraid for his safety when he got to the gas12 station. I would note that all of the officers, when13 they left the gas station after EMS arrived, they14 proceeded immediately to the location of the shooting,15 the location that Anthony Covington had identified for16 them. When they got there, they took a tactical17 position, they waited for back-up, and they did so18 because they were afraid that a shooter was in the19 house, and they wanted to proceed very cautiously in20 making sure that they neutralized the threat that21 shooter posed to the public safety, including their own.22 I think that in examining the exigencies of23 a situation a court would be justified in looking at the24 circumstances in which the crime occurred, and could25 very well take into account the fact that the crime29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 occurred at 3 o'clock in the morning as opposed to 52 o'clock in the afternoon. But I think that we would3 expect any reasonable police officer to do precisely4 what the police officers in this case did, which was5 proceed directly to the scene, not use their interview6 with Anthony Covington as an occasion to execute an7 affidavit or otherwise engage -­89 saying that10 mean, after11 can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects12 can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your13 friend is arguing for. I still have trouble figuring14 out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating15 officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant?16 MS. KRUGER: I think that the test that the17 Court set out in Davis is one that focuses on the18 purpose of the interrogation because of the limited19 context in which that -­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And what do21 you do with the last sentence of footnote 1. It's the22 one that says -­23 MS. KRUGER: In the end it's the declarant's24 statement that the Confrontation Clause requires us to25 examine.30CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but then you're the focus is on the police officers. I all, we're not saying that police officers￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right.MS. KRUGER: We read footnote 1 to be an acknowledgement that answers given in response to police interrogation do not constitute the universe of possible testimonial statements, that testimony can indeed be volunteered as was Lord Cobham's letter, for example, in Sir Walter Raleigh's treason case. But in the end Davis, I think, quite properly focuses on the primarypurpose ofthe interrogation.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Van Hoek.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER JON VAN HOEK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. VAN HOEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Court:please theOfficial￼When Anthony Covington made his statement to the officers at the gas station, not just once but several times, he reasonably understood that he was providing the police information as to events which had concluded a half hour earlier at a location six blocks away, with an understanding that that information would assist the police in locating, apprehending, andpotentially responsibleprosecuting the person he felt wasfor his injury.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear the end. In31Alderson Reporting Company1 locating and?2 3 4 56 that, if --7 a State law8 an exception to the hearsay rule, why should the9 Confrontation Clause bar it? There is not greatOfficialMR. VAN HOEK: Apprehending.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Apprehending.MR. VAN HOEK: Arresting -­JUSTICE BREYER: -- involves something like what keeps that out? I mean, assuming that or the Federal Rules of Evidence admit it as10 likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's11 affidavit, it is going to be introduced per se into the12 trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would13 we want to keep it out? That's the part that I do not14 understand.151617 the Federal 1819 Constitution -­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your answer,21 counsel, is that we decided that in Crawford, from which22 Justice Breyer dissented.23 (Laughter.)24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think you might have25 another -­32￼MR. VAN HOEK: Well, certainly -­JUSTICE BREYER: Federal -- I mean, under Constitution.MR. VAN HOEK: Under the FederalAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I think we didn't. Suppose I happen to think -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps there is another answer that I would like to hear.JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to hear your answer because I don't think we decided it in Crawford.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now is a good time to try to jump in, I think.(Laughter.)MR. VAN HOEK: Okay. The reason, Your Honor, that the Confrontation Clause is thefundamental -- part of the fundamental law of the country, and what this Court, I believe, decided in Crawford and then applied to those situations -- similar situations in Davis and Hammon, is that where you have a statement from a witness to a police officer as part of a questioning and that statement is the functional equivalent of testimony that witness would have given had he or she appeared at trial and been subject to cross-examination, then the admission of that statement at trial even under a hearsay exception without cross-examination effectively allows the police to present -­JUSTICE BREYER: But does it mean -- does it mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -­33Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be2 used at trial? Or it may just happen to turn out? I3 mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the4 situation? When I looked into history I thought -- I'm5 not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand6 there have been situations where the Court's gone back7 to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it8 doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it9 a little bit. I think that that goal could be open to10 us.11 So I want to know what the basic reason is12 that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say,13 an investigation. There's an investigation of a crime,14 and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes15 some statements just generally that help the16 investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as17 co-conspiracy, okay?18 What in the Constitution, what functional19 principle, is there that says we should keep that out of20 Court?21 MR. VAN HOEK: Because I think what this22 Court said in Crawford and Davis is that is the primary23 test. That is what our Constitution requires to allow24 the reliability, the believability, the trustworthiness25 of that evidence to be evaluated by a jury. We don't34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 have a situation -­2 JUSTICE BREYER:3 all -- all hearsay evidence,4 rule makers saying there are5 trustworthiness is sufficient, such as co-confederates,6 confederates, all of that's wiped out by Crawford and7 the-­8 MR. VAN HOEK: It would be wiped out if the9 statement at issue qualifies as testimonial under the10 test this Court announced in Crawford and Davis.11 JUSTICE12 Crawford, isn't it?13 MR. VAN14 JUSTICE15 for now because I'm16 that. What is the constitutional rationale? I joined17 Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many18 second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended19 as I have written it.20 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, I would have to say the21 constitutional justification for that is the reason why22 the right of confrontation is, isn't it, in the23 Constitution, where you had a situation in English24 common law, as we said, where magistrates were allowed25 to go out, interview witnesses, come into court, and35Is it all hearsay? Now, despite State or Federal exceptions where theSCALIA: That's what we said inHOEK: Yes, it is.BREYER: Of course, what I'm looking -- is whether there's any sense to￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 present their memory, their version, of what the witness2 said as substantive evidence in a case and the defense3 is not allowed to question or talk to the witness -­4 JUSTICE BREYER: So now you've just got what5 I'm looking for. What I'm looking for is I can go into6 Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this7 was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial8 and the Marian judges. And now what I need is a line.9 Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done,10 which seems just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar11 virtually all hearsay exception evidence, of which for12 400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a13 lot in the courts.14 MR. VAN HOEK: I certainly don't think15 Crawford and Davis bars all hearsay exception -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: What, in your view, is the17 correct line and why, most importantly why?18 MR. VAN HOEK: I believe this Court in19 Crawford and Davis correctly established that line, in a20 situation like this where it is the response of a21 citizen to questions from a police officer, that you22 look primarily, as footnote 1 indicates, to the content23 of that statement. If that's -­24 JUSTICE ALITO: If it were established that25 this was a dying declaration and was done in -- made in36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford?2 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, this Court certainly3 has suggested that in Giles, that a dying declaration4 might be an exception to Crawford as an exception that5 existed at the time of the framing. We don't have to6 deal with that question in this case because this is not7 a dying declaration.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why not?9 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand -- I understand10 that, but assume -- assume for the sake of argument that11 it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying12 declaration, which the Court has suggested. What does13 that tell you about the understanding of the scope of14 the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth15 Amendment was adopted? Because a dying declaration may￼16 very well be testimonial under -- is17 testimonial under the Crawford test.18 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. And19 dying -- maybe the dying declaration20 situation is an indication. What's different about21 dying declaration from all these other hearsay22 exceptions is that, at the point the statement was made,23 it's an understanding that that witness is never goint24 -- will not be testifying, that there -- that there is25 no potential that that witness will appear in court in37Alderson Reporting Companylikely to beI think that the as being in thatOfficial1 person. There's -- the police officers in any of these2 situations speaking to a witness -- when a police3 officer arrives at the scene they have no way of knowing4 what's going to occur months later at trial.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought -- I thought the6 rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they7 are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable. You can8 certainly question that. But I thought that that was9 the rationale that the courts gave.10 MR. VAN HOEK: I think that's correct.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: On your death bed before12 you're going to meet the maker, you're not going to13 lie--Ithinkthatwasthetest.Soitwasa14 reliability component, correct?15 MR. VAN HOEK: That's true. And I think16 that's -- that's also the -- the background of most17 hearsay exceptions is that for the circumstances that18 there's some degree of inherent reliability to that19 statement which excuses the absence of cross-examination20 if the witness is unavailable. But -­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, suppose that there is22 a universe of instances that we can identify as23 questions in order to alleviate and stop an emergency to24 prevent a crime from becoming aggravated and continuous.25 Let's suppose we can have a universe of those questions.38￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there an argument3 that responses made for that purpose are more reliable?4 Is that what -- is that what underlies the so-called5 emergency exception, do you think?6 MR. VAN HOEK: I don't believe so. I don't7 believe that -- that a -- a statement by a witness that8 is a narrative of past events -­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it -- so -- well -­10 and, of course, Davis certainly does not rest on11 reliability12 reliability.13 1415 only way to 1617 fact there's a 911 -­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't there a reliability19 component that underlies this whether we like it or not?20 MR. VAN HOEK: I don't believe so. I don't21 think that the fact that someone calls 911 and makes a22 report, whether they're talking about an ongoing23 situation or reporting a past event, makes that somehow24 inherently more reliable than if they used another25 medium.39-- or Crawford, rather, doesn't rest onMR. VAN HOEK: No.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that really the explain the 911 exception?MR. VAN HOEK: No, no. The 911 -- well, the￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I think the distinction made in Davis is that the beginning of the 911 call that Ms. McCottry was making to the case was not relating past events. It was a declaration of emergency. It was a call for immediate assistance.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't -- isn't the reason we accept that is because it's reliable? It's an excited utterance. It's an account of an ongoing event. It's a contemporaneous observation. Therefore, it is reliable.MR. VAN HOEK: I don't -- no, I don't think that was the basis on which this Court held it was nontestimonial. I think this Court held it was nontestimonial because it was not what a witness does during a trial. It was -­case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to thisMR. VAN HOEK: Yes.Official￼JUSTICE GINSBURG: Excited utterance was -­ the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he -­ and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened.I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited utterance wouldn't work. Could he have raised dying declaration? She said absolutely yes.40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 So my question to you is: Just assume that2 we should hold the Confrontation Clause is applicable.3 Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say,4 well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying5 declaration plea here. So it would only be fair to6 allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this7 testimony was a dying declaration?8 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, in -- in this case,9 when -- when the initial attempted admission of this10 evidence, at the preliminary exam, when it met a hearsay11 objection, the prosecutor at that point argued that it12 was admissible under Michigan evidence rules as either13 an excited utterance and/or a dying declaration.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then she did argue dying15 declaration.16 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, they argued dying17 declaration. The judge sustained the objection and said18 he had not established the foundation for either one of19 those. The prosecutor at that point established a20 foundation solely for excited utterance. The judge21 ruled the evidence admissible and specifically said22 admissible only as excited utterance.23 At that point, the prosecution abandoned any24 attempt, throughout the State court proceedings, to say25 this was a dying declaration.41￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that was in the pre-Davis world. But do you think the prosecutor had abandoned that effort had he been informed about Davis?MR. VAN HOEK: I don't know. I don't knowwhat the -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Van Hoek, what is the basis for your concession that a dying declaration is an exception from the Confrontation Clause?MR. VAN HOEK: I -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It is an exception fromhearsay, for certain, but MR. VAN HOEK: meant -- if you took whatfrom the Confrontation Clause? I'm not -- if I -- if II said as a concession, what IOfficial￼said is that this -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You conceded it. It's beenthe whole basis for Justice Ginsburg's subsequent interrogation.JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question was based on it's an open question because we have said maybe a dying declaration.MR. VAN HOEK: And I -- I -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was an open question only -- only where the -- the defendant has42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 effected the death of the person who has made the dying2 declaration. I don't know of any cases that allow a3 dying declaration in over a Confrontation Clause4 objection.5 MR. VAN HOEK: If I -- if you took my answer6 to the prior question to say that I conceded that, I'm7 not saying that. I'm saying when I was first asked the8 question about dying declaration, I pointed out that9 this Court in Giles indicated that that may be an10 exception to the Confrontation Clause. And I agree -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it wasn't -- and it12 wasn't in Giles. It wasn't in -­13 MR. VAN HOEK: No, Giles is not -­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG -- any way to the -- that15 the -- that the purpose of the killing was to get rid of16 the witness's testimony. Giles made the statement maybe17 dying declaration is an -- is an exception to our18 Crawford's jurisprudence.19 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. And as you said, this20 Court has not reached that question directly, and -- and21 there's no need to reach that question in this case￼22 because this is not a dying23 JUSTICE SCALIA:24 if it is not an established25 Confrontation Clause, there43declaration case.If it hasn't been reached,exception to theis no basis for saying,Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425therefore, the Confrontation Clause pertains only to reliability. It pertains to the opportunity to cross-examine.And -- and reliability exceptions are what we used to do under -- under Reynolds. If it was reliable, we let it in.MR. VAN HOEK: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: And the mere fact that it's reliable as a dying declaration instead of reliable as something else ought to have nothing to do with the Confrontation Clause decision.MR. VAN HOEK: I agree. I'm not -- I clearly don't -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whether we -- whether you agree or not, we said it was an open question.MR. VAN HOEK: Yes, yes.JUSTICE ALITO: Can there be -­MR. VAN HOEK: And it has not been decided. JUSTICE ALITO: Can there be a situation inwhich the primary purpose for a statement or for the question that elicits the statement is to respond to an ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a few seconds before, but it relates to something that has44Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 occurred as opposed to something that is occurring at2 that very moment?3 MR. VAN HOEK: I think there are situations4 where -- where the police are coming in and asking5 questions: Is there a threat here? Is there someone6 here who is -- who is threatening you? Is there someone7 here who is coming to threaten you or threaten other8 people? They may be able to get some background9 information to put that in context, but we don't have10 anything like that in this case.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand, but we12 need to know where to draw the line. So, you concede13 that the line is not between a statement about he's14 hitting me with a baseball bat as opposed to he just15 finished hitting me with a baseball bat and is headed16 out the door? That's not where the line is drawn.17 MR. VAN HOEK: I think the line would be18 drawn if those were the only statements, he's hitting me19 with a baseball bat versus he -- he just hit me with a20 baseball bat and he just left. I think the line is21 clearly drawn in Davis between -- the hitting me with a22 baseball bat would be nontestimonial -­23 JUSTICE ALITO: No, no. I really would like24 a clear answer to this. Is -- can there be an ongoing25 emergency where the statement relates -- where the45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 statement recounts something that has occurred, not2 something that is occurring?3 MR. VAN HOEK: I think that in the absence4 of any statement by the witness alleging that there's5 any current, ongoing, imminent danger, if the witness6 only gives a statement that relates to past, completed7 events, then it's not a showing of -- of an ongoing8 emergency.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what do you do -­10 what do you do with the statement the guy in the gas11 station shot me? Is that purely past, or is that an12 ongoing emergency?13 MR. VAN HOEK: That statement standing14 alone -- I would say that that's past, purely past.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the guy16 in the gas station is still there with a gun, the police17 are within range?18 MR. VAN HOEK: Are we referring to a19 specific person?20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. I mean, that21 strikes me as something that happened in the past, he22 shot me, but at the same time demonstrates an ongoing23 emergency because he's right there and he might shoot24 you. I'm suggesting the line you propose to25 Justice Alito doesn't work.46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, I -- I would -- I2 don't -- I don't think that -- that the -- the -- there3 has been discussion of verbs tense and past tense, and I4 don't think that is the -- is the determining factor.5 It's certainly important. It's certainly a relevant6 consideration in -­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: The guy in the gas station8 is present. It's not past. He's making an assertion9 the guy who is now in the gas station shot me. The10 "shot me" is past, but he's asserting that the person is11 now in the gas station. That is a statement of a12 present fact.13 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. And I think if you look14 at all of the circumstances together, it's a -- it's -­15 and going to the primary purpose is, is the witness16 declaring some type of emergency, some sort of imminent17 harm and requesting the police to render assistance to18 alleviate that, to protect him -- him or her.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose they get a20 9-1-1 call. There's -- a man has just been shot on the21 corner of Fifth and Main. They go to Fifth and Main;22 they find a man there; he's shot; he's bleeding23 profusely; he's in shock; and they know nothing more24 about what's happened. And they say, well, what25 happened? Well, he shot me. Who shot you? It's John47￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Jones.Now what about that?OfficialMR. VAN HOEK: I would say that's our case, and I would say that was testimonial.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the police under those circumstances don't know whether John Jones is going on a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous victims. Maybe it's a gang fight. He's shot one member of an opposing gang; now he's going to go shoot another member of an opposing gang.How can they -- how can you answer that question, what's the primary purpose there? I just don't understand it.MR. VAN HOEK: Well, I would think -- in that situation, nothing about the Davis rule, nothing about the Confrontation Clause precludes the police from taking that information and asking those further questions -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you were the one that drew the line between a past event and an ongoing event. Suppose the sniper says, I've shot you now, and I'm going to shoot three other students, good-bye. That's a past event.MR. VAN HOEK: But if the statement is made to the police that a sniper has said he's -- he is on48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the verge of shooting other people because he just shot2 someone, I would say that's certainly a declaration of3 an emergency and certainly would be nontestimonial under4 the -- under the test of Davis.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any -- I'll try6 this -- I think you're just -- you don't like my -­7 where I'm coming from, but -- and so you might not have8 an answer to this.9 But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and10 that line is dividing what I think of as the11 Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation,12 which I have in my mind as people going into a room and13 saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it14 out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a15 letter, and they say "bye," and then they walk next door16 to the trial and introduce it. I mean, that's Walter17 Raleigh, in my mind.18 And then, on the other side of the line, is19 an -- evidentiary rules that are basically in State20 cases run by the State. And they sometimes let hearsay21 in, and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability,22 et cetera, judgments in developing their -- their23 decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work. Okay?24 Now, why don't I like emergency to draw25 that? The reason I don't like the word "emergency" is I49￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425think police do lots of things other than handle emergency and develop testimony.There's a range of things that you would describe as investigating the circumstance. There's no danger. There have been a string of robberies. They go around and ask the grocery store people and everything what happened. Now, I don't know why we should keep out evidence that, say, is given in that situation by a confederate. It turns out he was the assistant -- why?And if I don't like that, I don't like the emergency rule as doing the -- as doing the work there, and I'm looking for something else.Now, you have my whole train of thought. If you want to say, Judge, there is nothing but theemergency rule, you are perfectly free to say it. JUSTICE SCALIA: Do it.(Laughter.)MR. VAN HOEK: I -- there is nothing -­ there is nothing but the emergency rule. I think that when -- when the police are investigating a reported crime and getting statements from witnesses, whether the victim or another witness -­JUSTICE BREYER: They're not. They're just asking -- all right. Yes. Go ahead.MR. VAN HOEK: Well, they're investigating.50Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They're2 investigating.3 MR. VAN HOEK: They're seeking information4 in which they will do their job, which is to go try to5 arrest someone and see what the situation is. And6 they're getting narratives of past events from7 witnesses, and they're acting on that. And nothing8 about this rule prevents them from doing that.9 But the admissibility -- for them to be able10 to come into court, and they alone to come into court,11 and say this is what this witness told me and this is12 what this witness told me and this is what this witness13 told me -- and by the way, defense counsel, those14 witnesses aren't going to be here today, and you're not15 going to be able to ask them what they meant by that or16 whether they were telling the truth.17 No. Mr. Bryant at this trial was never able18 to question Mr. Covington.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, but in the past20 that situation you are describing arose only where there21 was a hearsay exception. I would imagine most likely it22 would be the case of a confederate, someone who was part23 of the conspiracy. So if I think if that's going to be24 the case, that probably will be admissible where this25 has bite.51￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. VAN HOEK: Well -­JUSTICE BREYER: And there be some others, excited utterances, maybe another. Dying declarations are probably few and far between. Baptismal certificates -­MR. VAN HOEK: But the line this Court drew in Crawford and Davis -­JUSTICE BREYER: I know they did. And what I'm saying is I'm finding that -- it seems to me that that line, if taken literally, would keep out exceptions to hearsay testimony, which have been well established in the United States for 200 years. Baptismal certificates, statements of birth.MR. VAN HOEK: I don't believe that -­JUSTICE BREYER: Confederates is the one I come back to.MR. VAN HOEK: Those examples you just gave -- baptism -- are not statements made during police questioning. If we're talking about a -­JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. I forgot -­MR. VAN HOEK: The difference that made in Davis is that the -- the definition of testimonial is not across the board -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess it depends on what you mean by "in the past," as Justice Breyer put it.52Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Undoubtedly, under the regime of United2 States v. Reynolds, which was what, 25 years old -­3 when -­4 MR. VAN HOEK: Roberts.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Roberts. I'm sorry.6 MR. VAN HOEK: Roberts, which -­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No relation.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Roberts. I'm sorry.9 Roberts, which -- Reynolds was the Mormon case -- which10 was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided,11 yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it. But12 if by what you mean is in the past, Crawford examined13 the past, and its conclusion as to what the past said is14 quite different from what Justice Breyer now says,15 although he joined Crawford.16 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. I -- and as you said,17 in Crawford this Court looked at that and thought that18 the protections of the hearsay rule, and the focus under19 the Roberts standard of whether a statement fell within20 a firmly established hearsay rule, was not sufficient21 under the Constitution, under the Confrontation Clause,22 to -- to alleviate the fact that there -- there's no23 cross-examination.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Many -- I mean, like many25 cases there is language that takes -- that can take us53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 far afield from the subject matter before us. And I2 will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford.3 So I'm really asking about that scope and, in4 particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or5 to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping6 out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a7 co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent8 to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited9 in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.10 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, I'd have to go back to11 my answer that the Confrontation Clause is the primary12 law of the country, not State hearsay evidentiary rules.13 Many of the examples -- the co-conspirator -- the14 co-conspirator exception is not going to be applicable15 in many cases because those statements aren't made to16 police officers; they're made between co-conspirators in17 the course of a conspiracy. That's the foundational18 requirement.19 It's not going to eliminate hearsay rules.20 Statements made to private citizens, statements made in21 a lot of different circumstances are still going to be22 evaluated solely under hearsay rules because they're not￼23 going to be24 the product25defined as testimonial, because they're not of police -- police questioning.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm still trying to54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing2 emergency doctrine. Would it be fair to say that your3 idea is that the police have to have specific evidence4 that there is an immediate threat of physical violence5 that they want -- they need to respond to, in order for6 the ongoing emergency doctrine to apply?7 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes. Yes. They have to -­8 JUSTICE ALITO: And in a case of doubt, they9 can't do it. So if they don't know whether there is an10 immediate threat or not an immediate threat, then that11 doesn't fall within that exception. That's your idea?12 MR. VAN HOEK: My position is that where the13 witness has not provided any information to the police14 indicating that there's an immediate threat, either15 volunteered to the police or in response to questions16 from the police saying is there a threat? Where -- in17 this case, no questions were asked, where is Rick?￼1819 it. You -- 202122 questions.23 ask the questions, but whether, after they ask them, the24 answers can be introduced at trial.25 MR. VAN HOEK: Yes, and if the answers -- noJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they can always do you don't say they can't do it.MR. VAN HOEK: No, not at all.JUSTICE SCALIA: They can always ask the The only issue here is not whether they can55Alderson Reporting Company1 matter what2 a narrative3 testimonial4questions they asked, if the answers all are of past events, then that qualifies as because it is the -- the equivalent -­ JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you just said thatOfficial5 wasn't the test, past versus present. Didn't you say6 that about 10 minutes ago -- it's not the difference7 between something that's taking place and something that8 has taken place?9 MR. VAN HOEK: No. No. I think my answer10 was that -- that if the witness is declaring an11 emergency and telling the police that there is a -­12 JUSTICE ALITO: The witness has to say there13 is an emergency?14 MR. VAN HOEK: Not in those words but -- but15 in comparison to what the witness in Davis said, is that16 he's beating me up.17 JUSTICE ALITO: There's a shooting -­18 there's a report of shooting at a school, and the police19 go and they find two students lying on the ground. One20 is dead, and the other is severely wounded. And they21 ask the one who is wounded: Who did it? It's John22 Jones.2324 emergency. 2556￼Now, does that -- is that an ongoingMR. VAN HOEK: No.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: No?MR. VAN HOEK: No.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can he ask the witness-­OfficialJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that not an ongoing emergency? What would be an ongoing emergency?MR. VAN HOEK: Well, it would be -- it would be -- a statement from the -- from the witness at that point of the police officer asking him: Is John Jones here? Is he threatening you? Do you know where he is right now? Do you know what he is intending to do? And the answers are: Yes, he has a gun. He's right over there. He's going to shoot someone else. He said he was going to shoot someone else.That's different.JUSTICE ALITO: You have to have very specific information?MR. VAN HOEK: Because the -- the Petitioner's position here is that the situation itself, standing alone -­JUSTICE ALITO: What if there are three students who have been shot, four students who have been shot, but nobody says, well, I think he's still in the building, he may have an interest in shooting some more students?57￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. VAN HOEK: Well, certainly if the police come on the scene and there's multiple students who have been shot, you would think that if their primarypurpose -- if the primary purpose, if you take that asa test, that their primary purpose of questioning the witness is to determine whether there's an emergency, they're going to ask those questions.JUSTICE SCALIA: Would they ask his name? God, it's really important for us to know, four students on the ground. What's the name of the guy that did this?That's not the emergency.MR. VAN HOEK: No.JUSTICE SCALIA: They'd say: Where is he? JUSTICE ALITO: Of course that -- of coursethat's the emergency because how are they going to find the person that they -- that they're looking for if they don't know who it is? What if he's thrown away his gun? Of course, if they come upon him and he has his gun in his hand, then it's not a question. Bu what if he has disposed of it? They have to know who to -- who to go for.MR. VAN HOEK: And they can ask all of those questions. As Justice Scalia said, there's nothing in the -- in this Court's opinion in Davis or nothing in my58Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 position that prevents the police -­2 JUSTICE ALITO: But I still -- I'm totally3 puzzled now as to what you -- when you think there's an4 ongoing emergency and when there isn't.5 MR. VAN HOEK: I think there's an ongoing6 emergency -- that a statement relates -- would become7 nontestimonial relating to an ongoing emergency when8 there's some indication from the statement made by the9 witness that such -- that there's some immediacy.10 There's some request for assistance -­11 JUSTICE ALITO: It has to be made by the -­12 by the declarant? It can't be inferred from the13 circumstances?14 MR. VAN HOEK: No, I don't think just from15 the circumstances, because if you -­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure it can. If17 he says the principal did it. It's -- it's 10 o'clock18 in the morning; you assume the principal is at the19 school; and he says the principal did it. You can infer20 from the circumstances that he's referring to an ongoing21 emergency.22 MR. VAN HOEK: I don't -- I don't agree. I23 don't agree because if that's the case, any report -- as24 Justice Scalia I think said previously, any report of a25 past crime certainly raises the potential that a59￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 subsequent crime will occur. If that's the case, then2 -­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's quite4 different than saying, you know, this happened to some5 guy driving by, or something like that. If he says the6 principal did it, it's at 10 o'clock, it's in the7 school -- that suggests to me more, not that the dying8 student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that9 the principal was convicted, but that there's an10 emergency, something is happening.11 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, again, I think that if12 all it is that the principal shot someone before, that13 basically is I think the -­14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think there's15 a danger implicated by coming onto the lawn of a school16 and a student is there and says the principal shot me17 inside? You don't think that that suggests an ongoing18 emergency, that the principal is still inside with a19 gun?20 MR. VAN HOEK: Well, if they ask those21 questions and the principal is still inside and there is22 an indication that the -­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no. You24 don't want them to have to go through, you know, a whole25 list of questions while the student's there dying and60￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the principal is inside the building shooting people? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did he shoot you becausehe had a grudge against you, or is he just shooting -­ MR. VAN HOEK: No -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- blindly, and he sayshe shot me?MR. VAN HOEK: No. I'm not taking the position that they have to go through a whole list of questions before they can do anything. If you go in that a situation and a student says the principal shot someone, certainly nothing about the Davis rule stops them from immediately running into the school and determining if there's a situation there. But -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Ms. Palmer, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. PALMER: I'd just like to reiterate thatthe underlying principle, as this Court has said repeatedly in Crawford and in Davis, is formality, and that's what the purpose of any inquiry should be in looking at -- at the scene, whether there's an emergency or not, or declarant's view or not. It all comes down to formality akin to a magisterial examination. And I would also -­61Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go to formality.2 It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and3 everything a victim tells you is admissible. There has4 to be some emergency. That's what we've said.5 MS. PALMER: Right.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Correct? So the issue7 here is how do you define that dividing line between8 emergency and non, when the police officers are just9 asking questions that by their nature are always going10 to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try11 to use whatever is said later? So, in discerning the12 primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying you13 can't go by what the police officers are asking because14 they are going to be asking dual motive always. You15 have to look to what the declarant tells you. And is he16 or she telling you something that suggests an emergency?17 MS. PALMER: Well -­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's really the19 difference between the two of you, I think.20 MS. PALMER: Well, even if -- even if you21 take that view, that it's the declarant's purpose,22 objectively viewed, that controls, I think here it's23 difficult to see how Covington's purpose could have been24 to provide evidence any more than the 9-1-1 call in25 Davis. I think he was in shock from a bleeding wound.62￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 He didn't call the police. They came to him. You know,2 this wasn't even a 9-1-1 call where he sought them.3 They came to him. It's not clear who called, but it was4 not him.5 So even taking it from his point of view,6 it's -- it's difficult to see here how the purpose would7 have been anything other than, as he said, when is EMS8 coming to help me.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what10 you're saying. You mean he has to intend to provide11 evidence that he knows will be used at trial? I don't12 think that's the test.13 MS. PALMER: I don't agree with that, and -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's intending to accuse15 somebody.16 MS. PALMER: Well, I think here he's17 intending to seek help because he has been mortally18 wounded.19 Thank you.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.21 The case is submitted.22 (Whereupon,
