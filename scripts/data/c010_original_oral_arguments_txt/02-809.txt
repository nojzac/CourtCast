Joseph Jermaine Pringle. Mr. Bair.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:When the officer stopped the car respondent was riding in and found drugs packaged for distribution in the rear seat armrest, and then also found a large amount of cash in the glove compartment -QUESTION: What - the rear seat armrest was pushed up -          MR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: - and then the drugs were behind the - the armrest?MR. BAIR: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The rear seat armrest was pushed up against the rear seat. The officer merely folded it down and then the drugs appeared, and these are drugs that were packaged in five separate individual packages that were packaged for distribution at $20 a bag. The officer also found $763 in a rolled-up ball of cash in the glove compartment, and there - at thatPage 3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 time there was individualized probable cause that focused2 on all three people in that car, and this is so for three3   principal456   arrested,7reasons. First -QUESTION: At the end of the day, what happened? MR. BAIR: At the end of the day, all three were respondent confessed, and said the -QUESTION: And respondent was a front seat8 passenger? 9101112131415MR. BAIR: Yes, Justice O'Connor.QUESTION: He's the one who confessed?MR. BAIR: Yes.QUESTION: And was found ultimately guilty of - MR. BAIR: He was found -QUESTION: - some drug-related offense?MR. BAIR: He was found guilty both of possession￼16 and possession with intent to distribute.17 QUESTION: And the other two?18 MR. BAIR: The other two were not charged19 formally after respondent confessed. The officer made a20 discretionary decision not to charge the other two at the21 station house after respondent confessed to this crime.22 QUESTION: Do you say that there was probable23 cause for the arrest of all three at the time they were24   found?25             MR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.Page 4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9QUESTION: Was there probable cause sufficient to support charges at a preliminary hearing -MR. BAIR: I think there would have been. QUESTION: - against all three?MR. BAIR: I - yes, Justice O'Connor, I thinkthere would have been. I think, given the circumstances of this arrest, the mere fact that one of the three confessed doesn't ultimately determine that the other two were not culpable.MR. BAIR: I would say they're identical, YourQUESTION: So - so under - under that view, assume no confession, hypothetical case, under that view, these people, all of the three could have been bound over for trial?MR. BAIR: I believe so. I believe so.QUESTION: And under that view, any motion to dismiss prior to trial would have to be denied?MR. BAIR: I believe there would have been probable cause to charge and to take the cases to trial.QUESTION: And I suppose what happens in thatPage 5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Is there any additional requirement for establishing probable cause at a preliminary hearing above and beyond what's needed for the arrest, or are they identical, in your opinion?101112131415   Honor.16￼1718192021222324251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case is the judge says, and I want to tell you right up front I think this is a very skimpy case, you'd better come up with something - I guess that's the way it works -          MR. BAIR: I think so -QUESTION: But there's - but the - as Justice O'Connor said, it's probable cause and it's the same standard - excuse me - it's the same standard to bind over on arraignment as it is for the officer to arrest?MR. BAIR: My understanding from the case law, Your Honor, is that probable cause is probable cause, be it to search, to arrest, or it - I think it's a fluid concept, obviously depending on the exact context, and I'm not saying that a prosecutor would not exercise discretion as would a police officer in a given case not to take a case forward.QUESTION: Well, a preliminary hearing is largely a matter of Maryland law, isn't it, or State law?          MR. BAIR: It is and -QUESTION: I mean, is there any - any constitutional requirement that there be a preliminary hearing before a criminal case is tried?MR. BAIR: Not that I know of, Your Honor, no.QUESTION: Well, I take it even under the Constitution, if it's a Federal case, both the indictmentPage 6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 and the - or the information shows simply probable cause, 2   that's enough to bind over?3 MR. BAIR: I believe so, Justice Kennedy, I4 believe so. Now, in this case, of course, there was -5 QUESTION: But if you say it's fluid, that - that6 concerns me. I was somewhat puzzled by what the7 Government said in its brief, page 26 to 28, it says,8 well, you know, it's fluid, the prosecutor takes a second9 look and it - it sounds as if the prosecutor has a greater10 burden, but I - I'm not sure that that's the law.11 MR. BAIR: I'm not sure it's a greater burden. I12 think the prosecutor's decision, of course, is looking13 forward to trial where they know that they have to prove14 the case beyond a reasonable doubt. They know they have15 to get past a motion for judgment of acquittal. The16 police officer on the scene is making the same type of17 decision vis-a-vis probable cause but it's in a very18 different context. I think that's the difference.19 QUESTION: In your view, is this very fact-20 specific so that it might come out differently if the21 money and the drugs had been located in some little pocket22 next to the driver as opposed to some rear seat passenger23   or other passenger?24 MR. BAIR: I think one factor that would25 significantly change the totality of the circumstancesPage 7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼123 4- 56 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: - they were found very close to the driver, you know, sometimes there's a little pocket right next to -          MR. BAIR: In the door?QUESTION: - on the door, on the driver's side. Suppose it were there but you had a passenger in the front and in the rear. Any different result?MR. BAIR: Not in this case, no. I think - I think if - if the drugs are found in a common area of the passenger compartment of the car -QUESTION: How about the trunk?MR. BAIR: I think the trunk changes things a little bit, but of course you have to look at the totality of the circumstances, Justice Ginsburg.QUESTION: Why a little bit? I thought this whole case was predicated - your whole case was predicated on those drugs between the armrest and the backseat were accessible to all three people in that car.MR. BAIR: That's -QUESTION: Now, if you have something in a lockedPage 8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005here would be, for instance, if the drugs had been found on the person of one of the passengers.QUESTION: No, that wasn't my question. What if          MR. BAIR: If it had been -￼1 trunk, it 23 of course4 instance,5 the trunk6 think then there is a - the calculus changes in terms of7 totality of the circumstances, and I think if it were that8 situation, even though that particular evidence was in the9 trunk, I think there's still a - a strong inference thattruly is not accessible to the passengers.MR. BAIR: It certainly is not as accessible, and it's not as immediately accessible, but, forif there had been a large quantity of drugs in or if there had been a dead body in the trunk, I10 could be drawn that everyone in the car knew about it,11 because who would take the chance in terms of taking along12   innocent passengers -QUESTION: Well, let's stick to the five - these that were stuck in a Ziploc bag. The Ziploc bag trunk, not a dead body.MR. BAIR: I understand. I think in that case1314 five bags15 is in the1617 there would be a much closer case, it would be a much more￼18   difficult192021case vis-a-vis all three occupants of the car. QUESTION: But under -QUESTION: Okay, what about the -QUESTION: - under - under your view, if - if the a high crime area and some mother gets a ride22 car is in23 from her son who she perhaps doesn't know has been24 involved in drugs, then if drugs are found anywhere in25 that car, she's subject to arrest and - and sufficient forPage 9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 charge? 2345 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BAIR: Not - not -QUESTION: I mean, suppose it's at - in the middle of the day and she's going to the grocery store, we don't have it at 3:00 a.m. in an area where drugs are frequently sold. Does that enter into the calculus?MR. BAIR: I think it does, Your Honor. I think, obviously with - with - with the totality of the circumstances, anytime you change - and, of course, some of these are going to have more minor impact, some are going to have more major impact. But in this case you had, of course, 3:16 in the morning, three men who were roughly of the same age who appeared to be intimately connected with one another, you had the drugs and the money. I think here's a very strong case, but I agree, Justice O'Connor -QUESTION: What if there had been four people inthe car?MR. BAIR: I don't know that four people would change things.QUESTION: How about six?MR. BAIR: I think within the -QUESTION: Or what if it was a minivan and therewere eight in the minivan?          (Laughter.)Page 10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼123456   trial?78 9101112131415161718192021222324MR. BAIR: I think if you have identical circumstances to these in terms of the time, how well- acquainted they all appeared, the fact there was money, the fact that there were drugs packaged for distribution. It appeared to the officer, a reasonable inference, that there was a drug distribution common enterprise.QUESTION: But the distribution, as I understand it, was just enough to take care of a big party. There was no evidence that they were for sale, was there?MR. BAIR: Well, the evidence, at the time the officer made the arrest, I think he could draw an inference that there was cash proceeds perhaps of former drug sales, prior drug sales, and there were five individually packaged crack - hits of crack cocaine.QUESTION: And the charge was possession with intent to distribute, wasn't it?MR. BAIR: Yes, it was both simple possession and possession with intent to distribute, and he wasMR. BAIR: I'm not sure it changes it significantly, Your Honor. I think that the most significant -QUESTION: You think with eight people in the minivan you could arrest all eight and hold them over for￼25   convicted.Page 11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: How about if it had been a bus? Now, 2 we've gone from the sedan to the minivan, how about the 3 bus?45 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BAIR: I think a bus is different, Your Honor. I think a bus changes things significantly in the - in the context of, of course, the numbers of people are much greater, and then there's -QUESTION: Are you talking about a public bus or you're talking about a chartered bus?(Laughter.)MR. BAIR: I think that would affect obviously the totality of circumstances as well.QUESTION: What - what is - what is the rule that you're - there's the restatement hypotheticals - Restatement of Torts, where there's the dead body, two people are each accusing the other, and add - I don't know how the hypothetical would work - but add to the mix that only one could have done it. Can you arrest both?MR. BAIR: I think you can, Your Honor. I think both the Restatement of Torts, the Model Code of Pre- Arraignment Procedure, and just the - the nature of probable cause would permit that, because we're talking about -QUESTION: The Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure just talks again about probable cause?Page 12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BAIR: Same situation where you have, say, two people, only one of whom could be guilty of the crime. You could still have - you still would have probable cause to arrest both.QUESTION: But that's two people and here you've got three.QUESTION: What about three? I was going to ask, what about three?MR. BAIR: I think three is - is - QUESTION: You can arrest all three?MR. BAIR: I think so.QUESTION: What about five? You're going toarrest all five? Even - I mean, you know, it gets worse and worse -          MR. BAIR: Well, of course.QUESTION: - 10 percent chance, there are 10 of them now -          MR. BAIR: And - and -QUESTION: - so the chance that any individual one did it is 10 percent. That's still enough?MR. BAIR: I think we can't draw - the Court in Gates said that you cannot quantify probable cause. You have to - in those circumstances -QUESTION: It doesn't mean probable.MR. BAIR: No, it does not mean probable.Page 13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Clearly -QUESTION: Why do we call it probable cause? MR. BAIR: I'm not - I think there's a bit of amisnomer there, but clearly from the case law of this Court, it means a fair probability, it means something greater than reasonable suspicion under Terry -QUESTION: But if you had to reduce it to a percentage figure, what would you call the percentage required for probable cause?QUESTION: But it's less than 50, though, IMR. BAIR: I don't know that I could, Your Honor. I really don't know that it's useful to -10111213   gather?14MR. BAIR: Yes. Your - the cases of this Court has said -15161718   people?19 MR. BAIR: I think - I think three people clearly20 would be -21 QUESTION: And with four people it would be 2522   percent.  Is that enough?23 MR. BAIR: Probably, probably.24             QUESTION: Probably.25             (Laughter.)Page 14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: So that takes care of the two people in the room, but when you get down to 33-1/3 with three1 QUESTION: You - you agree - you agree that at2 some point the probability is - when the numbers of people3 present keep increasing, at some point the probability is4   going to be too slim?MR. BAIR: Yes, I agree with that. I agree with again, in Illinois v. Gates, this Court said we we cannot, it's not useful to try to quantify56 that, but7 will not,8 probable cause in that way, we still have to look at the9 totality of the circumstances beyond whether there are two10 people or three people or whatever.11             QUESTION: And one is -12 MR. BAIR: Of course, on the Government's theory13 I don't think it would matter, because they say you can14 infer a conspiracy, and I suppose then the whole bus could15 be in the conspiracy, but if it's an individual approach,16 which I think you're taking, then the number of people17   might make a difference.18 MR. BAIR: I think so. Now, of course, it would19 depend on - on the crime that the probable cause was going20 to. In this particular crime, of course, drugs can be21 jointly and constructively possessed, so clearly in this22 particular car, all three of the people could be guilty of23   the crime, not just one.24 QUESTION: Do you accept Justice Stevens'25 suggestion that your position might differ from thePage 15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Government here?MR. BAIR: I don't know that it does. I thinkour positions are basically the same.QUESTION: So - so you do think a conspiracy cangenerally - can be inferred as to all people in these - in the instance like this?MR. BAIR: In our case, absolutely, absolutely. In our case, clearly -          QUESTION: But if one of them -QUESTION: But you didn't argue the - excuse me - you didn't argue the conspiracy theory in the Statecourt, I don't think, did you?MR. BAIR: Well, I think we did, Your Honor. Ithink we argued in the State court that because drugs can be jointly and constructively possessed, that any one, two, or three of the individuals in the car were - were guilty of this crime.QUESTION: If you know nothing more than what you knowhere-Imean,Itakeitthatif-ifitwere undisputed that one of the three was a hitchhiker, you - you would not make the argument with respect to the10111213141516171819202122   hitchhiker?￼23 24 25MR. BAIR: I think if - if it's undisputed, and of course, that's going to be a difficult situation to - to know that there's no actual connection -Page 16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: That's the wonderful thing about being on the Supreme Court.MR. BAIR: If it's -QUESTION: You can make those assumptions.MR. BAIR: If it's undisputed, then I think thatsignificantly changes, because I think a lot - a core concept here is this notion of common enterprise, that when you have people in a car together, particularly a small passenger car, there's an inference, I think in this case a very strong inference, that all three of these people were engaged in a common enterprise. So -QUESTION: But do you have - do you need the -QUESTION: What if the car - what if the car included a driver and two hitchhikers and the drugs were found exactly as they were here, and there's obviously no common enterprise, would there be probable cause?MR. BAIR: I guess it would be - of course, that would be a more difficult case because you had the money in the glove compartment of the car and the drugs in the backseat of the car, so that -QUESTION: I'm not sure the money really adds anything to the analysis, to tell you the truth.          MR. BAIR: I think it adds -QUESTION: Because there's certainly nothing illegal about carrying money in the glove compartment,Page 17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 where it is illegal to carry drugs in the - behind the 2   seat - the armrest.3 MR. BAIR: Well, certainly the money without the4 drugs would be a - a different case than the drugs without5 the money. 6             QUESTION: But you -7 QUESTION: The hitchhiker - the hitchhiker8 example poses a question for the arresting officer,9 because does he have to accept the declaration of someone10 that I'm just a hitchhiker here?11 MR. BAIR: No, and - and that, of course, goes12 back to whether it's undisputed in some way, I don't know13 quite how it would be undisputed. You've always got the -14 the officer who on the scene is making a reasonable15 judgement from all the facts and circumstances, and one of16 those is, I don't have to believe the criminal or17 criminals in this car. I know there are drugs in the car,18 we have a known crime here being committed in the presence19 of the officer, possession or possession with intent to20   distribute drugs.21 QUESTION: Well, I'm still curious about the22 answer to my question. Assume the officer did accept the23 truth of the representation they were two - two24 hitchhikers picked up at different times, and maybe he was25 following the car, for instance, so he knew that was true,Page 18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9and then there's the driver and then there are drugs in the backseat just as there are here. Would there be probable cause in that case?MR. BAIR: Two - two answers to that, Justice Stevens. One, of course, is you would measure the probable cause by an objective standard and not by the subjective standard of that particular police officer. The other is -10111213141516171819202122232425   cause?QUESTION: But what is the answer?MR. BAIR: The other is, it could be that - QUESTION: I thought you were going to say thetwo answers were yes and no.          (Laughter.)MR. BAIR: It could be, Your Honor, that the - the driver knew the hitchhikers and that's why he picked them up. I mean, a lot of times people -￼QUESTION: No, no, no. I'm just assuming the only relevant facts are that it's undisputed they were two - two unrelated - they're three unrelated people, they're just entirely different backgrounds, one doesn't even speak English and one doesn't speak Spanish, but there are three of them in the car and the drugs are found exactly under the circumstances here. What I'm trying to say - if there were no conspiracy theory, would there be probablePage 19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BAIR: I think so, yes. Yes, I think there would be.QUESTION: You - you have - you really have to say that based on the dead victim hypothetical that you answered earlier.MR. BAIR: I think so, I think so, that - that if the, again, one - the other inference among the - the - the indicators of a common enterprise would be, I think it's unusual that several people are going to be taking a chance driving around, either with evidence of a murder or evidence of a drug conspiracy. They're not simply as a matter of reasonable inferences that an officer can draw, take the chance of having innocent people along.Unless there are any further questions, I - I'd reserve the remainder of my time.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bair.Mr. Srinivasan, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASANON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The totality of the circumstances apparent to the officer at the scene established probable cause for respondent's arrest. Of particular significance, thePage 20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 officer uncovered drugs that were packaged for2 distribution and that were concealed in the location in3 which they were readily discoverable by the other4   passengers.5 6 7 8 9QUESTION: Your brief reads to me - at about page 15 - to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in the passenger portion of the car.MR. SRINIVASAN: It's - we don't intend - QUESTION: Is that your position?MR. SRINIVASAN: We don't intend to suggest a10111213141516171819202122232425   statement.broad rule, Justice O'Connor.QUESTION: Do you agree that it is a totality ofthe circumstances test?￼MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, it's a totality of the circumstances test, and it will turn on contextual factors that are present in any particular case.QUESTION: Well, you do say at page 15, beginning of the first full paragraph, for these reasons, the discovery of an amount of narcotics suitable for distribution in the passenger compartment supports an inference that all of the car's occupants were aware of, and hence, involved with the drugs. That's a sweepingPage 21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, what - what we intend to2 say is that ordinarily when drugs that are packaged for3 distribution are found in a location in which they're4 readily discoverable by the other passengers, a reasonable5 officer can fairly conclude that there's a fair6 probability that each passenger is - is aware of the7 drugs, but of course in particular cases -8 QUESTION: But it - it might - wouldn't different9 factors enter into it? Suppose it's a young child -10 MR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.11 QUESTION: - in the vehicle, and it's in the12 middle of the day and they're dropping the child off at13 school or something. Are you suggesting there would14 nonetheless be this inference and the child could be15 hauled up and sent to the juvenile court?16 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The inference is tethered17 to the particular facts of this case. In cases that18 present different facts, for example, if a child was in19 the car of - if, as was earlier discussed, a hitchhiker20 were in the car, the probable - probable cause calculus21 would be different. But in this case there was no reason22 to suspect that any of the individuals was uninvolved in23 the possession of the cocaine. In fact, what's24 particularly significant in this case in our view is the25 location in which the drugs were found, because they werePage 22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 found wedged behind the rear seat armrest, which2 apparently is the type of armrest that's adjustable in an3 up or down position. The very purpose of that type of4 armrest is to give the passenger an option according to5 his preference whether the position - the armrest in one6 position or the other, so it's highly -7 QUESTION: The only evidence that supports the8 notion that some were uninvolved is that as soon as one of9 them confessed, the police immediately dismissed the10 charge against the other two, and therefore abandoned the11 notion that it was a common enterprise.12 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I - it - there's a - I13 think there's a different question concerning whether14 there was probable cause for an arrest and the15 determination by an officer whether to proceed with16 charges. Just because the officer -17 QUESTION: You'd think if the - if the backseat18 person or whoever it was that confessed had confessed19 while the officer was arresting him, there would have20 remained the probable cause as to the other two? Could he21 have said, I don't believe you, I'll take all three of you22 in anyway?23 MR. SRINIVASAN: There might well have been,24 Justice Stevens, because an officer's not required to25 believe the version of events that's given to him byPage 23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 people on the scene. It might well be the case that they2 have a coordinated plan in advance to pin the blame on a3 particular person as opposed to the other two, and an4 officer can take into account the totality of5 circumstances in making that type of assessment.6 QUESTION: May I - may I clarify whether you are7 indeed relying on common enterprise? I thought the view8 was it may or may not be a common enterprise, but here is9 a situation, drugs equally accessible, drugs accessible to10 any one of the three. We can't say whether all three or11 which one, so looking at the three, and we say, well, it's12 not more - not more likely the driver than the front seat13 passenger, who's there behind the money, or the backseat14 passenger, because any one of them could have pulled down15 that armrest. I thought that was your theory, not a - not16 necessarily a common enterprise.17 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice18 Ginsburg. It's not necessarily a common enterprise. It19 could be any one of the three or it could be all of them20 or some combination of the three of them, and the21 combination of those various scenarios rose to the level22 of a fair probability that respondent was involved with23 the cocaine. And as I was - as I was saying, that's24 particularly the case because they were concealed behind25 the armrest, which is a type of instrument thatPage 24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9affirmatively invites manipulation by a passenger, so if one of the occupants of the vehicle alone were responsible for carrying cocaine, it seems quite unlikely that he would have chosen the area behind the armrest as a place to conceal it from the other passengers.QUESTION: Do - do we demand the same standard from the arresting officer as we do from the district attorney who decides whether or not to proceed to preliminary hearing?MR. SRINIVASAN: The probable cause standard works the same. In both situations the question would be whether there's a fair probability. Now -1011121314151617   assessment?18 MR. SRINIVASAN: It's often the case that19 prosecutors will have more rigorous standards as a matter20 of internal - matter of internal guidelines. And for21 example, in the U.S. Attorney's manual, it dictates that22 prosecutors in the Federal system need to ensure that it's23 likely that they'll be able to obtain a conviction on -24 QUESTION: Well isn't - isn't that - that means25 the - the probable cause standard is the same, but thePage 25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: But - but do we demand a higher standard -MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's -QUESTION: - from either of them in making that￼1 prosecutor has an obligation to try to find out more and2 get more evidence before he goes forward. Isn't that the3   difference?4 5 6 7 8 9MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. The nature of the application of the probable cause standard is different in the prosecutorial stage because the prosecutor is identifying a particular offense, laying out the facts to support that offense, and the -21 22 23 24 25MR. SRINIVASAN: There's a different - there's a different question whether the evidence is sufficient to convict as presented by the prosecutor and whether the prosecutor has enough to go forward with the charges.QUESTION: No, but you're saying the prosecutor does not have an obligation to refrain from bringing aPage 26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: But the - but the standard - the standard that determines the - the - the degree of likelihood of inference, that is the same standard, whether we're talking about the police officer or whether we're talking about the district attorney later?10111213141516171819   court?20MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct. That remains constant in both scenarios.￼QUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying. You're saying it - it can get to the jury with no more than probable cause and should not be thrown out by the1 prosecution where he plainly on the face of it doesn't2 have enough evidence to convict?3 MR. SRINIVASAN: As long as there's probable4 cause to go forward, the prosecutor can go forward with 5   the charges.6 QUESTION: To say plainly on the face of it is7 something that a - a prosecutor is seldom confronted with.8 I mean, you've got different people telling different9 stories usually and it's usually a question of who's121314151617181920212223242510   believed.11MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and -QUESTION: Well, I'm assuming he has three people in the car and the chance for each of them is 33-1/3 percent -MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, he could go -QUESTION: - and he prosecutes one of them and he has nothing else. That's all he has, three people in the car, stuff in the back seat -MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's -QUESTION: - and he picks the passenger and brings a prosecution. The passenger, it could have been me, it could have been the other two, 33-1/3 percent.MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's - that's different from the facts of this case, but even assuming that itPage 27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 were an equal likelihood that each of them independently2 were involved in the offense, the prosecutor could go3 forward in that situation, but it's highly unlikely that4 he would go forward in that situation because - because5 he's unlikely to obtain to a verdict in his favor. So6 there's institutional incentives -7 QUESTION: And the district court probably would8 not let the case go to the jury if the motion was made at9 the end of the prosecution's case and this was all you10 had?11 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.12 QUESTION: The prosecution should - the13 prosecutor should bring cases which clearly will not be14 able to go to the jury?15 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not should bring cases -16             QUESTION: May, may.17 MR. SRINIVASAN: May, under the Constitution.18 QUESTION: Okay, that's not my understanding of19   the prosecutor's -20 MR. SRINIVASAN: And that's why, I think,21 prosecutors typically enforce upon themselves a more22 rigorous obligation than the probable cause standard.23 QUESTION: But we have no case saying that they24   may not proceed?25 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, there's no case that I'mPage 28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9aware of that says that they can't proceed where there's probable cause.QUESTION: But you just said the manual instructed them not to bring cases to trial.MR. SRINIVASAN: In - in the Federal system - QUESTION: Yes.MR. SRINIVASAN: - there's Federal guidelinesthat spell out when Federal prosecutors are supposed to bring cases to trial, but I'm not aware that that's required by Federal law or by the Constitution. Each prosecutor's office might have their own -101112131415161718192021   anyone.22QUESTION: Do you have readily at hand the - the citation to the manual?MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't - I don't have the particular provision.￼QUESTION: Of course, the - the manual wouldn't in any way bind Maryland authority.MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. Each prosecutor's office might have different standards.QUESTION: If - if the Federal manual bindsMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Well, the deficiencies23 in the Maryland court's probable cause analysis, we think,24 are particularly are apparent when one considers the25 implications for officers at the scene in circumstancesPage 29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 like this case, because apparently the up-shot is that2 officers either could arrest no one or that they could3 arrest the driver alone, and the latter situation seems4 unsound because perhaps the least likely scenario in5 circumstances like this case is that - that the driver was6 acting alone and carrying the contraband in the car,7 because if the driver in fact were acting alone, one might8 expect that he would conceal the contraband in a location9 in which it was not so readily discoverable by the other10   passengers.11 QUESTION: What about the respondent's position12 that your position means two innocent people may be locked13 up in jail, because suppose Pringle hadn't fessed up, and14 he exercised his right to remain silent. Then you might15 have a prolonged periods, assuming they couldn't make16 bail, three people stuck in the brig and two of them are17 innocent.18 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it's19 possible that innocent persons will be arrested and bound20 over in circumstances like in this case, but the probable21 cause standard accepts that possibility as the cost of22 ensuring the effective enforcement of the criminal laws.23 In fact, this Court reiterated in Wardlow recently that24 the probable cause standard accepts that innocent persons25 may be arrested on occasion. That's simply the cost of aPage 30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 functioning criminal justice system.2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan.3 Ms. Forster, we'll hear from you.4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY S. FORSTER 5   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT6 MS. FORSTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 7   please the Court:8 This is a unique case with highly unusual facts,9 and the reason it is unique is because of the facts - not10 because of the facts that exist so much in this case, but11 because of those that do not exist here. There was no12 testimony whatsoever in this case that Mr. Pringle had13 control over or knowledge of the drugs hidden in the back14   seat of the car -15 QUESTION: Ms. Forster, when you say testimony,16 you're not referring to any scheduled hearing or formal17   hearing, are you?18 MS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, what the court in19 Maryland reviews on appeal is the motion to suppress20 hearing, and at that hearing there was no evidence21 presented whatsoever that the officer in this case noticed22 any furtive movements by Mr. Pringle, any furtive23 gestures, that he said anything suspicious at the scene,24 or that he acted in any unusually nervous manner. All we25 have here -Page 31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, I thought we were considering2 this on the basis offered, which is the three people at3 3:30 a.m. in a high crime neighborhood in a sedan where4 there were a certain quantity of drugs behind the armrest5 and money in the glove compartment.6 MS. FORSTER: A few corrections, if I may, 7   Justice O'Connor -8 QUESTION: Three people in the car.9 MS. FORSTER: This is - 3:00 a.m. is accurate,10 3:16 a.m. It is in a residential area. This was not in11 fact a high crime area. And I think that under the12 totality of circumstances we have to put that in context,13 and the context is this, that it's 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday14 night with a car of three young men in their twenties in a15 residential area, and I think that anyone who has children16 of that age knows that often their Saturday night does not17 even begin until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m.18 QUESTION: Well, a lot of people wouldn't refer19 to children as being in their twenties, I think.￼(Laughter.)MS. FORSTER: Young adult children, Your Honor. QUESTION: You - you make an interesting opening that this is a highly unusual - we've - a lot of lot of these cases. It seems to me this happens20 21 2223 statement24 us read a25 all the time, that drugs in the car, the person says, it'sPage 32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 not mine. It seems to me that that's commonplace.2 MS. FORSTER: But what we have here with respect3 to Mr. Pringle is simply presence and nothing more. We 4   have no further -5 QUESTION: But isn't there - isn't there6 something more than presence here? Isn't the significance7 - isn't the significant evidence of this case something8 that appears when you contrast it with Houghton from a9 couple of years ago? Houghton, you had evidence that the10 driver of the car was a recreational, a personal drug11 user. We don't, I think, in this society, at least12 certainly today, assume that everyone who is in the13 company of a recreational drug user is also a drug user or14 an accessory to the first person's drug use. Here,15 however, what the police officer had was evidence, not16 merely of the time, but of - of three people in a17 relatively small car with commercial quantities of drugs,18 an amount of money that was enough to suggest that drug19 dealing was going on, and I think a - an inference was20 possible that someone in that car was dealing in the21 drugs.22 And it seems to me that the different inference23 that can be drawn about the others here as distinct from24 the inference in the Houghton case is, most drug dealers25 do not go around in their place of business, the car, withPage 33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425people who are totally innocent of drug activity - MS. FORSTER: If I -QUESTION: - and isn't that the basic difference between this and Houghton and doesn't that inference support - amount to probably cause?MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, if I - if I may, with respect to this being packaging - the drugs packaged that is indicative of sale or for distribution, there was absolutely no evidence in this record that this was anything inconsistent with personal use.QUESTION: Five - five crack cocaine hits?MS. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor. In fact, I think that there are a lot of crack cocaine addicts for whichthat isproblemmoney -a small amount of personal use.QUESTION: But is -QUESTION: How about a big roll of money?MS. FORSTER: And, Your Honor, also, there's awith the record in this respect with regard to￼QUESTION: Well, you pointed it out, but I think it - I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong here, I thought that it was - it was - the evidence was, regardless of how he first described the quantity that he saw, I thought the evidence came out that there was 700 and some odd dollars in it, so I think the judge could infer that it was fairlyPage 34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9- a fairly sizable roll of bills.MS. FORSTER: Justice Souter, the actual amountdid not come out until the trial. That never came out at the motion to suppress hearing, and in fact, the amount of money was never characterized at the motion to suppress hearing by the officer who testified, other than to say he saw the sum of money, that's all.QUESTION: And what is in - and it was in the glove compartment?MS. FORSTER: It was concealed in the glove 11 compartment?101213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: And it was open, it wasn't in a wallet or something like that?          QUESTION: A roll of bills.MS. FORSTER: We don't - we don't know. In fact, the officer who - Officer Snyder, when he testified at the motion to suppress hearing, simply said that when Mr. Parlo, the driver of the automobile, went to retrieve his license and registration from the glove box, that is when I saw the money.QUESTION: So it's reasonable -QUESTION: But he - he must have seen it in the form of a - a roll of bills or something, rather than, as Justice Souter said, just not in a wallet.MS. FORSTER: The record is unclear.Page 35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   money.9 QUESTION: Do you have a roll of bills exposed in10 your glove compartment?11 MS. FORSTER: At times I do, Your Honor.12             QUESTION: You do?13             MS. FORSTER: Yes.14 QUESTION: You better be careful if you do.15             (Laughter.)16 MS. FORSTER: I might also point out that at the17 actual trial, the expert who did testify for the State18 with regard to the - whether or not this was an intent to19 distribute - testified that without Mr. Pringle's20 confession and this statement, he could not in fact say21 that this was consistent with an intent to distribute22   based solely -QUESTION: Well, but, I mean, you - you don't have to have been born yesterday to decide that.MS. FORSTER: Well, the - Your Honor, I guess the point is, is that all that was before the trial - the trial judge at the motion to suppress hearing - there was never any characterization of the denomination, the amount, nothing, just the only thing that was said was the￼2324 would you25 there wasQUESTION: So it was at least possession. So concede that a crime - in the officer's presence evidence of the commission of a crime?Page 36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. FORSTER: Yes.QUESTION: Then - so the officer says, I know that a crime has been committed. In the whole world there are only three possible people who could do it. What instruction would you give to the officer on the scene who knows that a crime has been committed, there are three possible people, but he can't say which? Is it the answer that he can make no arrest?MS. FORSTER: No, that's not the answer. QUESTION: What arrest can he make?MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, in this case, theofficer could arrest Mr. Parlo, the driver of the automobile, because I think it is universally accepted that we can impute the driver owner of an automobile with the knowledge that he knows what is in his car and he has exclusive control over that which is in his car. So the officer here should have arrested Mr. Parlo.          QUESTION: And no one else?MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, I would suggest that perhaps - I mean, and of course, this is not the issue before the Court, that perhaps because of Mr. Smith, the backseat occupant, may also have been arrested given that the nature of an armrest is not really a normal repository that one would place personal items in -QUESTION: So maybe - definitely the driver,Page 37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1   maybe the234backseat passenger -MS. FORSTER: Maybe Mr. Smith.QUESTION: - but not the one who in fact -MS. FORSTER: But definitely -QUESTION: - who in fact committed the crime. MS. FORSTER: Definitely not Mr. Pringle, but of5 67 course, if we're going to use Mr. Pringle's confession in8 determining in hindsight, we need not have -QUESTION: If this were - if this were a bus or a a theater or some of the examples, then itwould unreasonable to assume that the front seat could reach back to the last row of the theater. this was a small car. It isn't hard for910 tavern or11 certainly12 passenger13 But here,14 somebody in the front seat to turn around and push down15   the armrest.16 MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that17 - that perhaps it would not be difficult, given the18 compact nature of this car. However, there was no19 testimony that in fact that anyone saw Mr. Pringle do20 that, number one, and number two -21 QUESTION: Well, that's because they - they￼22   didn't have a23   at the scene.buy committed in the presence of the officerFORSTER: Well, I - I understand that, YourPage 38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200052425 Honor.MS.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: I mean, I don't know why that counts against -MS. FORSTER: Well, my second response would be this, that I think that it would be highly unreasonable that Mr. Smith, the backseat passenger, would allow Mr. Pringle to turn around and store the drugs in the armrest right next to him.          QUESTION: Why?QUESTION: Ms. Forster, the Maryland Court of Appeals, which ruled in your favor, says, during the search Officer Snyder seized $763 from the glove compartment, so they are - they accepted that as a fact.MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, the Maryland - with all due respect, the Maryland Court of Appeals made a mistake in this case because what they said in their opinion -QUESTION: Well, but no, we take the facts as the lower court found them. I mean, I don't think it will do to say that the court of appeals is wrong on the facts.MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, what the court of appeals incorrectly did in this case was - and they dropped a footnote to suggest that it was unclear to them whether or not there was a separate motion to suppress hearing or whether there was a combined motion to suppress trial proceeding. In fact, that's incorrect. There was a separate motion to suppress hearing.Page 39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But the - but they nonetheless say that Office Snyder seized $763.MS. FORSTER: That's true, Your Honor, and for purposes of Mr. Pringle's position, the fact that that money is concealed, really it makes no difference the amount. However, if the - as the petitioner and the U.S. Solicitor find the amount to be significant, I think we should have a clearer record.QUESTION: Why - why did you say the driver, I mean, on your theory? I think it would be harder for the driver who's driving along to put the bags back in the backseat than it would be for the passengers.MS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Breyer, that assumes that the driver did not put it there before he picked up his passengers.QUESTION: Well, if he put it there before, wouldn't they all know it was there?MS. FORSTER: I don't think so, Your Honor. If it's - if it's sandwiched between the armrest as it's pushed up against the seat, no, I don't.QUESTION: But the driver consented to have the car searched, so one might think, my goodness, if he knew there were drugs there, why did he say yes when he could have said no?MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I can tell you asPage 40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 a criminal defense lawyer that defendants consent all the2 time when3 drugs are45 cases that you relied on is the Di Re case. Your answer6 to me was, arrest the driver. There, the informer had7 fingered the driver, so the police knew that they had the8 right man when they arrested the driver. Here, it isn't9 at all like Di Re because the driver may or may not havethey have a car full of drugs and they know the there. It's not unusual and it -QUESTION: This is not like the - one of the10   been the right person.11 MS. FORSTER: Except that - how this case is12 similar to Di Re is that in Di Re this Court held that if13 the act - the criminal activity, the ongoing criminal14 activity, is not visible to the occupants, the mere15 presence is not enough on which to have probable cause to16 arrest. And here we have concealed drugs and nothing more17 than Mr. Pringle's presence in the front seat.18 QUESTION: But there - there's - there's another19 difference. The drugs are not locked up in the trunk.20 They are at a place where the backseat person could push21 it down. There wasn't a serious attempt to hide those22   drugs securely.23 MS. FORSTER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree with24 that. But however, that would only point more closely to25 Mr. Smith, the backseat person sitting directly next toPage 41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the armrest, not to Mr. Pringle, the front seat passenger.2 QUESTION: Well, except if - if you accept the3 proposition that the - that there probably was a roll of4 bills visible in the glove compartment, Mr. Pringle was5 within easy reach, not even arm's reach of the rolled6 bills.7 MS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Souter, the - the8 problem with that, of course, it's pure speculation, but9 we don't even know if this glove compartment was locked or10 unlocked. What we know is that it was opened by the11 driver at the time he was asked to retrieve his license12 and registration. Whether he had to unlock that glove13 compartment is not clear at all for the record.14 QUESTION: Well, we - we don't know that and we15 don't know whether the armrest had come down during the16 time the backseat passenger was there. There are lots of17 things at a probable cause stage that one does not know,18 but the very fact - if - if we're going to talk - if we're19 going to find it significant that something is within20 reach of one of the passengers or not, I would have21 supposed that for probable cause purposes, the fact that22 the money was in reach was a relevant fact.23 MS. FORSTER: But, Your Honor, I - I think that24 if we want to speculate that perhaps then we could say25 that that would be enough, but probable cause requires farPage 42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 more than speculation. It requires a fair probability, at2 least of complicity, and we simply don't have the facts in3 this case that would support that fair probability with4 respect to Mr. Pringle, because all the record shows is5 that Mr. Pringle was present in a car where drugs were 6   found hidden.7 And if I may address the common enterprise8 theory that both the petitioner and the U.S. Solicitor9 relies on in this case, the problem with the common10 enterprise theory is that the cases that they cite in11 support of that involved ongoing criminal activity that12 was conducted in plain view. You have the Ulster County13 case, where the Court found that the weapons, one of which14 was described as as large as a cannon, that was in plain15 view of all of the occupants of the car. And in the16 Houghton case - so it was reasonable in the Ulster County17 case, or if that had in fact been the issue in that case,18   which it was not -19 QUESTION: Those I just think that - look, it20 just doesn't strike me as plausible that when you have21 three people in a car, one of them would stuff some drugs22 behind an armrest where they're very easy to find, unless23 he thought the other two were in on it, I mean, unless you24 thought the other two at least didn't care, and if they25 didn't care they're out there transporting the drugs withPage 43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 them. 2345 6 7 8 9          MS. FORSTER: Well -QUESTION: So - so how - I don't even know, I mean, what I'm struggling for is, that seems like a reasonable inference so how - how do I know, I mean, I'm making this kind of inference. How do I know whether I should or not?MS.

Why - you'd have to be crazy to be stuffing crack into a car like that without thinking your friends are - have - don't give a damn at the very least -MS. FORSTER: But certainly -QUESTION: - and probably are in on it. QUESTION: But certainly, I think that even ifthey - he does that in the view of Mr. Pringle, that - so that Mr. Pringle has knowledge that the drugs were shoved in the armrest - that certainly does not also go to the next level, which is that Mr. Pringle possesses those drugs. I may see one - a passenger -QUESTION: Would - would - would the - the officer at that point then be able to say, ah, but, in anyPage 44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9case I could arrest the other two because they'reharboring a felon? In other words, you said could maybe arrest the ones who sitting next other, since the drugs are barely concealed?MS. FORSTER: Well, no, Your Honor, - I was not clear.that you tothe-theI - perhaps IQUESTION: Here's what she's thinking, and there might be a million different crimes. You say to the front seat passenger, everything's the same, but you say to the front seat passenger, Mr. Front Seat Passenger, did you know that there were drugs down there in the armrest? And he says yes, and that's all he says. I would imagine he could be arrested then, couldn't he?MS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, I -QUESTION: You couldn't arrest him then?MS. FORSTER: I don't think he could be arrested. QUESTION: For transporting the drugs or helping10111213141516171819   something?20￼21 22 23 24 25MS. FORSTER: Well, certainly if he's the front seat passenger and not the driver he's - he's along for the ride. He's not necessarily the person transporting -QUESTION: Well, he doesn't say anything. We don't know anything about it. He just says, sure I knewPage 45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005to transport them or being an accessory or doing1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9there were drugs back there, that's all.MS. FORSTER: Under those circumstances, YourHonor, I think you'd have a much closer case. QUESTION: No, no, but - but no, look, eitherthere is a crime of being in a car knowing that or there isn't. Is there or not? I don't know.MS. FORSTER: Well, the crime of possession requires not just knowledge, but it also requires the intent to exercise dominion and control over the drug.MS. FORSTER: Yes. That would -QUESTION: All right. But that's -MS. FORSTER: - there would have to be someQUESTION: All right, so - so you'd have to then make an inference that a person who says, yes, I knew the drugs where there, was also going to help later on.101112131415161718   either?19￼reasonable inference -QUESTION: And you think that's not reasonableMS.

FORSTER: No, Your Honor, nor at the trial. Only Officer Snyder testified at the motion to suppress hearing for the State.If I may go back to the common enterprise theory, as I said, the cases that the State and the U.S. Solicitor rely on here involved criminal activity conducted in plain view, and - which, from which an officer could reasonably infer, I think, a common nefarious enterprise. We have a - less than one gram of cocaine in this case that is hidden, hidden, concealed in the backseat armrest, and secondly, again, with respect to this being a commercial quantity of drugs, there is simply nothing in the record that supports that. This was -QUESTION: Well, it was in separate littlepackets, right?MS. FORSTER: Yes, it was, but that, again - QUESTION: A kind that people would buy for asingle dose?MS. FORSTER: That, again, your Honor, is notinconsistent with personal use, and certainly I should think that if this police -QUESTION: Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not? I mean, we're not dealing only with intent to distribute but -Page 47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MS. FORSTER: That - that is correct. The charge was possession -QUESTION: Pure possession is what -MS. FORSTER: - and possession with intent. QUESTION: Well, to say it's not inconsistentwith personal use, I don't think gets your client totally off the hook, because something can be both consistent with personal use and consistent with commercial intent. You know, something can - you can infer both ways.MS. FORSTER: However, Justice Rehnquist, here this amount is not indicative of an operation that requires the participation of more than one person. This is an amount that, if it's for sale, it's for sale -10111213141516   compartment?17 MS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, I think then it18 would still require speculation on the part of this police19 officer to assume that one was connected to the other. I20 think that the only common enterprise that reasonablyQUESTION: But - but how about the combination of that with the - with the $763 roll in the glove￼21 could have been inferred from the facts of this case is a22 common enterprise to go from one destination to another23 and nothing more than that, and given the concealed nature24 of the drugs in this case, the lack of any suspicious25 activities on Mr. Pringle's part, and the lack of, I Page 48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005123456789   remaining.think, any reasonable inference pointing to complicity that he possessed the hidden drugs, the Maryland Court of Appeals in this case correctly held that there was no probable cause to arrest Mr. Pringle, and this ruling should be affirmed.QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Forster.MS. FORSTER: Thank you.QUESTION: Mr. Bair, you have 4 minutes10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER12 MR. BAIR: Thank you, Your Honor. I just wanted13 to first clarify any record inconsistencies or - or14 clarifications that might be in order. I believe that the15 court of appeals' opinion, which is at appendix page 3A to16 the petition for cert, makes very clear that the court of17 appeals, the highest court in Maryland, construed the18 record as the officer seeing a large amount of money19 rolled up in the glove compartment, and it totaled $763.20 That is clearly stated in the court of appeals' opinion,21 and I would direct the Court's attention to the trial22 transcripts at pages 83 to 84. It is not in the joint23 appendix but it is in the record in the case, the trial24 transcript pages 83 to 84 from the trial on April 10th of25 2000. The police officer who arrested respondentPage 49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 testified at the trial that he saw a large roll of money2 in the glove compartment and that it totaled $763, so3 clearly there is record support and the court of appeals4 so found.5 With regard to the glove compartment being6 closed or locked, there's nothing in the record ever7 indicating that the glove compartment was locked. I think8 the only natural inference from this record is that it was9 closed at the time the car was stopped. The officer saw10 the drug - excuse me - saw the money in the glove11 compartment when the driver went to retrieve his vehicle12 registration, and then after the officer obtained consent13 to search14 again and1516 suggested17 driver should always be arrested. I think that's18 absolutely inconsistent with this Court's Fourth Amendment19 law. In closing, unless the Court has any questions -the car, he then opened the glove compartment seized the money.I think it's ironic that the rule that is being by respondent is the bright line rule that the￼QUESTION: Yeah, I do have one -MR. BAIR: Yes.QUESTION: - which is, I think she said, look, three possible inferences. One is that thehad nothing to do with it, didn't know about it.20 21 2223 there are24 passenger25 Two is, everybody knew about it but that's all. AndPage 50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 three, they knew about it and wanted to help sell the2 drugs. All right. Now, she says, one plus two are so3 great that three isn't probable cause, but about, at least4 two. 5678910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Two - two isn't a crime, I mean, if they just all knew about it?MR. BAIR: Your Honor, I think all - the nature of probable cause is that the officer is entitled to accept under the totality of the facts any of those inferences. I think any - any -MR. BAIR: Under Maryland law, they have to have an intent to exercise control over the drugs. If they simply knew about it, that would not be enough for a conviction, but I think -QUESTION: It has to be all three - it has to bethree is great enough, so despite one plus two - okay. MR. BAIR: Yes, but I think for probable cause purposes, clearly that would be sufficient. Thank you,Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bair.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)Page 51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼
