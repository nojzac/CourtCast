OLSON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please1011121314151617181920212223    store.24              QUESTION:  But it's different than Freedman, in25    the sense that Freedman was expressly designed to permitthe Court:          This case is controlled by the interaction offour principles, all designed to eliminate the danger ofcensorship by delay, from this Court's decisions on speechlicensing schemes.  First, in order to comply with theFirst Amendment, a speech licensing scheme that acts as aprior restraint must guarantee an applicant a prompt finaladministrative decision in a short, fixed period of time.because it requires a license to operate an adult bookQUESTION:  Mr. Olson --MR. OLSON:  Yes.QUESTION:  -- is this a speech licensing scheme?MR. OLSON:  It is a speech licensing scheme31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9or not permit speech based solely on its content.          MR. OLSON:  You're correct.          QUESTION:  And it seems to me this is not thatat all.  I recognize the analogy, but Freedman is notdirectly controlling, it seems to me.          MR. OLSON:  You're right that the Waukeshaordinance doesn't permit licensing decisions on its faceto be made on the basis of content, but the Court Ibelieve has recognized in City of Lakewood and in FW/PBSthat licensing decisions that are not expressly content-based can still be used for covert content-based101112    censorship.13141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Are you claiming that any of thereasons that were given -- this is a case of a licensethat was in existence, and it was -- it's a nonrenewalcase, right?          MR. OLSON:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And the nonrenewal was based onviolation, alleged violation of the terms of the license.Are you contesting that any of those terms, like no minorson the premises, open booths, that any of those termsviolate the First Amendment?          MR. OLSON:  Not in this case.  We will do thatin some future case, but we have not made that argument inthis case and we don't think the Court should reach that4 1    argument in this case.  This is a case about procedures, 2    not about the substantive disqualification criteria. 3              QUESTION:  I suppose a book store, or a 4    newspaper has to -- they're in a building, and I guess 5    they can't have holes in the floors and unsafe electricity 6    and maybe they wouldn't be able to run a business if they 7    did. They don't have to meet -- for that safe electricity 8    or working conditions and so forth there isn't some 9    special test, is there?10              MR. OLSON:  Oh, all of those laws of general11    application that don't act as prior restraints targeted at12    speech can be enforced.13              QUESTION:  How are the violations here targeted14    at speech?  I believe that the accusation was they were --15    involve conduct, nothing to do with speech in the books in16 the store.17              MR. OLSON:  They're targeted at speech in the18    sense that they're tied to the license, and they're tied19    to the permission to continue your ongoing speech.20              QUESTION:  Well, so you have a book store, and21    it says you can have a license to sell a book store, open22    your book store provided there isn't electricity running23    all over the floor and electrocuting people.24              MR. OLSON:  Those --25              QUESTION:  Is that then subject to some special5 1    test because it's a book store? 2              MR. OLSON:  If the requirement to have the 3    electricity only applies to book stores, yes, it would be 4    subject to the Freedman guarantees.  If it applies to 5    everybody, as all those building code requirements do as 6    far as I know, then they're not subject to the Freedman 7    guarantees, and that's what the Court said in Lakewood. 8              The second principle that I think controls the 9    Court's disposition of this case is that a speech10    licensing scheme violates the First Amendment if it11    permits the status quo to be altered to the applicant's12    detriment during the administrative proceedings.13              QUESTION:  How do you get that from Freedman,14    because Freedman, the status quo was no speech.  That is,15    the Court said you must have a graphic procedure, because16    you're not allowing someone to speak.  Here, a speaker has17    been permitted to speak, has a license, and the question18    is whether it will be renewed.  So --19              MR. OLSON:  That's --20              QUESTION:  So you're asking for, the continued21    speech is the status quo, as distinguished from Freedman,22    where no speech was the status quo.23              MR. OLSON:  That's absolutely correct.  In24    Freedman and in Southeastern Promotions the Court said25    that a prior restraint before judicial review can be6 1    imposed only where it maintains the status quo. 2               Where the status quo is speech, obviously you 3    can't impose a prior restraint prior to judicial review, 4    and in the tail-end of Southeastern Promotions the Court 5    listed the constitutional deficiencies with the law at 6    issue there, and one of the deficiencies listed was that 7    it permitted the status quo to be altered to the 8    applicant's detriment before judicial review. 9              QUESTION:  That was another Freedman-type case,10    wasn't it, where the performance could not go on under the11    existence.12              MR. OLSON:  It was a new speech case, that's13    correct, but I believe the Court found that the status quo14    was altered to the applicant's detriment because the show15    in the presentation of Hair in Southeastern Promotions had16    to be postponed and they lost their date for the17    presentation.18              We believe that the third principle governing19    this case is that a licensing scheme that acts as a prior20    restraint must confer upon an unsuccessful applicant the21    right to prompt judicial review, and the fourth principle22 is that --23              QUESTION:  Do you really -- is that really your24    principle?  As I understand your case, it's not prompt25    judicial review as such, as was the case in Freedman, but 1    here you would be delighted to have delayed judicial 2    review as long as you keep your license until judicial 3    review is over, so what you're really saying, it's not a 4    question of prompt, it's a question of until the end of 5    the judicial road, however long that road is, your license 6    can't be revoked. 7              MR. OLSON:  We believe that's what Southeastern 8    Promotions requires, and we believe that's the only way to 9    prevent injury from lack of prompt judicial review.10              QUESTION:  But then if that's the case it's11    nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review.12    It's simply that you retain your license until judicial13    review is over, however long it takes.14              MR. OLSON:  It's right that that's the rule15    we're urging the Court to find in Southeastern Promotions16    and FW/PBS and apply in this case, but it's wrong to say17    that it has nothing to do with the promptness of judicial18    review, I think, because the question on which the Court19    granted certiorari is does the licensing ordinance have to20    contain language to prevent injury from want of prompt21    judicial review, and the only way to prevent injury from22    want of prompt judicial review when you're enacting city23    licensing ordinance is to maintain the status quo,24    guarantee the status quo --25              QUESTION:  But that can be done by the court.8 1    If that's constitutionally required, as you say, when you 2    have the ordinance providing for prompt commencement of 3    judicial review, what would go along with the prompt 4    commencement of judicial review is the ability of the 5    court, indeed the obligation of the court, if the 6    Constitution is as you say it is, to immediately issue a 7    stay order preventing the cancellation of the license. 8              Why isn't that sufficient?  Why does it have to 9    be in the statute if you provide for judicial review and10    if, as you tell us, the court having judicial review must11    maintain the status quo?12              MR. OLSON:  Justice Scalia, it's not sufficient13    for five reasons.  First, the timing of that sort of14    temporary relief is in the discretion of the circuit court15    and can depend on lots of factors, including docket16    pressure --17              QUESTION:  Not if it's constitutionally18    required, as you tell us.  You tell us that the status quo19    has to be maintained.  If that's so, you have a -- you20    know, a lock on a stay order from the court as soon as the21    case gets there.22              MR. OLSON:  Well, that really depends on what23    this Court says in this case.  If the Court says in this24    case, as we urge it to say, that the status quo through25    judicial review must be guaranteed, then I suppose we9 1    could go into circuit court and get on the schedule for a 2    motion and have the judge receive briefs and decide our 3    motion and, after a period of time, issue an order 4    implementing this Court's decision. 5              QUESTION:  It would also mean that you've 6    brought this case before you have any reason to believe 7    you've been harmed. 8              MR. OLSON:  No. 9              QUESTION:  I mean, why should we pronounce that10    advisory opinion?  If it is indeed the case, as you say it11    is, that the court must issue a stay order, why can't we12    await that event?  If and when a court doesn't issue a13    stay order, then you've been harmed.14              MR. OLSON:  I don't think that a stay order, the15    possibility of a stay order in the circuit court is an16    adequate substitute for Freedman safeguards, including17    maintenance of the status quo as written into the18    ordinance.19202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, the supreme court of Wisconsinheld -- was it the supreme court, or the court of appeals?          MR. OLSON:  Court of appeals.          QUESTION:  The court of appeals held that whatyou're asking for was not required here, didn't it?          MR. OLSON:  The court of appeals believed thatthe status quo would be maintained through the101    administrative proceedings automatically, and the court of2    appeals held that it wasn't necessary to maintain the3    status quo through the termination of judicial4    proceedings.5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  So under that holding, if you wentinto the Circuit Court of Waukesha County you might get astay and you might not.          MR. OLSON:  Well, we wouldn't have much of aclaim on a stay today except by making the arguments fromFreedman and Southeastern Promotions that we're makinghere today.          QUESTION:  Well, couldn't you argue that theadministrative determination by the city was arbitrary orcapricious?  Isn't that a ground for judicial review of anadministrative order?          MR. OLSON:  We could.  That would be an argumentgoing to the merits of the claim and, of course, it wouldbe relevant to the issuance of a stay, because we have toshow probability of success.          QUESTION:  Your position basically is, eventhough your claim substantively has no merit, you're stillentitled to an automatic stay.          MR. OLSON:  I don't even get to whether we'reentitled to an automatic stay in my thinking, because Idon't think that the possibility of a stay being imposed111    in a discretionary manner in the circuit court is2    sufficient to satisfy Southeastern Promotions, Freedman,3    FW/PBS.4567    license.8              MR. OLSON:  Or some provision is9    unconstitutional.10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yes, all right, you say this, we havea claim on the merits, and you say, judge, decide it.Decide it before we have to close down.  Now, if they do,it's fine, right?  You have no complaint as long as thejudge decides your claim on the merits before you have toshut the door.          MR. OLSON:  In an as-applied challenge thatwould be correct, but this is a facial challenge.          QUESTION:  No,  but I'm not saying about thiscase.  Suppose it was always true that the judges woulddecide on the merits before anyone had to shut the door.          MR. OLSON:  If that were always true, then --          QUESTION:  No problem, all right.          MR. OLSON:  -- the court wouldn't have to worryabout a specific guarantee --          QUESTION:  Fine, then why aren't you better off,12          QUESTION:  It is sufficient if they decide yourcase -- if the circuit -- you have some claim on themerits.  You say they're arbitrary in taking away my 1    not worse off, if the court decides a stay before you have 2    to shut down, for after all, a court will give you the 3    stay as long as there's a reasonable probability of 4    success, but the court will allow you to stay open on the 5    merits only if you're right. 6              MR. OLSON:  Getting that stay does require us to 7    show a reasonable probability of success on the merits. 8              QUESTION:  But to win, you have to win, so 9    you're easier -- it's easier for you to get the stay than10    it is to win.11              MR. OLSON:  Not -- not really, in terms of12    timing especially.  We can't show a reasonable probability13    of success on the merits in an administrative review until14    that administrative record gets to the court, and there's15    no time limit on that under the unamended ordinance.16              QUESTION:  This case has an air of unreality to17    it, because in fact your client did get a stay until the18    end of the judicial road without making a showing of19    probability of success on the merits and, in fact, the20    entire case has been now adjudicated on the merits, is21    that not so?22              MR. OLSON:  That's correct, and we have no as-23    applied challenge here.  This is strictly a facial24    challenge case.25              QUESTION:  But isn't it also have an air of13 1    unreality because your client is not in business any more 2    and doesn't intend to go back into business, as I 3    understand the proceedings. 4              MR. OLSON:  Our client is still just barely in 5    business operating as a nonadult store, and intending to 6    close even that operation within a matter of days, but as 7    we pointed out in our brief -- 8              QUESTION:  Why isn't the case moot? 9              MR. OLSON:  The case isn't moot because there's10    a disability from licensure that flows from having11    violated the ordinance by operating without a license,12    which I told them they were entitled to do under13    Shuttlesworth, because --14              QUESTION:  But there's a disability for15    licensure for a business he has no intention of engaging16    in, as I understand it.17              MR. OLSON:  Well, there's no showing that they18    intend to engage in this business, or that they have not19    applied for a new license and they don't have an20    application pending now, but they haven't foresworn any21    intention to apply for a license at some other location in22    the future.23              QUESTION:  I have the impression -- I may be24    unfair to you -- that you may be representing interests25    other than the named party to the case here.14 1              MR. OLSON:  Not -- my client has a real, 2    concrete interest in having a facially valid, 3    constitutional ordinance on the book in Waukesha.  City 4    News and Novelty and its officers have real interests in5 that -- 6              QUESTION:  Sufficient interest to finance 7    extensive litigation in the United States Supreme Court. 8    I guess that's the answer, right, and of course he's 9    paying the bills, I suppose.10              MR. OLSON:  Yes.  The City News and Novelty is11    footing the bill for this case because they believe12    they're right, they believe in it's important principle,13    and they don't want the 5-year disability from licensure14    that will fall on the corporation and its officers.  If15    they're determined to have been operating without a16    license in violation of a valid ordinance up until17    February 14, 2000, which is when they stopped operating as18    an adult book store, they'd be disabled from licensure in19    Waukesha for 5 years after that, until Valentine's Day20 2005.21              QUESTION:  That disability has nothing -- I22    mean, that disability has something to do with a defect in23    the system that might have produced a merits decision that24    was contrary to the facts, or contrary to the law, but I25    don't see how that disability has anything to do with the15 1    question of timing that you're now bringing before us.  I 2    mean, if, indeed, your client was properly found to be in 3    violation of the substantive provisions of the ordinance, 4    then it seems to me he deserves to be disabled from future5 licensing. 6              What does that have anything to do with the 7    timing question of, you know, he has to be allowed to 8    continue operation before the adjudication is made?  I 9    mean, I see that you have some continuing interest, but10    it's not an interest that depends at all upon the issue11    that you're bringing before us here.12              MR. OLSON:  Justice Scalia, they do in the13    following sense.  If there is no valid judicial review14    path in this licensing ordinance, then there's no valid15    renewal mechanism, and the whole licensing requirement16    becomes facially invalid.  Then they're entitled to17    operate without a license.18              QUESTION:  But you're not saying that the whole19    judicial review mechanism is invalid in the sense that it20    has produced an unjust or incorrect substantive decision.21    You're saying that there's one feature of it, namely22    whether your client was allowed to operate in the meantime23    that rendered it unfair, but I don't see how that has24    anything to do with your -- the propriety of preventing25    your client from operating in the future, once a16 1    substantive violation has properly been found. 2              Or, you say it can't properly be found, that the 3    entire judicial proceeding is invalidated by reason of the 4    fact that your client could not be allowed to continue 5    operation pending the proceeding? 6              MR. OLSON:  My client was allowed to continue, 7    but my client was entitled to have that guaranteed on the 8    face of the ordinance, and we contend that the -- 9              QUESTION:  Well --10              QUESTION:  There is a -- there was a -- I forgot11    what the title of the case was, but a decision of this12    Court explaining that if you were entitled to something as13    a matter of constitutional right, due process, like14    notice, it doesn't matter that the notice provision isn't15    in the law itself, as long as the court insists on it.16    Then you have no constitutional right that has been17 violated.18              MR. OLSON:  That's right.  There are some of the19    cases going to the requirement of, for example, explicit20    and specific and objective licensing standards that21    recognize that these could be -- these could come from22    usage or authoritative construction, as well as on the23    face of the legislation, but here there is no usage or24    authoritative construction that builds a status quo --25              QUESTION:  Well, do you have -- all we know is17 1    in your case you were allowed to remain in operation until 2    the end of the line.  Do you -- is there anything in this 3    record to show that that doesn't routinely happen? 4              MR. OLSON:  Well, as far as I know, this is the 5    only establishment ever to be licensed in Waukesha as an 6    adult book store.  There's nothing -- 7              QUESTION:  So you're saying in another case 8    someone else might suffer the violation of a 9    constitutional right, but certainly that has not been your10    experience, and I don't know why we shouldn't assume that11    other cases would proceed in this same pattern and not in12    some other pattern.13              MR. OLSON:  The Court has held in more than one14    case that license applicants are entitled more to the hope15    of the grace -- to more than the hope of the grace of the16    Government.  They're entitled to a guarantee.  In other17    words, maybe they will.  Maybe they will let the next guy18    stay open, too, or maybe they'll say that we let Olson's19    clients stay open because that was test case, raising20    constitutional issues about our ordinance and we weren't21    sure how it was going to come out, now we know, so you've22    got to close with our nonrenewal decision.  We're23    entitled --24              QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, does the fact that you're25    making a facial constitutional challenge here in your view181    make any difference on the question of mootness or2    ripeness?3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. OLSON:  Yes, I think it does.  I think if wewere making an as-applied challenge the -- Justice Scaliawould be right in the sense that we haven't suffered anyinjury, because we were allowed to remain open.  The factthat we're making a facial challenge, I think first of allit focuses the Court's attention on the ordinance as itstood in 1995, and that's -- in '96, and that it preventsit from being mooted out by the subsequent amendments tothe ordinance that have taken place four times this year.          QUESTION:  Maybe, is it standing?  I mean, as Iunderstand it you're saying -- you're complaining about aprocedural flaw, call it X.          MR. OLSON:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And as far as your client isconcerned, X never happened to him.          MR. OLSON:  Correct.          QUESTION:  As far as your client was concerned,it's now been determined that he violated the statute onthe merits.          MR. OLSON:  Correct.          QUESTION:  And your client says, I'm out ofbusiness anyway, I've made an agreement not to try to getback into it.198 910111213141516          QUESTION:  Can I add one fact before you answerJustice Breyer?          MR. OLSON:  Sure.          QUESTION:  Generally the purpose of the facialchallenge is to protect third parties who may not bebefore the court, but here, is it not a fact that thethird parties are largely, maybe not entirely protected bythe amendment to the ordinance, from the very danger thatyou're seeking -- the very principle you're seeking to          Now, it sounds as if that should violate someprudential principle.  I just --          (Laughter.)          QUESTION:  I'm not totally sure which one.          MR. OLSON:  Well --          QUESTION:  You've looked into this more1234567    thoroughly.17    vindicate?18              MR. OLSON:  The third parties are protected from19    a couple of the original problems.  They're protected from20    indefinite time -- indefinite times in the administrative21    procedure.  But they're not protected from lack of prompt22    judicial review and lack of preservation of the status quo23    during judicial review.  The third parties out there who24    will apply for renewal in the future under this ordinance25    will still face those facial problems with the scheme as20 1    it stands today. 2              QUESTION:  But those third parties will be in 3    exactly the position that your client has been in during 4    the course of this litigation, isn't that correct? 5              What I'm getting at is, the kind of the classic 6    third-party right that we recognize is the right in the 7    case in which the individual defendant in effect says, 8    yeah, as applied to me the ordinance is perfectly 9    constitutional, but there are these other people and as to10    them it would not be.11              But here your client is in exactly the same12    position as the other people, and should that make a13    difference?  One reason why it might make a difference is,14    if it turns out that this supposedly facially invalid15    ordinance in practice is applied in a perfectly valid way16    to you, should we therefore assume that it will be17    different when the ordinance is applied to third parties?18              MR. OLSON:  I --19              QUESTION:  So I'm wondering whether you're20    really in a situation in which our cases recognize your21    right to raise a third-party right where you're in the22    same boat with them.23              MR. OLSON:  I think your cases prevent you from24    assuming that we are in the same boat with them.  I think25    they prevent you from assuming that they won't be required211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9to close pending judicial review, for example, or that --          QUESTION:  Well, why aren't you in the same boatwith them?          MR. OLSON:  Because --          QUESTION:  You say our cases prevent me frommaking that assumption.  Why aren't you?          QUESTION:  There's also, usually a championcomes forward and says, other people are going to bechilled, but in this case not only aren't others chilledfrom getting into this business, but you're being edgedout not because of any ordinance, but because a biggerplayer has taken over and there's not -- and has squeezedyou out of the market.          MR. OLSON:  We got the grace of the Governmentand a special dispensation to be allowed to remain open.Future applicants, there's no reason to believe that theywill get that, and they are entitled --1011121314151617181920    location.21              QUESTION:  But they are perfectly adequate22    champion of themselves.  It's not like the person who is23    going to be afraid to demonstrate for fear of being          MR. OLSON:  Maybe not totally out of the market.They might want to apply for a license at some other24    arrested.  It's -- I don't see any chill of people like,25    what is it, the B -- whatever the organization that has22 1    come into this town with a bigger and better adult book 2    shop. 3              MR. OLSON:  Setting that particular organization 4    aside and looking at future operations that might be 5    deciding whether or not to locate in Waukesha, I don't 6    think it's beyond the stretch of the imagination to 7    suggest that they might decide to go elsewhere if this 8    Court decides that Waukesha's ordinance is just fine and 9    you can be nonrenewed administratively for popcorn on the10    floor, and you have to close until you get a judicial11    decision on the merits that that's an unconstitutional12    criterion.13              QUESTION:  Maybe we have been misconstruing your14    argument.  Is your argument not that there is a third-15    party right that you were raising, but an argument that16    even as to you in this case, in which you were allowed to17    operate as the proceedings progressed, even as to you in18    this case, the statute was simply flatly unconstitutional19    and therefore the entire proceeding was unconstitutional,20    even though you weren't shut down pending the21    determination.22              MR. OLSON:  We do contend that, and we do23    contend that at least on remand the nonrenewal order will24    have to be vacated because it was issued pursuant to an25    unconstitutional licensing scheme.231 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And with the Court's permission, I'd like toreserve my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Olson. Mr. Meitz,we'll hear from you.                ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURT MEITZ                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. MEITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          The petitioner in this case was denied a renewalof its adult license for committing nine separateviolations of our municipal code, including permittingminors to loiter and allowing sexual activity to bothoccur on the premises.  The City of Waukesha maintainsthat a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination, asrequired in Freedman in the context of a censorshipscheme, is neither applicable or required for a licensingordinance that focuses on the secondary effects of suchestablishments and targets prior misconduct not protectedby the Constitution.          The specific issue before this Court, which isbefore the Court today, is that -- whether such anordinance, which has neither the effect or purpose oflimiting or restricting the content of any commutativematerials must provide either a guarantee of a promptjudicial determination, versus the availability or access24 1    to prompt judicial review for administrative decisions 2    that are made concerning conduct which is unprotected by 3    the First Amendment. 4              QUESTION:  Well, if we accept your statement of 5    the question, I think it's perhaps an easier case than I 6    believe they mean to bring, because I think part of their 7    point is that even under a scheme which is justified on 8    the secondary effects analysis, so it's not content-based 9    in the classic sense, even under that scheme, there is10    still going to be a content restriction on speech if this11    establishment is shut down, and that is true simply12    because the nature of the establishment is rather content-13    specific, so you're going to have a content -- you're14    going to have an effect which is correlated to content, so15    that's why I wonder if it's fair for you to say that the16    ordinance does not have the effect, in addition to not17    having the purpose of a content restriction, because I18    think they're saying it does have the effect of a content19    restriction, and that's why you ought to have some20    safeguards.21              MR. MEITZ:  In answering your question, Justice22    Souter, this Court said in the seminal cases, in the first23    and the plurality of American Mini Theatres, and in24    Renton, that these types of establishments, adult25    establishments do have a effect on the surrounding25 1    environments. 2              The Court said in Renton, the majority said that 3    you are capable of regulating, you have a substantial 4    important interest, and as long -- 5              QUESTION:  No question. 6              MR. MEITZ:  As long as your regulations are 7    justified without regard to the content of what they sell, 8    in this case what they sell or rent, that is content- 9    neutral.  Certainly --10              QUESTION:  It is content-neutral for certain11    purposes, but he is saying that there ought to be some12    procedural safeguard that recognizes the fact that even13    these so-called content-neutral limitations based on14    secondary effects do have an effect on speech, and that15    effect is at least very closely correlated with content,16    and he's saying that for that reason, even though you can17    regulate it -- that's not being contested, is it, as a18    broad proposition -- even though you can regulate it,19    there ought to be some limits on your regulation because20    of the damage that you can and do on a content-basis, in21 effect.22              MR. MEITZ:  And I think that is clear.  As the23    Court -- a plurality stated in FW/PBS, technically this is24    a -- requires prior restraint analysis, and we do25    initially, we provide the objective standards for review,                                  26 1    because if you don't have, as the case was cited in 2    Lakewood, where there are no standards, you have unbridled 3    discretion, and without any standards there's that hidden 4    idea of censorship, and we provide, as the court of 5    appeals determined, objective, definitive standards. 6              The other key here, as FW said, is you must 7    provide, the licensor must provide a determination in a 8    reasonable, specific period of time. 9              QUESTION:  But I think, and I don't want to cut10    you off, but I think what you're saying -- and this may be11    fine, but I want to make sure I understand it.  You're12    saying, yes, so long as we meet certain conditions, not13    all the conditions he wants, we can have an effect on14    content.1516171819202122232425          MR. MEITZ:  I think what we're going to findhere is certainly --          QUESTION:  But isn't that your position?          MR. MEITZ:  There will be what we consider anincidental burden on content.  There clearly will be, butthis Court on numerous occasions involving time, place,and manner restrictions where you have in place somerestrictions, as long as they're incidental, andincidental as this Court has defined on many occasions, isthat the regulation is essential to the furtherance of theinterest, and clearly here, our interest, our interest in271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425protecting the health, safety, and welfare of ourcitizens, is geared on not what they're selling, not whatthey're renting.          We're concerned about keeping minors out ofthese establishments.  We're concerned about keepingsexual activity from occurring.  We're concerned aboutpeep booths not being obstructed, which would discouragesexual activity.          QUESTION:  We accept that and he accepts that.All he's saying is, if you're going to regulate on thatperfectly legitimate basis, you've got to do it promptly.That's the argument.  Why can't you do it promptly --          MR. MEITZ:  And I --          QUESTION:  -- and therefore why is it a burden?I mean, that seems to me what the issue is in this case.Why is it a burden that you should not carry?          MR. MEITZ:  We would agree with that.  Webelieve that the argument of administrative determine --of prompt judicial administrative determination is not theissue before the Court.          QUESTION:  But do you agree that it's required?          MR. MEITZ:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  Well then, what's the differencebetween an administrative delay, which you concede theConstitution prohibits, and a judicial delay?28 1              MR. MEITZ:  The big difference is this, and I 2    think there were six justices in FW/PBS v. Dallas that 3    recognized the distinction between content-based 4    censorship schemes and the Freedman analysis, which was -- 5    required these safeguards to obviate the dangers of a 6    censorship system, and those licensing ordinance that do 7    not pass judgment on the content of any commutative8 material. 9              QUESTION:  But what sense would it make for the10    Court to have strict rules about administrative expedition11    but not judicial, other than what Justice -- the line of12    questions Justice Scalia was indicating, that there is13    authority to issue a stay?  Other than that, what would be14    the reason?15              MR. MEITZ:  The reason is, is the requirement16    for a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination in17    Freedman is because the licensing scheme in Maryland was18    passing a determination on the content of what is19    obscenity.  This Court has stated, to obviate the risks20    associated with that the judiciary has the expertise to21    make determinations concerning the constitutionality or22    whether a matter is protected or unprotected.  That is23    clear, that an administrative review body is not the final24 arbiter.25              If they want to declare something obscene or                                  291    not, the burden is upon them -- the burden upon them of2    going to court and proving that is there, and the3    requirement of prompt judicial determination is because4    the judiciary has the necessary sensitivity towards what5    is protected or not protected versus an administrative6 body.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Meitz, if some kind of provisionfor prompt administrative review is required in theselicense revocation cases, do you think this Court has everdecided whether the ensuing judicial review, whether ithas to provide for a prompt decision or just prompt accessto the courts, to courts having a power to maintain thestatus quo if the appropriate showing is made.          MR. MEITZ:  We believe that --          QUESTION:  Is there a difference between accessand final decision and what do you think our cases hold inthat --          MR. MEITZ:  For matters involving censorship orcontent-based situations, it's clear from Freedman and itsprogeny, Southeastern, that a prompt judicial, guaranteeof a prompt judicial determination is necessary tominimize the risk, and the --          QUESTION:  You mean final determination?          MR. MEITZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  As opposed to access?30 1              QUESTION:  Yes.  However, as the plurality 2    stated in FW, the words availability, avenue, and 3    possibility, that that is appropriate considering the fact 4    that what we are doing here, the municipality is not 5    passing judgment on the content.  What they sell is 6    irrelevant.  We are making determinations that are within 7    our expertise.  We do it every other Tuesday in the City 8    of Waukesha. 9              QUESTION:  Well, I'm not clear on what you think10    is necessary.  Is it necessary here that there be a11    provision on the face of the statute for prompt final12    judicial decision, or just prompt access to the court for13    judicial review?14              MR. MEITZ:  Prompt access, Justice O'Connor,15    because we believe that the purpose, the reason for a16    prompt judicial determination to eliminate that17    discouraging effect on the individual film exhibitor to go18    into court and the expertise, which only the judiciary19    has, that is not applicable.20              QUESTION:  But it seems to me it would go the21    other way around.  If the administrative agency has22    expertise, and it's required to expedite, in your case,23    but the judiciary doesn't, then you're allowing the entity24    without expertise to delay.  That seems to me, you have it25    backwards.31 1              MR. MEITZ:  Not with regard to matters that are 2    not content-based.  If you're making a determination on 3    whether minors are loitering or not, that is within the 4    particular realm of municipal body.  They make decisions 5    like that all the time, and that decision is, in effect, 6    final, unless there is an appeal taken, and that's clearly 7    unlike the censorship scheme, where you have to go to 8    court Maryland, if you want this to be declared obscene 9    you better get authorization --10              QUESTION:  I go back to my earlier question.  If11    the premise is that the Constitution requires expedition12    at the administrative level, why doesn't it have the same13    requirement at the judicial level?  Expertise can't be the14    answer, because that works against you, it seems to me.15              MR. MEITZ:  The reason it would not be required,16    you have to look at the underlying rationale of Freedman17    and why Freedman required a prompt judicial determination,18    because of specifically what the Court said -- filed like,19    the 37 photographs.  You are not in the position,20    censor -- you are -- you're in the business of censoring,21    and you are not sensitive to the protected versus22    unprotected speech.23              QUESTION:  Well, isn't there something, too, to24    the idea that when you get into court, you're dealing with25    a neutral tribunal, whereas perhaps the administrative32 1    tribunal might be thought not to be neutral. 2              MR. MEITZ:  This is true, and I think as you 3    pointed out earlier the deferential standard of review 4    exists virtually in every State that I'm aware of.  It's 5    pointed out by the Solicitor General, is whether there -- 6    whether the administrative body was arbitrary and 7    capricious, exercises will versus its judgment. 8              QUESTION:  Mr. Meitz, would you be making this 9    same argument if what was at issue here was not a statute10    directed at adult book stores but a statute directed at,11    let's say, radio stations?  It's not addressed at all12    business, just radio stations.13              It picks them out, and it addresses the external14    effects of radio stations.  If they're found to be in15    violation of the sanitary code because they're infested16    with rats, or because the plumbing is unsafe, or because17    the electricity is unsafe, their license can be revoked.18    It seems to me a very parallel situation.  Now, would you19    say that you could have a hearing under that statute20    directed only at radio stations, and shut down the radio21    station before the opportunity for complete judicial22    review has been accorded?23              MR. MEITZ:  If you're obviously not trying to --24              QUESTION:  I am worried --25              MR. MEITZ:  -- control the content, but if it's                                  331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9like you said --          QUESTION:  That's right.          MR. MEITZ:  -- rats, or whatever, I would say,absolutely, because if you -- you have an interest inmaintaining the sanitation and health of the community --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. MEITZ:  -- and if there happened to be alicensing scheme that allowed them to be shut down, Ithink the municipality would have a real substantialinterest in controlling, and as part of its public --          QUESTION:  A court would want to inquire intowhy only radio stations were prohibited from having ratsin them, as opposed to every other kind of business, I1011121314    suppose.1516171819202122232425          MR. MEITZ:  I would agree with that, but Ithink, again I bring the Court back to the seminal casesof American Mini Theatres and Renton.  The Courtrecognized that these secondary effects associated withsuch establishments are important and substantial, andthey allow the municipality some flexibility with dealingwith these very serious problems, so yes, in a sense --          QUESTION:  Those cases just dealt with thelocation of the business.  They didn't go into proceduresat all, Renton and Mini Theatres.          MR. MEITZ:  Renton and Mini Theatres was a                            34 1    licensing, albeit you're correct, Justice Stevens, it did 2    involve the zoning, but I think there have been other 3    cases since then, and I'll use -- although not in the 4    adult book scheme, but I will mention Ward v. Rock Against 5    Racism, where there was a clear burden, or incidental 6    burden placed upon speech from the standpoint of how loud 7    the music could be in Central Park, and the interests of 8    the municipality being, you know, the neighbors around 9    Central Park had the right to quiet enjoyment --10              QUESTION:  But again, that didn't have anything11    to do with the timing of the decision, as I remember it,12 did it?13              MR. MEITZ:  Well, the Court there analyzed that14    as intermediate scrutiny, time, place, and manner15    restriction.16              QUESTION:  I'd just like to get quickly your --17    what's the procedural doctrine that -- is -- look, they're18    complaining about X.  They weren't hurt by X.  They've19    decided definitely they're not entitled to a license20    anyway and they're going out of business, all right.21    They've agreed to that, and yet they want to complain22    about X.  What's the procedural doctrine that bars them?2324    question.25              QUESTION:  Well, you don't think they ought to35MR. MEITZ:  I'm not sure if I understand the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425be here making this argument.  You called it moot, or --we just went --with him?MR. MEITZ:  Yes.QUESTION:  Remember what I just went throughMR. MEITZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  I want to know, what's the proceduraldoctrine that says we can't get to the merits of this?          MR. MEITZ:  I -- the reason we brought thisissue to the Court's attention, and for the very limited,unique situation, was the issue upon which you grantedreview, and that is whether you require a prompt judicialdetermination.  The fact whether it was expedited or not,they were not injured.  They were allowed to stay open,and that -- again, we would prefer that this matter belitigated on the merits.  We have many municipalities --          QUESTION:  I just want the name of the doctrine.What is the law that stops them from doing --          MR. MEITZ:  I would cite Asarco from thestandpoint at least that you have to have some kind oflikelihood of redress that's available from this Court,and it's very speculative at this point in time.          QUESTION:  But you called it moot.  You didlabel it mootness, as opposed to standing, because Isuppose, on the theory that going in, when this whole36 1    thing started, they appeared to be -- to have a live 2    interest in this, but now at the end of the line they 3    haven't maintained that interest.  I thought that's what 4    you were saying, but maybe not. 5              MR. MEITZ:  Only since the Court granted this 6    petition for review, we felt it was our obligation to 7    bring it to your attention because of the limited issue 8    upon which you granted the review, not because we amended 9    the ordinance.10              QUESTION:  Well, is the -- is this any more moot11    than Pap's and Erie was moot?12              MR. MEITZ:  I think it's distinguished from13    Pap's, because one, as the Court stated in Pap's, they14    were -- this is clearly not an attempt by us -- they15    arrived at a favorable decision from the lower court,16    number 1.  Number 2, we don't know what -- as Justice17    O'Connor said in Pap's, there's some ongoing injury that18    occurred in that case to the City of Erie --19              QUESTION:  The difference seemed to me to be, in20    Pap's it's solely a question of mootness.  Here there's a21    different thing.  The additional thing is that they were22    never hurt by the provision of which they're complaining.23              MR. MEITZ:  And that's exactly why we brought24    that to the attention --25              QUESTION:  I know, and I'm trying to look for                                  371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the doctrinal handle.          MR. MEITZ:  Yes, and we look at it, if the Courtwould have granted cert on all issues that would have beena different case, because that might, if you were -- thestandards issued, or there was some impartiality questionof City of Waukesha panel, then that would maybe underminethe entire licensing process, but this was a very limitedissue, and we fail to see how this -- how they are harmedby this, or there's any redress likely by this Court.          The Court here is -- there's 21,000municipalities in this country, approximately, all ofwhich have a substantial interest and -- in seeing --preserving the quality of urban life in America.          QUESTION:  May -- I'm sorry, may I just go backto this other issue, and I want to ask you a questionabout your ordinance.          They're out of business now, I take it.  They'renot -- they don't wish to operate at the moment.          MR. MEITZ:  That's my understanding.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. MEITZ:  They're closing down this week.          QUESTION:  Now, if they were to win their case,would they be entitled to a license renewal under yourordinance, even though they do not at the present timewish to operate the business?38 1              MR. MEITZ:  We don't believe so, because of the 2    narrow issue before the Court. 3              QUESTION:  Well, I'm not -- no, but I'm not 4    asking about the issue before the Court.  I'm asking a 5    question about your ordinance.  If they were to win this 6    case and they come to you and say, we don't intend to 7    operate this business, but we'd like a license, does your 8    ordinance provide for granting them a license? 9              MR. MEITZ:  They could be granted a license if10    they were -- if they're found not to have committed a11    violation over the past 5 years.  The offices --12              QUESTION:  You license businesses that don't13    intend to operate?14              MR. MEITZ:  If they don't operate, no, we would15    not give them a license.16              QUESTION:  Well, that was my question.  As I17    understand it, they don't intend to operate.  They say,18    okay, we've won our case.  We don't intend to operate,19    give us a license.  Can they get a license under your20    ordinance?21 22 23 24 25     MR. MEITZ:  No.     QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Meitz.     Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.        ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMANON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9                 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT          MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          It's our position that the city's ordinance inthis case satisfies First Amendment procedural standardsin that prompt judicial review is available and thereforethe judgment below should be affirmed.          QUESTION:  You mean access to review, as opposedto decision-making?          MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  I think that actually is thequestion on which the courts of appeals were divided, andthat's the question that the Court ought to reach anddecide, whether what's necessary is access to promptjudicial review, or a final judicial determination on themerits within a particular period of time.          QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, are those casesinvolving renewals, or initial issuance of licenses?          MR. FELDMAN:  I think all of the -- at least allof the court of appeals decisions I think were initial1011121314151617181920    licenses.2122 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Do you think the considerations arethe same in the two situations?          MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, I do.  I think there aredifferences in a due process analysis between someone whohas applied for renewal of a license and hasn't gotten the40 1    renewal and has a property interest, perhaps, in that 2    license, and that may have due process implications, but I 3    think from the standpoint of the First Amendment the 4    question is, is there going to be a period of time during 5    which the expression doesn't occur, or does occur, and 6    it's just an interest in expression, and it doesn't matter 7    whether before that time the person was licensed and 8    had -- expression occurred or not. 9              QUESTION:  Of course, the status quo is entirely10    different, because in one case the status quo is that the11    First Amendment materials are being sold, and in the other12    they're not in -- they're not being sold.13              MR. FELDMAN:  I think that's true.  I think that14    status quo issue has to -- may have to do with a due15    process analysis.16              QUESTION:  Yes.17              MR. FELDMAN:  From the standpoint of the First18    Amendment, the Court's references in Freedman and the19    other cases to maintaining the status quo was -- in the20    context of those cases what that meant is, there can be a21    period of time during which the expression doesn't occur,22    and I think that's the same principle that applies here.23    There can be a period of time in this case pending24    judicial review, as long as the judicial review is25    available, during which the expression doesn't occur.41 1              I think what's necessary in this context is, the 2    license applicant has to have the availability of -- has 3    to be able to go immediately into court once the 4    administrative decision is made, the licensee has to have 5    the ability to get temporary or preliminary relief if the 6    facts of the case warrant it, and there has to be no 7    particular obstacles that are placed in the licensee's 8    way, and if all of that is satisfied, then the court is in 9    the position to safeguard the licensee's interest and no10    further requirements are necessary.11              QUESTION:  So you think the availability of12    temporary relief on a substantial showing is a necessary13    component of the review?14              MR. FELDMAN:  It's not directly presented here,15    because that is available under this statute, but yes, I16    think it's probably -- if you had a scheme -- and they are17    unusual, but I think they may exist here and there.  Where18    a court doesn't have the power to grant the temporary19    relief, I think that would raise other -- that would raise20    First Amendment concerns.21 I think --22              QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, does the Government have23    a position on mootness, or whatever you want to call it,24    or the justiciability of this case at this time in its25    current posture?42 1              MR. FELDMAN:  I think it's our position that 2    essentially for the reasons given by the petitioner, that, 3    although it might be a close question, the case is 4    probably not moot.  There still is some continuing 5    interest that the petitioner has in the case. 6              QUESTION:  Why do these adult book store owners 7    keep going out of business and not intending to get back 8    in?  I mean, we had the same question in Pap's.  It's an 9    occupational hazard, I gather.10              (Laughter.)11              QUESTION:  I don't understand.12              MR. FELDMAN:  I'm really not aware of the13    economics that lead to that.14              QUESTION:  But how does he have the right to15    raise the claims of people who are not here whom would be16    affected by this procedural provision, when he himself is17    not affected by it?18              MR. FELDMAN:  I think that his -- I think his19    basic claim is this, is this procedure that the city's put20    into effect, this licensing procedure, is21    unconstitutional, and therefore I don't really even need a22    license, or if I need a license, I ought to be able to get23    one immediately.  That's the basic claim that --24              QUESTION:  He's saying the whole thing is25    unconstitutional because --431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FELDMAN:  Right.          QUESTION:  -- it doesn't have sufficiently quickjudicial review, which he himself wouldn't have beenaffected by.          MR. FELDMAN:  That's right, but I -- the factthat in this particular case he wouldn't have beenaffected by it --          QUESTION:  Can you think of another case whereit was that distant and somebody was allowed to raisesomebody's First Amendment rights when the other peoplewere perfectly able to raise it themselves?          MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I think the FW/PBS case, forexample, or in the Lakewood case, I think in a couple ofthose cases you've had people who say, that there arethese -- that there are First Amendment proceduralsafeguards that are required, and the party is able to gointo court and say, his claim is that the scheme isunconstitutional.  Now, I'm not -- we don't agree that itis --          QUESTION:  Even though it doesn't affect them atall.  Even though they're not affected and the otherpeople --          MR. FELDMAN:  They're not affected in this case.I suppose the theory would be that when he goes forrenewal again he might be affected, or that he --44 1              QUESTION:  Well, if the theory is if he goes for 2    renewal again and he's not going back into the business, 3    it's a little far-fetched, isn't it? 4              MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I think -- yes. 5              QUESTION:  Well, I take it that the classic 6    Thornhill doctrine, where I'm allowed to raise somebody 7    else's rights, is because it's a content-based statute, 8    and this is not content-based. 9              MR. FELDMAN:  That's right, and I think that's10    the crucial -- this is not contents-based, it's true, but11    although in the FW/PBS case, which was identical to this12    in terms of whether it was content-based, the Court said13    the party could also raise these procedural interests,14    First Amendment interests, could make a challenge to the15    constitutionality of that scheme.16              I do think that on the merits the important --17    the crucial point here is that the decisions the city18    makes are not content-based.  Unlike in a situation like19    Freedman, where the Court said, this Court said that a20    reviewing court has to be able -- has to -- is necessary,21    because what the State was doing was looking at the22    particular movie and making a judgment based on that23    content about whether that movie should be allowed.24              QUESTION:  Can you explain to me why the25    administrator must act promptly, but the judiciary does451 not? 2              MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, I hope so.  I think in -- in 3    FW/PBS what the Court held was that some of the Freedman 4    requirements are not necessary in this context and, in 5    particular, it said the city doesn't have to go to court. 6    You can let the other party go to court and the city 7    doesn't have to bear the burden of proof when it goes to 8    court, and I think the point of that decision was that the 9    municipal decision here, since it's not content-based, can10    be allowed to go into effect and have final effect even11    with no judge ever looking at it.12              In the Freedman context, it's quite different.13    In the Freedman context, what the Court was saying, we14    don't want this censor's decision to go into effect for15    any significant period of time without a judge looking at16    it.  It's not really a final determination of law until17    you go into court, until a judge has a chance to look at18    it and decide whether the material --19              QUESTION:  I thought --20              MR. FELDMAN:  -- is constitutionally protected.21              QUESTION:  Am I wrong, I was thinking, look,22    normally where your courts are at stake a preliminary23    injunction is good enough, but that isn't good enough24    where it's the administrator, because the administrator25    might not be as fair.461              MR. FELDMAN:  I'm not sure I understand the2    question.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, the reason that you have toprotect them more about -- against the administrator thana judge is, you think, well, the judge will be fair.  Hesees irreparable injury, and if there's some probabilityof success he'll give you the injunction.          MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  But you have to be tougher than thaton administrators, because they're already taken a sideand they're not judicial and so forth.          MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.  I was only makingthe point that there was a unique feature present in aFreedman-type case, which is, you don't want any effect tobe given, or any substantial effect to be given to theadministrative decision because it's a content-baseddecision on the content of that speech.   You don't wantany effect to be given to that, basically, until it getsinto court.          Here, the point of FW/PBS was, that can havesome effect as long as the proper procedures are required,and --          QUESTION:  Excuse me, until it gets to thecourt?  Are you saying that if it's a content-basedrestriction you cannot impose it until the judicial review471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9is complete?          MR. FELDMAN:  No.  No, but I do think that theFreedman safeguards were designed so that it has a verylimited effect, and that was the reason why in Freedmanyou needed the judicial determination, not just the accessto the judge, to be within a very prompt period of time,because there was a concern that that administrativedecision just shouldn't have a final effect until -- notfor a very long time, only for the minimum possible time,until the judge decides the --101112131415161718192021    situations.22              MR. FELDMAN:  The stay, in my view, in our view23    those are really procedural due process issues and not24    First Amendment issues, but I think that would be          QUESTION:  Why wouldn't a stay by the judge, ifthe judge thought there was any question about it, whywouldn't that have sufficed in that context as well?          MR. FELDMAN:  That would, but I think you couldlook at the Freedman decision --          QUESTION:  Yes, but that would be changing thestatus quo.MR. FELDMAN:  Excuse me.          QUESTION:  That would be changing the statusquo.  The State problem is different in the two25    sufficient.  I think you can look at the Court's decision                                  48 1    in Freedman as essentially saying that the -- saying that 2    either a judge has to grant a stay in each one of these 3    cases regardless of the merits, or there has to be a 4    prompt judicial determination within a very short period5 of time. 6              QUESTION:  Yes, but the stay in the case 7    involving an initial issue, a stay would be a mandate to 8    grant the license, rather than a stay to maintain the9 status quo.10              MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.  That's correct.11              QUESTION:  So it's really not a stay, it's more12    of a mandamus.13              MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct, but I -- that's14    correct.  That's correct, but I do think the difference is15    that in the initial -- whether, in -- under a procedural16    due process analysis there is a difference.  For the First17    Amendment the question is, is that speech occurring during18    that period of time, and how long a period of time can19    that be allowed to happen.20              The decisions that the city makes in a scheme21    like this are decisions about things like whether there22    were minors in the store, what was the age of the people,23    were they there, were they not there, were the booths24    covered or were they not covered so that you could be able25    to tell what was going on inside them, was there sexual491 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425activity that some of the patrons were engaging in or not.          Those are very, very different from the kinds ofdecisions that were made in the Freedman context, andsince those decisions are the kinds of things thatmunicipalities make in generally in enforcing policepower-type ordinances, there's no reason for them not tobe given, in fact, when they make them.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Feldman.          Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF S. OLSON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. OLSON:  Thank you.  If I'm operating a radiostation and the city takes my license away because I'velet the fence around my tower get into slight disrepair,and my defense is that the provision of the ordinance thatsays you can lose your license for having your fence indisrepair slightly is unconstitutional, I can't even raisethat defense until I get to court, and if I don't getprompt judicial review or a stay of the status quo and beallowed to operate until my judicial decision, I will inall likelihood be out of business and I won't have anyeffective judicial review on that constitutional defense,and the administrative process can't touch thatconstitutional argument.          This Court's decisions are clear that delay in a                            50 1    licensing process can lead to content-based censorship 2    just as easy as lack of standards, even in a situation 3    where licensing decisions are not expressly based on the 4    content of the material. 5              Lakewood I think also warns us that an ongoing 6    business is a more likely target of content-based 7    discrimination in the licensing process at the 8    administrative level.  The -- 9              QUESTION:  Then I don't understand why the10    proper answer isn't, because there is this danger, the11    court will look at it case-by-case and if, indeed, this is12    a situation where the administrator is abusing authority13    to disguise what is really content-based regulation, the14    court can say in that situation, we put a freeze on it.15    We allow you to keep your license pending the decision.16              But if there's no basis for that, so that it is17    just a time, place, and manner-type restraint, why should18    you be able to maintain the status quo, which is, allowed19    to go on with the business, in face of very serious20    charges of violations that have nothing to do with the21    content of the books and tapes that are sold?22              MR. OLSON:  On the face of the ordinance, those23    violations may or may not be very serious.  Nonrenewal is24    required for one single, trivial violation of a provision25    of the ordinance that may well be unconstitutional.  We51 1    can't test the constitutionality of that provision on the 2    face of the ordinance until we get to court. 3              There are really large numbers of people out 4    there, highly motivated, with influence in municipal 5    affairs, who are waiting for this Court to give them an 6    opening for the covert censorship of sexually explicit 7    speech through delay of licensure, or through any other 8    method that allows room for indirect action. 9              Not only my client, as an adult book store, but10    other people who are engaging in unpopular speech and11    mainstream media ask this Court not to create that opening12    for covert censorship by delay of the judicial review13    until that delay becomes fatal to many businesses who14    won't have meaningful judicial review because they'll just15    die on the vine while they're waiting for a judicial16 decision.17              A temporary injunction that they have to take18    the burden of getting in circuit court is not going to be19    an answer.  First of all, it's the kind of cumbersome and20    time-consuming and expensive measure that, as Justice21    Harlan, concurring in Shuttlesworth, said, you shouldn't22    have to engage in to pursue your free speech rights, and23    second, it's a flawed process because you have to wait for24    the administrative record to prove you've got a chance of25    prevailing.521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Olson.          MR. OLSON:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)53
