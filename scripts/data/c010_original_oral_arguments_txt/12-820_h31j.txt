Alvarez. Mr. Regan.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAWN P. REGAN       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. REGAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I represent Manuel Jose Lozano, a father wholoves his daughter.  Respondent kidnapped that daughterand concealed her from Mr. Lozano, first in the UnitedKingdom, for nearly eight months; then in France, thenin the United States.      In Abbott, this Court recognized childabduction to be one of the worst forms of child abuseand that the Convention, therefore, aims to deter andprevent child abduction from occurring in the firstinstance.  Equitable tolling furthers that aim.  Bycontrast, the rule adopted by the Second Circuitprovides a playbook for thwarting the Convention ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. ­­ Mr. Regan, you ­­ you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field, family law, where the interest of the child is always of paramount importance and running all through family law3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 is ­­ is that concern. And changed circumstances figure2 very large.3 So decrees that might be final in another4 area of law are not because, if circumstances change,5 then the child custody may change. So it seems to me6 that this area is hugely unfit for equitable tolling7 that would leave out consideration of the child's best8 interests.9 MR. REGAN: Justice Ginsburg, we believe10 that equitable tolling does provide, within the context11 of the Convention, consideration ­­ the opportunity for12 courts to consider the interests of the child. And13 that's most poignantly illustrated by some of the cases14 in which it has been applied.15 If I may provide an example, an example in16 Respondent's brief, Mendez Lynch v. Mendez Lynch, on17 page 31 of their brief, it's a case in which the Court18 found equitable tolling is available, and it found19 equitable tolling applied factually. The Court,20 however, considered the facts and circumstances of the21 child's life, including those facts and circumstances22 that relate to the extent to which the child is settled.23 But it considered those facts and24 circumstances within the rubric of the Article 1325 analysis, and that is consistent with what other courts4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 have done in what I would ­­ what I would term more2 natural Article 12 ­­3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that equitable4 discretion, or is that still equitable tolling?5 Because, as I understand equitable tolling, if it6 applies and, say, there's a 6­month suspension, the7 child must go back, so that there's ­­ so that the ­­8 that the weighing that you're talking about just9 doesn't ­­ doesn't come into play.10 MR. REGAN: Thank you, Justice Kennedy. And11 I think this is important because I think this ­­ this12 illustrates how foreign courts have miscomprehended13 equitable tolling, how it would operate ­­ how it14 operates within the context of the convention.15 Equitable tolling would prevent the16 abducting parent from taking advantage of the Article17 12.2 exception, that ­­ that the child should not be18 returned because the child is now ­­ because the parent19 has met that minimal routine showing of the child is now20 settled. He's going to school, he or she is ­­ has some21 friends, so on and so forth, that they are living a22 normal life here.23 What it does not prevent ­­ and Mendez24 illustrates this, as do other cases ­­ it does not25 prevent the Court from looking at the Article 135Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425considerations.  So, for example, as in Mendez and othercases, the Court will still consider if the child ­­ ifthe child is of sufficient age and maturity to testify,such that, if this Court should take into account his orOfficial￼her views or objections      JUSTICE GINSBURG:we can look at it?      MR.

REGAN:would be an intolerable situation.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, as Justice Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are two different axes here. One is the best interest of the child, and the other is an adequate deterrent so that parents don't abduct. But those axes don't cross very often, if at all.MR. REGAN: I respect, Justice Kennedy, it's difficult to balance them. They're somewhat incommensurate or ­­ you know, competing considerations or ­­ but both very important. We think that equitable tolling properly balances them within the structure of the Convention because equitable tolling, again, it ­­ it prevents this Article 12.2 exception, but it doesn't prevent the Article 13 exception.      In fact, in many ways, what we're talkingabout is not inconsistent with what the English courtdoes or did in Cannon.  In Cannon, the court said if ­­where there is concealment and subterfuge, there will bea heightened burden for establishing settlement.      Now, in this ­­7Grave risk of harm.      Grave risk of harm to theOr if the court finds that itAlderson Reporting Company14 They've entered conditional15 child be returned at a time16 the testimony is necessary.17 JUSTICE ALITO:orders that require thewhen the proceeding ­­ whenOfficial￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 Article 13 still is different from what's in the best3 interest of the child.4 MR. REGAN: I think ­­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, it's true that all6 we're talking about is for the ­­ during the time in7 which the hearing takes place, but these hearings take8 years, and expert witnesses are not available or readily9 available.10 MR. REGAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, to your11 point about timing and essentially provisional return, I12 do think ­­ you know, courts ­­ district courts have13 shown great adeptness at dealing with those issues.Excuse me. Let me give you 18 this example. Suppose a child is abducted at ­­ at age19 one and is concealed for 10 years, and then the location20 of the child is discovered. The other parent files a21 petition. So that, if there's equitable tolling, the22 petition was filed within one year.23 But during those 10 years, the child has24 become very well settled in the new country, has learned25 the language of that country, the customs developed,8Alderson Reporting CompanyBut that still ­­ butOfficial￼1 gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth.2 Under ­­ if there is no equitable tolling,3 but the abduction can be taken into account under the4 doctrine of equitable discretion, that's ­­ that's one5 thing. But the way you read this, the way you read the6 Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the7 petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the8 conditions in Article 13 was met, for example, a grave9 risk that the child's return would expose the child to10 physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the11 child in an intolerable situation, then there would12 be ­­ then the child would have to be removed.13 So there is that major difference, isn't14 there, between those two positions?15 MR. REGAN: There is a significant16 difference. And we think that that significant17 difference is warranted and necessary in order to18 achieve the effect of deterrence because the Second19 Circuit's rule essentially says to abducting parents, if20 you abduct your child and you conceal your child for 1221 months, you will be rewarded.22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's true. The23 position of the Respondent and the government would give24 a great incentive for parents to abduct children and25 hide them for a period of time. But on the other side,9Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as my example, I think, illustrates, your rule wouldmean that a child who is very well settled in aparticular location would have to be returned to theother country for purposes of the custody determination.      So why do you think the Convention should beread one way, rather than the other?MR. REGAN: Justice Alito, I hope to make abundantly clear that our position, equitable tolling, would not mandate that that child be returned. All it does ­­ but it's significant ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how would it not?MR. REGAN: It ­­ it changes the question that the court asks. Absent equitable tolling, the courts ­­ the question on which ­­ the question before the court is, is this child settled? And the factors the courts looked at ­­ the courts have looked at it, and it really ­­ they're ­­ you know, "settlement" is not defined in the Convention, and Congress has left it to courts to decide.      And courts look at ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, which of the articles ­­ which of the provisions in Article 13 would ­­ would prevent the return in the hypothetical that Justice Alito just gave you?MR. REGAN: Courts have looked at ­­ and10Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I'll say it ­­ in the decades ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what ­­ what doesArticle 13 allow the court to consider?  It says, "It'snot bound to order the return if the person,institution, or other body having care of the person ofthe child was not actually exercising the custody rightsat the time of removal or retention."Well, you know ­­MR. REGAN: That's known as acquiescence. JUSTICE SCALIA: That wouldn't have ­­ orhad consent to or ­­ that wouldn't apply in hishypothetical or in this case.MR. REGAN: It's really B.JUSTICE SCALIA: B, "There is grave riskthat his or her return wouldphysical or psychological harm."  I mean, we have noreason to believe that ­­ that your client would ­­would harm the child or ­­ or that the parent in JusticeAlito's hypothetical would harm the child, "or otherwiseplace the child in an intolerable situation."      I don't see how any of those things would ­­would come to the assistance of the child in ­­ inJustice Alito's hypothetical.MR. REGAN: If I may explain by way of illustration, in some of the cases, what courts have11Alderson Reporting Companyexpose the child toOfficial￼1 looked at. And let me give ­­ Blondin is another2 example cited in our brief, cited by the Solicitor3 General, a Second Circuit ­­ the well­known Second4 Circuit case. That's a natural Article 12.1 case.5 Petition is filed before the period of one year expires.6 The Second Circuit looked at ­­ or Judge7 Chin ­­ then­Judge Chin in the district court, looked at8 the child's facts and circumstances related to9 settlement as part of that grave risk analysis. There10 was expert testimony, as there often is in these cases,11 that the child was suffering from potential ­­ from12 post­traumatic stress disorder.13 Experts testified that return of the14 child ­­ the child should not be returned because it15 presented a grave risk of harm to the child.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Physical or psychological17 harm.18 MR. REGAN: That's correct. And there are19 cases, Mendez v. Lynch and others.20 JUSTICE SCALIA:21 but in22 you, I23 not to24 years.25 MR. REGAN: If I may answer in two ways, in12It might be now and then,Justice Alito just gaveany ­­ any reason at allthe routine case thatdon't see how there'syank the child back from wherever he's been for 10Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the example Justice Alito gave.  With a 10­year­oldchild, it's ­­ it's very likely that the court wouldhear from that child.  I think the more difficultexample is ­­ let's make that child 7 or 8.  But ­­and ­­ and there's no evidence these cases haveoccurred.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:To use the ­­MR. REGAN:      JUSTICE SCALIA:not say the child ­­ the child can state ­­ well, let'ssee.  "The child objects to being returned."  I guessyou could limit to that.  "May also refuse to order thereturn of the child if it finds that the child objectsto being returned."MR. REGAN: That's been universally adopted by the courts hearing testimony.JUSTICE SCALIA: So that's the one exception, yes.MR. REGAN: But ­­ but the grave risk exception, and courts have applied this, it really ­­ it really just ­­ it ­­ it changes the question, like in Cannon.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in a sense, what you're saying is that it's not an automatic ­­ it's not13Which court?  Which court?United States court.     Yes, but Article 13 doesAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 an automatic rule. The more you argue that Section 132 is applicable, the more you're watering down the very3 rigid rule that you want, in order to say that there has4 to be deterrence.5 MR. REGAN: I understand that point.6 However, there is a difference. And so what we're7 trying to balance here, and I think ­­ it's not we.8 What the Convention balances ­­ what courts applying the9 Convention have found is the proper balance, is not for10 courts to say, well, let's try and figure out what the11 best interests are.12 In fact, the Convention couldn't be clearer,13 and Congress couldn't have been clearer that that is not14 where it ­­ that's where it least wanted courts wading15 into those waters.16 JUSTICE BREYER: The Convention says, in the17 preamble, that the parties ­­ that's countries ­­ are18 firmly convinced that the interests of the children are19 of paramount importance in matters relating to their20 custody. Okay? Paramount importance. So the provision21 you're talking about, Article 13, says, well, would22 returning the child lead to physical harm, psychological23 harm, or otherwise put the child in an intolerable24 position. So they mean intolerable.25 So I think this would be a pretty typical14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 case. The husband says he was fine. The wife says, no,2 he kicked me in the stomach and did a lot of other3 things. The judge hearing the two sides says I can't4 say the husband's right.5 MR. REGAN: Okay.6 JUSTICE BREYER: So we don't know. Now,7 your idea is to send the child back to the husband8 unless the child gets up there and chooses between9 parents. That's pretty tough on 8­ or 9­ or 10­year­old10 children and ­­ very tough. And you're going to keep ­­11 the ­­ you're going to send it back to the father in12 this situation, unless the mother can prove it's13 intolerable, either because of physical ­­ I mean, my14 goodness, a physical or psychological, you have all the doctors15 saying he should stay in New York. A typical problem16 for a family court judge, really tough.17 So you have the Convention, which says in18 the preamble, look to the interests of the child. You19 have every other country saying, that's what it really20 means; in other words, they're against you. You have21 the Department of State, in charge of the treaty, saying22 that's what it really means and otherwise against you.23 And so what do you have going for you? That isn't your24 fault that there isn't too much going for you, but25 nonetheless, I'd like to know what it is.15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. REGAN: I think we have a lot going for2 us. You've asked ­­ I think you've hit, Justice Breyer,3 on just about every issue that I could possibly want to4 address today. But ­­ and ­­ and let me say, I ­­ I5 respect the position of the 8­ or 9­year­old child, the6 difficulty. I was that child before a judge on the ­­7 giving that sort of testimony, so I certainly appreciate8 it.9 But on this ­­ this question of best10 interests, the Convention makes the decided choice if11 courts ­­ the Convention defines how courts are to12 determine that best interest. It doesn't say courts13 should determine what is in the best interest of the14 child. It says look at whether the child is settled15 under Article 12 or, if that's not applicable, you may16 look at Article 13. Other than that, the presumption is17 the best interest of the child is for return.18 You mention that the State Department is19 against us, which I'm happy to take the opportunity to20 address here. We don't believe that the State21 Department's views should be accorded great weight in22 this situation. Their brief does not speak to the23 diplomatic consequences of equitable tolling. It24 doesn't speak to ­­ it doesn't speak to the idea that25 equitable tolling will somehow impair our ability to16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 recover children abducted from the United States.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Mr. Regan, aside3 from the position of the United States, which ­­ which4 has changed, you made that point, the determination5 that's being made at this stage is really one of venue.6 It's where the main bout will be fought out. And so we7 don't want that to linger for a long time. We want that8 decision to be made with dispatch.9 And as one of the amici brief informs us,10 many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be11 badly abused women and if you ­­ if they had to go under12 Article 13, then they would have this full­blown, was he13 really the abuser? Doing it without equitable tolling,14 that question is reserved for the main ­­ for the main15 bout.16 I suppose if we had a case where the judge17 isn't certain was the father abuser or not, that judge18 would feel an obligation to stretch out this venue19 determination, to see if it's an Article 13 situation.20 MR. REGAN: I think, Justice Ginsburg, the21 domestic violence situation, which I am entirely22 sensitive to and appreciate, illustrates the difficulty23 of these cases and ­­ and that courts can't really24 figure out what's ­­ who's right or who did what in25 these circumstances. Most of ­­ usually all of the17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 evidence is overseas on that issue.2 What the Convention ­­ the approach the3 Convention decides on taking is that, first, there is no4 self­help remedy certainly for concealment, that ­­ that5 nothing excuses concealment of the child. And, in fact,6 to the extent you said there's a goal and a value of7 shortening these proceedings, to the extent equitable8 tolling disincentivizes concealment, it does that.9 I mean, the opposite rule says, if you10 conceal, i.e., you extend that period of time during11 which there's no relationship, you'll be rewarded.12 It's an enormous incentive. And our point13 is there is the proper safety valve. The standard under14 Article 12.2 is so pedestrian, it is essentially have15 you failed to be ­­ aside from abducting your child,16 since then, have you failed to be a normal parent? Is17 your child in school? Does he or she go to ballet18 class? Do you take him or her to church? Do they have19 friends? All those things were satisfied here. Can you20 be employed? What's your legal ­­ what's your21 immigration status?22 Now, this case illustrates just how simple23 and routine that is to achieve. And here, she didn't24 have a job. She's not here legally. I guess the25 court found that she had the depth and quantity of18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 friendships that your typical pre­kindergartner has, and2 that was enough for her to defeat return.3 The Convention properly balances these4 things by saying where it presents ­­ and courts have5 done this. The district courts are doing this. No one6 says ­­ you know, the State, the Solicitor General and7 our Respondent ­­ points to a single case where they8 say, here's equitable tolling and boy ­­ you know, the9 court got it wrong.10 Here was the wrong outcome because they11 applied equitable tolling as they have been doing for12 nearly two decades. Courts can do this. But the13 question, as it is in Cannon, can't be as simple as14 well, are you ­­ are you doing fine here in the United15 States.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Regan, Justice Breyer17 pointed out that all other countries seem to disagree18 with you. That's obviously a concern of ours when we19 interpret a treaty, that all other countries interpret20 it in a ­­ in a single way. Do you contest that? Are21 there any other countries that apply equitable tolling22 rules?23 MR. REGAN: We believe that it's neither24 surprising nor momentous that foreign courts have failed25 to adopt equitable tolling. It's not surprising because19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 they lacked the presumption that we do. It's not2 significant for two reasons. One, we think ­­ as I've3 alluded to, I think they miscomprehend equitable4 tolling. The Cannon court calls it "too crude," that it5 won't allow for an accounting of the child's interest.6 And as ­­ as the courts in the United States have been7 clear, it does.8 It provides ­­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they may be wrong. Who10 cares if they're wrong? The point is a treaty should be11 interpreted uniformly by all the parties to it. And12 you're telling me, well, all the rest of them interpret13 it another way, but they're wrong ­­ you know, everybody14 is out of step, but me. That's ­­ that's just not15 right.16 MR. REGAN: Not at all, Justice Scalia. And17 it was actually ­­ your question relates to my third18 point.19 What those decisions reflect is that the20 Convention leaves room within Article 12 for the21 operation of domestic law. Article 12 speaks to22 commencement of proceedings. You must commence23 proceedings within one year. It speaks to settlement.24 The Convention ­­ it is Congress in ICARA that defines25 how one commences proceedings. It says you must file in20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 a court that has jurisdiction. That's Section 11603(b)2 and (f)(3), which are at 117 through 121a of the3 Petition Appendix.4 Congress decides that's how you ­­ how you5 stop that period, by filing in a court having6 jurisdiction. Other countries provide nation ­­ courts7 of nationwide jurisdiction. Some countries provide that8 the central authority itself will file the petition for9 the applicant or will file in its own interest on behalf10 of the child.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: None of that is covered by12 the treaty. Yes, each State may apply its own law with13 respect to matters not covered by the treaty, but I do14 not read that to say ­­ to mean that each State may apply its15 own law in interpreting the provisions of the treaty and16 so can create exceptions on the basis of equitable17 discretion when the treaty has none or because its18 courts use that in another ­­ in other contexts or19 create an exception on the basis of equitable tolling.20 This is a matter of interpreting the treaty,21 not of bringing into effect some other principle of ­­22 of State law that overrides the treaty. That's how I23 read that provision.24 MR. REGAN: Our position is that, if you25 look at the drafting history here, the drafting history21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 was preliminary draft Article 11 provided for two2 periods, automatic return, if you will, return subject3 to the Article 13 and 20 defenses, if you filed within 64 months; or for a period ­­ a discovery rule capped at5 one year, if you didn't know the whereabouts of the6 child.7 Some countries said those periods are too8 short. Some said they're too long. Some said we don't9 want to have to deal with this discovery rule issue, we’re10 concerned about the evidentiary burdens. What's11 important is what the drafters did.12 They extended that first period to a year,13 and then, with respect to this discovery rule concept,14 they said, we're going to give you Article 18, it15 provides for return at any time; we're going to provide16 Article 34, which the explanatory report highlights, is17 meant to provide for invocation of domestic law or18 rules, particularly where 12.2 is implicated. And it19 left for countries to define the ­­ to define key20 elements of Article 12.2.21 In doing ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. That's23 turning legislative history, in my mind, on its head.24 They considered directly, if you study the25 SG's brief, a discovery rule that would have codified22Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 equitable tolling. And there was lengthy discussion2 about it and a decision that they wouldn't do that,3 that, instead, they would expand the period to a year4 where automatic return was required, and they introduced5 the best interest of the child after that year, and that6 that was now a balancing of all interests, the parents'7 and the child's.8 And you're right, they had other provisions9 that would affect the possible return or lack thereof,10 and they never wanted to stop a court from returning a11 child if it in its equitable discretion decided it was12 appropriate. But you're turning that legislative13 history on its head a little bit.14 MR. REGAN: Justice Sotomayor, we believe15 that the State Department's reading of that history ­­16 of that drafting history, is oversimplified because17 there were objections to that period, to that ­­ to that18 discovery rule that weren't simply to a discovery rule19 as a general matter. It was that some countries said,20 we don't want to have to deal with that. Other21 countries said, it needs to be longer.22 And so the choice that was made was a choice23 to give countries flexibility to determine how they want24 to calculate that period, when it should be set, and25 potentially to employ equitable tolling.

REGAN: I'd like to reserve my time.7 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Moskowitz.9 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREN A. MOSKOWITZ10 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT11 MS. MOSKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may12 it please the court:13 To reverse the Second Circuit's holding and14 to apply equitable tolling to Article 12 would be15 squarely at odds with the Convention's text, purpose,16 and drafting history, as well as contrary to the17 post­ratification understanding and interpretation of18 every other signatory state to consider the issue.19 Your Honors, we ended on a note of drafting20 history, and to return to Justice Sotomayor's question21 about turning that a bit on its head, I agree. The22 drafting history specifically shows that the countries23 considered two periods, one of prompt return, return24 forthwith within 6 months of the removal; and 6 months25 from the discovery of the whereabouts of the child, if24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the child were not known.2 And what the drafters thought ­­ some3 thought the period needed to be longer, but there were4 countries that wanted it to be shorter. There were5 countries that were very concerned that the child would6 become settled in the new environment, such that7 uprooting that child again, just for purposes of having8 a custody determination in the ­­ in the former country9 of habitual residence would be contrary to that child's10 interest.11 So they struck a balance. They ­­ they12 negotiated over ­­ over several drafts and finally13 arrived at a single period of one year, but that wasn't14 going to be a cutoff. Instead of having a statute of15 limitation ­­ statute of reposed construct, they said16 the obligation is going to continue, and it's going to17 continue until the child turns 16, unless it is18 demonstrated that the child19 its new environment.20 JUSTICE ALITO:21 about your position is that22 interests of children in a very powerful way, insofar as23 it does not deter and, indeed, encourages ­­ provides a24 great incentive for parents to abduct their children.25 And that was the central purpose of the Convention, to25Alderson Reporting Companyis now settled in her ­­ inBut what ­­ what troubles meit undermines the bestOfficial￼1 prevent harm to children and also to parents, but2 centrally to children who are abducted.3 And if you have a rule that says if you can4 abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which5 isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide6 some evidence of settlement, and you are going to ­­ you7 are going to win, you are going to deter return.8 Am I wrong to be concerned about that?9 MS.

I wonder if17 you would accept that, that there is no equitable18 tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but19 abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the20 return, that weighs against the failure to return the21 child, not just something that can be disposed of in a22 sentence, which is basically what the district court did23 here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into24 account in the exercise of equitable discretion.25 Would you disagree with that?26Alderson Reporting Companytaken into account intois settled.Well, all right.

MOSKOWITZ: Yes, Your Honor, I would6 presume so. But as well as any wrongful acts of either7 or both parents would be taken into account in a8 full­blown merits best interest of the child custody9 determination. What the Convention is trying to address10 in the instances of where a child is now settled in a11 new environment after having been at least one year in12 the new environment is, should the child be uprooted in13 anticipation of that full­blown hearing.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the fairness ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem is16 you're each ­­ you're each using the child as the tool17 in the objective that you have in representing the18 parents. On the one side is the allegation of19 inequitable conduct in concealment. On the other side20 is the interest in settlement. That's a dispute between the21 two parents, and the child is being used as ­­ as ­­ I22 don't know what ­­ you know, a tool in implementing23 those conflicting considerations.24 And to the extent that the Convention was25 designed to deter that kind of kidnapping, it adopted28Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼ 1   a ­­ a fairly strict rule.  And you're each trying to 2   say, oh, the rule doesn't mean what it means because, 3   don't worry, we'll take those considerations into 4   account in addressing custody; and on the other side, 5   well, don't worry because there's not that much 6   difference between 12 and 13.7 So how are we supposed to decide between 8   those two conflicting considerations of the parents 9   while maintaining the paramount concern, certainly not10   the exclusive one, but the significant one, in the11   interest of the child.12 MS. MOSKOWITZ: Yes, Your Honor. And just13   to address the one point that the Petitioner raised of the,14   don't worry about Article 12 because there's Article 13,15   those are completely different constructs.  In fact,16   Congress recognized that, when it set a different burden17   of proof for defenses under Article 13, as opposed to18   the well settled ­­ settled analysis under Article 12.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that cuts20   against you in some respects.  You say there is such a21   big difference, and therefore, it is very important that22   the kidnapping parent do the best he or she can to23   conceal the child's presence, so they get beyond 13 and24 into 12.25 MS.

The drafters were concerned both that13 it was going to be too long and that it was going to be14 too short.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Moskowitz, going back to16 Justice Alito's question. Could you tell me how you17 think this works? You said, in response to Justice18 Alito, that sometimes concealment can be a factor in19 determining whether a child is settled. And I presume20 you mean if somebody conceals the child by moving the21 child from place to place, the child would not be22 settled.23 Is it also a factor in determining whether a24 settled child should nonetheless be returned?32Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the question of whether and to what extent there is2 discretion to return a child ­­ a settled child under3 Article 12.

MOSKOWITZ: No, Your Honor. It's the discretion under Article 12, but it's in the same vein of there is discretion under Article 13 and 20, as well. The way that the language is written in Article 13, for example, states that the State is not bound ­­ I'm on 136a of the Petition Appendix ­­ that the State is not bound to order the return if it is established.      So it ­­ it's not saying that the returnmust be denied if these defenses are established.There's slightly different language in Article 12, whichI think is a reflection of the different drafting ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you ­­ you're confusing me. Let's say I'm the judge who has to decide36Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 this. The one­year period has just past, and I have2 evidence that this child who is now two years old has3 some friends, goes to play with the friends, goes to the4 park, has become accustomed to some American customs,5 knows the neighborhood.6 So the child is settled to that degree. And7 you say even if there's been very elaborate ­­ a very8 elaborate effort of concealment, no proffered9 justification for the abduction, no indication that10 there would be any serious harm if the child were sent11 back to the U.K., you say that's just too bad. That's12 your answer?13 MS. MOSKOWITZ: No, Your Honor. I think14 some of the factors you pointed out, for example, that15 there would be no serious harm if the child were16 returned, not necessarily physical harm or intolerable17 situation under Article 13, but there ­­ Article 1218 settlement does take into account roots.

If it's more than a year,25 the child shall be returned forthwith, unless ­­ unless37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 it is demonstrated the child is now settled in its new2 environment.3 It doesn't say you don't return it if the4 child is now well settled in the environment. It just5 says you don't have to return it forthwith.6 MS. MOSKOWITZ: Yes, Your Honor.7 JUSTICE BREYER: So I would have thought8 that that would have opened room for discretionary9 factors, but you have not given me a case that said that10 that's so. You have not given me anybody who said that11 what I thought was the natural reading and which you'd12 like to be the natural reading, you've not given any13 support for the proposition that it is the natural14 reading.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I ­­ I assumed from16 your brief that that was not the reading you were giving17 it. And that is not the reading it has to be given,18 frankly. I read it the other way, "shall order the19 return unless it is demonstrated that the child is now20 settled."21 I assume that to mean in which case you22 shall not order the return. Isn't that the way you've23 been reading it?24 MS. MOSKOWITZ:25 our ­­38Alderson Reporting CompanyNo, Your Honor.  We do inOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 Well, then, gee, we don't have a lot to argue about here.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if that's the case, if4 you're reading it that way ­­ I mean, I was reading it5 Justice Scalia's way, too.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: The first clause says,8 "shall" and the second clause says, "shall not." But9 there is an alternate reading where the first clause10 says, "shall," and the second clause essentially says,11 "may or may not at your discretion." But, boy, that12 would open up a big discretionary hole if you read it13 that way, wouldn't it?14 MS. MOSKOWITZ: No, Your Honor. It15 shouldn't be read that broadly. It's certainly ­­ and16 the House of Lords in England, in In re: M, did find17 that there was a residual discretion after finding a18 child was settled.19 JUSTICE BREYER: So I should read that case20 because the language says, "Unless it is demonstrated21 the child is now settled, you return it forthwith,22 unless it is demonstrated the child is well settled."23 Well, now, it's demonstrated well settled. Does that24 mean I cannot return it? Or does it mean I don't have25 to return it?39Alderson Reporting CompanyOh, it is not.

O'CONNELL: It's our position that, under Article 12, there is discretion to return a settled child and that that comes from Article 12 itself. As you pointed out, the language of Article 12 says that, if more than a year has passed, the court shall order the return of the child, unless the child is settled in her new environment.      And that ­­ I mean, I think it's clear thatthat could be read in two ways, and the Court has said43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 that, when the "similar except shall" formulation ­­ and2 we cited in our brief the Department of Commerce v.

The "similar except4 shall" language, it's interpreted depending on the5 context in which it appears.6 And we think it's very clear from the7 Convention that in the context of the Convention and8 specifically Article 12, that the better reading is that9 a settled child may be returned.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't the context11 include Section 13, which ­­ which lists specific12 reasons why you can depart from 12?

O'CONNELL: Well, Article ­­ it's true17 that Articles 13 and 20 are written in expressly18 discretionary language, but those are sort of set out as19 exceptions to the rule of Article 12. Article 12 is20 written up differently, but there's nothing in the21 Convention that ever says that a child has to stay in22 the country where she has been abducted to.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's ­­ what's the ­­ an24 example of where a settled child might be returned?

O'CONNELL: In exercising the discretion6 the court should be ­­ it's not just a free ­­7 free­wheeling discretion that the court is exercising8 under Article 12. We think it's guided by the purposes9 stated in the Convention. So, yes, first, you look at10 whether the child is settled, and that could be enough11 to defeat the presumption that an abducted child should12 be returned.13 You can also look at whether the child could14 easily resettle if the child was sent back. For15 example, a 10­year­old child who was in school and had a16 lot of friends and a routine in London was abducted to17 the United States for a year. That child may not ­­ may18 be settled in the United States, but she may not have a19 difficult time resettling.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would expect all the21 signatories to this treaty to come up with essentially22 the same exceptions, under ­­ under what you say is ­­23 is the interpretation of Article 12?45Alderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE SCALIA:courts.      MS.

O'CONNELL: No, I don't think so.And ­­ and, the other signatories have ­­ have almost all, I mean, I think the Hong Kong court does say that it doesn't have discretion, but it said, in that case, nevertheless, it would, even if it had discretion, it wouldn't order the children returned.

O'CONNELL: Well, I think the ­­ the10 last part, Justice Kagan, is the most important part,11 that it has to be guided by the objectives of the12 treaty; that it's not a free­wheeling, best interests of13 the child analysis or where this child should be, but14 you could take into account the principle in Article 12,15 that it's harmful to uproot a settled child, but you can16 also weigh against that the idea that this Convention is17 really geared in the first place toward preventing18 abduction.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would think it20 would be very unusual for a family court in that21 situation not to go ahead with the custody proceeding22 before it because it would think the child is settled.23 Now, do I send the child back. So that they can do the24 custody proceeding in England, or just go ahead and do25 it here?

O'CONNELL:That's right.Official￼1 its discretion by deciding the case either way.2 But, yes, we think on the one hand equitable3 tolling is not a good way to deal with this problem4 because Article 12 specifically wants courts to take5 into consideration the interest of the child ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, whatever fears7 my colleagues have, I've only found two ­­ or I should8 say my clerks have only found two published decisions in9 which courts have returned the child, so it's not as if10 they are ignoring the settlement issue. In fact, some11 might say that they are not giving abduction enough12 weight in ­­ in enough cases.13 But I ­­ the Hong Kong court who said there14 might not be discretion to return a settled child was15 not the highest court of Hong Kong, either.16 MS. O'CONNELL: That's ­­ that's right. I17 don't think any of these decisions are from the highest18 court.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, if we're going20 to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of21 international weight is that abduction is one factor for22 a court to consider in its equitable weighing on23 settlement because that's the whole purpose of the24 Convention. That's a central reason in the preamble.49Alderson Reporting CompanyMS. O'CONNELL:Well ­­Official￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 there always abduction? As your friend has pointed out,4 the whole treaty only applies where the child has been5 abducted, so you say, oh, well, there's a special6 exception to the rules of the treaty where the child has7 been abducted, but that's what the treaty applies to.8 MS. O'CONNELL: We understand that an9 abduction is going to take place in every case. I think10 we are looking for something more than what happened in11 this case, some sort of concealment that happened, so12 that the parent that is left behind and looking for the13 child cannot find him.14 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't know what sense ­­ I15 don't know what sense that makes. Let's say a child is16 abducted in Mexico, and let's say that the parent who is17 left behind is not a rich or sophisticated person, and18 now, the child is brought to the United States.19 And the parent in Mexico has a year to find20 the child in the United States, doesn't speak English,21 can't easily find a lawyer to handle the case. He's got22 an enormous country to try to find the child in the23 United States. How in the world is that going to be24 done?2550Alderson Reporting Company   But isn't there ­­There's always ­­ isn'tOfficial￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't need to do very2 much concealment. You can go to Peoria. You can go to3 New York City, and ­­ and it's going to be an enormous4 struggle to find that child within a year.5 MS. O'CONNELL: The first thing I'll point6 out is that Article 12 ­­ the drafters assumed that7 there was going to be some difficulty in locating8 children, and they decided on this one­year period, but9 also point out the State Department dedicates10 significant resources to finding children that are11 thought to have been abducted to the United States.12 They have access to all sorts of federal law13 enforcement databases to try to determine if the child14 has come here. They have ­­15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How ­­ how would that aid16 be invoked? Take Justice Scalia's example. The parent17 left behind in Mexico, no resources of her own or his18 own. How would the State Department get into the act?19 MS. O'CONNELL: Typically, the left­behind20 parent will approach the central authority in his or her21 own country and typically with an idea of what the22 abducting parent's connections are to other countries.23 And so, if the United States is singled out as a country24 to which the child might have been taken, the Mexican25 central authority would contact the United States51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 central authority, and immediately, somebody would be2 assigned to start looking for that child within the3 United States.4 And there are a great number of resources5 that are channeled toward that through the State6 Department in working with other Federal agencies,7 the ­­ the crime databases, the Federal parent locater8 service that's used to track down people in the United9 States to pay child support.10 It works with State law enforcement agencies11 who can check school records and driver's license12 records and things like that, so it's not like it's ­­ I13 mean, it is difficult. We are acknowledging that it's14 quite difficult.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How ­­ how separate are16 the two concepts of the best interest of the child and17 the interest in policing parents, so they don't abduct?18 At what point do they intersect?19 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I mean, we think ­­20 the Convention starts with the presumption that a21 settled child should be returned, and so the starting22 presumption is always that you should not abduct the23 child ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The child settled, that's25 when the abduction took place.52Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS.

A year has10 passed. The father never found out where the child was.11 Now, he suddenly finds out. He runs to Iowa. The judge12 looks at this Convention, and he says, well, the year's13 passed. You've lost, let's say, and I don't have to ­­14 I don't have to return him forthwith. The child's not15 going to suffer intolerable injury. I can't use that.16 I don't have to return him forthwith.17 Now, I look, is he settled? Yes. He's18 settled. All right. End of the matter. But do we now,19 in the discretion of the father, have a custody hearing?20 The father can say, yes, all that's true, but I should21 have custody. And he goes, and under Iowa law, we see22 who is entitled to custody. And he has something going23 for him. Namely, the mother's acted pretty badly,24 unless she has excusing circumstances in abducting the25 child.55Alderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE BREYER:question; is that right?That's the correctOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Does that happen or not?MR.

Of course.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If the answer is of course, what we're talking about here is, on the one hand, we don't want to encourage abductions. On the other hand, we don't want to treat the child as a yo­yo.MR. REGAN: Absolutely.JUSTICE BREYER: So the question is whether the custody hearing will be in a family court in Britain or whether it'll be in a family court in the United States.MR. REGAN: That's right.MR. REGAN: That is the question. And also, the question is how do we deter ­­JUSTICE BREYER: So our issue about whether there's discretion or ­­ it's a little bit secondary because we can have a big, full­blown hearing about who56Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 should have custody, though, it will be in a different2 court. It's true. You lose. There is more incentive3 to kidnap the child.4 It's also true, if you win, there is a much5 greater likelihood that the custody hearing will be in6 Britain, rather than the United States, which is the7 yo­yo problem.8 MR. REGAN: And our concern here, Justice9 Breyer ­­10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, go ­­ now,11 say what you want to say. Now, if I understand it12 correctly.13 MR. REGAN: Our concern is the deterrence14 and prevention, which is the goal of the Convention.15 Justice Scalia asked about other nations in uniformity.16 And there could be no better reflection about the room17 created in Article 12 and that this ­­ that the18 uniformity is not ­­ or that this is not a problem where19 we need to be so concerned about uniformity.20 In 2006, through the special commission21 process, the meeting of the ­­ of the members of the22 Convention, the United States specifically apprised the23 other nations that it was employing equitable tolling in24 the 12.2 context. As the government concedes, no one25 else disagreed. No one expressed any concern about the57Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 United States doing that. That's a clear reflection2 that there is this room in Article 12.3 Government's and Respondent's position is4 that concealment may be taken into account. The problem5 there is the Respondent still has this enormous6 incentive to conceal, which is the purpose ­­ that's the7 primary goal, to prevent that from happening, concealing and8 abduction. That's the goal of the Convention.9 But also, there's no standard. They haven't10 articulated a standard. The government doesn't11 articulate one. It ­­ it amounts to a standard that12 says concealment matters, unless it doesn't. That's an13 enormous ­­ that ephemeral standard is very difficult14 for a respondent to overcome. It's very difficult for a15 district court to apply. And what it does is it creates16 this incentive to conceal because no one even knows what17 the question is.18 Equitable tolling defines the question19 within the context of the Convention. It says, by20 tolling, this is the question you should answer. If21 there's not to be tolling and there are lots of22 courts ­­ lots of cases where courts have found we23 shouldn't toll because the child wasn't concealed or the24 parent didn't exercise due diligence finding the child,25 then we'll ask the Article 12.2 question, whether the58Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425child is settled.      The bottom line is equitable discretion willresult in the abduction of more children.  Equitabletolling will disincentivize that.  I would urge theCourt to look at those cases I mentioned, Mendez,Blondin.Reyes Olguin is another one. 2005, Westlaw 67094, a 2005 case in the Eastern District of New York, Judge Gleeson where return was denied under these circumstances. Now, that's a natural 12.1 case, I believe. But the court looks at factors of settlement. Excuse me.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
