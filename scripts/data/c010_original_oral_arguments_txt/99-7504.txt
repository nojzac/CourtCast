MEIERHENRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it10111213    you.14              This is from Yankton, South Dakota, which was15    the first territorial capital of the Dakota Territory.  As16    a result of that, certain institutions were created, one17    of which was Yankton College.  It was the oldest college18    in the Dakotas and Montana.  It's now closed.  It closed19    in the 1980's, and it's now a Federal prison camp.  That20    Federal prison camp has no walls.  It looks like Yankton21    College did for over a century until it was closed.22              At that place resides today Chris Lopez.  Chris23    Lopez came to the Yankton prison camp from the State of24    Iowa.  He drove across the State of Iowa and was allowed25    to do so by the district court to self-report to this312345    Davis.67 8 9                                              (10:02 a.m.)          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argumentnow in Number 99-7504, Christopher A. Lopez v. Randy J.please the Court, Ms. Brinkmann:          This case comes to you out of the State of SouthDakota, and I'd like to briefly put the setting for all of 1    college campus, now Federal prison camp. 2              We're here today to talk about 18 U.S.C. 3    3621(e).  That statute at the time that Chris Lopez was a 4    convicted person, before he was a prisoner, unambiguously 5    grants to him an incentive, and before he knocked on the 6    door to be let into prison it said to him, if you are a 7    drug abuser, which he admits he is, and if you agree to 8    undergo the program, which he does, if you've been 9    convicted of a nonviolent offense, Congress has made a10    deal with you.  We will allow you, if you successfully11    complete the program, to be let out of prison up to 1 year12    early.  He had 72 months to serve.13              QUESTION:  But counsel, that's not what the14    statute says.  The statute says the Bureau of Prisons may15    reduce the sentence up to 1 year.  It doesn't say you have16    a right or an entitlement, does it?17              MR. MEIERHENRY:  No.  I don't urge this Court18    that that is the case, that it's an entitlement.  The19    legislative history is clear that that was considered by20    Congress, and Congress did not wish to make it a right21    that if you simply go through the program yet you led the22    gang on the campus, or you created other disciplinary23    problems, that the Bureau of Prisons shouldn't have24    control over the prisoner while that prisoner was25    incarcerated, but this is something I'd like --41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Excuse me.  You're saying that it --that -- I mean, that doesn't go far enough.  All you'reacknowledging is that the Bureau of Prisons didn't have togive you that benefit unless you successfully completedthe program, right?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  But you're still maintaining that ifyou successfully complete the program, if you're a modelprisoner and everything else, you had a right to get that10    benefit?111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Justice, I think that's thenext case.  What we're here arguing today is whetherChris --          QUESTION:  Well, what does the statute say?          QUESTION:  It says may.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  The statute says may, but let'sconsider the structure of it.  3621(a) is very clear.3621(a) tells the Bureau of Prisons that they may notrelease a prisoner until the expiration of the termimposed, or there's a good conduct section 3624, so when(e) was enacted -- and the legislative history is Congressalso amended section 3621(b), which says the bureau shallmake available appropriate substance abuse treatment foreach prisoner the bureau determines has a treatablecondition of substance addiction or abuse.  All right,5 1    they enact that. 2              But 3621(a) would not allow anyone to be 3    released early, so they enacted subsection (c), which is 4    entitled, substance abuse treatment, so section (e), Your 5    Honors, had to be amended to give permission to the Bureau 6    of Prisons that if people took the substance abuse 7    treatment there would be some incentive.  The 8    congressional hearings are clear. 9              QUESTION:  Well, you're talking about10    legislative history, Mr. Meierhenry, and those of us who11    resort to legislative history usually do so only where12    something is ambiguous.  We're dealing with the word may13    here in section (b), and what is ambiguous about the word14 may?15              MR. MEIERHENRY:  I don't think there's anything16    necessarily ambiguous if you use another meaning of the17    word, give permission to.  I urge Your Honor that until18    the enactment of (e), if you had substance abuse19    treatment, if you had an incentive, the Bureau of Prisons20    could not turn anyone loose under any circumstances.21              What I am urging is a plain reading of this.22    Before Mr. Lopez, so to speak, becomes a prisoner, as you23    read this you would -- it would indicate that if you're a24    substance abuse user and you go through the program and25    you substantially complete it -- in other words, obey the61    rules within the institution.10111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MEIERHENRY:  No, I'm -- what happened inthis case, Your Honor, was that Chris Lopez, before heever walked in the institution, has been categoricallyeliminated because he has a sentence enhancement forpreconviction activity.  He is categorically deniedbecause of something that did not occur under the --          QUESTION:  But that -- that may be a perfectlygood argument, but it -- and it seems to me it takescognizance of the word may, that Congress has alreadydecided the categories of sentences, but I don't thinkjust bobbing and weaving around the word may does yourargument any good.          QUESTION:  And you may -- your sentence may be          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Right, but --          QUESTION:  See, you've got to deal with thatword may, Mr. Meierhenry.  You're speaking as if it saidwill be reduced.23    reduced.456789that --MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, maybe I'm not being clearQUESTION:  You're not --          MR. MEIERHENRY:  That the Congress gave to theBureau of Prisons certain discretion, and that discretionis over prisoners, not over creating categories of71 prisoners.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          Now, this is not a case where my client has anyopportunity to successfully complete for purposes of theincentive the program.  He's been shut out of the program.To use an analogy, this statute clearly says if you go todrug class, and the class --          QUESTION:  May I interrupt you?  He's not shutout of the program, is he?          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  He's not shut out of theprogram.  It's the incentive.  If I infer that -- it's theincentive, obviously, we're talking about here.  Allprisoners, Congress declared -- that's part of ourargument.  Congress declared that 100 percent of allprisoners by 1997 should have access to a drug treatment          MR. MEIERHENRY:  No.  No, and I don't want tomislead the Court.101112131415161718    program.19              QUESTION:  Mr. Meierhenry, how do you propose20    that the Bureau of Prisons implement the may?  You don't21    want them to use categories like, all prisoners who have22    engaged in violent behavior in prison.  Isn't that a23 category?24              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Yes, but it's --25              QUESTION:  All prisoners whom we do not believe81    will be safe to let out on the streets even after the2    program, isn't that a category?  It seems to me that if3    you're being rational, if you're trying not to be4    arbitrary, you establish categories, so your argument that5    may cannot mean you establish categories just leaves me6 cold. 78910111213141516171819202122232425          It seems to me that that's exactly what you wantthe Bureau of Prisons to do, to be responsible, not tojust arbitrarily say, yeah, you get it, you don't get it.That's arbitrary.  That's irrational.  But here they'vetried to establish a rational scheme.  What's the matterwith that?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, I could argue about,which I think is the next case, of whether it's rationalto consider Mr. Lopez is a violent person when they puthim in a --          QUESTION:  Oh, I didn't think they wereconsidering him as a violent person.  I thought they wereconsidering him as a person who had committed his crimewhile, I guess, carrying a gun.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  He had --          QUESTION:  I didn't under -- maybe Imisunderstand the Government, because I didn't think theGovernment was saying that that qualified him as a violentperson, because if that were the case we wouldn't be91    talking about any discretionary category.2              MR. MEIERHENRY:  No, that's correct, and we've3    been through that litigation history of them defining a4    nonviolent offense as a violent offense, which was the5    Eighth Circuit case of Martin v. Gerlinski,  but the6    answer to the problem, the problem is one of who gets in7    the classroom.  Our argument today is very simple.8    Congress told the Bureau of Prisons who gets in the9    classroom -- all --10              QUESTION:  Well, everybody gets in the11    classroom.  The question is, having been -- not who is12    eligible for the program, but who is eligible for the13    early release afterwards.  As you've said to Justice14    Stevens, there's no exclusion from the drug treatment15    program.16171819202122232425MR. MEIERHENRY:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And the reason there's no exclusionfrom the program is that it says that the bureau shallestablish the program.  If you read through 3621, what isreally -- it just jumps out at you, is that it keeps usingshall.  Shall, shall, shall, until it gets to the periodof custody section, and there all of a sudden it shiftsfrom shall to may, which means discretion.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  It means discretion, but it isnot a grant of discretion to categorically deny nonviolent10 1    offenders consideration for the reduction. 2              QUESTION:  May I clarify two things?  If you are 3    now leaving your argument that all people who complete the 4    program successfully and are nonviolent offenders must be 5    given this reduction, if you are leaving that, and 6    shifting to an each individual is entitled to an 7    individual determination, not a categorical exclusion, if 8    you're doing that, then mustn't the bureau do the same 9    thing for nonviolent offenders who weren't carrying any10 weapon? 111213141516171819202122232425          I mean, if it's going to be a one-by-oneexamination for a defendant that fits in your client'scategory, wouldn't it also be one-by-one for anyone?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  It could be.  I don't have adefinitive answer of how to run the Bureau of Prisons,except I'm here saying that this statute clearly tells theBureau of Prisons how people are to get into the programfor the purposes of the incentive, and that is allnonviolent offenders are to be considered, and that's tooccur after successfully completing the program.  Herethey've made that decision.          QUESTION:  Well, could they make a decisioncategorically that all people who are nonviolent offenderswho aren't carrying a firearm will get the reduction?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  I think they've done that.  I                            11 1    think that's the way it practically works, unless they've 2    had disciplinary problems.  I think 13 percent, according 3    to one report, the Triad Report, indicates that they were 4    not allowed because of disciplinary problems within the 5    institution. 6              QUESTION:  It seems to me your argument has got 7    to be not that there can't be categorization by the 8    bureau, but that Congress has limited the kind of 9    categorization the bureau may use, that Congress has said10    nonviolent offenders, and the bureau can't go beyond that11    when it's talking about limiting the availability of early12 release.13              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Chief Justice, that -- I guess14    that is essentially what I'm saying.  I'm saying that for15    the purposes of the incentive, that everyone starts the16    program and everyone has the opportunity to successfully17    complete it, and call that a category if you may, that18    it's while they're in the institution that they may be --19    their activities may eliminate them from this category.20    It's not something that occurred at the time of21    sentencing, which was preconviction activity.22              QUESTION:  You're saying that the only23    precondition category that the bureau can use is the24    precondition category which is set forth in the statute,25    and which implicitly excludes other pre-imprisonment12 1    categories, namely, violent offender. 2              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, there are two categories 3    when Chris -- before Chris -- when Chris Lopez is an 4    offender.  It's violent, and nonviolent.  The courts have 5    considered that the BOP's definition of that. 6              When he hits prison there are two categories, 7    violent and nonviolent, and my argument is that all of 8    those activities have been considered by Congress, have 9    been determined by Congress, and they wanted to broaden10    the program.11              QUESTION:  Then why didn't they use the word12    shall, rather than the word may?13              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Because I don't think they14    wanted -- Congress wanted to create a right that just15    based on completion of the program, without regard to16    their other activities as a prisoner, that just the17    completion of that program meant you were entitled to --18    and I think that's the word, entitled to reduction.19              QUESTION:  You say you don't think that.  I20    mean, is there something in the legislative history that21    specifically supports that argument?22              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Other than that it was clear,23    and I refer to the legislative history, the report.  It's24    clear from the legislative history that Congress said that25    this subparagraph we're discussing, they use the word13 1    authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to shorten by up to 1 2    year the term of a prisoner who successfully completed a 3    treatment program.  They saw it as an authorization -- 4              QUESTION:  Yes, but authorization is not 5    equivalent to mandate. 6              MR. MEIERHENRY:  But the converse is also true. 7    Authorization is not a grant of power to create categories 8    which overrule the two made by Congress, violent and 9    nonviolent.10              QUESTION:  Well, you know, your argument that it11    relates only to -- your argument would be a lot stronger12    if the section, the relevant section, 2(b), didn't have13    the word successfully in it.14              I could understand Congress saying the Bureau of15    Prisons may cut a year off the term of somebody who16    completes the program.  Then you could say, well, the17    bureau can, you know, can decide for itself whether this18    fellow, although he completed the program, has really been19    cured or not, or, you know, factors like that, but it20    doesn't say that.  It says, it may release somebody who21    has successfully treated -- completed the program.22              Now, what factors do you think the may was23    intended to let the Bureau of Prisons take into account?24    It isn't completion of the program.  No matter how25    successfully he completed it, he still is not entitled to                                  14 1    it.  Now, what could disable him from the year, other than 2    killing another inmate while he's in there? 3              MR. MEIERHENRY:  I think the traditional 4    standards that are applied to good time clearly are going 5    to be the type of criteria for good time release under 6    section 36 -- 18 U.S.C. 3624, would obviously still be7 used. 8              I mean, you have good-time release, which is the 9    only other way you can get out -- basically you can get10    out of prison early.  That was not affected by this11    legislation.  They added an incentive up to a year.12              I think you've got to wed those two together,13    and I think that's the discretion that the Bureau of14    Prisons has and must have, not to create defining15    categories of exclusion before they start, but you can16    eliminate the good time type criteria that the Bureau of17    Prisons is familiar with, and it would appear from18    Congress, Congress recognized that this must be a19    long-term program, 6 to 12 months, that it was not easy,20    and they said the committee believes that such an21    incentive is necessary to draw into treatment many inmates22    who may not be willing to undergo a difficult program23    otherwise.24              They recognize that there's an 800-percent25    greater chance of a drug-addicted person committing a151    future crime, and Congress --2              QUESTION:  May I ask how you would -- the3    statute in your view would have meant anything different4    if the word may had been replaced by the word shall or5 must? 678910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MEIERHENRY:  I think then, successfulcompletion.  A prisoner would have said, I successfullycompleted this program, I must be allocated up to a year,some period of time off.  It is a right of mine, it is ahandshake Congress made with me, and I must be given it,even though I violated every criteria for good-timerelease, this and this alone --          QUESTION:  What are those criteria?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, obviously, obeying therules of the institution, not having contraband, you know,those type of --          QUESTION:  Because if you had contraband youwould not have successfully completed this program.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Exactly.  That's the discretionthat obviously Congress had to give to them, because partof successful completion of a program is to obey the rulesof the institution as well.          QUESTION:  Then it should have used shall.  Thenit should have used shall.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, but if you use --                            16 1              QUESTION:  Because they could have said, you 2    shall release him if he successfully completed the 3    program, and you say that successfully completion of the 4    program includes obeying all the rules in the institution. 5              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, maybe I misspoke in this6 sense -- 7              QUESTION:  You certainly did. 8              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Because those are two different 9    things.  I mean, successful completion of the program --10    let me use my analogy of the classroom, all right.11              A student's in the classroom.  It's clear the12    student has power over the student in the classroom,13    whether they complete the program, whether they obey,14    they're in charge of grading, correct, and here the Bureau15    of Prisons has that.  But what the teacher does not have16    control over is which students enter the school.  In this17    case, that's Congress.  Congress has said, for the purpose18    of incentive, everybody with a nonviolent offense has a19    right to be a student and pass the course.20              Now, here the Bureau of Prisons says, well, all21    nonviolent offenders, yes, get to take the course, but22    we've already said you kids in this row, you people in23    this row will, even if you successfully do everything24    correctly, you don't qualify, not based on what Congress25 said --17 1              QUESTION:  Yes, but supposing you had a rule 2    that said, but there's a category of students who would 3    normally get a gold star but if they threw an eraser at 4    the teacher, they shall not get the gold star, and 5    supposing you have here a program that said, you are 6    entitled to the year, but if you have taken a poke at the 7    warden you shall not be released. 8              They just have a category, anybody who takes a 9    poke at the warden, even though he's successfully10    completed the program, shall not get the 1-year benefit.11    Would that categorical denial be consistent with the12    statute, in your view?13              MR. MEIERHENRY:  I think that is consistent,14    because it is activities in the prison over which the15 bureau --16              QUESTION:  So it isn't the mere fact that it is17    a category.  Your position is that if it's a18    pre-incarceration category, it's bad.19              MR. MEIERHENRY:  That's correct.  Congress took20    care of that.  It created the two categories and left the21    administration to the Bureau of Prisons.22              The Bureau of Prisons here has created23    additional -- numerous additional categories.  In my24    client's case, a nonviolent offender drug case with a25    sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm.  They've181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9created these categories in advance.          I'm not arguing that the Bureau of Prisonsdoesn't have discretion over its institution.  That's whatthe statute clearly says.          QUESTION:  And they can exercise that discretionby creating categories as long as the categories aredirected at postincarceration conduct.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  To the activities of theprisoner while they're in prison, not to preconviction10    activities.111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  It's a very sensible and logicaltheory, but what in the statute or the legislative historyidentifies that particular theory?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Nothing specifically identifiesit that way as opposed to my colleague's way.  To me, itis rational, it is something that makes sense, it issomething that when you --          QUESTION:  It's more than that.  I thought -- Imean, come on, you're -- you'll have to give us some textto hang on to.          I assume that what your argument is, is thefamiliar argument, inclusio unius exclusio alterius, thatin fact the statute does identify one pre-incarcerationfactor that will disqualify you from obtaining the year'sbenefit, and that pre-incarceration factor is conviction191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of a violent crime, and by adding another pre-incarceration factor, namely just merely possessing afirearm, you're contradicting the implicit exclusion ofother pre-incarceration factors.  Isn't that yourargument?  You're relying --          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- upon the fact that a violentoffender is explicitly excluded.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Our argument is clearly this isan unambiguous statute.          QUESTION:  Well now, you -- but Justice Scaliaasked you a particular question.  Is that or is that notyour argument, and I think you --          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, it is my argument.  I --what I was going to say, first we believe it'sunambiguous, but if you get into the determination --          QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Why is it unambiguous?  Idon't understand what you mean by, it's unambiguous.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Well, because of the way theyconstructed this.  First of all, subsection (e) onsubstance abuse had never been the law of the land untilCongress identified that this was a serious problem.Okay.  So they've got to enact substance abuse treatment,which they do.  They require the Bureau of Prisons totreat 100 percent, or make available 100 percent all201 prisoners. 2              Then they recognize, this is a tough program, 3    let's give an incentive.  At first it was to all 4    prisoners, then it was -- the Senate created two 5    categories, violent and nonviolent. 6              Then it came down to substance abuse treatment. 7    They added the incentive that said -- and they couldn't 8    give them any time off up until the passage of part B, 9    period of custody, and they created two categories,10    violent, nonviolent, and they said to the Bureau of11    Prisons, as we have given you the discretion over the12    years on good-time decisions, we give you that discretion13    as well in determining who successfully completes a14    treatment program, but we don't want to go the next step15    and make it a right of release.  We want the discretion16    for successfully completing the program.17              So the common sense reading appears to be, you18    don't have to, you can take into other considerations, but19    nothing in that step-by-step process said, Bureau of20    Prisons, you may create additional categories that21    categorically exclude prisoners based on preconditions.22              QUESTION:  So your answer to Justice Scalia's23    question is basically yes.  Is that correct?24              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Yes.25              QUESTION:  If the Bureau of Prisons had a21 1    categorical rule that extreme recidivists, someone who had 2    been convicted four times, has been in and out of prison, 3    that four-time offenders will not be released early, would 4    that be impermissible? 5              MR. MEIERHENRY:  I believe so, and I'm assuming 6    your question is nonviolent -- 7              QUESTION:  Yes. 8              MR. MEIERHENRY:  -- for nonviolent offenses.  I 9    think that's correct, that Congress considered that.  We10    may not like it, the Court may not like it.  Clearly the11    Bureau of Prisons doesn't like it.12              QUESTION:  So -- but essentially your argument13    then comes down to the may means shall.  It wouldn't make14    any difference if the word shall had been used, or must,15    that in this context may means shall or must.16              MR. MEIERHENRY:  It would mean that again the17    door -- in this case, there is no door to the prison wall,18    but it would make the difference between the natural19    discretion the Bureau of Prisons has over the activities20    of the prisoners inside, as opposed to their activities21    that occurred when they were just --22              QUESTION:  So your answer is no.  You don't want23    us to read may to be shall.  You want us to read may to24    mean may, but that the scope of the discretion only25    excludes -- only includes matters other than pre-221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9incarceration convictions, at least, right?          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Correct.  My argument is simplythat Congress created the excluding category, and that wasa violent offense, that the BOP, having created additionalexcluding -- not based on any activity in the prison,excluding categories, nothing in this act, legislativehistory, or the purpose of this, supports reducing thenumber of prisoners available for the incentive.  It isthe opposite.  It was an inclusive statute.          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,Mr. Meierhenry.          Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MS. BRINKMANN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The issue in this case is whether the Bureau ofPrisons permissibly exercised its discretion under section3621(e)(2)(B) as reflected in its regulation and program101112131415161718192021    statement.22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Ms. Brinkmann, I take it thatdiscretion was exercised in the regulation adopted by theBureau of Prisons.          MS. BRINKMANN:  The regulation and program                            23 1    statement that the Bureau of Prisons promulgated was a 2    statement of policy of how the Bureau of Prisons will 3    exercise its discretion. 4              QUESTION:  I notice that in an amicus brief it's 5    argued that the regulation was promulgated without 6    following the notice and comment requirements of the 7    Administrative Procedure Act, but I gather that issue was 8    not developed below and is not here. 9              MS. BRINKMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor.  It10    wasn't raised below nor in this Court, nor did the court11    below address it and, in fact, our understanding is that12    no court of appeals has addressed that argument, but we do13    believe, as we explain in a footnote in our brief, that it14    is not subject to the notice and comment requirement.15              It could go into effect as an interim16    regulation, because it is a statement of policy, the way17    in which the Bureau of Prisons will implement the statute,18    and then in each case there is a determination of whether19    a particular prisoner will be granted early release.20              QUESTION:  Are there any other instances of21    statutes -- are there any instances of statutes where the22    Bureau of Prisons is explicitly authorized to make23    distinctions and decisions based on preconviction conduct?24              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, Your Honor, many.  In fact,25    the good conduct time statute that we -- Mr. Meierhenry24 1    was discussing is in a neighboring provision.  It's in 2    section 3624.  It talks about the Bureau of Prisons 3    granting good conduct time, and there are two different 4    standards, and they're dependent on whether or not the 5    prisoner was convicted of a crime of violence, and in fact 6    this program statement also applies to that statute, 7    although there's no discretionary determination, so the 8    crime of violence is determined by the statutory 9    definition.10              QUESTION:  Well, do you think the bureau could11    switch back and forth under that section that you just12    referred to and say, although Congress said all nonviolent13    people should be treated this way, we think some of these14    should be treated the way violent people are?15              MS. BRINKMANN:  No, Your Honor.  We believe that16    that is a determination that Congress has made.17              QUESTION:  Why isn't the same true here, that18    Congress has said nonviolent offenders shall be eligible19    for this, and the Bureau of Prisons has said categorically20    some nonviolent offenders will not be eligible?21              MS. BRINKMANN:  Because of the broad grant of22    discretion given the Bureau of Prisons by the express23    statutory language, Congress using the term may.  There's24    nothing in the statutory text to suggest that the25    statutory eligibility requirements that Congress set,                                  251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425which are two, conviction of a nonviolent offense andsuccessful completion of the program, in any way theneliminate the ability of the Bureau of Prisons to considerother factors in making their determination.          QUESTION:  Suppose the bureau says, we're notgoing to release in 1 year anyone guilty of a hate crime,violent or not, we don't like people who commit hatecrimes, could they say that?          MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, Your Honor.  We think thatwould be subject to an arbitrary and capricious review,but very --          QUESTION:  Or offenses, you know, against theUnited States Treasury.  It really gets us mad.  I mean,it's one thing, you know, harming other private citizens,but boy, it really gets us mad when you steal somethingfrom the U.S. Treasury, so you're not going to be eligiblefor 1 year.          MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It would besubject to arbitrary and capricious review.  It's verysimilar to the situation before the Court in the case ofINS v. Yang.  That was a situation involving a waiver ofdeportation for persons who committed --          QUESTION:  Right.          MS. BRINKMANN:  -- fraud at entry.          QUESTION:  Why is a firearm use not arbitrary261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9and capricious, but -- and hate crime, is that arbitraryand capricious, or not?  You say that's okay?          MS. BRINKMANN:  We think within the broadexpertise of the Bureau of Prisons and --          QUESTION:  That's okay.          MS. BRINKMANN:  If the --          QUESTION:  Treasury, stealing from the Treasuryis not okay.  That's arbitrary and capricious.  Why?          MS. BRINKMANN:  We -- I don't believe it would1011121314151617181920212223    work.24              I gather it's a difficult thing, and there just25    isn't enough inducement for somebody to force himselfbe arbitrary and capricious.          QUESTION:  Oh.MS. BRINKMANN:  I think that --QUESTION:  So all of those are okay.MS. BRINKMANN:  They very well may be, YourHonor.  They would only be subject to arbitrary andcapricious to determine if there was some lack of totalpenalogical reason for that.          QUESTION:  Well, but isn't this argumentavailable to just that point, that it is perfectly clearfrom the legislative history that the object of allowingthe 1-year reduction is to provide an incentive withoutwhich the drug treatment program could not be expected to27 1    through this unless there really is going to be a 2    substantial reward, and it seems odd to me that if that is 3    the object, that Congress would have wanted, for example, 4    to exclude the entire class of gun carriers who are 5    obviously much more dangerous gun carriers, I assume, when 6    they're under the influence of drugs, from the inducement 7    that would lead, if the statistics are correct, to a 8    reduction in the number of drug-using gun-carriers.  Why 9    would they exclude the inducement from all of these10    serious categories?11              MS. BRINKMANN:  Several answers, Your Honor.12    First of all, there is a significant participation in the13    substance abuse treatment program of those who are not14    eligible for early release.  More than one-third of the15    prisoners that participate in this program --16              QUESTION:  Well, that may be, but the concern of17    the Congress was that we need an inducement to make our18    program effective.  Why -- if that is their premise, why19    would they exclude such large categories, or entire20    categories of offenders from that inducement?21              MS. BRINKMANN:  Congress' determination was that22    they would give the Bureau of Prisons the authority to23    grant that kind of incentive because, as Mr. Meierhenry24    said, otherwise the bureau --25              QUESTION:  Well, that's the conclusion, but in28 1    providing authority, why would they want to give the 2    Bureau of Prisons the authority to exclude entire 3    categories from an inducement which they thought was 4    necessary to make the program work? 5              MS. BRINKMANN:  The legislative history does not 6    support the proposition that the incentive is necessary 7    for participation.  Certainly it enhances participation, 8    but what Congress did was give that authority to the 9    Bureau of Prisons consistent with its repeated grant to10    the Bureau of Prisons of broad authority in recognition of11    the bureau's expertise --12              QUESTION:  Okay.13              MS. BRINKMANN:  -- in penalogical matters.14              QUESTION:  May I interrupt?  Help me out on the15    facts, then.  I had thought that there was an indication16    in the legislative history that there was a distinct17    difference between the expected successful completion rate18    with an inducement and the expected, or the actual19    successful completion rate without an inducement.  What am20    I thinking, if it's not in the legislative history?21              MS. BRINKMANN:  There was certainly evidence22    that there were State prison systems that had this type of23    incentive, and it was quite effective.  Congress --24              QUESTION:  Where was the evidence?  Was it25    brought before the Congress?291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. BRINKMANN:  I believe it was in somehearings, and there was some discussion in some of thereports concerning some -- a program in New York, forexample, but Congress did not then mandate that the Bureauof Prisons grant early release to everyone whosuccessfully completed the program.          QUESTION:  But don't you -- can we not fairlyinfer, might we perhaps not infer, be able to infer simplyfrom the text itself --101112131415161718192021222324    categories.25              MS. BRINKMANN:  -- only for certain categories.30MS. BRINKMANN:  No, we don't believe --          QUESTION:  -- that Congress thought theinducement was important, and if it thought the inducementwas important, why would it want to preclude theinducement from working in whole categories like this?          MS. BRINKMANN:  It wanted to give the Bureau ofPrisons the authority to decide --          QUESTION:  But that -- with respect, I don'tthink that goes to my question.  My question is, why wouldit want to allow the Bureau of Prisons to eliminate thisinducement entirely?          MS. BRINKMANN:  The Bureau of Prisons has noteliminated the inducement entirely --QUESTION:  For the categories -- for the 1    For the very reason that Congress repeatedly delegates 2    authority to the Bureau of Prisons in these matters. 3    Categorizing prisoners is the bread and butter of the 4    Bureau of Prisons.  They do it all the time. 5              QUESTION:  So you're saying we've got to look 6    beyond this statute to the fact that there is a whole 7    universe of statutes in which the Bureau of Prisons is 8    given quite extraordinary discretionary powers. 9              MS. BRINKMANN:  We point to that to support the10    clear text of the statute.  The statute does not mandate11    early release for any prisoner.12              QUESTION:  No, but the clear text just talks13    about discretion.  The question is, what is the category14    of discretion in which it can operate.15              You emphasize the expertise of the Bureau of16    Prisons, which it does seem to me is terribly important.17    They're experts on how well the prisoners have done in18    prison, but are they experts in classifying which people19    should be eligible for this offense?20              Why are they experts in saying, for example,21    hate crimes should be excluded but heroin possession might22    not, or something like that?  Why are they experts in23    that?  They don't even -- the whole notion of abolishing24    parole suggested that the prison expertise is just about25    what happens in prison, not what happened before.311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. BRINKMANN:  Your Honor, we would disagreewith that.  The Bureau of Prisons has expertise on a dailybasis of categorizing prisoners, for example, for securityclassifications.  The first thing that happens to aprisoner when they are placed in the custody of the Bureauof Prisons is a determination of what kind of housing thatperson should be in.  The main part of that determinationis their criminal history, their past conduct --          QUESTION:  But that all applies to theconditions of his confinement while he's there.  Do theyhave any expertise in determining recidivism and makingjudgments accordingly?          MS. BRINKMANN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  Theymake decisions about --          QUESTION:  What are the statutes which allowthem to do that?          MS. BRINKMANN:  They make decisions aboutfurlough.  That's granted authority to them by Congress,about the good conduct release, about placement incommunity correction centers.          QUESTION:  But those are things that happenin -- good conduct release determines the conduct inprison.  The furloughs depends on conduct in prison.          MS. BRINKMANN:  Your Honor, also it depends onthe criminal history of the individual, as does placement32 1    in a community correction facility. 2              We would also point out that the statutory text 3    granting this authority does not have any restrictions on 4    other factors that the Bureau of Prisons consider and, as 5    I mentioned before, it's very analogous in that respect to 6    INS v. Yang, where the Court recognized that although 7    Congress had provided a statute that allowed the Attorney 8    General to grant a deportation waiver to an alien who had 9    committed entry fraud, that that nonetheless still allowed10    the Attorney General to take into account circumstances11    surrounding the fraud in exercising their discretion12    whether or not to grant that waiver, and that's13    particularly the situation here.14              QUESTION:  So it would be permissible, I15    suppose, for the Bureau of Prisons to decide that any16    person who entered the country illegally would be17    ineligible for this program.18              MS. BRINKMANN:  Subject to arbitrary and19    capricious review.20              QUESTION:  Well, it wouldn't be arbitrary.  They21    just have experience that these people tend to be22    recidivists, or something like that.23              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, Your Honor, and all this24    does is eliminate one incentive to the program.  As I25    mentioned, there is substantial participation without it,33 1    and the Bureau of Prisons in its exercise of its expertise 2    and broad authority has also implemented other incentives 3    through regulation for the program. 4              QUESTION:  Ms. Brinkmann, may I ask how the 5    Bureau of Prisons implements this with respect to 6    possession of drug offenders who do not carry firearms? 7    Is that also categorical?  That is, does everyone who 8    commits a nonviolent offense without using a gun, who 9    successfully completes the program, do they as a category10    get a reduction?11              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes.  Any prisoner who12    successfully completes the program is granted -- and is13    convicted of a nonviolent offense is granted early14    release.  It may not be the full 12 months.15              QUESTION:  How is that?  You've just answered my16    first inquiry about, it's discretion both ways, exercises17    discretion to have categories of inclusion, exclusion.  If18    you fit that category you get released, so it's not that19    they're doing it case-by-case for people who commit20    nonviolent offenses without guns, but categorically for21 the other.22              MS. BRINKMANN:  Your Honor, it is case-by-case.23    Except, it's incorporated in this categorical24    determination of successful completion of the program.25    That incorporates any type of infractions, disciplinary341 problems -- 2              QUESTION:  Yes, but we passed that hurdle.3 Everyone -- 4              MS. BRINKMANN:  After all of that is completed, 5    yes, that is when early release is granted.  It may not be 6    up to 12 months, because in the exercise of discretion the 7    Bureau of Prisons tempers the amount of early release, 8    depending on the completion of the program. 9              For example, if a prisoner is sent to the10    community corrections facility the bureau ensures that11    they complete the 6-month transitional drug abuse program12    there, and that may cut into their year of early release.13    They may end up only getting 6 months of early release,14    for example.15              QUESTION:  Let's take the case of a nonviolent16    offender who does not come within the bureau's regulation17    as the gun, and so forth.  Do all of them get some form of18    early release, even though it's not the full 12 months?19              MS. BRINKMANN:  If they successfully complete20    the program, yes, Your Honor.  There are other categories,21    of course, as we point out in the brief, that are22    categorically denied early release, and for similar23    reasons in the expertise of the Bureau of Prisons has24    determined that they pose a greater threat to the25    community when they're released, prisoners with prior351    convictions for serious crimes such as homicide,2    aggravated rape and assault, and also prisoners whose3    current offense involves sexual abuse of children.  Those4    are also categorical determinations, and it is consist -- 5 6    offenses? 7 8    Your Honor, and the Bureau of Prisons has set forth this 9    regulation in order to further its purpose of consistency10    and even-handedness in applying this program, and to give11    fair notice to prisoners.12              I'd also like to emphasize that looking at the13    prior convictions and circumstances surrounding an14    offense, it's reasonable when predicting and looking at15    the threat to the danger of the community, because in fact16    that is all conduct that occurs in the community.17              One can say it's more rational, perhaps, to look18    at a prisoner's use of a gun when they were in a community19    when deciding what their conduct may be when they return20    to the community as a postinfraction during their term --21              QUESTION:  The difficulty with that argument,22    that assuming that the incentive does increase the success23    rate of the scheme, the Bureau of Prisons argument seems24    to say, we would rather have gun-carriers using drugs25    released a year later than former gun-carriers not using36QUESTION:  And they are regarded as nonviolentMS. BRINKMANN:  In some instances they may be, 1    drugs released a year earlier, and that doesn't seem quite 2    so rational. 3              MS. BRINKMANN:  We think that's precisely the 4    type of expertise, though, that Congress relies on the 5    Bureau of Prisons to bring to this type of decision. 6    That's why Congress did not -- 7              QUESTION:  No, but the way I just stated it, it 8    seems irrational, and are you saying that the Bureau of 9    Prisons has a reason to say that my factual assumptions10    just don't operate, that in fact the gun-carriers just do11    not seem to be subject to this inducement and therefore12    it's better not even to get into the question of early13    release?  Is that their reason?14              MS. BRINKMANN:  Their theory, as they set forth15    in the program statement, is that the use of a gun in the16    course of a drug transaction increases the likelihood of17    use of force and violence, and for that reason granting18    early release is not appropriate.  The full deterrent19    effect of serving the entire sentence is something that20    the Bureau of Prisons has determined is appropriate in21    those types of cases.22              QUESTION:  Ms. Brinkmann, can I go back to one23    of your responses to the Chief Justice?  When he pressed24    you on the question of previous convictions for violent25    crimes for -- you mentioned some specific crimes, and he37 1    asked, are they nonviolent crimes, and you said in some 2    instances they are, but in some instances -- or in some 3    instances they aren't, you said.  But in some instances4 they are. 5              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes. 6              QUESTION:  And I assume that if we read the may, 7    or more precisely if we read the excluded category of 8    violent, of persons in prison for a violent offense as 9    being exclusive, so that the Bureau of Prisons cannot add10    to that category, the result, I gather, would be that you11    could have somebody who happens to be in this time for a12    nonviolent offense, but who was convicted five times13    before of the most heinous, violent offenses, including14    murder, and that person would have to be released.15              MS. BRINKMANN:  Precisely, Your Honor.  It's the16    situation where the instant offense is a conviction for17    money laundering of the hit man who has many, perhaps even18    a series of convictions, whether in the Federal or the19    State system.  That's exactly the type of categories that20    the Bureau of Prisons looked to in deciding to exercise21    its discretion --22              QUESTION:  So it's quite plausible that when23    Congress was enacting this thing, that one thing was24    obvious, we don't want someone --25              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes.                                  381              QUESTION:  -- who's in there for a violent2    offense to get out a year early, and there may be some3    other categories, too.  We don't want to trouble to list4    all of them.  We'll leave the rest to the Bureau of5    Prisons.   You're asserting that that's what they did.6 7    is totally supported by the text, because of the point I 8    think Your Honor and some of the other members of the 9    Court made, when you look at the language of the10    neighboring statute using the word shall to mandate the11    provision of the substance abuse treatment program.  The12    Bureau of Prisons does not have discretion to not make13    available the substance abuse program to prisoners who are14    eligible, and the terminology in the statute for that is15    someone who --16              QUESTION:  That's not the point.  I mean, we're17    all agreed that it has discretion.  The issue is not18    whether it has discretion or not.  It's really -- it isn't19    the may that's the issue here.  The issue is whether that20    other provision, namely the disqualification of non -- of21    violent offenders is meant to be exclusive.  That's really22    the crucial provision here.23              MS. BRINKMANN:  And we believe it's clearly not,24    Your Honor.  That sets a statutory eligibility25    requirement, a threshold, but there's no indication that39MS. BRINKMANN:  Absolutely, Your Honor, and that1    then the Congress intended to impose restriction on2    factors that may be related to that eligibility.3              QUESTION:  Do we give the bureau chevron4    deference on that question as to whether that provision5    was meant to be exclusive or not?6              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, we believe so, Your Honor,7    and we believe that it's regulation here is a8    authoritative statement of its implementation of the9 statute.10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  May I ask about the regulation?  Thewhole regulation isn't quoted in your brief, but the partthat you have quoted on page 4 refers to the offense forwhich -- the current offense is a felony, b) that involvedthe carrying and so forth of a gun, so the regulationwe're fighting about in this case is one that speaks onlyto the current offense.          MS. BRINKMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Then is there another regulation thatdisqualifies people because of their recidivism character?          MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Petitioner hadactually provided the full regulation in their brief.It's in the blue brief, the appendix, beginning on page 3,and --          QUESTION:  3 of the appendix?          MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, and carrying over to40 1    page -- well, page 3, you have to see that (a)(1) explains 2    that in the exercise of discretion the Director of the 3    Federal Bureau of Prisons is deeming certain categories of 4    inmates not eligible for the early release.  The first one 5    is INS detainees, then we go on to pretrial inmates, 6    contractual boarders, all of which are ineligible for 7    reasons that are clear to the Bureau of Prisons in their 8    expertise of the management of prisons. 9              Subparagraph (4) talks about inmates who have a10    prior felony or misdemeanor conviction for homicide,11    forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, or child12    sexual abuse offenses.  The next category has to do with13    prisoners who are ineligible for the community-based14    corrections program.  Then we get down to subcategory (6),15    which talks about inmates whose current offense is a16    felony, and then there are four subcategories of those,17    one being the subcategory at issue here, a felony that18    involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm or19    other dangerous weapon.20              One of those other categories are offenses that21    are felony -- that involve sexual abuse committed against22    children.  The other two have to do with the actual23    attempt or threatened use of physical force.  The other is24    a felony that by its nature or conduct presents a serious25    potential risk of physical force against that person or411 property. 2              QUESTION:  Would that be a violent offense? 3    Probably not, I guess, huh? 4              MS. BRINKMANN:  One of the reasons that the 5    Bureau of Prisons set forth these was to ensure that it 6    had exercised its discretion in a regulatory manner 7    because of problems that had arisen with inconsistent 8    statutory interpretations by the lower Federal courts, 9    which create inordinate problems for the Bureau of Prisons10    because of the -- not only that they have personnel in11    different areas of the country implementing different12    standards, but also prisoners are frequently transferred13    between different circuits.14              So they set forth -- and as pointed out, some of15    these offenses could also be covered under the violent16    offense category, but they wanted to set forth, out of17    fairness to prisoners also, notice beforehand, and also18    for the even-handed administration of the incentive.19              QUESTION:  One argument that's made is, because20    a couple of circuits said the bureau was wrong initially21    when it typed people who carried guns in connection with22    possession offenses, drug possession offenses, typed them23    violent and then said the -- and then the prison24    responded, Bureau of Prisons responded by saying, we're25    not -- no longer categorizing them as violent offenders,42 1    we're exercising our discretion to exclude them. 2              That could be characterized as trying to do an 3    end run around the court of appeals decisions that said, 4    these crimes are not crimes of violence. 5              MS. BRINKMANN:  Your Honor, we do believe that 6    the Bureau of Prisons' initial regulation actually was a 7    permissible regulation.  They ran into problems in some 8    circuits because the courts -- because of their reference 9    to 924(c).  The court then held that they, the Bureau of10    Prisons, could not look to anything beyond the elements of11    the offense.  That was really the problem there.12              So the Bureau of Prisons came back and decided13    to, as a matter of discretion, exercise that authority and14    make clear.  We don't think there's anything impermissible15    about that.  In fact, it's consistent with16    well-established administrative law principles that a17    agency's hands cannot be tied because of the inartful18    drafting of a prior regulation.19              QUESTION:  You're saying end runs --20              QUESTION:  Ms. Brinkmann, if you'll go back to21    section 6 of appendix 4 of the petitioner's brief it says,22    sets forth four categories, has an element, the actual23    attempted or threatened use of physical force against the24    person or property of another, involve the carrying,25    possession, or use of firearm or other dangerous weapons43 1    or explosives, c) that by nature conduct presents a 2    serious potential risk.  What isn't included, other than 3    embezzlement and false tax returns? 4              MS. BRINKMANN:  Any kind of drug offenses, Your 5    Honor, that don't involve the use or carrying of a 6    firearm, certainly, and all kinds -- I mean, this doesn't 7    just have to be drug-related offenses. 8              I can tell you, there's a substantial 9    participation, Your Honor.  The Bureau of Prisons informed10    me that currently there are approximately 16,800 prisoners11    participating in the program at one of -- either on the12    wait list, in the residential program, or in the13    transitional program currently, and --14151617    it?18QUESTION:  Who are eligible?MS. BRINKMANN:  No, Your Honor.  30 percent --QUESTION:  Well, but that's not responsive, is                MS. BRINKMANN:  But Your Honor, at least19    one-third of those prisoners are not eligible for early20    release.  The real incentive in this program, Your Honor,21    is a life change, and that in fact --22              QUESTION:  But then you're saying the23    congressional -- Congress was wrong in providing an24    incentive.25              MS. BRINKMANN:  No, Your Honor.44 1              QUESTION:  It wasn't needed. 2              MS. BRINKMANN:  No, Your Honor, it is an 3    incentive.  It's a useful tool for the Bureau of Prisons 4    to use in implementing the drug abuse program and, as I 5    mentioned before, the Bureau of Prisons has, in fact, by 6    regulation promulgated other incentives having to do with 7    the prisoner being able to obtain the maximum time in a 8    community correction facility.  There are financial 9    incentives for completion of the various phases of the10    program.11          So that is the Bureau of Prisons implementingthe program and fulfilling the mandate that they makeavailable this program to any prisoner who has a substanceabuse program and wants to participate in it.1213141516171819202122232425    program?          QUESTION:  May I just ask, the 16,800 is a largenumber, but compared to how many people in prison?MS. BRINKMANN:  Approximately 130 to 140,000 --QUESTION:  About 10 percent, then.MS. BRINKMANN:  -- is the current population.QUESTION:  But how many are eligible asnonviolent offenders, of that total number?          MS. BRINKMANN:  Out of the 130 to 140 --          QUESTION:  Yes.  How many are there because ofnonviolent offenses and therefore eligible for this45 1              MS. BRINKMANN:  I don't have that information. 2    that was not ascertainable, and I also must say, Your 3    Honor, out of that number you'd have to winnow it down to 4    the prisoners who are actually statutorily eligible under 5    (e)(1), which means a prisoner who has a documented 6    substance abuse program and who are willing to participate 7    in this very rigorous program. 8              QUESTION:  Clarify one thing for me.  You don't 9    have to be not -- nonviolent is only for eligibility for10    the 1-year shortening of the sentence, but even a person11    guilty of a violent offense is eligible for the program,12    aren't they?13              MS. BRINKMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  Yes.15              MS. BRINKMANN:  And they're also eligible for16    the other incentives that the Bureau of Prisons provides.17              QUESTION:  But to get either in the program or18    the 1 year, you would have to have a history of drug19    abuse, so I -- is that --20              MS. BRINKMANN:  Yes, to be able to get into the21    program, that's correct.22              QUESTION:  So I guess if you were unfortunate23    enough not to have a history of drug abuse, you can't get24    that 1 year.25              MS. BRINKMANN:  That's true, Your Honor.461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  That's sort of tough, isn't it?          MS. BRINKMANN:  That was Congress'determination, because --          QUESTION:  I guess a lot of prisoners are tryingto show they had a history of drug abuse, right?(Laughter.)          MS. BRINKMANN:  The bureau -- unfortunately,there is a very high percentage of Federal prisoners thatdo have problems, but again it goes back to thedetermination that Congress wanted to provide the Bureauof Prisons with this authority that it could grant thisearly release.  The Bureau of Prisons does not have anyauthority or discretion without this statutory provisionto grant anyone early release.          If there's nothing further, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann.          Mr. Meierhenry, you have 4 minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK MEIERHENRY                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  Counsel, I assume under your argumentthat we would have to strike down subsection 4 of theregulation, which applies to inmates who have a priorfelony or misdemeanor.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Yes, Your Honor, I think that's                            471 correct. 2              To answer statistically, and my source is the 3    website of the Bureau of Prisons, there -- as of August of 4    2000 there were 63,621 inmates, or 56.9 percent of all the 5    inmates in Federal prison were there for drug-related 6    charges.  The Bureau of Prisons also shows on their 7    website that 2,633 people in 1999 got the incentive. 8              QUESTION:  Could I ask you about your response 9    to Justice Kennedy?  I suppose you could have a theory10    that the only thing that's explicitly excluded is an11    additional disqualification based upon the offense for12    which you're sentenced, because use of a gun involves the13    very offense for which he's serving, right?14              You don't have to carry the burden of saying15    that recidivism or a prior violent crime can't be taken16    into account, because that is not the condition that17    Congress has set forth.  The only condition Congress spoke18    to was the very offense for which you're sentenced.19              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Correct, as a convicted person,20    and maybe my definition isn't quite right, but I mean,21    when you -- even when you get the chevron, the gap here,22    there is no gap.  Congress didn't create a gap.23    Nonviolent, convicted person.24              What they left the discretion to is the25    treatment or the actions of the prisoners, and those481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9judgments within -- once he was prisoner.  I mean, thesection where --          QUESTION:  Well, but Justice Scalia's questionwould push it further than that and say it also, as Iunderstood it, would leave discretion to acts committedlong before you were sentenced this time.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  And I don't -- Congress did notaddress that.  Congress did not address that.          QUESTION:  Well, even if --          QUESTION:  Well, if Congress didn't address it,why doesn't it fall within the -- I mean, it doesn'treally affect your case, it but affects the argumentperhaps.  Why doesn't that thing fall within the bureau's1011121314    discretion?1516171819202122232425          MR. MEIERHENRY:  Because Congress, in creatingthe incentive --          QUESTION:  Why do you want to hold that ground?          QUESTION:  You should -- it seems to me yourposition is, subparagraph (6) would have to go entirely,not just (6)(b), but subparagraph (4) would not have to gounder that theory.          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. MEIERHENRY:  I think one of the questionsasked by one of the members of the bench in theINS v. Yang that my colleague brought up, some 4 years49 1    ago, she was asked about the authority of the Attorney 2    General, and the question was, it's a longer question, but 3    the last part was, would it be within her, the Attorney 4    General's discretion to say, I will never exercise my 5    discretion in favor of a waiver, and Ms. Brinkmann 6    answered, yes, Your Honor, we believe it would be. 7              In the opinion, joined by all of you, it said, 8    it could be argued that if the Attorney General determined 9    that any entry, fraud or misrepresentation, no matter how10    minor, no matter what the attendant circumstances, would11    cause her to withhold waiver, she would be exercising --12    she would not be exercising the conferred discretion at13    all, but would be making a nullity of the statute.  That's14    my argument.  The BOP is making a nullity of the15    incentive.16              QUESTION:  We didn't say that argument was17    right.18              MR. MEIERHENRY:  I understand that --19              QUESTION:  We just said it could be argued,20 right?21              MR. MEIERHENRY:  but I think it summarized --22              QUESTION:  And you're proving that it can be23 argued.24              (Laughter.)25              MR. MEIERHENRY:  Your Honors, we would ask the501 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court to overrule the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals andfind that the discretion that the BOP has is attendant towithin-the-prison and not preconviction activities.Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,Mr. Meierhenry.  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)51
