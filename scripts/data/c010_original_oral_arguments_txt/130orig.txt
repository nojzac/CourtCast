STERN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          Before the Court today is Maine's motion todismiss New Hampshire's complaint on res judicata grounds.By its complaint, New Hampshire seeks to redraw itsboundaries --          QUESTION:  Would you speak up a little, please?          MR. STERN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Maybe you can raise the podium andit'll be closer.          MR. STERN:  I apologize.  By its complaint, NewHampshire seeks with redraw its boundary with Maine bymoving the border from the middle of the river ontoMaine's shoreline along the Piscataqua River.  In 1976,this Court held that the King's 1740 order permanentlyfixed the boundary as the, quote, middle of the river,closed quote.  The consent decree approved by this Court3         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    in 1977, according to New Hampshire at the time in a brief 2    reproduced at 149a of New Hampshire's Appendix, that 3    decree, quote, contains specific findings and rulings and 4    sets forth the precise factual basis and legal principles 5    upon which it, the decree, is founded, closed quote. 6              Paragraph three of that decree sets forth the 7    pertinent provision of the 1740 King's order, the, quote, 8    middle of the river, closed quote, language. 9              Paragraph four of that decree is a ruling or10    legal principle or finding that as used in the 1740 order,11    quote, middle of the river, closed quote, means, not12    surprisingly, middle of the Piscataqua River, middle river13    of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.14              QUESTION:  If we agree with your position, does15    it become important or do we decide here, or does it16    remain in dispute whether the middle means the geographic17    middle or the middle of the channel?18              MR. STERN:  No, paragraph four of the 197719    decree specifically held or noted or ruled that as used in20    the 1740 order, quote, middle of the river, closed quote,21    means middle of the main channel of navigation of the22    Piscataqua River.  In fact --23              QUESTION:  But what I guess I'm asking is, is it24    necessary then, if your position is to be maintained, that25    we refer to our own earlier decree as opposed to simply4               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    relying on the 1740 decree?  Is this issue going to come 2    up again, or does that depend on how we write the 3    decision, if you prevail? 4              MR. STERN:  Hopefully it will not come up again, 5    since this is the third time it's come up.  The 1976 6    opinion of this Court confirmed that the 1740 King's 7    decree permanently fixed, permanently set the boundary as 8    the, quote, middle of the river, closed quote. 9              QUESTION:  Where is that in the Appendix?10              MR. STERN:  That would be the Commissioner's11    report is at, I believe, 14a attached to our Appendix, or12    attached to our brief.  And I believe that 21a or 22a is13    the King's affirmance of that.14              QUESTION:  Well, now, the 1977 consent decree I15    thought had to do with the lateral marine boundary from a16    point going out to sea.  And I did not think that it dealt17    actually with the upriver area at all and the island where18    the naval base is now.  Am I right?19              MR. STERN:  No, Your Honor.20              QUESTION:  No?21              MR. STERN:  At the --22              QUESTION:  Where is it -- it is not at 14a -- at23    least not on 14a of your brief.  I mean, that's what I'm24    looking for.25              MR. STERN:  I apologize, Your Honor.  It's 7a.5               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    Two points I'd like to make in response to your questions.2 First --3              QUESTION:  It's not 7a either.  You want to try4    again?  You're talking about your brief in opposition to5    the motion to dismiss?67 party. 8 9    got you.  I'm looking at the wrong -- I'm with you now.10              MR. STERN:  Second paragraph.11              QUESTION:  7a.12              MR. STERN:  Second paragraph.  And it is13    affirmed, I believe, on 21 or 22a.14              Getting back to your question, Your Honor -- two15    points I'd like to make.  First, by necessity the terminus16    point of the lateral marine boundary from the Isle of17    Shoals to the river -- you have to determine where the18    location of the boundary is in the river.  That's clear19    from the very first pleading, the complaint filed by New20    Hampshire in 1973 where on the very first page they state21    that the boundary between the two States is described in22    the 1740 King's decree as the middle of the river.  So by23    necessity, one --24              QUESTION:  Yeah, but the question might then25    become whether it follows the thalweg or it doesn't, and6               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR. STERN:  No.  Our brief -- we're the movingQUESTION:  Oh, I'm sorry.

It may not in relation to this island where thenaval base is.          MR. STERN:  The decree on its face in paragraphfour, without reservation, gives meaning to the phrase,quote, middle of the river, from the 17 --          QUESTION:  And what page is that on?          MR. STERN:  Excuse me, Your Honor?          QUESTION:  Page four, which is where?  I'm stilllooking for the decree.  I can't find it.          MR. STERN:  You mean the --          QUESTION:  The '76 decree -- that's what we'retalking about, isn't it?          MR. STERN:  The 1977 decree is reproducedattached to the United States brief -- the gray brief --and I believe the --          QUESTION:  That's what I've been asking for.I'm trying to read this --          MR. STERN:  I misunderstood, Your Honor. Ithought you were referring to the 1740 decree.  If onelooks at 2a, paragraph four, without reservation, givesmeaning to the term, quote, middle of the river, closedquote, from the 1740 decree as the middle of the mainnavigational channel of the Piscataqua River.  Paragraphfive that I wanted to get to applies that principle to the7         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    river.  It applies the principle by laying out a mile 2    portion of the river from its mouth all the way up to 3    Fishing Island. 4              Of note, in the dissenting opinion written by 5    Justice White, it's noted that Maine strongly objected to 6    the proposed geographic midline of the special master 7    because of the substantial areas that Maine would lose to 8    New Hampshire in both the river and harbor and seaward 9    thereof.  Before this Court, Maine's Assistant Attorney10    General argued, and it's at 104 to 105a of New Hampshire's11    Appendix, that as much of an objection as Maine had to the12    effect of the geographic line with respect to losing13    territory off the coastline outside the harbor, Maine felt14    much more -- a much greater prejudice from the effects15    inside the harbor.  To the extent that the impression has16    been left that nobody was thinking about it or nobody was17    arguing with respect to the rest of the river, that simply18    is not true from both the --19              QUESTION:  But the point is that I at least20    looked at New Hampshire's complaint here as resting on an21    allegation that the division is the low-water mark of the22    Maine shore.  That has nothing to do with -- and doesn't23    require us to determine whether we follow the thalweg or24    the geographic middle of the river if we applied the old25    King's decree.  But you could deal with your motion and8               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    say, sure, we dismiss it because at least it isn't that 2    the low-water mark of the Maine shore, and not decide 3    whether it means the thalweg or the geographic middle of4 the river. 5              MR. STERN:  Exactly, Your Honor. 6              QUESTION:  We could do that, and that would mean 7    they could come back here a fourth time, I assume. 8              MR. STERN:  I assume, yes. 9              QUESTION:  But to do that we would just as much10    have to rely upon the fact that the only thing which the11    1977 decree technically held, mainly the outward line,12    depended upon a calculation of what the line within the13    river was.  We'd still have to make that conclusion.  And14    while we're making that conclusion, we may as well go the15    whole hog and accept what that decree said was, namely the16    middle of the channel of navigation, rather than the17    geographic middle.  Isn't that logical?18              MR. STERN:  That's logical.  Either approach19    would result in the motion --20              QUESTION:  Well, I think the other approach is21    illogical.  I mean, there's no basis for saying that we22    can resolve this matter without deciding where it is in23    the River, because the only thing the decree says is that24    the line outward into the ocean depends upon the line25    inward in the harbor and in the river, and it then goes on9               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    to say, and that line is the middle of the navigation 2    channel, so it seems to me if we buy into the binding 3    effect of the decree, we buy into the middle of the 4    navigation channel. 5              MR. STERN:  We agree, Your Honor.  To the extent 6    that there's a suggestion that New Hampshire had no reason 7    or no incentive to press a claim to the shoreline back in 8    the 1970s, that is simply wrong.  Indeed, in response to 9    the special master's report, New Hampshire filed10    exceptions seeking to move the middle of the river line11    three hundred and fifty feet closer to Maine's shore.  If12    the shoreline boundary was correct, if they pressed it13    back then, the line would be moved not three hundred and14    fifty feet but over half a mile onto Maine's shoreline,15    obviously resulting in a substantial additional amount of16    territory being in New Hampshire rather than Maine.17              To the extent that there is the suggestion that18    the middle of the river could possibly mean the shoreline,19    that's defused by New Hampshire's own -- not only the20    decree on its face, paragraph four in particular and its21    application in paragraph five, but also with respect to22    New Hampshire's own pleadings at the time, own briefs,23    where at -- in a brief at 459a of Maine's Appendix, New24    Hampshire explained that when, quote, middle of the river,25    closed quote, must be interpreted, there are two possible10               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    interpretations -- thalweg or geographic middle.  New 2    Hampshire at the time did not identify Maine's shoreline 3    as a possibility, because New Hampshire had the -- 4              QUESTION:  Just as a matter of English usage, it 5    seems that when you're talking about the middle of the 6    river it would not be Maine's shoreline. 7              MR. STERN:  That's what we have been saying, 8    Your Honor.  We are here on a complaint seeking to in 9    effect that, quote, middle of the river, closed quote,10    does not mean the middle of the river, but it gets more11    peculiar because as a result of the decree in 1977, at12    least the first mile of the river is laid out as the13    middle of the river.  New Hampshire appears to agree that14    once we get up to the head of tide near Salmon Falls, we15    jumped back into the middle of the river again, because16    apparently the 1740 decree describes the boundary up there17    as the middle of the Nuashanog.18              So the middle of the river means middle of the19    river at the mouth.  Middle of the river means middle of20    the river at its head, but middle of the river does not21    mean middle of the river, according to New Hampshire, in22    the middle section of the River.  It becomes even more23    peculiar, because it appears that New Hampshire concedes24    that virtually all, if not all, of the islands on Maine's25    side of the middle of the river, except the Shipyard11               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    Island, are in Maine.  So it would have this jogging 2    boundary with all of the islands except one in the State3 of Maine. 4              QUESTION:  But the last time around there wasn't 5    any actual adjudication.  As I understand it, the special 6    master said that the geological line, and this Court said, 7    no, the parties have agreed on what middle of the river 8    means, but it was -- one could say that agreement was for 9    that controversy, and then all bets are off, and we're10    talking about a different portion.11              MR. STERN:  We would disagree with that for a12    number of reasons.  First, we've argued both claim and13    issue preclusion.  And our view is because the transaction14    of the meaning and applicability of the 1740 King's decree15    was before the Court in the 1970s, in particular with16    respect to the location of the boundary in the river, New17    Hampshire is precluded from today coming in presenting a18    different theory as to the meaning and applicability of19    the 1740 decree.20              QUESTION:  First, on claim preclusion, it isn't21    the same claim because it was one portion that was in22    contention in '77 and a different portion now, so I don't23    see how it could be claim preclusion.  The dispute over24    lobster fishing is not dealing with the same land as the25    current case, is that right?12               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. STERN:  Not exactly, because back in the 2    1970s, as it has been explained previously, by necessity 3    it was essential to determine the location of the boundary 4    in the river and, in fact, the decree applied the 5    principle to a portion of the river.  But we understand, 6    as is obvious by comparing the United States' brief and 7    Maine's brief, that reasonable minds can differ as to 8    whether we're talking about a claim or an issue.  We 9    believe the claim preclusion and issue preclusion are10    different paths that get to the same spot res judicata,11 but --12              QUESTION:  The difference is that claim13    preclusion would favor you to the extent that it doesn't14    matter what was actually litigated if it's part of the15    whole claim.16              MR. STERN:  Exactly.17              QUESTION:  Issue preclusion, it usually does18    matter whether it was actually litigated.19              MR. STERN:  Yes.  If it is a, quote, consent20    decree, closed quote, and we would argue that this is not21    the type of consent decree described in, for example,22    International Building, because here this Court made an23    independent determination that the 1740 King's Order and24    not the proposed consent decree permanently fixed the25    boundary as the middle of the river.

MINEAR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may15    it please the Court:16              The United States submits that Maine's current17    suit is barred by this Court's 1976 decision and its 197718    decree in New Hampshire v. Maine, No. 64, Original.  And19    we think to understand 64 Original, it's useful to look at20    a map here.  New Hampshire has provided a lodging of maps,21    and I would refer you if you have a copy to map four,22    which shows the consent decree line.23              QUESTION:  What?24              MR.

Now, map --          QUESTION:  Some of us don't have it, Mr. Minear.          MR. MINEAR:  Okay, perhaps I can describe theline and that might be helpful to understand the operationof the consent decree in 1977.          This consent decree did provide for adescription of the lateral marine boundary which runsperpendicular to what would be the coastline of Maine andNew Hampshire.                QUESTION:  For those of us that do have it, what      is the page?                MR. MINEAR:  It's map number four.  It's tab                In any event, the line that was drawn here15    includes the lateral marine boundary.  But by terms of the16    consent decree, it also extended the line up into the17    harbor.  This is the line that runs almost north-south18    that is marked here.  That is -- that line is described in19    paragraph five of the consent decree.  You notice it's a20    straight line, and the reason why it's a straight line is21    it follows the range of lights that mariners use to22    navigate up the channel, and that's why we call this the23    main channel of navigation.24              And you'll see it ends at a point where there is25    another line that crosses perpendicular almost east-west.15               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO10111213    four.141    That's another set of range lights where people who are2    navigating would follow as well, going further up the3    river.  But the important point to recognize with regard4    to the consent decree is that it did define the channel as5    the middle of the river, as the middle of the main channel6    of navigation, and it extended that line up into the river7    to a considerable decree.8              QUESTION:  When you say that definition of the 9    middle of the river, the main channel -- is that the10    thalweg, or just the channel that is in fact used by the11 ships?12              MR. MINEAR:  I think in actuality it is the13    channel that is in fact used by the ships.  As Justice14    White pointed out in his dissent in No. 64 Original, the15    thalweg would normally follow the deepest channel or where16    the current is fastest, and so it would not necessarily be17    a straight line.  But by the terms of the consent decree,18    and as the line that is drawn show in here, they19    compromised their meaning of the consent --their meaning20    of the 1740 Order by using where the ships actually21    travel.2223242516               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  And how does that help us as weproceed north through -- beyond Seavey Island?          MR. MINEAR:  Seavey Island is to the left -- tothe west of this line.  And if one were to draw the line 1    consistently with the '64 decree, one would travel east- 2    west along those range lights.  They're very faintly 3    marked, and they begin at, actually at Pierce's Island 4    which is not marked here, but up north you see Seavey5 Island. 6              The important point for purposes of the motion 7    to dismiss is under any interpretation of the 1740 decree 8    we think that New Hampshire's complaint must be dismissed. 9              QUESTION:  The argument is being made that the10    normal conditions for issue preclusion are met here11    because this was not an ordinary consent decree -- that12    the Court really had to make a legal determination because13    of the special nature of the Court's responsibilities with14    regard to boundary disputes between the States.  If that15    is true, I can't understand how the Court could have16    simply invented -- certainly in 1740 they meant either the17    thalweg or the geographic center of the river.  I mean18    -- I don't think anybody thought in 1740 they meant the19    usual channel of navigation.  Did anybody say that?20              MR. MINEAR:  Well, Maine was making that21    argument, and it wasn't ultimately resolved.  Of course,22    the master disagreed with the consent judgment that was23    proposed on the basis that it should have been the24    geographic middle, and this Court rejected that argument.25              Now, the Court made two legal rulings and --17               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  Well, you say the Court actually 2    decided that that's what the 1740 document meant? 3              MR. MINEAR:  No, rather what the Court said in 4    its 1976 decision was first that it's clear that the 1740 5    Order of the King controls here, and it's the middle of 6    the river.  And second, that the parties are entitled to 7    compromise their claim because this is a reasonable 8    interpretation of the decree, not perhaps the only 9    interpretation of the 1740 decree, but one that was10    permissible.  And I don't think the Court wants to go back11 and --12              QUESTION:  The 1740 decree reasonably referred13    to harbor lights that were planted out there in what,14 1960?15              MR. MINEAR:  No, I think what the Court was16    suggesting is they could have -- that that decree could17    reasonably describe what was the main channel of18    navigation, however that was determined at that time.  And19    of course boundaries are ambulatory, they move, and maybe20    the main channel of navigation is followed differently21    then as now.  But for purposes of resolving this dispute,22    the Court accepted the parties' agreement that the range23    light line would be used to determine the main channel of24    navigation as to this settlement.25              We think that the Court's consent decree does18               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    preclude further litigation, at least to the extent that 2    certainly the middle of the river is not on the low-water 3    mark.  And furthermore, we would argue that the main 4    channel of navigation should be continued to be used to 5    continue up the river.  To do otherwise would provide a 6    discontinuous line, and we do think the 1740 Order of the 7    King ought to be interpreted in one way as we go from the 8    mouth of the harbor up the river.  Any other 9    interpretation will lead to discontinuous lines the Court10    will have to connect.  New Hampshire suggests that's all11    right, you simply use your equitable powers.  We suggest12    that the better approach here is to read the consent13    decree as reasonably determining that the King's Order14    would have one meaning for purposes of the 1740 Order, and15    that should be applied consistently throughout the length16    of the river.17              QUESTION:  Is the --18              QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, which preclusion19    principle are you relying on?  Because it seems to me it20    doesn't fit claim preclusion.  It is a different claim21    that's being made here.22              MR. MINEAR:  We rely on issue preclusion.23              QUESTION:  And even though the Court didn't24    actually adjudicate anything, it accepted the parties'25    submissions.19               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. MINEAR:  Well, the Court did adjudicate the 2    question of whether the 1740 Order controls.  It found it 3    necessary to reach that issue in order to enter the 4    consent decree. 5              As to the line that was drawn, this Court noted 6    in Arizona v. California, and it noted in United States v. 7    International Building Company that if questions of law in 8    fact are resolved in a consent judgment, those can be 9    binding on the party.  And we think it's reasonable to10    read this consent judgment as providing a single11    interpretation of middle of the river, it would apply12    henceforth to all applications of the 1740 decree.  After13    all, this decree only affects these two states.  It's14    reasonable for them to conclude, when they drew the15    boundary, that they were looking at one definition.16              And in fact, the text of the order suggests --17    of the 1977 decree suggests that as well.  It says what18    the word middle of the river means, not what it's meant to19    -- what it's deemed to mean for purposes of this case20    only.  If the parties -- the parties were well-21    represented.  And if the parties had intended that this22    case was only good -- that this ruling was only good for23    this stretch of the river, they would have clearly24    indicated that by the terms of the consent decree and they25    would have put the Court on notice that that's exactly20               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what it was determining.          QUESTION:  What is -- that vertical blue linethat you're talking about on map four?          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.          QUESTION:  On paragraph five of the decree itsays it proceeds southward as indicated by the rangelights located in the vicinity of Pepperell Cove andKittery Point.  Is that what they're talking about?          MR. MINEAR:  Yes. They're going, moving fromsouth -- from north to south.          QUESTION:  So it starts -- so that phrase inparagraph five is meant to pick up the top of thatvertical leg and go down.          MR. MINEAR:  That's right.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. MINEAR:  And the reason that they say in thevicinity is they start at that point with the two rangelines intersected.          QUESTION:  All right.  And so this all comesfrom some map?  The range line is marked on the coast ingeodetic survey chart, 211, et cetera.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  Now, the current charts, ifthe Court is interested in looking at the current nauticalcharts, they're NOAA charts 13278 and 13283.

LUDTKE                ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF          MS. LUDTKE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I'd like to start by framing what appears to bethe central issue before the Court, and that issue is asfollows: Maine and the United States argue that NewHampshire is bound by its position in the 1976 caseconcerning the meaning of the 1740 boundary decree. Thatcase involved the determination of the State's lateralmarine boundary that ran between the mouths of PortsmouthHarbor and Gosport Harbor.          Now the boundary decree in question which wasissued as an order in council in 1740, describes theboundary as follows, and I will paraphrase thedescription.  The boundary passes up through the mouth ofPiscataqua Harbor and up the middle of the river into theriver Newichwannock and through the same to the furthesthead and it divides the Isle of Shoals.  In 1976 Maine and22         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    New Hampshire agreed that three phrases in the 1740 decree 2    had relevance in determining the location of their lateral 3    marine boundary, and those phrases were as follows. Phrase 4    number one: The boundary passes up through the mouth of 5    the harbor.  Phrase two: It passes up the middle of the 6    river.  And phrase three, it divides the Isle of Shoals. 7              Since that time, New Hampshire has determined 8    for good historical reasons after a searching review of 9    original records and maps that the phrase up the middle of10    the river has no relevance to determining the location of11    the boundary in the harbor and the tidal portions of the12    Piscataqua River.13              Maine and the United States claim that the14    stipulation in 1976 preludes New Hampshire from arguing in15    this case that that phrase, up the middle of the river,16    has no application to the location of the boundary in17    Portsmouth Harbor.  New Hampshire contends that it isn't18    precluded from arguing that, because that phrase, up the19    middle of the river, was not essential to this Court's20    jurisdiction to enter judgment approving the consent21    decree.  We say that it wasn't essential to the Court's22    jurisdiction and we say that if anything, it impeded this23    Court's ability to enter that Order.24              QUESTION:  You're -- about how you argued in25    1977, you said we said, which I take it is something that23               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516    navigation.17              MS.

Paragraph four.  The terms,2    middle of the river and middle of the harbor.  Now,3    certainly middle of the harbor was essential to drawing a4    line outward into the lobster beds.  Do you think middle5    of the harbor means something different from middle of the6 river?7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. LUDTKE:  That means the middle of GosportHarbor, Your Honor.  The boundary line, the lateral --          QUESTION:  And it means -- it means the --          MS. LUDTKE:  -- marine boundary line goesthrough the middle of Gosport.          QUESTION:  The regular channel of navigationthrough the harbor, and you think that middle of the riverdoes not mean the regular channel of navigation throughthe river.  That's rather odd it seems to me.          MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, New Hampshire has verycarefully reviewed the historical documents pertaining tothe 1740 Order and the way in which that language was usedin that 1740 Order.          QUESTION:  Well, just focusing on number fourfor a minute.  It said the terms middle of the river asused in the above quarter mean, then I'll interpolate, (a)the middle of the main channel of navigation of thePiscataqua River, and (b) the middle of the main channelof navigation of Gosport Harbor.  So those are -- those26         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    are conjunctive phrases each having their own meaning, are2 they not? 3              MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct.  The term middle of 4    the river refers to the main channel of navigation in the 5    Piscataqua River, which is then defined by the ships' 6    range light line.  The term, middle of the harbor, means 7    the middle of the main channel of navigation through 8    Gosport Harbor, which is in the Isle of Shoals. 9              QUESTION:  All right.  So then it goes on to10    define what they're talking about, and they say the middle11    of the main channel of navigation, and that's why I ask12    this question, and they say is that blue line.  Okay?  So13    that's what it says right in the decree.  It says it's14    that blue line.  I mean, at least that's what I was told.15              Paragraph five of that decree means exactly as16    if it were written, that blue line.17              MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct, Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  All right.  So what's the issue?19    Here you agree and they agree that in a consent decree20    entered by the Court that the channel is that blue line.21    And now you're saying it's not that blue line.  All right,22    why?232425          MS.

It is not a continuous line.          QUESTION:  So can you -- I'm sorry that I may be-- looking at map four, what part are you talking about?          MS. LUDTKE:  Looking at map four, the line thatproceeds from here to here, the top towards PepperrellCove, at the turn, represents the 1956 ships' range lightline --          QUESTION:  Right.          MS. LUDTKE:  -- determined by that.  Itterminates --          QUESTION:  Which is the blue dogleg.          MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MS. LUDTKE:  And it terminates, by definition,at the shore right here.  We've supplied the United Statescoast and geodetic map.  It terminates, by definition, atthe shore, which is the location of a ships' range lights.          QUESTION:  What is it New Hampshire wants?          MS.

LUDTKE:  This case is not about the locationof the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard -- it's about theboundaries of New Hampshire, and it's about whether NewHampshire has rights to Portsmouth Harbor thathistorically have been New Hampshire's.  Our case goesback to 1679 when New Hampshire was created as a royalprovince and the Port of Piscataqua, later the Port of NewHampshire, was annexed to New Hampshire.  We historicallyhave controlled and governed the harbor, our claim goes tothe fact that the historical documents show that at thetime of the American Revolution --          QUESTION:  But shouldn't all of this have beenfleshed out in the 1976 case?          MS. LUDTKE:  In 1976 the parties had no motive                            29         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    or reason to litigate these issues.  The key matter at 2    issue in the 1976 litigation concerned New Hampshire's 3    desire for a straight line lateral marine boundary.  And 4    there have been a number of maps filed that shows the 5    respective claims of the parties, and I'll refer you 6    specifically to map number eleven which shows all the 7    different boundary claims.  And people had a lot of 8    different ideas about where the boundaries should be in 9    the lateral marine area.10              QUESTION:  That's with the -- these are all --11    that refers to the 1976 litigation?12              MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And13    the location of the starting point was intended to achieve14    one purpose as far as New Hampshire was concerned, and15    that was to accomplish a straight line lateral marine16 boundary.17              QUESTION:  But if in fact the choice of that18    starting point also leads to other perfectly logical19    conclusions, isn't New Hampshire bound by that?20              MS. LUDTKE:  No, Your Honor.  New Hampshire is21    not bound by that because there was no actual adjudication22    of the issues in 1976.  No inference can be raised that23    the parties intended to adjudicate that, and I will24    address that specifically with respect to the continuity25 argument.30               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  May I just ask -- you say there was 2    no actual adjudication, but paragraph four was a subject 3    of dispute within this Court.  Three of us dissented from 4    paragraph four.  How can you say there wasn't an actual 5    decision on that point? 6              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, I think that the 7    question on whether there was an actual decision goes to 8    the matter of whether that stipulation was essential to 9    the Court's authority to enter the decree.  And the Court10    could have entered the decree as a valid agreement of the11    parties establishing the location of the boundary simply12    by reference to the phrase in the 1740 decree that13    describes the boundary as passing up through the mouth of14    Piscataqua Harbor.15              And the point that I attempted to make before is16    that if anything, that was an impediment.  The Court17    entered the decree despite that, not because of it, and18    the reason is is because there's no legal authority for19    using a modern ships' channel as a divisional principle in20    boundary cases.  There are a number of boundary cases that21    do use ships' channel, but the ships' channel is always22 --23 24 25          QUESTION:  But you're just repeating JusticeWhite's argument.          MS. LUDTKE:  Pardon?                            31         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  You're just repeating Justice White's 2    argument that the Court rejected. 3              MS. LUDTKE:  And well -- that's why I think that 4    the 1976 order issued by this Court does stand for the 5    proposition that the States have broad latitude in coming 6    to agreement as to the location of a boundary when the 7    underlying boundary instrument is imprecise, and I think 8    the second corollary of that is this Court need not 9    adjudicate the actual true and correct historical meaning10    of the underlying decree in approving such an agreement of11    the parties.12              And I think later on in the Multistate Tax13    Commission that we've cited in our brief, in that case the14    Court explicitly cited this case as well as the Virginia15    v. Tennessee case for the proposition that an approval of16    an agreement relative to a boundary line didn't implicate17    the Commerce Clause when the underlying instrument was18    imprecise.19              So I think it goes to the point of whether this20    Court could have approved that consent agreement entered21    into between New Hampshire and Maine, had that stipulation22    not been there, regarding the meaning of the phrase middle23    of the river.  And the answer to that has to be yes, and24    particularly for the reasons you state regarding the25    dissent that was raised, because there is no legal or32               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    historical authority for defining the term middle of the 2    river as it was used in 1740 to mean a ships' channel 3    marked by 1956 range lights that clearly was not located 4    at the location of the thalweg. 5              QUESTION:  Well, I think the Court would be 6    surprised to learn that the real disagreement between the 7    majority and the dissent in the case was not over where 8    the line was, but rather over whether you can accept the 9    parties' stipulation or not.  There is no indication in10    the writings as I recall it that that was the difference11    between the majority and the dissent.  I think both the12    majority and the dissent understood that they had to be13    determining what the line was, giving some allowance to14    the parties' concessions, but that the Court had a15    responsibility to determine the line.  Both opinions seem16    to indicate that, and you're telling us that the basic17    distinction is that the majority just thought that they18    had no responsibility to come to an independent19    determination.  I just don't read the order that way.20              MS. LUDTKE:  Well, the consent decree that was21    approved stated specifically in the first paragraph that22    the master's decision is approved, and the master's23    recommendation provided for a line at the geographic24    middle.  Then the dissent raised questions that it was not25    the thalweg -- no representation was made that it was the33               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    thalweg -- that it was a 1956 ship channel that was being 2    used, and raised questions about the legal authority of 3    those devices to determine a 1740 boundary. 4              New Hampshire at oral argument told the Court 5    this decision is arbitrary.  It's based on administrative 6    convenience, we want a straight boundary line.  And the 7    reason why that dogleg went up into the harbor instead of 8    emerged from a closing line is that Maine insisted at that 9    time that a closing line not be placed across the harbor10    so that it could take advantage of the reservation that11    this Court had allowed it in the United States v. Maine12    case to litigate the legal extent of its seaward13    boundaries.14              So this was not a case where the parties15    intended to negotiate or to conclude a boundary in the16    harbor.  The dogleg portion of it was done to accommodate17    Maine's interests in reserving its right to litigate the18    question of the legal extent of its seaward boundaries.19    Moreover, as the State has submitted to the Court, the20    Solicitor General at that time was expressing grave21    concern regarding the question of whether this would22    implicate rights in the United States v. Maine case by23    establishing a ruling that colonial charters had a legal24    effect in determining boundaries in the marginal sea.25              QUESTION:  Is your point this, that -- I look at34               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    that map four.  You say go to the top of the blue line, 2    and you say we're not talking about the blue line, we're 3    talking about a line that would be drawn to the left of 4    the top, past Seavey Island. 5              MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 6              QUESTION:  All right.  Now, you're also adding 7    that that blue line represents some kind of compromise in 8    the case that doesn't actually make very much sense but it 9    was a compromise.10              MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct, Your Honor.11              QUESTION:  So now you're saying whatever we12    might have done to compromise that blue line, we never13    said a word about the line that isn't there, and by the14    way, it wasn't in the case, the line that wasn't there, so15    we get to litigate that afresh.16              MS. LUDTKE:  That's absolutely correct.  The17    claim was a very different claim --18              QUESTION:  Okay, I understand.19              MS. LUDTKE:  As stated in the complaint, the20    claim was for the lateral marine boundaries that ran from21    the mouth --22              QUESTION:  Okay, is there any theory, is there23    any theory of law or common sense or anything that would24    say, all right, the blue line -- you draw the line at the25    lights, but the line, imaginary line, goes off to the left35               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    past Seavey's Island, you don't draw at the lights.  Now, 2    is there anybody other than a totally illogical person who 3    could defend that proposition? 4              MS. LUDTKE:  There's no line that is a natural 5    outgrowth of the line that terminates at the lights. 6    Those range lights were installed in order to allow 7    vessels to navigate up through that particular area. 8              QUESTION:  And there are no range lights the9 other way?10              MS. LUDTKE:  Well, there are actually some range11    lights at Pierce's Island, but those range lights weren't12    even discussed in the context of the 1976 case.13              QUESTION:  Ms. Ludtke, I mean, the one problem14    with what you're saying is that it just doesn't -- doesn't15    comport with what is said in the consent decree.  I mean,16    the consent decree doesn't say, oh, you know, let's just17    draw the line here arbitrarily, we have to draw it18    somewhere.  It begins by setting forth the Order of the19    King and Council of April 9, 1740, and it then continues20    as used in that Order of the King and Council the term --21    not just the term, middle of the harbor, but also the22    term, middle of the river, mean the middle of the main23    channel of navigation.  I mean, there's just no other way24    to read the consent decree except as addressing that25    precise issue and not coming to some just arbitrary, not36               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425based on the 1740 consent decree line through the middleof the harbor.  They thought that they were doing -- beingfaithful to the Order of the King and Council.          MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, I would disagree withthat based on the oral argument when New Hampshirerepresented to the Court that that was an arbitrarylocation based on the administrative convenience of theparties.  Moreover, it does --          QUESTION:  Where was that?  In the oralpresentation?  New Hampshire said what?          MS. LUDTKE:  New Hampshire in the oral argumentssaid that those locations were arbitrary and based on thedesire to serve the administrative convenience of theirrespective States.          QUESTION:  But that doesn't certainly mean thatMaine necessarily agreed with that.          MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, Maine did not take theposition at this time that this was a litigated issue orthat this was an issue that actually was tied to thehistorical location of the ships' channel --          QUESTION:  Well, then you shouldn't lie aboutit.  If you think it's arbitrary, you shouldn't sign apiece of paper that says the Order of the King and Councilsays this, and what that order means is this.          MS.

If you 3    believed it was arbitrary, you shouldn't have signed this 4    is seems to me, and I think we can hold you to what you5 sign. 6              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, the history of the 7    litigation shows that at the time that Maine and New 8    Hampshire entered into this decree, which was 1974, both 9    States did it with the best of intentions.  There was not10    a searching historical inquiry into what the phrase, up11    the middle of the river, might have meant.  Both States12    did it with the best intentions without a thorough inquiry13    into what the history was.14              QUESTION:  Well, at the very least it didn't15    mean the low-water mark on the Maine shore, did it?  I16    mean, no matter what you had in mind, it was some version17    of the middle of the river.18              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, I think the question19    goes to the applicability of that phrase to describe the20    harbor boundary.  At that time both Maine and New21    Hampshire believed with the best of intentions and the22    best of understanding that that phrase applied to the23    harbor boundary.  We have since changed --24              QUESTION:  Excuse me, I just -- I don't think I25    had an answer to my question.  How could the term the38               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    middle of the river, which you agreed to, mean the 2    low-water mark on the Maine shore? 3              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, our position on the 4    term, up the middle of the river, means that -- we take 5    the position that as historically used that was intended 6    to describe the course of the boundary up the main part of 7    the Piscataqua River, and it was intended to direct that 8    the line that proceeded north two degrees west went from 9    the main tributary that was that the main feeder stream10    into the headwaters of the Salmon Falls River, and we have11    shown through the 1763 boundary proceedings and the 182812    boundary proceedings that that is how that term was used.13              We do not think that that term is properly14    applied to the harbor boundary.  In 1973, both Maine and15    New Hampshire and the special master all thought that term16    had some relevance to the harbor boundary, with the best17    of intentions, because there had not been a searching18    historical inquiry into what that language meant, and it19    was an easy mistake to make.20              QUESTION:  May I ask then --21              MS. LUDTKE:  The New Hampshire --22              QUESTION:  If I understand you correctly, if you23    were counsel for New Hampshire in 1976 and you then knew24    what you now know, would you have signed this decree?25              MS. LUDTKE:  No, Your Honor.  But that's not39               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    what they knew, and they did it with the best of 2    intentions. 3              QUESTION:  All right, so that's what worrying 4    me, that when I read this, until I heard you actually, I 5    thought, well, gee, I don't understand what this argument 6    is, because the reading of this decree seems to say when 7    you take the middle of the river or middle of the harbor 8    or middle of anything, it seems to take the main channel 9    of navigation divided down the river.  Now, you've read it10    closely and you say that this part of it wasn't actually11    at issue.  Well, maybe that's true, but if we start12    reopening boundary decrees, it seems to me we're going to13    get into a lot of trouble because there may be a lot of14    boundary decrees among States that have parts that, if you15    really looked at them, they might not have been perfect or16    perfectly described.  So why not just hold you to this,17    even though it was all done by mistake and with the best18    of intentions and so forth.19              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, we're not trying to get20    out of anything that was decided in 1976.21              QUESTION:  It wasn't literally decided, because22    it wasn't directly an issue in the case, I assume.  But23    nonetheless the words in this decree surely cover it,24    don't they?25              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, the issue wasn't40               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    actually adjudicated.  The applicability of this phrase 2    was an assumption that the parties brought to the 3    negotiations, and the boundary was set out based upon 4    those negotiations. There was no actual -- no actual 5    adjudication of whether this phrase applied.  The portion 6    of the boundary at issue was not the harbor boundary. 7    There is no intent to make this apply, that was clear. 8    And I think that the most troublesome aspect, and that's 9    why I addressed this question first, is whether this Court10    could have entered the consent decree in 1976 had the11    parties' stipulation pertaining to the meaning of the12    middle of the river not been there.  And I think the Court13    could have entered it, because the boundary description14    describes the boundary as passing up through the mouth of15    Piscataqua Harbor, and it would have been reasonable,16    given that description of the boundary, for the parties to17    agree upon a location in the middle.  But the point is is18    that neither the application nor the meaning of the19    phrase, up the middle of the river, was actually20    adjudicated in 1976.21              QUESTION:  What effect do you think should be22    given to the 1740 decree?23              MS. LUDTKE:  The 1740 decree is a relevant piece24    of historical evidence.25              QUESTION:  Is relevant historical evidence, or41               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    is irrelevant?  I didn't hear. 2              MS. LUDTKE:  No, we've actually stated it is 3    relevant to when we've listed the items that we believe 4    bear on New Hampshire's boundary claim, and that's on page 5    12 of our motion and our brief. 6              QUESTION:  Well, why can't I read the consent 7    -- why can't I read our earlier decision, our decree, as 8    saying that the 1740 determination is controlling of the9 boundary?10              MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, I don't think that11    decree can be read in that way because there was no12    adjudication of the issues.  The claims are very different13    in this case.  No intent can be inferred, and it was not14    essential to this Court's jurisdiction to enter judgment.15    And I think that's been made clear by the Court's citation16    --171819202122232425    precisely.42               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  Why should the 1740 decree berelevant to part of the dispute and not another part ofthe dispute?          MS. LUDTKE:  The 1740 decree describes theboundary as passing up through the mouth of the harbor,and we believe that is relevant.  But what we think ismore relevant is the historical evidence.QUESTION:  They said the middle of the harbor,1234567    side.8              MS. LUDTKE:  That's correct, Your Honor, but the9    dividing line is not what's at issue here.  What's at          MS. LUDTKE:  It doesn't say the middle of theharbor.  It says it shall pass up through the mouth of thePiscataqua Harbor and up the middle of the river.          QUESTION:  And that the dividing line shall partthe Isles of Shoals and run through the middle of theharbor between the islands to the sea on the southerly10    issue is the phrase passing up through the mouth of11    Piscataqua Harbor, and New Hampshire has made a claim12    based upon its right as a successor sovereign to the Crown13    at the Revolution when the province of New Hampshire's14    boundaries extended to the Maine shore.15              QUESTION:  At one point it seems to me it does16    say just passing -- where is it -- through the mouth of17    the Piscataqua Harbor.  But then later when it refers to18    the same line it says, run through the middle of the19    Harbor.  So it does say middle of the Harbor, and you're20    essentially arguing that the middle of the harbor means21    something different than middle of the river.22              MS. LUDTKE:  No, Your Honor.  Middle of the23    harbor refers to Gosport Harbor and, in fact, there is a24    distinction there because the decree says specifically25    that it passes through the middle of Gosport Harbor43               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    whereas it only says it passes through the mouth of 2    Piscataqua Harbor which, at that time, was annexed 3    entirely to the province of New Hampshire, governed and 4    controlled and administered by New Hampshire provincial 5    officials.  New Hampshire collected tonnage, New Hampshire 6    collected in imposts -- 7              QUESTION:  May I stop you there just for a 8    moment, because I want to be clear on how much you want to 9    go back.  I understand that you say that the settlement10    that was entered into in what, '77, was for that case11    only.  You have answered Justice Kennedy that the 174012    Order is relevant evidence but not conclusive.  Are you13    attacking that 1740 Order also as not the basis --14    whatever it means?  Are you saying it is not the proper15    basis for determining this boundary?16              MS. LUDTKE:  We think that the 1740 Order needs17    to be reconciled with history.  We don't think that the18    apparent meaning of the text can trump history.  What we19    have done is look at history and try to understand the20    text of that Order in a context of history, and that has21    been the reason for our great reliance on historical22    events and documents in explaining what the terms of that23    1740 Order --24              QUESTION:  Are you saying it's not binding?  For25    what reason?  That was intended to be a settlement, a44               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    decision by the King, ultimately by the King.  Whatever2    those words may mean that are set out in 2(A, isn't that3    at least conclusive between these two States?4              MS. LUDTKE:  Yes, and we say those words are5    entirely consistent with the boundary located on the Maine6    shore, because those words were intended to direct that7    the boundary follow the main part.  And we have cited the8    charter and that --9              QUESTION:  And what language places it on the10    Maine shore?  I mean, I can understand you're saying11    middle of the river means you follow -- you follow the12    main channel of the river and not one of the side13    channels, but what portion of that 1740 decree -- unless14    it's a terribly sloppy piece of work -- what portion of it15    says when you follow the main channel you use the Maine16    shore?17181920212223242545               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  You're talking M-a-i-n-e andm-a-i-n --          QUESTION:  The first one is, m-a-i-n, and thesecond is M-a-i-n-e.  I thought that was clear.          MS. LUDTKE:  The boundary decree describes theboundary as passing up through the mouth of PiscataquaHarbor, and New Hampshire has shown through historicalevidence that the Harbor was annexed to New Hampshire, andthat the boundary commissioners had no authority to dividethe harbor.  We've cited --          QUESTION:  But they would have said somethingabout it.  Where in the 1740 Order do they refer to theMaine -- with an e -- shore?  I don't see anything therethat refers to the Maine shore.          MS. LUDTKE:  Your Honor, may I proceed to          QUESTION:  I wish you -- yes.          MS. LUDTKE:  The boundary decree, although itsays passes up through the mouth of the harbor has to beconstrued in the context of the authority of the boundarycommissioners, the authority of the treasury over ports,the authority of the King to withhold navigable rivers andports from royal provinces without charters --          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Ludtke.          Mr. Stern, you have four minutes remaining.              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN                ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT          MR. STERN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  There's beena suggestion today that river does not equal harbor.  Thespecial master at the time was pretty sure that the harborand the river were coextensive.  New Hampshire, back inthe 1970s, specifically stated that the mouth of theharbor is the same as the mouth of the river.          QUESTION:  Are there two harbors here, by the                            46         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1234567    answer?8 910111213141516171819202122232425 1    way?  She said there is Gosport Harbor and another harbor. 2    What are the two harbors? 3              MR. STERN:  Gosport Harbor is the harbor out at 4    the Isle of Shoals.  Out in the islands in the sea. 5              QUESTION:  Oh, out by the -- okay. 6              MR. STERN:  Piscataqua Harbor or Portsmouth 7    Harbor is the one we're talking about. 8              QUESTION:  I understand. 9              MR. STERN:  But in the 1970s New Hampshire was10    pretty clear that mouth of the harbor equaled mouth of the11    river and they stated that in pleadings to this Court at12    315a and 329a of Maine's Appendix.13              QUESTION:  What is the answer to her simple14    argument that that area to the left -- you go to the top15    of the blue line, you look left, and there's a dotted16    line.  And she says, is that dotted line -- whatever we17    said in that decree, it wasn't an issue in the case, and18    therefore we want to go back into it.19              MR. STERN:  The whole river was before the Court20    because what's been lost in the argument here, I believe,21    is that there were two main events, so to speak, with22    respect to the 1970s litigation.  One was whether the line23    going out from the Portsmouth Harbor to the Isle of Shoals24    was straight or crooked in some way.25              QUESTION:  Okay.                                  47               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. STERN:  The second one, which is the one 2    that the dissent addressed, was where in the river was the 3    boundary because depending upon where it was -- geographic 4    middle, thalweg, or the Maine shoreline, it would 5    determine how much territory was in each State.  To 6    suggest that New Hampshire didn't have the incentive to 7    claim a shoreline on Maine's -- in Maine, I mean, borders 8    on implausible because it would have resulted in hundreds 9    if not thousands of additional acres of territory being in10    New Hampshire rather than Maine.  You'll recall that New11    Hampshire filed special exceptions to the special master's12    report and argued to this Court that the boundary should13    be moved over a bit, three hundred and fifty feet in the14    middle of the river, to get some additional territory.  A15    shoreline boundary would have increased that manyfold, so16    New Hampshire had the incentive to press a claim to the17    shoreline boundary.18              The notion that we can suggest today that the19    Attorneys General in the 1970s didn't know anything --20    didn't know what we know today -- is exactly why we have21    res judicata.  The circus of what we almost would have to22    do is bring those folk back in and cross-examining them is23    why we have res judicata.  New Hampshire had the24    opportunity to press a shoreline boundary, which had all25    the incentive and the fair opportunity to do in the 1970s.48               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    Its failure to do so precludes it from doing so now. 2              And the reason we have these specific findings, 3    rulings and legal principles according to New Hampshire, 4    as they explained in the 1970s, was to avoid the Vermont 5    v. New York problem where there was a decree without 6    findings, without an adjudication of any issues.  Because 7    of that concern that this decree might not be approved, 8    these specific findings and rulings and legal principles 9    were laid out here, and they are made without reservation.10              And getting back to Justice Breyer's questions,11    paragraph five, if we can read the line, says, quote, the12    middle of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua13    River, commencing in the vicinity of Fort Point and14    Fishing Island, closed quote.  It's an effort, maybe not15    an exact effort, but it's an effort to lay out the middle16    of the main channel of navigation of the Piscataqua River.17    There may have been reasons to have it as a straight line18    in that channel, but it is an effort.19              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Stern.20    The case is submitted.21              (Whereupon, at 1:59 p.m., the case in the above-22    entitled matter was submitted.)23 24 2549ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO
