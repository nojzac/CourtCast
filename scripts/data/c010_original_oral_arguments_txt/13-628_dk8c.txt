LEWIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            How an American is identified in his or herpassport or U.S. Consular Report of Birth Abroad,including the place of birth designation, does notamount to formal recognition by the United States ofthat designated location's sovereign status.  This isthe principal reason why Congress's law authorizingJerusalem­born citizens to carry passports that say theywere born in Israel is a legitimate congressionalexercise of Congress's power to regulate foreigncommerce, naturaliza ­­            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that ­­ supposethat the President and the Secretary of State put on thepassport the place of birth ­­ I've written it out ­­the place of birth on this Jerusalem­born citizen'spassport has been listed as Israel at the holder'srequest.  This designation is neither an acknowledgment3Official￼Alderson Reporting Companysuggested ­­But in the case that Justice KennedyJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Has that ever happened?MS.

LEWIN:  Yes, Your Honor, they could putthat statement on the passport.  But we ­­            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if ­­ if ­­ if Congressthen passed a law saying that that statement had to comeoff every passport, could Congress do that?            MS. LEWIN:  Yes, Justice Kagan.  The ­­the ­­ we ­­ there's no restriction on the initialgranting of recognition by the President.  But by thesame token, the Congress has the ability afterwards,upon deliberation, to decide if they disagree with thatrecognition.United States where Congress after  the President haddeclared that it was not recognizing someone, hasCongress ever recognized it?4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MS. LEWIN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. In ­­2 in 1898, Congress passed a joint resolution for the3 recognition of the independence of the people of Cuba4 over the initial opposition of President McKinley, and5 that ended up recognizing the independence of Cuba.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were careful to say7 at the outset that this is not recognition, the court of8 appeals decision, I think it was in the Judge Tabor9 concurrence, said that both parties urge upon us that10 they ­­ that the power of recognition is involved here11 and Congress has done it. And then, of course, the12 Attorney General takes ­­ takes the opposite position13 that the ­­ that this, A, this is recognition and, B,14 that's why it's void.15 Did you change your position here, or am I16 just misinterpreting the way this ­­ the court of17 appeals discussed it?18 MS. LEWIN: We've provided to the Court19 alternative options for resolving this issue. Our20 primary position, as I said at the outset, is that what21 is written in this statute does not amount to a formal22 recognition of sovereignty because the language of the23 statute itself is very narrow.24 It begins by saying that, for the purposes25 of, for the narrow purposes of recording a place of5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 birth on a passport or a Consular Report of Birth2 Abroad, that is where ­­ what this statute provides for.3 It also does not state that in all circumstances you4 have to list Israel as the place of birth. It is merely5 giving the individual choice.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The ­­ the ­­ does ­­ the7 provision is part of a section, Section 214. And I8 think you're trying to read G, and so it is9 disassociated from the purpose that's expressed10 throughout 214, that is, that Jerusalem is the capital11 of Israel. Congress said that, and you ­­ you are12 trying to deal with a piece of one section without13 regard to the ­­ to the thrust of the whole provision,14 that Congress has said we think Jerusalem is the capital15 of Israel.16 MS. LEWIN: Justice Ginsburg, the ­­ that is17 correct. This section of the statute should be reviewed18 and the constitutionality of it be determined on its19 own. But the Court should look not at what Congress may20 have intended by the entire section but, rather, what21 this section actually did. And this section, as I said,22 gives the individuals a choice and does not confer23 formal recognition. There are benefits that come with24 formal recognition.25 JUSTICE BREYER: You say that. But the ­­6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 you say ­­ I've heard exactly what you said. And I2 think that's certainly a reasonable position. You could3 read this and say it doesn't really say anything about4 recognizing anything.5 But the Solicitor General of the United6 States, after conferring with the State Department,7 says, "Since Israel's founding, every President has8 adhered to the position that the status of Jerusalem9 should not be unilaterally determined by a party," and10 he adds, "by requiring the President to contradict his11 recognition position regarding Jerusalem in official12 communications with foreign sovereigns, the section13 unconstitutionally encroaches on the President's core14 recognition authority."15 So he has a different view. He thinks it is16 our policy not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital,17 which you apparently agree with, and he thinks that this18 does have some tendency at least to suggest the19 contrary.20 Now, I'm a judge. I'm not a foreign affairs21 expert. And when he tells me that, and they are foreign22 affairs experts in the State Department, how can I say23 that I'm right even if I agree with you, and they, who24 are in charge of foreign affairs, are wrong when they25 make those two statements, which certainly sound7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 plausible.2 MS. LEWIN: Two points, Justice Breyer. The3 first is that what goes on a ­­ on a passport as a place4 of birth is not tantamount to recognizing foreign5 sovereignty. Taiwan is a perfect example. The State6 Department puts ­­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I want ­­ and I must8 interject at this point because you emphasize the Taiwan9 example and it seems to me it's most distinguishable.10 Taiwan and China maintained from the beginning there is11 only one China, and so Taiwan is a place name. It's a12 region. It's in no way recognizing, no ­­ there's no13 question of recognition in the Taiwan example.14 MS. LEWIN: That's correct, Justice15 Ginsburg. So what you put on the passport does not16 automatically confer recognition ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, to go back to my18 question ­­19 MS. LEWIN: But the question ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ which I'd like an answer21 to. I don't think that Taiwan is a counterexample since22 the policy of the State Department in that thing that's23 FAM, which is the Foreign Affairs Manual, says pretty24 clearly that if there's a dispute about the larger25 power, i.e., China, you always can put in your passport8Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the smaller place of birth, like a city or I would thinkhere Taiwan.  So I don't hearI'm saying the experts saying thatconflicted with their policy.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  ChinaDid China not object to it?            JUSTICE BREYER:  Chinawant an answer to this question ­­Scalia.Official￼the Department or I guess     the Taiwan exampleMS. LEWIN:  Yes, that is correct, Justice            JUSTICE BREYER:  ­­ not whether Chinaobjected or didn't object or so forth.  I'm notinterested in that.            I'm interested in what we, as judges, dowhen the State Department and those charged say thoseother things were not contrary to our recognitionpolicy.  That's what they think, and this is.            MS. LEWIN:  So one last point on Taiwan ­­            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd like the first point.What am I supposed to do in respect to that?            MS. LEWIN:  Well, the first ­­ the firstpoint is that this ­­ what goes on the passport does notconfer the benefits of formal recognition ofsovereignty.  This does not entitle the government, theforeign government to bring cases in ­­ in our courts,9Alderson Reporting Companyobjected to that.may have done ­­ I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to the protection of sovereign immunity or to the actof ­­ act of state doctrine.  What goes on a passport,therefore, does not amount to sovereign recognition.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Lewin, I ­­ I thoughtyour position was you couldn't care less if the StateDepartment thinks that this is going to interfere withour relations with the Palestinians, that Congress isentitled to do what it is authorized to do under theConstitution, even when that contradicts ­­ let's assumethey can't recognize a country, but they can declare waron a country, can't they ­­            MS. LEWIN:  Yes.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  ­­ that the StateDepartment has decided to recognize and ­­ and to befriendly with?            MS. LEWIN:  Yes, Justice Scalia.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Congress can do that.            MS. LEWIN:  That is correct.  Congress cando that.  And the test, if there is a conflict ­­            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say can do the samehere.  And ­­ and the fact that thedoesn't like the fact that it makesangry is irrelevant.            MS. LEWIN:  Absolutely,That is correct and ­­10State Departmentthe PalestiniansJustice Scalia.Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: If you take that position,2 which explains it, then what do you think of Justice3 Story who writes in 1833 that, "The exercise of the4 prerogative of acknowledging new nations and5 ministers" ­­ and he makes clear that involves whether a6 city or a region is part of a country, et cetera, he7 says, it's an executive function. Some argue, as we ­­8 I think we've just heard, that Congress could make that9 decision, too, but that hasn't been decided. And he10 concludes that, "A power so extensive in its reach over11 our foreign relations could not properly be conferred on12 any other than the Executive Department will admit of13 little doubt."14 1516 you have to17 that has to18 knowledgeable about the founders' intent.19 MS. LEWIN: But that is a rather extreme20 position, number one, to suggest that the Executive21 Branch would have not only the authority to recognize a22 foreign government, but also at the State Department's23 say­so, that automatically would end the question or any24 review by any other branch. The ­­ the State Department25 merely says that the power's influence upon ­­11MS. LEWIN:  Justice ­­JUSTICE BREYER:  So he is saying, of course,have one person deciding such a thing, andbe the Executive.  That's 1833, prettyAlderson Reporting Company18 sovereignty 1920 suppose you21 it was trumped Story in 1830, right? I mean, he said22 pretty much the exact opposite, that the recognition23 provision was really just a trivial formality.Official￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what ­­ there is2 always review with the power of the purse, and there's3 always review with not appointing an ambassador.4 There ­­ there is review in a variety of alternative5 ways by Congress. It just may not be the way you6 prefer, that they could pass a resolution contradicting7 that that would have any legal course.8 MS. LEWIN: There ­­ well, there is review,9 and even ­­ both to respond to Justice Sotomayor and10 Justice Breyer, Justice Story and William Rawle both11 recognize that authority of Congress to review.12 Justice Story also said that, "If such13 recognition is made, it's conclusive upon the nation14 unless, indeed, it can be reversed by an act of Congress15 repudiating it." And then he went further to say that,16 "If the President refuses to recognize, then he said17 Congress may, notwithstanding, solemnly acknowledge theof the nation or party."CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose ­­ Icould also say Hamilton in 1787 or whatever24 MS. LEWIN: Hamilton also switched his25 position before he was in the administration and after12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 he was in the administration. What that would seem to2 show, Mr. Chief Justice, is that it's not clear the3 history ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Lewin ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: In any case, this is not6 your main point, is it? You're ­­ you're being either7 forced into or willingly yield yourself to arguing8 that ­­ against the proposition that if this is9 recognition, it is invalid. But your main position is10 this is not recognition; it just has an effect on ­­ on11 the State Department's desire to ­­ to make nice with12 the Palestinians, and your position is Congress has13 no ­­ no compulsion to ­­ to follow that, assuming it14 can't recognize.15 MS. LEWIN: That is correct.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't claim that this17 is recognition.18 MS. LEWIN: We do not claim that this is19 recognition. In fact, if there was a conflict ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you ask ­­ one factual21 matter I'd like. I see in the record that your22 application for the passport asked for "Jerusalem,23 Israel," but that was changed. Was it changed in24 litigation? Was there an actual official request to25 change it in your application?13Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MS. LEWIN:  The initial request was madepurely because of a misunderstanding of what the lawinitially required.  And it was a common ­­            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer my question.  Didyou apply formally to have it changed or did you justtake this ­­ that position in litigation?            MS. LEWIN:  The position was thensubsequently taken in litigation.  But in subsequentrenewals of the passport, too, it has been just therequest of "Israel" be put on the passport, and it hascome back with "Jerusalem."            JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you another ­­another factual question?  When Menachem was born, washe issued a birth certificate by the Israeliauthorities?            MS. LEWIN:  Yes.            JUSTICE ALITO:  And the United Statesrecognizes that as ­­ as a lawful exercise of Israeliauthority, to issue a birth certificate for a child bornin Jerusalem?            MS. LEWIN:  I believe they do, Your Honor.            JUSTICE ALITO:  So what ­­ this is aquestion I would ask the Solicitor General, but I don'tcompletely understand what the position of the UnitedStates is regarding Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem.14Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 I understand it is the position of the United States2 that Israel does not exercise full sovereignty over3 Jerusalem, but in that ­­ in this instance, the issuance4 of a birth certificate, and others I can think of, I5 suspect the United States recognizes that Israel is6 lawfully exercising attributes of sovereignty over the7 territory of Jerusalem. Is that correct?8 So if someone ­­ let's say an American9 citizen committed a crime in Jerusalem, would the United10 States take the position that the Israeli government has11 no lawful authority to prosecute that person for the12 crime?13 MS. LEWIN: I do not believe so, Your Honor.14 I believe that they would feel that the Israeli15 government has the authority to prosecute that crime.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Lewin, if I can ask you,17 if your primary position is that this is not a18 recognition statute, can we talk a little bit about what19 it is? I mean, why ­­ what ­­ what is the design, what20 is the effect of this statute other than as something21 that goes to recognition?22 MS. LEWIN: This statute is a statute that23 was created to give individuals the right to24 self­identify as they choose that they were born in25 Israel.15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the United States2 Government does not usually give people that right to3 self­identify in this way. In other words, I think this4 was the Chief Justice's question in the first argument,5 if you're an American citizen born in Northern Ireland,6 you can't get the right to say Ireland. For that7 matter, if you are an American citizen born in Jerusalem8 today, you can't get the rights to say Palestine.9 This is a very selective vanity plate law,10 if we might call it that. And ­­ and it's selective11 because Congress had, it appears to me, and it's12 consistent with the rest of the statute, as Justice13 Ginsburg said, a real view that this was the14 self­identification it wanted. In other words, the15 ability of American citizens to say yes, I was born in16 Jerusalem, and that means I was born in Israel. That17 and only that self­identification is allowed.18 MS. LEWIN: This statute was rectifying a19 misguided policy of the State Department which enabled20 individuals born in Israel proper, whether in Tel Aviv21 or in Haifa, who were opposed politically to the State22 of Israel to remove that sovereign, to remove reference23 to Israel from their passport, but it did not allow the24 flip. It did not allow those who are born in Jerusalem25 and who live under the sovereign government of Israel,16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 who wish to put Israel on their passport, to put Israel2 on their passport.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about Palestinians4 who were born in Jerusalem and want to have Palestine as5 their place of birth? That ­­ that existed until 1948,6 that option.7 MS. LEWIN: Correct, Justice Ginsburg,8 because at that point there was, before 1948, a9 Palestine. So the ­­ the law was not going so far ­­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, people can ­­11 Palestinians cannot ­­ American­born Palestinians cannot12 do that. And that suggests that Congress had a view,13 and the view was that Jerusalem was properly part of14 Israel.15 MS. LEWIN: And that is because this statute16 was dealing with an existing sovereign that you either17 remove from the passport or put on the passport. They18 weren't complicating the situation by putting in19 non­recognized sovereigns or other entities. They said20 you either put it on or you take it off. We'll give you21 the choice ­­22 JUSTICE ALITO: If an American citizen is23 born in Barcelona, Spain, is that citizen allowed, by24 the State Department, to put Barcelona as place of25 birth?17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MS. LEWIN: If they wish to remove the2 country of birth and list the smaller entity? Yes.3 JUSTICE ALITO: And is that a ­­ is that a4 vanity plate for people who believe in Catalan5 independence?6 MS. LEWIN: It is enabling an individual to7 exercise their choice to self­identify as they choose,8 yes.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, your10 argument ­­ and you're consistent on this, your first11 argument is that this is not recognition. Now, suppose12 the State Department, and I think this is its position,13 says this is recognition. If we defer to the State14 Department's judgment, to the government's executive15 judgment on that point, and the government said this is16 recognition, and you say it isn't recognition, why17 doesn't the government trump? If the government ­­ if18 the Congress really wants to test its power, it can pass19 a law saying you must recognize Israel as being the20 legitimate government of Palestine, but it has not done21 that. And since it has not done that, it seems to me22 the government's argument trumps.23 MS. LEWIN: Justice Kennedy, you are24 correct. The way the balance of powers works is that25 the Executive Branch has the right to recognize a18Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 sovereign. However, if Congress deliberates, passes2 legislation, and that legislation is signed into law,3 then Congress's position trumps.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you ­­ but you say5 that this isn't recognition. So the ultimate conflict6 is not before us and ­­ and, therefore, the government's7 policy, which says that this is recognition, should be8 given deference and it trumps.9 MS. LEWIN: Well, Your Honor, if it does not10 amount to recognition, then Congress had the authority11 to pass this legislation pursuant to its passport12 authority.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I ­­ I guess there are14 competing canons here. I mean, one is, I suppose, that15 we listen to the State Department on matters of foreign16 affairs, but I suppose another one is that we do not17 hold a ­­ an act of Congress to be unconstitutional and18 thereby ineffective. So that seems to me a draw,19 doesn't it?20 MS. LEWIN: Yes, Justice Scalia.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the State Department22 says this amounts to recognition, and Congress says23 whether it does or not, we want ­­ we want this person24 to be able to list Israel.25 MS. LEWIN: That is correct. And since this19Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 was signed into law by the President, the law right now2 trumps whatever the Executive Branch may say.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ­­ can I give you a4 hypothetical, Ms. Lewin? Suppose that Congress passed a5 law and this law said that the Secretary of State had to6 send an official letter to all foreign ministers7 whenever a U.S. citizen was born in Jerusalem, and that8 official letter from the Secretary of State said ­­ says9 just ­­ it announces that a new American has been born10 in Israel. Would that be constitutional?11 MS. LEWIN: Excuse me, this would be a law12 passed?13 JUSTICE KAGAN: This is a law passed by14 Congress and it says every time a U.S. citizen is born15 in Jerusalem, the Secretary of State has to send an16 official letter to every other foreign minister saying17 that a new American has been born in Israel.18 MS. LEWIN: Yes, that would be19 constitutional.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: That would be21 constitutional, even though the ­­ the Congress is22 basically telling the Secretary of State to engage in a23 certain kind of diplomatic communication with other24 foreign countries.25 MS. LEWIN: The description of the law that20Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 you provide seems to be very similar to what a passport2 does. A passport recognizes an individual as an3 American citizen for purposes of communicating that4 information to the foreign government.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, exactly right. That6 was going to be my point, that it was ­­7 (Laughter).8 JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ that it was extremely9 similar to what a passport does, that both are forms of10 diplomatic communication, and that what we usually say11 about diplomatic communication is that whatever12 Congress's other foreign affairs powers are, the power13 of diplomatic communication belongs to the President and14 the President alone; that in that realm we only speak15 with one voice.16 And so I guess I have to sort of say that17 that answer that you gave me, that this could ­­ that18 Congress could say to the Secretary of State, here's the19 diplomatic communication that you have to send to other20 foreign ministers, seems, well, a little bit shocking.2122 an American23 movement of24 this passport, if it were to list Israel pursuant to25 this law, would be indistinguishable from all the other21MS. LEWIN:  But recognizing an individual ascitizen facilitates the transfer and theAmerican citizens across borders.  This ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 passports of individuals born in Tel Aviv or Haifa or2 anywhere else in Israel. That passport would not, when3 shown, be making any kind of political statement. It4 would merely be identifying the individual by their5 name, date of birth, place of birth, as all American6 passports of individuals identify them.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would say in8 Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's9 required to be sent to every foreign head of state would10 be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the11 passport is, because the passport is used primarily for12 purposes of identification, and it's only the letter13 that makes it something else.1415161718 our opinion 1920 declaration, that's correct, Justice Kennedy.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, I'm not sure22 why that Congress passed it, then.23 MS. LEWIN: Congress passed it to give these24 individuals the right to self­identify as they choose,25 because individuals in general have that ability on22MS.

Since 1948, Israel hasacted as the sovereign over western Jerusalem where ourclient was born, and since 1967 over the entire area ofJerusalem.  So ­­ so ­­            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know what it's done,but has the U.S. recognized ­­ has any President since1948 recognized Israel's sovereignty over that area?            MS. LEWIN:  In a formal sense, no.  Butallowing individuals to recognize that, that would notbe a false statement.            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Lewin, may I just ­­ Iknow your time is ­­ but if I might just go back to thethought that the Chief Justice gave you that you agreed23Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 with. Here's the way a passport begins. It begins,2 "The Secretary of State of the United States of America3 hereby requests all who it may concern to permit the4 citizen," blah, blah, blah. That's what ­­ that's5 the ­­ you know, the Secretary of State requests all of6 these who are going to be looking at this passport.7 And then in Haig v. Agee, we described a8 passport as a letter of introduction in which the9 issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests10 other sovereigns to aid the bearer. So this is, this11 passport, it seems, both on what it says itself and on12 what we've said about it, it's like a letter from the13 Secretary of State. It's a communication.14 MS. LEWIN: It is a communication merely to15 facilitate this transfer of individuals as American16 citizens, not to make public statements about where they17 were born or where they're from or what countries the18 United States recognizes.19 If I may reserve the rest of my time.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.21 General Verrilli.22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT24 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and25 may it please the Court:24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Let me get to the heart of the problem with2 Section 214(d). Even if Section 214(d) does not3 officially change or formally change the recognition4 position of the United States, it tries to deny the5 President the power to give effect to our official6 recognition position by forcing Executive Branch7 officials to issue official diplomatic communications8 that contradict that position.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What ­­ what if10 there were a law that said precisely pretty much what11 you just said? The law says, okay, Mr. President, you12 can recognize whoever you want, but if you recognize13 this ­­ this country, this government, we're going to14 treat it as if you hadn't recognized this government.15 For all purposes of domestic law, we're going to16 pretend ­­ we're going to operate on the assumption that17 you have recognized this country.18 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think there would be19 limits to Congress's ability to do that. We think that20 the recognition power that the President possesses21 necessarily22 recognition2324 would be unconstitutional?25 GENERAL VERRILLI: To the extent it said forincludes the power to give effect todecisions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So ­­ so that law25Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 all purposes, yes, because ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that3 exactly what the Taiwan Relations Act says? What it4 says is, "The absence of diplomatic recognition shall5 not affect the application of the laws of the United6 States with respect to Taiwan."7 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Mr. Chief Justice,8 that's quite different. The Taiwan Relations Act was an9 act that was an exercise of the necessary and proper10 power to implement the President's foreign relations11 judgment about how Taiwan should be treated.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say the13 President ­­ let's say the President did not want to14 recognize Taiwan and Congress passes a law that says for15 every purpose under American law, we will treat Taiwan16 as if it had been recognized?17 GENERAL VERRILLI: That might raise a18 serious Constitution question, but that isn't the19 situation that was ­­ it wasn't the case when it was20 enacted, it's not the case now, and it's ­­ and it's21 different from the current situation.22 The fundamental problem with Section 214(d)23 is that it purports to try to force the Executive Branch24 to issue official diplomatic communications that25 contradict the position of the United States.26Alderson Reporting Company1 JUSTICE ALITO: But is that really true?Official￼2 Suppose ­­ could Congress pass a law saying that3 passport ­­ every passport issued to an American4 must list the place of birth, including country,5 that for this purpose, the country is the nation6 issued the birth certificate to that individual?7 Could ­­ could Congress do that?10 to the Executive Branch's judgment that the place of11 birth listing can have significant diplomatic12 consequences. We have had policies in place for decades13 in this country that align place of birth designations14 with our official recognition policy. The reason we do15 that is because foreign sovereigns look to these16 communications as indicative of where we stand on17 what ­­1819 Congress's20 difference21 countries?2223 things that are within Congress's power that would24 antagonize foreign countries that wouldn't raise a25 separation of powers problem, of course, like a trade27                                                     every                                                     citizen                                                     and                                                     thatthat ­­ 9 that in a situation like that, the Court ought to defer8 GENERAL VERRILLI: I ­­ I think that JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it ­­ if it is within­­ if it is within Congress's power, whatdoes it make whether it antagonizes foreignGENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, there are certainAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425embargo or a travel ban.  But ­­            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And this may be one ofthem.So­­            GENERAL VERRILLI:  This is not one of them.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  ­­ the mere fact that itupsets foreign relations doesn't prove a thing.            GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  The critical point,Your Honor, is that what this statute does that thoseother statutes don't do is it requires the ExecutiveBranch, the President himself and the Executive Branchitself, to communicate a message that contradicts theofficial recognition position of the United States,undermining the President's credibility and preventingthe President from being able to speak with one voicecredibly.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why couldn't you havea disclaimer of the kind that I've explained to thePetitioners' counsel.  She said that would be perfectlylawful, for you to say it's not the position of theState Department, this is not an indication that Israelis ­­ has jurisdiction over Jerusalem.the problem?GENERAL VERRILLI:  Your Honor ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why wouldn't that solveGENERAL VERRILLI:  It doesn't solve the28Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 problem because the issuance of the disclaimer is a2 credibility hit. It undermines the credibility of the3 President because what is ­­ think about what it's4 actually saying. What it's actually saying in this5 context is yes, we're issuing thousands of passports6 that identify persons born in Jerusalem as being born in7 Israel; yes, the Congress of the United States required8 that; but pay no attention to it really; it doesn't have9 any bearing on recognition.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it had ­­ if it11 were such a big deal, why did the Chief Executive at the12 time sign it?13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the Chief Executive14 issued a signing statement which really was, in effect,15 a disclaimer, in 2002. President Bush's statement said16 in 2002, this does not change our official recognition17 policy and we're going to treat it as advisory, and that18 did not have the effect of ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should give no20 weight to the fact that the Chief Executive signed the21 law that he is now saying has such a dramatic ­­ that22 his successor, but I gather the position is the same ­­23 is now saying has such deleterious effects on American24 foreign policy? Well, as a general matter, does that25 have any consequence at all?29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I mean, I think this2 Court held ­­ I think this Court held in Myers that the3 fact that one President signed a law into ­­ signed a4 law that violated separation of powers doesn't have any5 effect.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. I know, I'm7 not suggesting it does, although that's a separate8 question. But it does go to the credibility of the9 assertion that this is going to have such dramatic10 effects on American foreign policy.11 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think that ­­ I12 think the credibility of the assertion is proven by13 history. With all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, even14 though President Bush issued that statement which said15 this didn't change the policy of the United States and16 that we weren't going to enforce it because he was17 treating it as advisory, the consequences that ensued in18 the Middle East in October of 2002 were that there were19 mass demonstrations in Jerusalem, thousands of people in20 the streets, some turning violent. The Palestinian21 parliament met and voted for the first time to declare22 Jerusalem the capital of the Palestinian state, No23 longer forbearing on that issue. And if you look at24 pages ­­2530CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's partlyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 because the Executive Branch made such a big deal out of2 it. I mean, they issue a statement saying, this is3 unconstitutional and all that. They could easily have4 said, this is no big deal, they're just letting whoever5 is born there pick the name they want to put on ­­6 GENERAL VERRILLI: With all due respect,7 Your Honor ­­8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ nothing to see9 here, move on, and we're proving that by going ahead and10 signing it. And over the ­­ over the intervening11 course, the executive has litigated this. It's a12 self­fulfilling prophecy that it's going to be such a13 huge deal.14 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, with15 all due respect, I think on this question that you're16 asking me, this is a place where the Court should accord17 deference to the judgments of the Executive Branch and18 the State Department, in particular. If the State19 Department had thought, if the executive had thought20 that it could solve the diplomatic problem by minimizing21 the effect of this provision, pretending as though it22 wasn't going to have this effect, certainly they would23 have followed that course.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What they're asking you31Alderson Reporting Company10 That's ­­ 111213 "Disputed,"14 gather they15 the truth.16JUSTICE BREYER:  So how are we ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if it just saysparentheses after it, "Disputed"?  Then Iwouldn't be lying.  They would be tellingGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I don't know. I 17 mean, a couple things about that. First, Your Honor,Official￼1 to do is to look ­­ they're asking the government to2 lie.3 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think that ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not ­­ that's5 exactly what you're saying the government should ­­ the6 executive department should not do.7 GENERAL VERRILLI: I do think the problem8 here is that the executive made a considered judgment in9 2002 that this couldn't sensibly be handled that way.18 that would have the effect of identifying the passports19 that were issued to people born in Jerusalem on the ­­20 because that would be the reason to put it on. But21 beyond that, it isn't disputed as a matter of the22 official position of the United States. The position of23 the United States ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's disputed25 as a matter of the government of the United States.32Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Part of the government says this ­­ well, actually, no,2 I mean, Congress is not saying under my hypothetical,3 this is Israel. It's saying there's a dispute about it,4 which I would think is about as true a statement as you5 can make.6 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, there's a dispute7 certainly among the parties of the region, but I think8 the whole premise of Petitioner's argument here is that9 within the government of the United States there isn't a10 dispute over the recognition issue.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you help me with this12 same question? How should we approach it generally?13 That is to say, I can think of instances where a similar14 statute is serving nothing other than administrative15 matters ­­ the passport should be red or something ­­16 and I can think of instances where it causes a lot of17 trouble. But I can think of instances like this one,18 and I could and you could easily replicate this19 controversy with Israel in our imaginations, similar20 controversy with Donetsk and the Ukraine, where we make21 some agreement with Russia and something similar comes22 up, or with Iran, and pretend that ­­ remember that23 Russia once invaded the northern part of Iran. And all24 over the world there can be similar kinds of problems25 where it's debatable what the words of the passport33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 actually mean or how they will be taken by others and2 what others will think they mean.3 Now, how do we, who know little about it,4 determine, when it gets into the realm, that we should5 stay out of it and let the President and the6 Constitution gives him that power or should ­­ some7 think we should always intervene, perhaps some never.8 What in your mind is the right standard? How do we9 decide?10 GENERAL VERRILLI: I do think this Court,11 the last time the case was here, said that ultimately it12 was up to the Court to judge the constitutionality of13 the statute. Of course, we accept that. But in doing14 so, we believe it is quite important that the Executive15 Branch get deference on judgments of precisely the kind16 that Your Honor has identified. This statute is a very17 rare passport statute. There really isn't any other18 passport statute like this one that purports to19 interject an issue of recognition policy into the20 content of passports.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: General Verrilli, if we22 agree with the Petitioner, we do not have to confront23 the constitutional question whether the President has24 exclusive power over recognition. If we agree with you,25 we are going to have to grapple with that constitutional34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 question, right? So maybe you want to talk about it.2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, let me ­­ I'm3 delighted to talk about it, but before I do, let me4 actually address that. I don't think you necessarily5 have to address the question of exclusive power to rule6 for us, and here's why: I think that, given the7 petitioner's position that 214(d) does not change8 recognition, the official recognition position of the9 United States, and the Senate amicus brief saying it10 doesn't change official recognition position of the11 United States, then that's a given, that the official12 recognition position of the United States is that we are13 not recognizing any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem14 at this point until the parties work it out.15 With that as a given, the separation of16 powers problem with Section 214(d) is that it forces the17 Executive Branch to engage in diplomatic communications18 that contradict our official recognition position and19 undermine the President's credibility, and that ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if it does, then their21 argument is going to be it does amount to a ­­ if it22 does contradict it, then Congress is making its own23 judgment about recognition. You have to confront that.24 Are they entitled to do that? I don't see how you can25 avoid that question.35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I'm happy to2 address it. I will address it now, but I do think that3 you can decide the question on the ground I just decided4 without ultimately resolving that question.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Couldn't you say that, at6 a minimum, the Petitioner has conceded that it is not7 clear that this is recognition?8 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's certainly the9 case and, therefore, we take as a given that the10 President's position on recognition, which is the same11 as the position every President going back to Truman, is12 the official position of the United States and the13 executive is being forced to issue diplomatic14 communications that contradict it.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, it is16 ­­ the requirement of place of birth on the passport,17 that doesn't come from the Congress. That comes from18 the executive, right?19 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. There's20 a longstanding policy there.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that the22 purpose of birthplace identified by the government, by23 the executive, is to identify the person and not ­­ it's24 not something that the President or the executive25 required out of a foreign policy concern. The purpose36Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of it was to identify the individual; isn't that right?2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that is its primary3 purpose. But even though that's its primary function4 within the passport, it has the effect of raising5 diplomatic foreign policy issues about our recognition6 position, and that is why we have had in place official7 policies in the Foreign Affairs Manual going back to the8 early 1960s that align decisions of place of birth with9 our recognition policy. And in fact, before they were10 formalized in the manual, they stretch all the way back11 to World War II. It's just inevitable that foreign12 sovereigns are going to react to that, that the way in13 which we ­­ the information that we put in that ­­14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is a pretty rough15 way to identify someone. I mean, there are hundreds of16 John Smith's in the United States.17 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's true, Justice18 Sotomayor, but, you know ­­ and this question about19 whether place of birth designations are necessary on20 passports is actually one that Congress asked the21 Comptroller General to study back several decades ago22 and there were a series of studies made, and the23 conclusion of those studies, which you can find in the24 current version of the Foreign Affairs Manual, not the25 one in the joint appendix, but the one on the State37Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Department's web site, is that you really have to have2 them for two reasons. And the first is that very often3 foreign nations require place of birth information to4 let you travel to that nation, so it's going to be5 highly inconvenient if it's not in the passport.6 And second, law enforcement and7 counterterrorism officials were quite concerned that8 passports were going to become less effective in their9 efforts if you removed the place of birth designation.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you the question I11 asked Ms. Lewin. What exactly is the position of the12 executive regarding Israel's exercise of sovereign13 powers in Jerusalem? Is it the case that it is the14 position of the executive that Israel cannot lawfully15 exercise any sovereign powers within Jerusalem?16 GENERAL VERRILLI: The position of the17 executive is that we recognize, as a practical matter,18 the authority of Israel over West Jerusalem. With19 respect to the rest of Jerusalem, the issue is far more20 complicated. It might well be, as a practical matter,21 although I confess I don't specifically know the answer22 to the question you asked Ms. Lewin about the status of23 the birth certificate issued there, it might well be24 that, as a practical matter, we would accept it as25 evidence of birth. Of course we would also issue ­­38Alderson Reporting Company            GENERAL VERRILLI:            JUSTICE ALITO:  ­­            GENERAL VERRILLI:as a practical matter, I don'tanything about our recognitionrecognizing practical reality.Right.in order to get that.Well, that's right.  Butthink one can inferpolicy from that.  We'reOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it must have beenaccepted as evidence of birth or the passport wouldnever have been issued.            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, we do have theconsular notification of birth.            JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you had to providea birth certificate ­­            I do think, for example, Your Honor, if wewere to start issuing passports to people born in theCrimea tomorrow that identified Russia as the country ofbirth, that would carry obvious implications for ourforeign policy position, and it would contradict theforeign policy position in a way that could be quitedeleterious.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say there'sa ­­ that passports are printed in Country A, not theUnited States, and there's a printing plant there, andCongress passes a law saying, no, you must have thepassports printed in Country B because we don't think39Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 you should recognize Country A. Does that interfere2 with the President's recognition power?3 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I'm trying ­­ try4 to give you a precise answer to that. If the statute5 said they may not ­­ passports may not be printed in6 Country A because the United States does not recognize7 Country A, that would be ­­8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because Congress9 wished the President would not recognize Country A. So10 in response to that, we're directing that passports that11 are now printed in Country A be printed in Country B.12 GENERAL VERRILLI: That would be a harder13 case than this one, I think, because it doesn't as14 clearly implicate the President's ability to give effect15 to recognition power. And one reason it doesn't is16 because that doesn't affect the content of the17 diplomatic communication in the way that Section 214(d)18 does.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your20 position was that the President has the exclusive right21 to decide what interferes with his recognition power.22 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think that the23 President has the right to give effect to his24 recognition power, and Congress cannot try to command25 the Executive Branch to act in a manner itself that40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 contradicts the President's recognition decision because2 that prevents the President from giving effect to that3 decision. And we do think, to go back to Your Honor's4 question, that it is an exclusive power with the5 President.6 It is ­­ after all, recognition is not7 lawmaking. It is an executive function. And one would,8 therefore, expect that it'd be assigned to the Executive9 by the Constitution and not to the Congress. And10 when ­­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: War making is an executive12 function, too.13 GENERAL VERRILLI: But with respect to ­­14 with respect to the executive functions around15 recognition, when Congress wanted the ­­ excuse me, when16 the framers wanted the Congress to play a role and the17 Constitution envisions a role for the framers in those18 executive functions, it's prescribed. Article II gives19 the Senate a role in confirming ambassadors, it gives20 the Senate a role in advice and consent for treaties.21 And there isn't anything in Article II as a structural22 matter that gives the Congress ­­ the Senate or the23 Congress a comparable role with respect to recognition24 decisions.2541JUSTICE ALITO:  If I think that ­­ thatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Congress generally ­­ that Congress has the authority2 under the Constitution to require identification3 information in passports and to specify the4 identification information that's included, if I ­­ if I5 believe that, then the effect of your argument, I guess,6 is that something that Congress can do is7 unconstitutional if it affects the recognition power ­­8 the President's recognition authority in ­­ in some way.9 Is that the ­­ is that ­­10 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, our position is11 narrower. I think all you need to decide to decide this12 case in the government's favor here is that what13 Congress can't do is use the authority it has to14 regulate passports, and we acknowledge this, as we did in our15 brief, that Congress has authority to regulate16 passports. It can't use that authority to command the17 Executive Branch to issue diplomatic communication that18 contradicts the government's official position on19 recognition. And that we would say ­­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't ­­ I don't like21 to, you know, just keep going back to the same thing.22 It seems to me that you could draft a statement that23 actually furthers your position. This passport does not24 indicate that the government of the United States and25 the Secretary of State recognize that Israel has42Alderson Reporting Company78 think quite 9JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Lewin answered, Icandidly ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it doesn't further ­­it further it?GENERAL VERRILLI:  Because the very need toOfficial￼1 sovereign jurisdiction over Israel, and you'd actually2 be making your case.3 GENERAL VERRILLI: I appreciate the appeal4 of that idea, Justice Kennedy, but the problem with it5 is that the need to make that statement doesn't further6 the diplomatic interest of the United States ­­10 why doesn't 1112 make the statement calls the credibility of the13 President's representation of our recognition position14 into question. And the reason ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just like the16 signing statement.17 GENERAL VERRILLI: Excuse me, Mr. Chief18 Justice.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just like the20 signing statement, which said precisely what21 Justice Kennedy suggested, that the Executive could do22 at this point.23 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. And it did not24 have and I ­­ but I think that's the point. The25 a ­­ signing statement was in the nature of a disclaimer43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 and it did not prevent the damage to the credibility of2 the United States.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, I think4 the answer to the question that Ms. Lewin gave was that5 she said yes, the Executive could put that on the6 passport. But she also said Congress could then pass a7 law saying, this is antithetical to our view, and that8 doesn't have to be put on the passport. On the passport9 is just birthplace, Israel, period. Congress could pass10 that into law and counter whatever the President does.11 GENERAL VERRILLI: And I do think that's the12 necessary implication of the Petitioner's argument here,13 not only that Congress could forbid a disclaimer, but14 Congress could require that the ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that law isn't in16 front of us.17 GENERAL VERRILLI: But ­­ but were the ­­18 were the Court to uphold the constitutionality of the19 law that is in front of you, it seems to me the20 necessary implication of that would be that Congress21 could prevent a disclaimer, it could require not just22 that Israel be listed but Jerusalem, Israel be listed23 on ­­ on a country of birth, and it seems to me that24 those are very serious interferences with the25 President's ­­44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, if I'm2 understanding your narrow holding, just so that we can3 underscore it, what you're saying is that Congress can't4 compel speech by the President with respect to foreign5 relations.6 GENERAL VERRILLI: I would put it a little7 more narrowly, Your Honor, that Congress cannot compel8 the Executive to issue diplomatic communications that9 contradict the official position of the United States on10 a matter of recognition. I think that's all ­­ that's11 the question before the Court in this case.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you see, I ­­ I pick13 up this passport, and it says place of birth, Israel.14 Do I know whether this person was born in Jerusalem or15 in ­­ in Haifa?16 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, you don't. But17 the ­­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: So how does it ­­ how does19 it advertise to the world that ­­ that the President is20 contradicting himself? All you know is that the person21 was born in Israel. It could have been anywhere in22 Israel.23 GENERAL VERRILLI: The world knows that we24 will issue thousands of passports to people born in25 Jerusalem identifying them as born in Israel, and the45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 world knows that we will be doing that because the2 Congress of the United States required it. And those3 actions under ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it is not a5 communication contained in the passport itself, is it?6 You're just saying that ­­ that this ­­ this piece of7 legislation advertises to the world what the situation8 will be, but ­­ but you're not compelling the President9 to ­­ to say that this individual was born in Jerusalem10 and we're going to say he was born in Israel, because11 you can't tell that from the passport.12 GENERAL VERRILLI: You're requiring the13 President to make statements thousands of times that14 contradict the official recognition position of the15 United States. Now, it is true that ­­ that a border16 guard in a ­­ in a country where a person is traveling17 won't know whether this particular passport is one of18 them, I suppose, unless they ask for place of birth19 information ­­ city of birth information. But unless20 they ask that, they won't know with the particular21 passport.22 But what everyone will know, what foreign23 sovereigns will know, what the parties in this region24 will know is that thousands of times the Executive25 Branch is issuing passports that contradict our official46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 recognition position with respect to persons born in2 Jerusalem.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, in ­­ general,4 when I travel abroad and come back to the United States5 or when I go to a foreign country and they're stamping6 my passport, do they have forms that require you to7 identify the city?8 GENERAL VERRILLI: I'm not aware that they9 do, Your Honor. I don't know the answer to that. I'm10 not aware that they do.1112 do. I know 1314 Honor. But15 here with ­­ with what 214 does is that it tells the16 Executive to communicate a message that the Executive17 believes contradicts our position and undermines the18 President's credibility as our sole spokesman in matters19 of diplomacy. And there is not an issue on which theJUSTICE SCALIA:  I know that some of themthat some of them do.GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, they may well, YourI do ­­ but I do think the essential problem20 President's21 question of2223 the most vexing and volatile and difficult diplomatic24 issue that this nation has faced for decades. It goes25 all the way back to President Truman. And the fact ofcredibility could be more important than thethe status of Jerusalem.The question of the status of Jerusalem is47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the matter is that the parties in the region, the2 nations in the region, and frankly people around the3 world and governments around the world scrutinize every4 word that comes out of the United States Government and5 every action that the United States Government takes in6 order to see whether we can continue to be trusted as an7 honest broker who could stand apart from this conflict8 and help bring it to resolution.9 And there is no doubt that Section 214(d),10 when it was enacted, had a serious adverse effect11 calling our credibility into question. You can just12 look at the statements from foreign parties that are in13 the Joint Appendix and the State Department communiqué14 at pages 231 to 233. You can look at contemporaneous15 press accounts from that time, and it seems to me16 without ­­ of course, if we were required to implement17 this, we would do everything we could to try to mitigate18 the problem. But it seems to me that the right ­­ it is19 quite important for this Court to understand that there20 is a very serious risk that that harm to our credibility21 as an honest broker on this very serious vexing issue22 could be called into serious question ­­23 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would that be so? No24 matter how this Court decides, everyone will know what25 the position of the President is. Everyone will know48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 what Congress thought when they passed this legislation.2 Whatever we do, that's not going to3 decision isn't going to be based on4 have about whether Jerusalem should5 of Israel or the capital of Israel.6 So why will there be any effect on foreign7 policy except by people who will misunderstand the8 situation, either ­­ either because they really don't9 understand it or they will exploit it in some way?10 GENERAL VERRILLI: I've got ­­ I've got at11 least two points to make about that if I could. First,12 it's not a misperception. It's an accurate perception.13 One looks at 214 as a whole, not just 214(d). What14 214(d) ­­ what 214 does is try to force the Executive15 Branch to take a series of steps16 take if it did not recognize the17 over Jerusalem, and that nations18 did recognize the sovereignty ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: But Congress did that, so20 nothing that we do is going to change that or change21 what Congress thought.22 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think that's, with all23 due respect, too easy an assumption, Your Honor. The24 difference between when this statute was enacted ­­ and25 it did give rise to very serious problems that we had to49Alderson Reporting Companybe changed, and ourany view that we maybe regarded as partthat no nation wouldsovereignty of Israelwould only take if theyOfficial￼1 work very hard to try to get under control. The2 difference between then and now, there's two very3 important differences, and they lead to a very important4 conclusion.5 The first important difference is it won't6 be one branch of the United States Government saying7 that this should happen. It will be two branches of the8 United States Government saying it should happen. It9 won't be that we will ­­ that this statute will have10 been enacted, but it won't be enforced. It will be11 enforced.1213 together is14 credibility15 question of16 of Jerusalem until the parties work it out will17 inevitably and seriously be called into question and18 into doubt.19 Foreign governments, foreign peoples will20 not be able to have complete confidence that the21 position that the President announces on behalf of the22 United States is, in fact, the position of the United23 States.24 That is exactly why Section 214 violates the25 separation of powers, even if you conclude that Congress50And the consequence of those two thingsthat the credibility of the executive ­­ theof the President on this fundamentalwhere the United States stands on the statusAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425might have some residual power, which we obviouslystrongly disagree with.  The official position of theUnited States is that Jerusalem, we don't recognize anynation's sovereignty over Jerusalem until the partieshave worked that issue out on their own.            And what this ­­ what this statute does ifit was enforced will undermine the credibility of our ­­of the President's ability to maintain that criticallyimportant diplomatic position as we move forward.            Thank you.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.            Ms. Lewin, you have four minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALYZA D. LEWIN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MS. LEWIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Just acouple of points.  Justice Sotomayor, this is notrequesting that the government lie on a passport.  Asthe Solicitor General said, this is just recognizing apractical reality that Israel is exercising ­­            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it's not.  It's theplace of birth.  If you say Israel, you believe that ­­you're saying that you believe that person was born inIsrael.            MS. LEWIN:  Yes.  Well, seven years prior tothe passage of this legislation, Congress passed the51Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Jerusalem Embassy Act, and in the Senate brief it's2 actually referred ­­ amicus brief, it's referred to in3 Footnote 10, which had required that the embassy be4 moved to Jerusalem and provided the President with a5 waiver ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there was a7 waiver ­­ and there was a waiver provided and every8 President has exercised the waiver.9 MS. LEWIN: So this would be, though,10 recognizing, as was said before, that there is a11 disagreement, but not ­­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you tell me13 it's not a lie? You, the United States, are being asked14 to put on the passport that you believe the place of15 birth of this individual is Israel, and the16 government ­­ and the executive has said, no, we don't17 think it was Israel, we think it was Jerusalem.18 MS. LEWIN: But the speech is the speech of19 the individual who has self­identified.20 JUSTICE21 not the one issuing22 The document says.23 between sovereigns.24 MS. LEWIN: But we are permitting that25 speech when it comes to West Bank, Gaza Strip, a host ofSOTOMAYOR:  But the individual isthe passport.  It's the government.This is a diplomatic exchange52Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 others. We're recognizing and allowing that speech.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I take it, Ms. Lewin, when3 you say the West Bank, I take it you think that Congress4 could pass the identical statute with respect to a child5 born in Hebron, say.6 MS. LEWIN: Saying that ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: That that, too, is Israel?8 MS. LEWIN: Correct.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Okay.10 MS. LEWIN: We are providing two alternative11 arguments, Justice Kagan: One saying that this is does12 not amount to recognition; or if the Court decides to13 reach the separation of powers question and views this14 as somehow implicating the recognition clause, that at15 this point the law passed by Congress would trump the16 President. Allowing the State Department's say­so to17 control because it's an expert in foreign relations18 would be abdicating an independent function and would19 turn the President into an autocrat whose word controls.20 We suggest that this is analogous, the21 recognition power, is analogous to the President's22 authority to enter into executive agreements to resolve23 foreign claims, and that just as though that is not an24 explicit authorization provided to the President, it's25 also not exclusive, and the agreements entered into by53Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the President cannot contradict or run counter to the2 express will of Congress.3 With regard to the international response to4 this, the consequences, first of all, described by the5 Solicitor General are grossly exaggerated. And what the6 world knows could be the ­­ first of all, the United7 States State Department could make clear in their8 statements, as they did with Taiwan, that this does not9 change the United States' policy with regard to the10 sovereignty over Jerusalem.11 And because the passports would be12 indistinguishable from those who are born elsewhere,13 there's no continuing statement. While this may14 initially have some impact, over time, and I propose a15 short time, particularly if the United States makes that16 statement, this will become a nonissue because there's17 no continuing ­­18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I say that this seems a19 particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of,20 "oh, it's no big deal" argument. I mean, history21 suggests that everything is a big deal with respect to22 the status of Jerusalem. And right now Jerusalem is a23 tinderbox because of issues about the status of and24 access to a particularly holy site there. And so sort25 of everything matters, doesn't it?54Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MS. LEWIN:  Well, the ­­ it is a sensitiveissue, but to suggest that what will go on a passport asa place of birth is going to implicate or make it worse,there's no evidence of that.Thank you.
