Mr. Crabtree.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. CRABTREE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. CRABTREE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three core reasons why the Court should hold that disparate impact is an available method of proof in age discrimination cases. First, the Court held in Griggs that identical prohibitory language prohibited facially neutral actions by an employer to disproportionately impacted the protected class.QUESTION: Mr. Crabtree, we are not talking about a situation where you are claiming that the fact of disparate impact gives rise to a permissible inference of intentional discrimination. You are relying just on disparate impact alone, are you not?MR. CRABTREE: No, Your Honor. We believe that disparate impact both serves the purpose of proving indirectly that perhaps subconscious biases exist, as well as detecting biases that could otherwise be concealed.QUESTION: Well, now in Washington against3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Davis, we held that disparate impact was not enough by2 itself under the statute or Constitution that you could3 infer from it an intent to discriminate. Now, are you, I4 didn't get the impression from the court of appeals5 opinion that you are arguing that this plan by the6 Respondent supports an inference of an intent to7 discriminate on the basis of age.8 MR. CRABTREE: We believe it does support an9 inference of an intent, an intent that does not need to be10 proven, that it justifies that it can justify the11 necessity for the doctrine because without it, it would be12 easy for an employer to conceal its intent for example, an13 employer could choose a device like a five-year rule in14 which they said that we won't hire anybody with more than15 five years' experience or we'll have speed tests.16 QUESTION: That's a very handy prophylactic17 rule, but with it, once you, once you acknowledge that18 indeed the malicious intent is necessary with it, with the19 rule that you propose, you are going to get a lot of20 employers that have no such malicious intent.21 MR. CRABTREE: Justice Scalia, we are not22 suggesting that malicious intent is required at all for23 disparate impact. We are suggesting that disparate impact24 will detect that as well, or at least the provision --25 QUESTION: You just say it is bad in itself.4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425It is not bad because it shows malicious intent.MR. CRABTREE: That's certainly true. Weabsolutely believe that.QUESTION: Because if the only reason it's badis because it shows malicious intent, my goodness, it seems to me it goes much too far. There are a lot of employers who have in place policies that may affect elderly employees more harshly who, you know, have no intent to do that.MR. CRABTREE: That's certainly true, and definitely, the doctrine goes beyond that. But what we are suggesting is it will also, it also prevents an employer from being able to hide behind --QUESTION: Well, you want us to consider the case on the assumption that the employer has no intent to discriminate. He actually has, his intentions are absolutely pure, but in some instances, he is still going to be liable under the adverse, pardon me, disparate impact theory.MR. CRABTREE: In many instances, that is correct, Justice Scalia.￼correct.QUESTION: And that's your position.MR. CRABTREE: That is our position. That'sQUESTION: Okay. So you are relying on5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425disparate impact alone?MR. CRABTREE: That is correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: May I ask, because it's always helpful to me to know, what's at stake in the particular case. What is the practice that you claim has a disparate impact in this case?MR. CRABTREE: What we have alleged in this case is that the employer's reduction in force has had a disparate impact upon the older workers, the selection device of the older workers.QUESTION: Are you saying reductions in force are always practices that if they have a disparate impact, give rise to a, an age discrimination claim?MR. CRABTREE: No, Your Honor, because in virtually every instance where there is reduction in force it will be quite easy for an employer to satisfy the defense under the reasonable factors of the age provision of the act.QUESTION: What is different about the reduction in force in this case?MR. CRABTREE: Well, in this case, Your Honor, as the district court acknowledged in its opinion that we are proceeding from, we had evidence at the highest levels that the decision to undertake the downsizing was actually a decision to get rid of, intended to get rid of older6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 workers.2 QUESTION: That's the disparate treatment3 claim?4 MR. CRABTREE: Unfortunately, it's not, Your5 Honor, because as the district court judge acknowledged,6 we could not make a disparate treatment case under these7 facts because in the disparate treatment case, we would8 still have to prove, unless we could make a cat's paw9 analysis that the actual decision maker harbored an animus10 against the employee who is terminated. But what we are11 suggesting under this model and under this framework is12 that if we can make a prima facie case of disparate13 impact, then the employer can justify that impact by14 showing that its decision was based upon reasonable15 factors and that those reasonable factors --16 QUESTION: But this is what I -- excuse me for17 interrupting, but is it the decision to downsize that it18 has to be reasonable or the particular discharge decisions19 on each individual have to be reasonable?20 MR. CRABTREE: We have identified in this case21 the action of the employer as being the decision to22 downsize itself.23 QUESTION: The decision to downsize itself?24 MR. CRABTREE: Which for most instances will be25 much more difficult probably for plaintiffs than it would7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 be if you want on a more micro-level. However --2 QUESTION: Why would it be more difficult? All3 you have to prove if I understand your theory is that4 there are more older workers in the group that were5 discharged than younger workers?6 MR. CRABTREE: Will, it would have to be a7 substantially disparate impact between the two groups. It8 would be more difficult because it would be much easier9 for an employer to justify a reduction in force in almost10 any circumstance.11 QUESTION: I thought you conceded that it was12 not enough for you to show disparate impact. That you13 had, say 70 percent of the people and my problem with your14 presentation is the same as Justice Stevens. In every15 disparate impact case that I know, a rule neutral is on16 its face that disparate impact like the high school17 diploma requirement in Griggs, there is the standard that18 has a differential effect. A high school diploma, a pen19 and paper test as in Washington V. Davis, a height, weight20 requirement as in Dothard vs. Rawlinson, but you don't21 come to us with any rule, standard, practice. You just22 say reduction in force.23 MR. CRABTREE: Well, what we are saying is24 this, is that the Court indicated in Wards Cove that the25 plaintiff in an age -- in a discrimination case is to8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 identify a specific practice or action by an employer that2 results in disparate impact that cannot be justified. We3 have identified this downsizing as being such a practice4 because we don't believe the employer can justify it5 because the downsizing was motivated by desire to --6 QUESTION: Why don't we leave motive out of it7 for purposes -- forget motive. Let's imagine in your8 case, that's what I thought this case was about, we9 imagine in your case the employer had a wonderful motive.10 There are other cases where the rule in question was we11 are going to fire some tenured teachers to save money.12 That was the real reason to save money. The tenured13 teachers tend to be older teachers. There was another14 case in which they said the court looked at a rule that15 said we will fire people in the higher-paid positions.16 That was their real reason to save money.17 But the court said each of those rules like18 your case, too, has a disparate impact on older employees.19 And just saving money is not a justification and therefore20 the plaintiff wins. Now, I take it that's the proposition21 you are defending.22 MR. CRABTREE: We are defending that23 proposition. That's correct.24 QUESTION: Okay. Then the other parts to me25 are easy. Of course you can use it to prove bad motive,9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 et cetera, but that's the hard proposition. Now, I wish2 you would explain why as a matter of law that tough3 proposition nonetheless is the law.4 MR. CRABTREE: Well, we believe it's the law5 because the prohibitions themselves as construed in Griggs6 apply to actions and then the reasonable --7 QUESTION: Well, the background in Griggs was8 racial discrimination, and the policies there seem to me9 to rest on a long history of societal and historical bias10 against black people. Now, we don't have that background11 with age discrimination, do we?12 MR. CRABTREE: No, Justice O'Connor, we do not.13 QUESTION: So it might be quite a different14 proposition here.15 MR. CRABTREE: Respectfully, no, Your Honor.16 And here's why. As the court acknowledged in Watson, the17 court is not limited a disparate impact to remedying past18 problems with discrimination. Disparate impact goes19 beyond that. Disparate impact exists to detect20 subconscious stereotypes operating in the work force,21 exactly what the court identified as the primary form of22 discrimination that exists under the ADEA.23 Thirdly, in Griggs the court said that the24 legislative purpose of the act was "plain from the25 language of the statute", so the court was looking at the10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 statute itself.2 QUESTION: That's a good idea. What is the3 statute that we are dealing with here? Can we look at the4 language of the statute?5 MR. CRABTREE: Sure, Your Honor. It's on page6 5.A, the appendix to the petitioner's brief. And when you7 look at the statute itself, what you see between (a)(1)8 and (a)(2) is a difference between a micro and a9 macro-orientation. In (a)(1), we are concerned about an10 employer's individual actions directed towards an11 individual employee, but in (a)(2), we are concerned with12 an employer's macro-actions directed towards its employees13 and how that impacts individuals.14 QUESTION: In each of those cases, Mr.15 Crabtree, it says because of such individual's age. Now,16 doesn't that suggest that there is some motive17 requirement?18 MR. CRABTREE: No, Your Honor. We don't19 believe it does and I'll explain why. When you look at20 (a)(2), the clause because of such individual's age, the21 word individual is critical because at the beginning of22 two, it reads, to limit, segregate or classify his23 employees in any way which would deprive or tend to24 deprive any individual of employment opportunities or25 otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because of such individual's age. So the clause relates to the effect and not to the motive of the actor.QUESTION: I would think it relates to, to the limit, segregate or classify.MR. CRABTREE: It cannot, Your Honor, because the word his employees follows those words.QUESTION: In any event, the wording is identical to Title VII, and Title VII on that wording has been held to have this differential impact theory for sex, as well as race.MR. CRABTREE: That's absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. And of course, Congress has never acted to expressly prohibit disparate impact under Title VII. The only prohibition of disparate impact under Title VII is in its age as the court construed in Griggs and Griggs' progeny.QUESTION: Was this language adopted in this form after it had been clearly established that the Title VII language did include disparate impact? You know, as an original matter, I wouldn't have thought it did.           MR. CRABTREE:  Oh, it did not.QUESTION: We held that. Now, was this language adopted after we held that or before it?MR. CRABTREE: It was before, Your Honor. It certainly was. However --12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: After Title VII, but before Griggs?2 MR. CRABTREE: That's correct. And to hold3 that this language does not prohibit disparate impact￼4 would mean5 VII. Even6 was define7that there was no disparate impact under Title in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, all Congress did a defense.QUESTION: But it seems to me that even if we8 accept your reading of the statute which I am not sure is9 the more natural reading, you still have because of such10 individual's age, that is to say what you would call11 disparate impact, what the statute says adverse impact12 must still be because of such individual's age and if we13 think because of, implies or necessarily requires a bad14 purpose, you still have the same problem.15 MR. CRABTREE: If because of did require a bad16 purpose, we would, however, there is two reasons why we17 can, why it is not. One is that the first one is that the18 reasonable factors other than age defense cannot make19 sense if the prohibitions only apply to intentional20 actions.21 QUESTION: Now you are going to the second. Just22 so I'm focusing in on this. (A)(2), it seems to me that23 your reading of the statute doesn't explain because of,24 then you have to go to this other part of the statute,25 which you have to do any way. So I mean this whole13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 argument over how to interpret 2 it seems to me doesn't2 get you there.3 MR. CRABTREE: Again, we are relating because4 of back to the effect of the individual and we are relying5 upon the court's interpretation of that language in6 Griggs.7 QUESTION: Well, one, one might feel that8 Griggs is stare decisis because it could feel that perhaps9 it reasoning would not readily be extended if there was10 some reason for distinguishing it.11 MR. CRABTREE: That might make sense. I would12 agree, Your Honor, however we don't believe there is any13 basis to distinguish here given the court's subsequent14 cases post-Griggs.15 QUESTION: But as -- may I go back to the16 question that we opened with, and that is I don't know of17 any case under Title VII where someone could just say18 reduction in force affected more women than men,19 therefore, I have an impact case or reduction in force, it20 affected more minorities than majorities so therefore.21 It's always been some specific practice that you could22 identify some rule, some neutral rule. In fact, it's even23 sometimes referred to as neutralized base discriminatory24 and impact.25 Here I don't -- reduction of force in and of14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 itself is not such a neutral rule. It's -- it's too2 general. So I, what is the precise rule practice standard3 that's comparable to a high school diploma, a height and4 weight. What is there in this case?5 MR. CRABTREE: Your Honor, two answers. First6 of all, that we equate reduction in force to a test. It's7 a selection process. We are not challenging a question on8 the test. We are challenging the test itself. But even9 if the court were to find that we have inadequately10 identified the action of the employer that should be11 subject to disparate impact analysis, we would still, it's12 an interlocutory proceeding. We would be happy to proceed13 on the theory as the court redefines or the court defines14 disparate impact under the ADEA. We would amend our15 complaint in accordance with the court's ruling.16 QUESTION: I don't think that the district17 court finding allows you to say the standard is the18 reduction itself because the district judge said that the19 people involved held a wide variety of jobs, were managed20 and supervised by different people and were terminated at21 different times by different decision makers based on22 different considerations of criteria, and that seems to me23 just wholly to reject that there is a rule or a standard.24 MR. CRABTREE: The reason why we believe it's25 important to be able to do the analysis with the reduction15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of force being the action is because otherwise it would2 allow an employer to purposely choose to do a reduction in3 force to get rid of its older workers where there is a4 corporate culture pervaded by ageism and have consequences5 as it did here where it greatly reduced the age of its6 work force.7 QUESTION: What is your closest precedent under8 Title VII dealing with race or dealing with sex where you9 have something so groundly general as a reduction in force10 with different decisions, different standards, different11 times?￼12 MR. CRABTREE: There are cases dealing13 reduction of force under Title VII. There is one14 vs. Medical Center, Inc., It was out of the third15 657 F.2d 1322. There have probably been others.16 QUESTION: And nothing more specific than a17 reduction in force?18 MR. CRABTREE: Candidly, Justice Ginsburg, I19 don't recall. I just know --20 QUESTION: Mr. Crabtree, I thought the question21 on which we granted certiorari was not whether this22 particular claim of disparate impact was too general or23 not specific enough. But whether the whole, I'll read it,24 is a disparate impact method of proving age discrimination25 available to plaintiffs.16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005withNAACPcircuit.1 MR. CRABTREE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.2 QUESTION: And I would hope you would address3 Justice Breyer's question in which he said why should we4 do this to say that tenured employees are the higher5 salaried employees? What would be the justification in a6 case such as that for using your theory of liability?7 MR. CRABTREE: Well, in most instances,8 employer is going to be able to explain why he engages in9 any selection process.10 QUESTION: Most instances, they can't explain11 it very well. In most instances, I think in a business or12 a university, you begin to look into it, and it dissolves13 in front of your eyes. People say you could do it this14 way, you could do it that way, you could do it some other15 way, and it will turn out you haven't thought about it16 that much. Now, it may well be sensible to make an17 employer go to that effort we were talking about race and18 gender, and yet here, there is so many rules correlated19 with age. There are so many that how could the employer20 run his business where you are going to have a court21 second-guessing every single rule that's correlated with22 age. That's the problem. What's your response?23 MR. CRABTREE: And that may very well be why24 Congress chose to use the result factors other than age25 language, and that is why there are, although we don't17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425agree with them, why there were good intellectual arguments that reasonable factors other than age is something less than business necessity. That it is easier to justify.QUESTION: What would your test be? I mean do you think the ninth circuit in the cases I mentioned was right? I mean, if you are going to apply exactly the same tough tests as in these other places, maybe they were. What's your opinion about that?MR. CRABTREE: We believe that the term is ambiguous. And we believe for that reason the court should defer interpretation.QUESTION: Which is what? Say what you think the form of words is?MR. CRABTREE: That it is that the employer must justify the action as being business necessity.QUESTION: But reasonable factors other than age provision doesn't really solve Justice Breyer's problem, does it, because it puts the burden on the employer to establish that, doesn't it?MR. CRABTREE: It does, Your Honor.QUESTION: So you are still in a situation where the employer said well he could have done it a lot of different ways and you are saying I'm sorry, that's no good.18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CRABTREE: But if the employer must only show that its action was reasonable, it is not as demanding as showing that it was necessary.QUESTION: You said emphasize reason. QUESTION: It's still a burden on him.MR. CRABTREE: It is still a burden on him.Yes, Your Honor.           QUESTION:  May I go back to the --QUESTION: Please.QUESTION: May I go back to your argument of a minute ago that the, that the various defenses make no sense except on the disparate impact theory possibility of disparate impact theory. What is your response to the argument that they make equally good sense on the theory that they respond to mixed motive discharges? What's your answer?MR. CRABTREE: They don't make sense on the mixed motive analysis because in the mixed motive analysis there is still an issue as to whether or not the employer's illegal motive caused an illegal action. In a, in a statute, it provides that the action is otherwise prohibitive, so you already have an action that is itself a violation of the act but-for the defense that follows. We don't have the same concerns we have in a mixed motive case where we don't know if the motive of the employer19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 actually caused the action. It's already been determined2 as a premise of the defense.3 There is an additional reason why we believe4 that the court should hold that disparate impact applies5 under the ADEA. And that is Congress passed the OWBPA and6 provided that employees who were terminated in reductions7 in force should be entitled to, were entitled to receive8 physical information prior to deciding whether or not to9 take the termination package, presumably of substantial10 economic value, or take their chances in litigation.11 Given that disparate treatment can generally12 not be predicated upon nothing more than statistics. And13 given that employees terminated in RIF's usually do not14 have an independent basis to suspect that they are being15 singled out for discrimination.16 QUESTION: Mr. Crabtree, could I just come back17 for a moment to, to your argument which I think is an18 important one that some of the defenses don't make sense19 unless there is a discriminatory impact basis. What about20 the defense that says it will not be unlawful to discharge21 or otherwise discipline an individual, an individual, for22 good cause? I mean, that's obviously a redundancy. It23 can only imply to an intentional discrimination case, not24 to a, not to an impact case. But it's obviously redundant25 because if you are disciplining him for good cause, you20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 are obviously not disciplining him with a motive of2 punishing his age. It's just thoroughly redundant. It3 seems to me a lot of these defenses are redundant. They4 are just there to make clear that there are safe harbors,5 one of which is disciplining an individual for good cause.6 Another one is observing the terms of a seniority system7 and so forth.8 MR. CRABTREE: Well, when you are observing the9 terms of a seniority system, you know, you may be looking10 at age directly. You may have, you can easily have a11 violation that exists under the act otherwise.12 QUESTION: Well, no, I don't, I don't know any13 seniority systems that go on the basis of people's age as14 opposed to how long they have been working there. Do you15 know any seniority systems that say you have more16 seniority if you are 65?17 MR. CRABTREE: I'm not sure, Your Honor. I18 don't have an answer to that. But I don't think that we19 can disregard the words of the reasonable factors other20 than age in this case. I don't think we can ignore the21 term reasonable factors, and when you look at, at (f)(1),22 and you look --￼2324 the way to25 individualQUESTION: It's redundant. It's just redundant discharge, it's lawful to discharge anfor good cause. Of course it's redundant. You21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 don't have to say that once you say that there has to be2 either intentional discrimination, or as you would say,3 adverse impact. You are talking about disciplining an4 individual. You really don't need that. Once you say5 there has to be intentional discrimination, but it's there6 just to make everything that much clearer. And you can7 make the same argument about the BFOA provision.8 MR. CRABTREE: You might be able to make that argument,9 but it is not the most logical argument. It does not10 respect Congress' words. It does not respect the fact11 that Congress required that the factors not just be12 neutral, but that they be reasonable because even if we13 ignored the otherwise prohibitive language, Justice14 Scalia, we still have to give effect to the term15 reasonable.16 Congress not merely required that the factors17 exist or that they be legitimate or bonafide as in the EPA18 or as Gunther acknowledged, but that they be reasonable as19 well.20 QUESTION: I don't want. I think you should be21 able to reserve your rebuttal time. But I do have one22 question. You seem to acceed to Justice O'Connor's23 suggestion that Griggs involving racial discrimination24 involved deeply rooted attitudes which called for special25 rules, and that those just don't apply with the age22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 factor. Would you want us to write the opinion that way,2 or are there some subtle biases against elderly workers3 that are important to support your theory?4 If you train a worker, you are going to get a5 better return on your investment as the worker is younger,6 etc.7 MR. CRABTREE: That's certainly true, Justice8 Kennedy. There are those subtle biases and that's what9 Secretary Ward's report acknowledged and that's what the10 court acknowledged in Hazen Paper when it said that subtle11 biases, stereotypes are largely an issue, not animus in12 age discrimination and that is consistent with the court's13 holding in Watson that disparate impact exists largely to14 detect subtle biases. If I may, Your Honor, I'll reserve15 the remainder of my time.￼1617 we'll hear 18192021 please the22 consistent23 Power Company, this Court can and should hold that the age24 discrimination and employment act does not make --25 QUESTION: Even though the language is23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Crabtree. Mr. Nager, from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. NAGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Court: If I may, I'd like to address why fully and giving full respect to Griggs vs. Duke1 essentially the same?2 MR. NAGER: Justice O'Connor, it's not. It is3 common language in Section 4, but this Court doesn't4 construe language in a statute in isolation from the5 remainder of the statute, and the remainder of this6 statute is quite different. The remainder of the statute7 includes the reasonable factors other than age provision.8 The remainder of this statute is based upon a report of9 the Secretary of Labor which said that the problems of age10 discrimination in the workplace were quite distinct and11 quite different from the problems that motivated the12 enactment of Title VII and it's the problems that13 motivated the enactment of Title VII which gave rise to14 Griggs. That's what this Court said in Griggs. It's what15 your opinion for the court says in Watson. So what, if we16 look at the statute, statutory language not in isolation,17 because in fact, we can read all of the court's Title VII18 disparate impact cases and we won't see the language19 parsed. The court looked at that language in terms of the20 overall objectives of the statute, and rendered a decision21 in light of the distinct and enormous problems of race22 discrimination that this country has faced and dealt with.23 Age discrimination, the Congress itself recognized was24 different. That's why it didn't include age in Title VII.25 Instead it commissioned a report from the secretary of24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 labor to tell us about the problems of older workers.2 Recommend legislation to us.3 And the bill, the report that was commissioned4 was submitted. This Court repeatedly in EEOC vs. Wyoming,5 in Hazen Paper, has repeatedly recognized that that report6 set the foundation for the statute.7 QUESTION: I thought you were going to tell us8 that because of age, is one of your strongest points, and9 as Justice O'Connor said, that's the same language10 structure that we had in Griggs, and that we would have to11 interpret them differently.12 MR. NAGER: You are right, Justice Kennedy.13 QUESTION: But, but, but then you automatically14 throw me over I guess to part (f) and talk about15 reasonable factors other than age, which is exactly what16 the petition wanted to do.17 MR. NAGER: That's my lack of clarity, Justice18 Kennedy. What we are suggesting to the Court is the more19 natural construction of the language in 4(a), the because20 of language, is an intent requirement. The fact of that21 intent requirement is confirmed and compelled by the22 remaining provisions in the statute. Our suggestion is23 just as your opinion in Public Employee Retirement System24 vs. Betts did.25 QUESTION: May I just interrupt. I want to be25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

NAGER: Yes, Justice Stevens, because the of the statute says that the employer can'tstructurelimit, segregate or classify his employees in a way that has an adverse effect on an individual.QUESTION: On any individual.MR. NAGER: Because of such individual's age. QUESTION: Correct. The effect that thatmodifies, not the classification.MR. NAGER: No. The comma in that provision, Ithink eliminates any ambiguity about what the because of phrase modifies. That it modifies the verbs to limit, segregate or classify.QUESTION: Even though the former is plural and the because of is singular?MR. NAGER: Because the sentence has to be read as a whole. It says limit, segregate or classify the employees in a way that has an effect on an individual because of the individual's age.QUESTION: Right.MR. NAGER: But the --QUESTION: You said it perfectly.26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 MR. NAGER: It is -- I would grant you that it2 is not the most elegantly written sentence in the world,3 but I would also urge upon you, Your Honor, that the comma4 in that sentence grammatically compels that the because of5 phrase modifies the to limit, segregate or classify.6 QUESTION: Your view is well, Title VII, the7 court really got it wrong. They are not good grammarians,8 so they got it wrong, but that's stare decisis so we'll9 leave it alone, because it's the identical wording, the F10 part I think you may have more of an argument there11 because it's not found in Title VII. But if your grammar12 argument has to be saying, and tell me if I'm wrong about13 this, the court really got it wrong in Griggs because14 there is no room for an impact test under Title VII any15 more than under age, but because the court said it in 197116 and continued to say it, we are stuck with it, but we17 don't have to make the same mistake again. Is that your18 argument?19 MR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not here to20 challenge Griggs in any respect. I am here to say that21 the more natural construction of that language was not the22 one the court adopted in Griggs, and just as this Court23 does that on occasion because of other materials that24 influence the construction of a statute.25 QUESTION: I mean, we look at the whole27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

NAGER: And that is what the court has found in its Title VII cases.￼it?thing.QUESTION: A comma is not a very big thing, isMR. NAGER: I'm sorry, could you -- QUESTION: I say a comma is not a very bigMR. NAGER: Well, it is part of the statute, and we think it has to be taken into account, but our argument that the age discrimination employment act should not be allowed to recognize disparate impact claims does not rest solely on the comma. Our point about Section 4(a), Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg is that the more natural construction of that language is the, an intent requirement, as Chief Justice Rehnquist recognized in his separate opinion on certiorari in Geller vs. Markham. The fact that the court found other considerations to lead to a different conclusion in the context of a limited class of Title VII cases does not compel a particular construction of the Age Discrimination Employment Act.28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425We have to look at those other considerations that inform the construction of the Age Discrimination Act.QUESTION: Well, I can see you point to (f) in￼the reasonableness because there in Title VII, but frankly --           MR. NAGER:  That's --QUESTION: Frankly, I take the identical words and sayis no counterpart to thatwould find it unseemly towe ignore the comma in one case. If we had paid attention to the comma, you haveto reach the same result.MR. NAGER: I don't think it's unseemly at all,Justice Ginsburg.QUESTION: If you are wrong the first time.MR. NAGER: Well, I'm not here to take --QUESTION: Which stare decisis would require us to accept for Title VII but wouldn't require us to accept for this statute.QUESTION: That's the very point I made to you, and you rejected it. I said --MR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has on any number of occasions, and I'll use the Chief Justice's opinion in Fogerty vs. Fantasy as an illustration, said that identical language in two separate statutes can be given two different meanings by this Court if a single29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 meaning isn't compelled by the words themselves and if the2 statute has different purposes or different legislative3 history. You coined that opinion.4 QUESTION: But here we know even though Griggs5 didn't come until sometime later, the Congress did, when6 it wrote the Age Discrimination Act, it did copy quite7 deliberately the Title VII language.8 MR. NAGER: That is true. But it is also the9 case that it did not copy the 4(f)(1) language. It is10 also the case that at the time --1112 looking at13 first part14 from Title15 way.1617 couldn't have known about Griggs at the time that the,18 that it used the language from Title VII in 4(a) because19 Griggs hadn't yet been decided, so that was not a20 well-established construction by this Court in 1967. But21 you are also right, it is the essence of our argument22 here, not to ask the Court to construe 4(a) in isolation.23 It'stoasktheCourttodoasitdidinBettsandasit24 does in any number of cases to construe 4(a) in light of25 the other provisions. Justice Scalia has made the point30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: But that's a different argument, the statute as a whole and saying whatever the means, here we have another part that's absent VII so we don't have to interpret it the sameMR. NAGER: I have two points. Congress1 about the discharge for cause. We also make the point2 about the reasonable factors other than age. That is an3 intent-based provision and it shows that this statute at4 every turn was concerned with employer intent, whether it5 be good cause, whether it be decisions .6 QUESTION: What you do you with the argument,7 which I think is an interesting one, that it is a8 reasonable factors other than age requirement.9 MR. NAGER: It is --10 QUESTION: If, if there were an intent11 requirement in the act, it wouldn't matter whether you are12 using reasonable factors or not, so long as you are not￼13 using age.14 That ought15 nothing to16You know, I don't like people with blue eyes. to be good enough, so long as blue eyes hasdo with age.MR. NAGER: As you have pointed out, Justice17 Scalia, it's perfectly appropriate for Congress to clarify18 and make unambiguous in any respect conceivable that it19 does not want any decision that's based upon a reasonable20 factor to be subject to liability under this statute.21 Secondly --22 QUESTION: Okay, but that argument is equally23 compatible with the position that your brother is taking24 on the other side, and if you take the ambiguity that is25 left, and you combine it with the argument that Justice31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 Ginsburg is making about the parallel language with Title2 VII, doesn't it lead you to say all right, the parallel3 language is answered only by an argument which in fact,4 boils down to an ambiguity and an ambiguity doesn't defeat5 the policy of construing like statutes, like drafted6 statutes in a like manner.7 MR. NAGER: The answer to that is no. The8 reason that it's no is because whatever one thinks the9 reasonable factor other than the word reasonable and the10 reasonable factors other than age means, it's still a11 motive-based test based upon what considerations are you12 taking into account, and --13 QUESTION: Why does it have to be a reasonable14 factor other than age? I'm not sure you have answered my15 question? So long as it's not age, the intent factor is16 not satisfied. You should be able to use an unreasonable17 factor other than age.18 MR. NAGER: You absolutely can. Section 4 F19 simply clarifies what's lawful. It doesn't tell us what's20 unlawful. We only can find what's unlawful by going to21 4(a) and reading it in light of the provisions in 4(a).22 QUESTION: So you say it's a safe harbor23 provision for sure if it's a reasonable factor other than24 age, it's okay?25 MR. NAGER: And it tells us more than that,32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Justice Scalia. It tells us that intent is what counts.2 Interestingly enough, our opponents in both their opening3 brief and their reply brief concede that the phrase based4 upon reasonable factors other than age is a reference to5 an intent requirement, and the whole notion, as Justice6 Breyer has pointed out through his questioning at the7 opening of this argument, is what distinguishes a8 disparate treatment case from an impact case is that9 intent is irrelevant, so if reasonable factors other than10 age --11 QUESTION: I don't really understand -- I must12 say, I don't entirely follow the argument. Supposing you13 have a test that you have to have an IQ above 110,14 something or other, in order to avoid discharge, and you15 find that that has a disparate impact on older workers for16 some reason, they lose their intelligence quota or17 something like that. Beyond the age.18 MR. NAGER: Bad news for us.19 QUESTION: Bad news for many of us. But there20 is statistics that show that. And you might come back and21 say I didn't realize that or something like that. It22 would be enough for you to show that, that that's totally23 irrelevant because you just didn't realize that fact. But24 why then would they need to say you have to defend that as25 a reasonable practice?33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. NAGER: The legislative history and the2 secretary's report makes quite clear why they put the3 reasonable in there, because they were concerned about the4 mixed motive cases. This statute, when it was originally5 discussed, the question came up, does this mean age has to6 be the only factor that's considered in order for it to be7 lawful solely? And the answer to that was the secretary8 came back and said no.9 We recognize that employers have been10 considering age for a long time. What we think the11 Congress should prohibit is the use of age as a screening12 device to filter. Now, it will still be the case because13 human beings are human beings that employers will still be14 cognizant of employees' age. They can't help but be.15 But so long as a reasonable factor other than16 age is the basis of the decision, there should be no17 liability for it.18 QUESTION: Yes, but why is that necessary to19 deal with mixed motive? Why can't you recognize mixed20 motive by recognizing unreasonable factors other than age?21 That's an equally mixed motive, if you would have an22 unreasonable factor.23 MR. NAGER: Well, every time that the mixed24 motive issue has been discussed, this Court in construing25 Title VII, in construing the National Labor Relations Act,34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 in construing the Constitution, the 1983 and Mt. Healthy2 cases, has always put a verb -- an adjective, motivating3 factor, substantial factor. Congress is speaking in4 common sense terms in writing these clarifying provisions5 to make it clear that age had to be the but-for cause of6 an employment action, and the employer had to intend it7 that we give you the illustration, our brief of Judge8 Wright's opinion for the D.C. circuit in Cuddy vs. Carmen,9 which talks about how the two provisions were intended to10 work in tandem just as Justice Kennedy's opinion for this11 Court in Betts said that 4(f)(2) and 4(a) were supposed to12 work in tandem to define the elements of a plaintiff's13 case.14 Could 4(a) have been written and construed15 without a clarifying provision? Of course. And we would16 be taking that position whether that additional language17 was there or not. But it doesn't weaken our argument in18 the slightest that Congress went further and clarified19 what the standards would be in a mixed motive case.20 QUESTION: Well, what, what does seem to weaken21 the argument is leaving even aside the mixed motive22 argument, you were, you are arguing that a reasonable23 factor test is proof that in fact it was a, an, a24 malicious motive-based liability in the first place. And25 it seems to me that what you are saying, if that is true,35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 then any motive other than the proscribed one is going to2 defeat liability.3 MR. NAGER: That's correct.4 QUESTION: And the odd thing is that you are5 saying that by specifying a reasonable factor defense,6 Congress was indicating that there would be an7 unreasonable factor defense because reasonable or8 unreasonable, if it's not age, there is no liability. And9 that it seems to me is an odd argument to say that by10 putting in the word reasonable they are, they are in11 effect confirming that an unreasonable defense would be12 equally good.13 MR. NAGER: I think the answer to that question14 is that reasonableness goes, is a permissible, the15 reasonableness of a nondiscriminatory factor that an16 employer offers is something that a judge can consider and17 if he finds a disputed issue of fact, a jury can consider18 in deciding whether or not the nondiscriminatory factor19 that is offered is a pretext for age discrimination.20 QUESTION: But if you really held that reason.21 In other words, the reasonableness of the, of the22 employer's alleged motive goes somehow to the credibility23 of the employer's argument that it was his motive, is that24 what you are getting at?25 MR. NAGER: Correct.36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: As an evidentiary point, I see it.2 As a logical point for defining the statute, it seems to3 me that it's clear.4 MR. NAGER: Well, I understand your point,5 Justice Souder, and I will be the first to acknowledge6 this case would be easier if the word reasonable weren't7 there. But all the Court has to decide in this case is8 whether or not the statute embraces a disparate impact9 test.10 QUESTION: Is there anywhere we can go, is11 there any way if you were finished, were you?12 MR. NAGER: Well, I just wanted to make the13 following point. Whether it's a reasonable motive or an14 unreasonable motive, it's still a motive and that's15 incompatible with disparate impact. The question is one16 of intent, not one of statistical correlations with age17 and not one of accuracy and verifiability of business18 judgment which are the two core issues in a disparate19 impact case.20 What distinguishes fundamentally a disparate21 treatment case from a disparate impact case is that in a22 treatment case while statistics are appropriate statistics23 that would satisfy Delbare are admissible, and can go to24 motive, the issue that we argue to the jury is motive. We25 don't argue about whether or not the correlation is so37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 substantial that it itself would state a prima facie2 violation and the jury is not allowed to question the3 employer's business judgment if it finds that in fact the4 employer was not motivated by age, and that makes a huge5 difference at a practical level and a legal level in the6 resolution of age discrimination cases, and that of course7 is why we would say that impact claims should not be8 recognized. I'm sorry.9 QUESTION: Is there any way, which I'm sure you10 don't want to bring up necessarily, but is there any way11 short of saying there is never a disparate impact claim?12 The problem that you mention could be alleviated. If I13 think, for example, that unlike race or gender, we might14 go into an ordinary company and find dozens or hundreds or15 maybe virtually every rule or practice or limitation16 connected with promotions is correlated with age.17 MR. NAGER: That's true.18 QUESTION: On the other hand, you might have19 some rules that are really correlated with age very20 heavily and have no justification. All right, so is there21 a way of dealing with that problem short of saying there22 is never a disparate impact case?23 MR. NAGER: Well, there is a way of dealing24 with it. I think Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court25 in Hazen Paper sets it out for us, but it doesn't require38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the recognition of a disparate impact claim. Justice2 O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Hazen Paper says that3 merely showing a correlation is not enough to create an4 inference of disparate treatment, but the court left open5 the question if the employer, the reason they used the6 factor, there was evidence that they thought that that7 factor should be used.89 saying you10 asking you11 disparate impact case, a real one, what I have been12 talking about throughout. Is there any way to deal with13 the problem of practicalities, which is a big one? That14 distinguishes this from race and gender.15 MR. NAGER: Well, I can only answer the16 question the following two ways. I don't think Congress17 contemplated which may be my legal answer for you.18 And I can answer it to you practically because19 I advise employers on these issues, and the way we deal20 with these issues now is not to change the practices21 unless we find they are really ridiculous. The way we22 advise our employers to deal with these practices now is23 to use quotas. When we advise employers if they are doing24 a reduction in force as to how to reduce the probability25 of a disparate impact claim and the circuits that have39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: That denies my hypothetical. That's are going to go over to intent. What I'mis if in fact the language here does justify a1 recognized them, we take out little five-year age bans and2 under 40 and over 40 and we assess who is included within3 it and who isn't included within it, and we tell them if4 you don't change the numbers, you face a greater exposure5 to a claim.6 Now, that is, I guess one way of discouraging7 employers from having thoughtless, even though not aged8 biased practice by the sword of a major lawsuit. Whether9 or not that's a legally common --10 QUESTION: But you don't have the power to do11 which this case I guess does ask us to do possibly, and12 that is also to look at the question of the defense here13 and say what does it mean in context? I mean, you could14 say, for example, reasonably necessary means necessary.15 Or you could say that reasonably necessary means a16 reasonable practice giving weight to the employer's17 reasonable judgment in this. There are a lot of things18 you could say. So I want your opinion on that.19 MR. NAGER: Well, my opinion is that the20 statute doesn't say reasonably necessary. That's what the21 BFOQ provision says.22 QUESTION: BFOQ. Based on reasonable factors.23 It's hard to get around that. Based on --24 MR. NAGER: Yes. It's, the entire phrase has25 to be read. It says based on it. What are the factors?40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 And that's a reference to motive. We know that from the2 ordinary English language, we know it from this Court's3 own cases talking about factors, and we know it from the4 legislative history because the secretary of labor in5 studying and reporting to Congress at Congress'6 legislative direction distinguished between purposeful7 uses of age as stereotypes of the abilities of older8 workers, and other forces that adversely impact older9 workers and what the secretary of labor recommended to10 deal with your problem that you pointed out, Justice11 Breyer, is not a coercive sanction that used, made neutral12 practices with disparate effects illegal. What the13 secretary of labor recommended to Congress and Congress14 adopted his recommendation in enacting the statute was the15 promotion of education, training and manpower programs16 both to get employers to better understand the talents and17 capabilities of older workers and where older workers18 were --19 QUESTION: Isn't the answer to Justice Breyer's20 concern about the employer who has an unreasonable￼21 criteria that in fact has a22 Isn't the answer that there23 jury is unlikely to believe24 MR.

NAGER: It's a much better answer than I7 gave. I thought --8 QUESTION: It's a very good answer. I wanted9 to know whether there was also any other answer.10 QUESTION: You gave that answer. May I just11 ask you this just to think through the problem a little12 bit. Assume I agree with you 100 percent that the13 reasonable factors other than age defense is a14 motive-based defense, why couldn't you have a good motive15 defense to a prima facie case that's based on objective16 factors?17 MR. NAGER: Well, I don't think it's a defense.18 I should state that. I think that the provision is not in19 there as an affirmative defense. I think the provision is20 in there to clarify what the scope of the prohibition is.21 QUESTION: Well, even as read in a defense, it's22 an exclusion category case, the motive. But whether it's23 a defense or an exclusion, the fact that it is24 motive-based doesn't seem to me necessarily to mean that25 the prima facie case must also be motive-based.42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 MR. NAGER: If we are talking about a disparate2 treatment case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that in3 an appropriate case with an appropriate statistical4 presentation, a judge would be justified in saying that5 the plaintiff has presented enough evidence to require the6 employer to respond to a disparate treatment allegation.7 Now, you know, it's hard to speak universally about8 statistical presentations. Most of them in my experience9 may satisfy Delbare, but don't tell us very much about the10 real merits of the case, but if we adopt as the premise11 that you have got a particularly powerful statistical12 presentation, I don't think there is any case law and13 certainly not from this Court because Teamsters and cases14 like that say that statistics are admissible to prove15 intent, that a plaintiff couldn't have statistics alone as16 their prima facie case, but it would be about intent, and17 the employer would be responding about its own intent. It18 wouldn't be responding about as the employer does in Title19 VII cases, about -- now, we not only had a good motive.20 Here's the proof that we were right about what we were21 trying to predict, because that is what the rebuttal22 burden in a Title VII dispute.23 QUESTION: May I ask you --24 QUESTION: I understand that. But it seems to25 me that it would be perfectly reasonable if you treat43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 disparate treatment as prima facie -- I mean a disparate2 impact as prima facie evidence of a wrongful intent. But3 I'm not sure that it would not also be an appropriate4 response even if disparate treatment was sufficient5 regardless of the actual intent. It makes good sense for6 Congress to put this defense in any way. I'm not sure you7 have --8 MR. NAGER: I'm not sure I understood the9 question.10 QUESTION: Assume your opponent is right. That11 disparate impact, which is totally innocent in terms of12 any malicious intent creates a prima facie case. Would it13 not nevertheless be sensible for Congress to say yes, all14 that is true, but if you have the right kind of good15 motive described in this paragraph, that shall16 nevertheless be a defense?17 MR. NAGER: Well, I think that would make good18 sense, but I think that Congress was advised by the19 secretary of labor that we are going to see correlations20 between age and neutral selection criteria all the time,21 and I don't think that Congress had in mind that22 foreseeable adverse impacts, not done because of but in23 spite of, should be a common basis for a prima facie case,24 whether it be called disparate treatment or disparate25 impact.44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: May I understand better than I have2 from your argument why you say it's the reasonable factor3 is not a defense? You are saying it's like the Equal Pay4 Act, which says any factor, any other factor other than5 sex. And that's always been regarded as a defense to an6 equal pay charge. You are charged with a violation of7 equal pay and you say no, it was based on any other factor8 other than sex.9 Why isn't it, since you are using the Equal Pay10 Act to say there is no impact theory under the Equal Pay11 Act, why isn't this equally a defense, rather than as you12 say, part of the definition?13 MR. NAGER: Well, perhaps our argument was not14 clear. We were not referring to the Equal Pay Act in the15 way that your question suggests. The only mention we made16 of the Equal Pay Act was where we made the point that the17 court in construing Title VII disparate impact doctrine18 has suggested in county of Washington vs. Gunther and in19 Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court in Manhart, the20 disparate impact claims would not be cognizable in the21 areas of pay disparities correlated with gender because22 the Bennett amendment incorporated the effect of the Equal23 Pay Act defenses into Title VII. It's our opponents who24 have made arguments based upon Gunther that there is25 something different about this.45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: I thought you were both making2 arguments? I thought, maybe I'm wrong about this, that3 your opponent was saying that this F provision is just4 like business necessity under Title VII and you said I5 thought, no, it's as in the Equal Pay Act when, where6 there is no impact test under the Equal Pay Act. I7 thought that was your argument. Maybe I misread you. But8 I think --9 MR. NAGER: No. That was not our argument,10 Justice Ginsburg. Our argument was that the reason, one11 of the reasons why this Court can and should rule that the12 Age Discrimination Act doesn't recognize disparate impact13 claims and be completely consistent and respectful of14 Griggs is that the court in Title VII cases has recognized15 that other provisions of the statute may cause Griggs to16 yield to other congressional manifestations of intent17 requirements in specific areas.18 QUESTION: Well then, let's just take the two19 statutes. One says reasonable factor, and the other says20 any factor, any other factor other than sex. Same kind of21 provision. Why in one case is it a defense and the other22 case, part of the definition of the --23 MR. NAGER: Well, I think the answer to that is24 that the court construed the four so-called affirmative25 defenses as affirmative defenses under the Equal Pay Act.46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 This Court in Betts recognized that when Congress wrote2 4(f), they didn't intend for all of the provisions in 4(f)3 to be affirmative defenses. Some of them were affirmative4 defenses. This Court in Criswell held that the BFOQ was5 an affirmative defense. 4(f)(2) was held not to be an6 affirmative defense but was held to be an exemption that7 redefined the elements of a prima facie case and our8 suggestion to the Court is since the reasonable factor9 other than age provision is not a provision in which the10 employer is trying to justify the use of age, employer is11 saying our decision should be held lawful because it's12 based upon factors other than age that it's not13 appropriate to characterize that as an affirmative14 defense, but rather --15 QUESTION: I don't follow why it isn't, you16 couldn't make the very same argument about the Equal Pay17 Act.18 MR. NAGER: Well, I suppose if I had been19 before the court in 1974 arguing that case, I might have20 made that argument.21 QUESTION: Well, that's another one we are22 stuck with it because it's stare decisis, isn't it?23 MR. NAGER: Well, no. We just recognize that24 we have a different statute and we also have a different25 court. I mean, the fact that --47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

CRABTREE4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS5 MR. CRABTREE: Thank you, Your Honor. Justice6 Scalia, you asked earlier why we should not construe the￼7 good cause8 reasonable9provision as just something similar to the factors provision.The difference is the absence of the words10 otherwise prohibited. The same words that did not exist11 in (f)2 when Betts was decided. Without the words12 "otherwise prohibited" there would be a good argument that13 the reasonable factors defense was not a defense. But14 because of15 that there1617 another discrimination case in trying to import the18 attorneys fee provision, prevailing party fee provision in19 that case did not make sense as it does here because the20 ADEA in Title VII share a common purpose and the common21 legislative history and the common language.22 In Gunther, the court did not hold that there23 was not disparate impact for a wage disparities under24 Title VII. What the court held was that the defense was25 any other factor and that that applied or suggested that48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005those two critical words, it is inescapable has already been a violation of the act. Second, Fogerty was a copyright case, not1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it might apply in a facially neutral practice. But the court also said in Gunther that the, that the Defendant, in proving its defense, must establish that factors were legitimate and bonafide. Here, of course, we have the additional word reasonable so mere legitimacy, or merely being bonafide cannot be enough.While the, as counsel conceded in mixed motive cases, the court's analysis is whether or not but-for, the but-for analysis must be connected and whether or not the employer's motives caused the employer's action is at issue. And again, going back to the words otherwise prohibited, we don't have that under the reasonable factors defense for the ADEA. I have no more to offer.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Crabtree. MR. CRABTREE: Thank you very much. CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case issubmitted.(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
