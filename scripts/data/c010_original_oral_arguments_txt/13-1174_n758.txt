Bank of America.      Mr. Goldstein.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEINON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may itplease the Court:      My clients filed this lawsuit againstMr. Waxman's clients.  The district court dismissed thatlawsuit and said that it was terminated.      Now, from the earliest days of this Court's­­ excuse me, this nation's jurisdictional statutes,that would be an appealable order under the aptly namedFinal Judgment Rule, and that must be so unlesssomething changed with Congress's enactment of Section1407(a) of the multidistrict litigation statute.  And weask you to hold that nothing changed, and it wasappealable for three reasons.      The first is the judgment was entered inthis action.  It was dismissed.  We had our owncomplaint, our own docket, our own lawyers, our ownplaintiffs, and our own defendants.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial4￼1 The second is that there is no judgment in2 the MDL itself, so there is nothing from which we could3 appeal at the end of the MDL litigation, so it must be4 that we appeal from this.5 And the third is that Rule 54(b) of the6 Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply because that7 applies to the dismissal of part of an action, some of8 the claims or some of the parties, not the whole action.9 And here, the whole action was dismissed.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me,11 first, what difference there is, if any, pursuant to12 your reasons, that would not apply to a consolidated13 case for all purposes, number one? And, number two,14 isn't a case consolidated with others, for purposes of15 pretrial proceedings, a pending action that involves16 multiple parties?17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: As to the first, there are18 different forms of consolidation. Both sides agree with19 that. They make this point, the Respondents do, on20 page 33 of their brief. There are forms of21 consolidation that produce a single action. That can22 happen under Rule 20 with joinder. It can happen under23 Rule 42(a)(1) if the parties consent with consolidation.24 The cases can become so intertwined that there is25 effectively one case, one complaint, and one action.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial      MR. GOLDSTEIN:the time.  That's correct.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MDLs ­­      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:retain their individual character, even though they'reconsolidated for all purposes.  There may be a casethat's taken as a test case among the many, et cetera.      Your rule basically is saying consolidationnow will permit piecemeal appeals in almost everycircumstance, except for a very limited number.MR. GOLDSTEIN: One preliminary point and then the question about what our rule produces.      In MDL litigation, as this district courtrecognized, you actually don't have consolidation forall purposes.  Section 1407(a) specifies is that therecan be consolidation for pretrial purposes only.  Thepretrial purposes in this case are over.  The complaintwas dismissed.      Now, as to the policy arguments of theRespondents, that there is a grave concern that our rulewould produce interlocutory appeals that go up to theAlderson Reporting CompanyThat doesn't happen most of    In ­­ in most of theYes.    ­­ most of the cases5￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's, frankly, not the majority of the cases. In ­­Official6￼1 court of appeals, lots of different times, there is a2 straightforward answer to that point, and that is that3 district courts, just as they have the discretion to4 enter a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b), have5 the same discretion to avoid entering a final judgment6 in individual actions under Rule 58(b).7 And this is very common in MDL litigation,8 just as you indicate, Justice Sotomayor. Very9 frequently district courts will enter consolidated10 complaints and will not enter orders in the individual11 actions that would be appealable.12 The distinct feature of this case, the13 critical distinct feature here is that this district14 court decided to dismiss in its entirety our individual15 actions. She didn't have to do that, but she did it16 consciously ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does the18 150­day provision kick in? I mean, you said don't worry19 about this. District courts can just put it on the back20 burner for three years, however long. Doesn't the21 150­day provision kick in if, in fact, the district22 court has dismissed all of the claims?23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two things, Mr. Chief24 Justice. First, we think it does not. So here we're25 talking about Rule 58(b) and Rule 58(c). And IAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:ourselves.(Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN: The MDLwell could ­­ the MDL litigation inlitigation, there the district court used the tool that we're discussing right now. It said, I'm going to resolve some of the claims, but I'm not going to enter an appealable judgment.      We do think that's the better reading.JUSTICE BREYER: How do you do that? Because not ­­ not all of us can look it up themselves.Alderson Reporting CompanyYes.  But you ­­   So they ­­ automaticOh, we could do itlitigation ­­ as youthe Chocolate7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425apologize, those ­­      JUSTICE GINSBURG:unless otherwise provided?      MR.

But there, the Chief Justice is pointing out that it's not entirely clear what 58(c) means and how long the district court's discretion lasts under Rule 58(b). I will give you an example, and if the Court wanted the ­­ the library or the clerks to look up the 1935 MDL in the ­­Doesn't Rule 58 say      JUSTICE BREYER:just asked you. Why not just answer what IOkay.

And then they have about seven different ways in which it will produce a mess in various cases. And so, obviously, I do pay attention when the district judges do say that.      And so I'm not a district judge, but I don'twant to produce a mess for them.  The MDL is trying todo the opposite.  So what's the answer to what they say?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. What they say,Mr. Justice Breyer, is actually not that our ­­ our result will produce a mess. It is ­­ they quite clearly say, we're not asking you to ­­ we're not saying what the correct interpretation of the statute or rules are. They have a grave concern that you identify, which is we don't want automatic interlocutory appeals from MDLs.Alderson Reporting Company9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Our answer is that our rule does not produceautomatic interlocutory appeals because district judgesare perfectly free, through a number of tools, only oneof which we've been discussing, not to enter.JUSTICE BREYER: Has ­­ has that happened to a lot of district judge? Your rule is the district judge, despite Rule 58(b), et cetera, says, I deny all relief in your case, Mr. Smith, everyone out, good­bye.      Then you say to the clerk, Clerk, don'tenter the piece of paper called the judgment because Idon't want them to take an appeal.      And then they ask for mandamus on the groundthat must be an abusive discretion.  What happens?  Orhas it happened a lot?      MR. GOLDSTEIN:this happened.      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR.

GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE BREYER:one else is ­­      MR. GOLDSTEIN:correct.  Frequently district judges will want thesequestions to go up on appeal because they will getguidance.JUSTICE BREYER: 54.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Now, they can do it under 54 or they can enter a final judgment in the case. So there is the 1935 MDL using Rule 58(b), but there are many other tools the district judges have.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, as ­­ as your view of the case is 54(b) would not be appropriate ­­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ when the ­­ when the judge says, I dismiss this claim entirely. This complaint is out. It's a final judgment. It's not appropriate for Rule 54 because Rule 54(b) is when one claim is done, but other claims are still pending.MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. Justice Breyer's suggestion of Rule 54(b) would not work if the district judge has dismissed the entire action.      It does say by its terms that it appliesOfficialAlderson Reporting CompanyNo. And then in the future, noJustice Breyer, that is not11￼Official121 only to the dismissal of some of the parties or some of2 the claims in the action. The action throughout the3 rule of civil proceed ­­ Rules of Civil Procedure refers4 only to one thing, that is, the individual piece of5 litigation. We have our own complaint, our own docket,6 our own plaintiffs, defendants, and lawyers.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But ­­ but your ­­ your8 answer is that, oh, well, the district judge can find9 plenty of ways, disingenuously perhaps, to say this10 isn't going to be entered yet, we're just going to wait.11 And so Chief Justice says you have the 150­day problem.12 It ­­ it seems to me that if you're asking for these13 sort of furtive measures, we might as well face up to14 the problem right away and just adopt Mr. Waxman's15 position.16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Kennedy, we17 don't think it's ­­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me you're19 asking the judge to be almost disingenuous.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, we disagree for the21 following reason, and that is, if the point of22 Mr. Waxman's side is that district judges need23 discretion to decide when to enter judgments, whether24 they're 54(b), partial final judgments, or final25 judgments under Rule 58, the discretion should be the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE KAGAN:point.      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE KAGAN:rules right, whether it's Rule 54 or something else.But are you saying that there is no practical differencebetween the two?MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm saying there's little practical difference. There is some, and that is that their side requires the district court and the court of appeals to have litigation on whether Rule 54(b) certification is appropriate, and whether the district court abused its discretion in entering a Rule 54(b) judgment. But there isn't much beyond that.JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one huge difference. The district judge can say no to 54(b) ifAlderson Reporting CompanyYes.And that's an importantYes.It's important to get the13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425same.      And the tools that I'm talking about are notused disingenuously by your district judges.  They areused consistently, and that is ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Are you then saying that there's no practical difference between your position and Mr. Waxman's position? In other words, you're saying Rule 54 is not the right vehicle.Official14￼1 it's a final judgment. In this ­­ in this very case,2 that's exactly what the judge said. In the first round,3 he said, you have an appeal of right, and ­­ she said to4 the plaintiff who was dismissed.5 And then when the Second Circuit said no,6 she refused to give a 54(b).7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The reason it's not a huge8 difference, Justice Ginsburg, is that the district court9 doesn't have to enter a final judgment.10 I'll give you a very specific example. The11 district court in this case entered a ruling in three12 different cases, the OTC plaintiff's case, the exchange13 plaintiff's case, and the ­­ our clients, the bondholder14 case. And if the district court had instead entered her15 opinion in the OTC or exchange complaints in the16 complaint that had just an antitrust claim, for example,17 that did not have just an antitrust claim, then there18 would not be an appealable final judgment.19 The district court quite consciously20 resolved all the antitrust issues, knowing that they21 would go up on appeal. She just changed her mind only22 after the Second Circuit, in a rule that the Respondents23 do not defend, decided that it did not want to hear the24 appeal as a matter of its discretion.25 It is quite important, I think, that ­­Alderson Reporting Company18 rule is that sometimes you can19 this, and they will deem it to20 judgment.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG:have an ­­ an appeal likebe an appealable finalOfficialThey said they ­­ they ­­ 22 there was a ­­ there's a phrase that the Second Circuit23 uses, and it ­­ something to the effect of an24 extraordinary case, an exceptional case.25 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's correct. Right.Alderson Reporting CompanyI don't think this court15￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 of appeals said as a matter of its discretion, and that3 was one thing that puzzled me about your presentation.4 The court of appeals said we have no jurisdiction.5 That's quite different from saying we have discretion.6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Ah. But, Justice Ginsburg,7 their rule is a case­by­case determination if they do8 have jurisdiction. And they said, in our ­­ they did it9 sua sponte. The defendants did not move actually to10 dismiss our appeal. The court of appeals, applying this11 case­by­case rule that's very hard to predict, which is12 why the Respondents don't defend it, said, we think ­­13 they didn't explain much about what they ­­ the reason14 that they dismissed it.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said we had no16 jurisdiction.17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right, they did. But their1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: But their main rule is there's no jurisdiction.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. And the great majority of circuits apply the opposite rule. They recognize that there's no reason to depart from the ordinary, long­settled understanding of what a final judgment is. It is called the final judgment rule. We happen ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to Justice Kennedy's question about the disingenuous nature of this?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we write an opinion and say, no, it's a final judgment. It could be appealed.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But district courts, you have other tools not to enter the judgment?MR. GOLDSTEIN:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. GOLDSTEIN:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Yes.    You can delay it?I ­­    That ­­ that does soundOfficiallike all we're saying that this is a very formalisticruling.

He'ssaying, and you're saying, we shouldn't let them.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, no ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If he can say it for as long as he thinks is appropriate ­­      MR.

This is something that Judge Rakoff does withsome regularity in complex litigation.  What he will sayis my inclination is I'm going to ultimately say thatthe antitrust claims cannot go forward and what I'mgoing to do, therefore, is stay the antitrust claimsand, therefore, you do not participate in discovery, forexample.      But we do think it is important to recognizethat there is a real reason for the appeals to goforward and that is, that it avoids duplicativediscovery when we have to come back after appeal andOfficial20￼1 difference between the parties?2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In terms of the effect3 on you. You're not going to participate in discovery4 under his system.5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's ­­ that is correct.6 And so my point to the Court is the following: And,7 that is, to the extent that members of the Court are8 concerned, that the district courts are concerned, the9 district judges that you cite, Justice Breyer, that we10 shouldn't have these interlocutory appeals, then the11 district courts have the tools to deal with that ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but what they tell13 us, these judges, who are experienced, I stress, on14 pages 12 and 13, "District courts have evaluated the15 Third Circuit factors," that is 54(b) factors, "in16 deciding whether to certify one among several17 consolidated cases for appeal." Footnote, and then in18 the footnote they have several cases which I take it,19 since they tell us that, are cases where they were20 consolidated cases, they used 54(b) to say that one of21 the cases could go ahead on appeal.22 Now, I took that as saying that judges are23 using 54(b) to accomplish the end that we seem24 apparently everyone wants, giving them the flexibility,25 and not the system that you propose.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not correct, Justice Breyer. And here's ­­JUSTICE BREYER: So are they wrong or I'm not reading it right? Probably the latter.MR. GOLDSTEIN: They ­­ there is some ­­ a piece of the puzzle that's missing, and that is that ours is the rule that for decades has been applied in the great majority of the country. There are ­­JUSTICE BREYER: In 54 – in fifty ­­ in the majority of the country judges have said, when we have four cases in front of us, we have consolidated and we wish to dismiss one but keep the others going, they have said, we cannot use 54(b). They have to have an appeal.MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Breyer. Whatit ­­ here's the situation. In MDL litigation, which is consolidated ­­JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about MDL. I'm just talking about consolidated cases.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, if it's consolidated for all purposes, that's quite different. You get ­­JUSTICE BREYER:MR. GOLDSTEIN:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.­­ a single action. Okay.  Then talk about MDL.Okay.  MDL litigation, theOfficialrule is, as described in the cert papers, overwhelminglyAlderson Reporting Company21￼Official22￼1 in our favor, and that is the district courts enter2 judgments when they are prepared for the issue to go up3 on appeal. The rule is, in the great majority of4 circuits, that if you do enter a judgment in an5 individual action in MDL litigation, you appeal. And so6 district courts are perfectly aware of it.7 We call it formal as if it were a bad thing8 that we have a final judgment rule, but it is not a bad9 thing. It is really important to have clarity.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if I could understand,11 Mr. Goldstein, what you're saying. Do you think that a12 judge properly considers the exact same factors whether13 it's done as the Respondents would like under Rule 54,14 or instead, whether it's done your way by staying the15 action or by holding off on a final order?16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer to that question17 is I am agnostic on it. My point is that to the extent18 that you all ­­ that the Court agrees with Mr. Waxman's19 point, the district courts need that discretion, then20 our solution is simply to give them that discretion with21 respect to the entry of the final judgment. It is not22 an argument against our position.23 The argument for our position that I have24 not gotten to, and I do want to make sure we don't miss25 it, is that I am required under Rule 4 of the FederalAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial23￼1 Rules of Appellate Procedure and Section 2107 of the2 statutes, to appeal within 30 days of the order or3 judgment that is affecting me. At the end of the MDL,4 there is no such order or judgment. The only thing that5 I can appeal from is the dismissal of my action. I do6 not know, at the end of the MDL, what it is that I'm7 actually appealing from. They have ­­ the other problem8 that they have is that Rule 54(b) doesn't apply here9 because the entire act ­­ you're going to have to change10 the meaning of what an action is throughout the ­­ all11 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which is uniformly the12 single piece of litigation, the single complaint, and13 there is no reason to create confusion.14 Imagine after the ruling that Mr. Waxman15 wants, there are four cases in the district court, and16 they relate to the same sort of facts, and the district17 court dismisses one. If you introduce this ambiguity18 about what an action is, then people are going to be19 unclear about when it is that they should be appealing.20 Because our lawsuit is a separate one; it is in a21 separate docket, we have a separate complaint.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't ­­ doesn't it23 become clear once we announce it? It's not like anybody24 involved in the MDL doesn't carefully know what's going25 on. That's the advantage of those cases.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial24￼1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It does not.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there is an order.3 There's an order terminating the MDL ­­4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ and sending the cases6 that are going to be sent back, back, and the ones who are7 finalized, those are finalized.8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Here's what happens. And I9 suggest that the Court look at the docket, for example,10 in the Fontainebleau MDL, which is I think number 2106.11 So what happens here is that at the end of the12 proceedings, imagine the district court dismisses13 complaint A, that will be my complaint, and then later14 on complaints B and C settle. So they are done. They15 are voluntarily dismissed.16 So there is no final judgment there. It17 could be years later. What the district court will do18 is it will send a recommendation to the JPML saying I19 think that this case is over. The JPML, which is not20 even in that circuit, will enter an order saying, we21 agree. It is possible that the district court will just22 enter a notation in the main MDL docket saying the MDL23 is closed. But that is not an order or judgment from24 which we are appealing. It is not an order or judgment25 that affects us. It's not a judgment at all. It's justAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial25￼1 an administrative notation.2 This is a place where turning square corners3 matters, where you should apply the actual status and4 rules. We don't need a new regime about what an action5 is, what a judgment is, what a final judgment is. In6 order to in ­­ accommodate the important policy concerns7 that Mr. Waxman may be raising, we don't have to change8 the meaning of Rule 54(b). I have a lawsuit. It has a9 judgment. The district court judge decided to dismiss10 it. I'm supposed to appeal.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If ­­ if there's an MDL12 for pretrial purposes and the district court thinks that13 one ­­ that some cases like yours just should not14 proceed, does the district judge have authority on its15 own to dismiss those few cases from the MDL? Does he16 have that authority or does he have to go back to the17 MDL panel to do that?18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The district judge cannot ­­19 the district judge can dismiss cases in the MDL and20 frequently does. Now, administratively, if the district21 judge thinks that they just don't belong in the MDL ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's my question.23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They will send a24 recommendation to the JPML. Now, this is, I think, an25 important point. And if I could just take you toAlderson Reporting Company 3 4 5 6   the MDL.  And so what I recommend to you is the ­­ if we 7   go about halfway down, there is a sentence after the 8   word "actions" that begins "Each action."  It's the line 9   that and begins "Actions."  "Each action so transferred10   shall be remanded by the panel" ­­ so it's a separate11   action,  ­­ "at or before the conclusion" ­­ so "at or12   before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to13   the district from which it was transferred" ­­ so that's14   when it begins or after it's done ­­ "unless it shall15   have been previously terminated:  Provided, however," ­­16   and this is the sentence that deals with during the MDL,17   that pan ­­ "that the panel may separate any claim,18   cross­claim, counter­claim, or third­party claim and19   remand any of such claims before the remainder of the20   action is remanded."21 The MDL statute provides for consolidated22   proceedings, that is, the district judge is going to23   bring the cases together, administer discovery together,24   enter orders.  Sometimes they'll apply to individual25   actions; sometimes it will apply to all of the actions.page 2; the block quote is the MDL statute.      And the MDL statute makes quite clear thatthe actions inside the MDL are separate actions duringOfficial26 1 Section – forty –­ fifty ­­ the 1407, again, this is a case about a2   statute.  And this is going to be in the blue brief at￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial27￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425But the relevant point is that they are separateactions.  They are actions that get initiated and at theend they get dismissed and it's called the finaljudgment rule, because it's a rule.  It's not called thesemi­final constituent matter principle.  When our casegets dismissed, it's over and we are supposed to appeal.      If there are no further questions, I'llreserve the remainder of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMANON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Let me start with what's now been theaccepted terminology of the disingenuous approach toachieving the flexibility of the district court's needand to avoid the obligation that the courts of appealsmust ­­ because his rule requires immediate seriatimpiecemeal appeals ­­ hear those.  I have been calling itthe ­­ a form of guerilla judging, but the point is thatthe flexibility that both sides agree and the retireddistrict judges certainly underscore that districtcourts need and the relief that the courts of appealsneed from the obligation to hear seriatim piecemealAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial28 1 appeals, is achieved by application of the rule that was￼2 specifically designed for this, which is Rule 54(b).3 Now, he says 54(b) doesn't apply. What that4 means is ­­ let me just first start by saying, in this5 entire litigation, one and only one authority has been6 cited for that proposition.7 JUSTICE ALITO:8 MR. WAXMAN:9 JUSTICE ALITO:   Well, but that ­­And that is Petitioner's brief.The text of 54(b) refers to 10 a separate appeal for a claim, counterclaim,11 cross­claim, or third­party claim. So your 54(b)12 argument, I think, is dependent on the proposition that13 Mr. Goldstein's complaint became part of a single14 action. Otherwise, so ­­ it was consolidate ­­ it be ­­15 became part of a single action and, therefore, it was ­­16 it was tantamount to a claim.17 MR. WAXMAN: Yes.18 JUSTICE ALITO: On that theory it could fit19 within 54(b). That takes a little bit of ­­ more than20 perhaps a little bit of pounding to fit that in there,21 don't 2223 every24 54(b)25you think?MR. WAXMAN: No, I don't. And neither doessingle court that has construed the application ofto consolidated litigation.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how did ­­ where do weAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial29￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425look to find that ­­ that his complaint became part of asingle action?MR. WAXMAN: Well, the ­­JUSTICE ALITO: The MDL statute doesn't ­­ doesn't make any reference to that. Quite to the contrary.MR. WAXMAN: Yes. The MDL statute doesn't consolidate cases.

WAXMAN: And my ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see a single reference in the rule, nothing by the advisory committee that so much as suggests that a consolidation for pretrial purposes only makes it one action for purposes of 54(b).MR. WAXMAN: Let me ­­ before I get tothe ­­ to the terminology, let me just underscore ­­ I realize this may be waving a red flag in front of this body, but there ­­ not a single court or commentator anywhere has suggested that in consolidated cases, whether they are ­­ that ­­ that are all consolidated under Rule 42 whether they come in by an MDL or not,Alderson Reporting Company8 JUSTICE KAGAN:Well, you know, maybeOfficial9 they're wrong.10 MR. WAXMAN:11 everyone is wrong.12 JUSTICE KAGAN:13 Mr. Waxman, because I mean, they're ­­ they're obviously14 looking for a certain kind of flexibility, which is15 important, and which I take it both sides have agreed is16 important. But the question is whether they found it in17 the right section. And I think what you're being asked18 is, if you just look at this section, this section is19 about multiparty, multiclaim single actions; that's what20 this section is all about. And it's being used for a21 purpose for which it was never designed.22 MR. WAXMAN: I think that is quite incorrect23 as an historical matter. Rule 54(b) was the product of24 the Court's experience arising out of these multiple25 mass actions, particularly exemplified in the ElectricNow, it's possible that   Yes, maybe they are wrong,Alderson Reporting Company30￼1 that ­­ that action refers to the consolidated2 proceedings for such a length as they are consolidated.3 And, you know, Judge Ginsburg's ­­ the other Ginsburg on4 the D.C. Circuit's opinion in ­­ I think it's Hill v.5 Henderson, explains that it is a commonplace in6 consolidated actions for courts that want a piecemeal7 appeal to employ Rule 54(b).JUSTICE KENNEDY:JUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. WAXMAN:JUSTICE KENNEDY:But in this ­­ Not any ­­Official311 Equipment Antitrust Litigation, and that's all over the2 legislative history of Rule 54(b) where 54(b) and 14073 don't ­­ didn't exist at the time, and were enacted in4 the wake of that.5 And the ­­ what the legislative history6 shows is that these four, 50 ­­ I guess 54(b) was in7 existence but not 1407. 54(b) was the mechanism in8 those consolidated actions by which particular issues of9 law were reviewed by the courts of appeals ­­￼10 11 12 1314 case,15 unconsolidated. When ­­ when the pretrial M ­­ MDL16 is ­­ is completed here, the separate judgments will be17 remanded to the separate courts. So you're ­­ what18 you're saying is, well, it's one action for a while, but19 then it's many actions again. Begins as many, then it's20 one for a while, then it's going to be many again.21 Isn't that ­­ isn't that the dynamic that you're ­­22 MR. WAXMAN: That ­­ that is exactly the23 dynamic for whatever length of time the consolidation24 occurs.25 JUSTICE BREYER: But his last point, this in­­ were not.     But in this ­­ in thisat the end of the day, the actions are, in effect,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial32￼1 my mind is that if we take your route ­­ one problem2 with his route ­­ one problem with your route is you3 have to muck around with the word "action." Well, you4 do. I mean, there's no doubt you do. You have to5 consider it a single action while it's consolidated.6 One problem with his route is that, A,7 nobody's ever done it, they've all thought you're right,8 and nobody's said much about it. And one problem with9 his route is you treat consolidations where the10 multidistrict panel is involved and you consolidate it11 for discovery differently than you treat consolidations12 in an ordinary district court, has four cases and13 consolidates them. That's the problem with his route.14 So it seems to me a sort of balance there.15 But one thing he said that I don't ­­ that did register16 is he said if we take your route, what happens when the17 multidistrict is over, see. Eight months ago, his case18 was dismissed, and a judgment was entered in his ­­ in19 his case, which is now only part of the case, on your20 theory.21 When is he supposed ­­ what is he appealing22 from? When did the 30­day clock begin to run? And23 suppose, by the way, it was never sent ­­ it was never24 really sent back because everybody else settled.

WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, I totally19 agree. And if there were any ambiguity, this Court's20 unanimous decision in Lexecon made that clear.21 The point is that it is up to the transferee22 judge, as it is up to any judge in a civil case, using23 the tools provided under rule 42 to decide how to manage24 all of the cases that have been transferred. The judge25 may decide to let them proceed ­­ only a couple of them, letAlderson Reporting CompanyAnd I think it was quite33￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me just make ­­ I2 have your question firmly in mind. I want to just3 observe two things about the premises to your question.4 One is that 3 percent of cases that are consolidated5 under the ­­ of MDL cases get returned to districts for6 trial. The overwhelming majority never leave the7 transferee courts.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's because the9 parties, either they get dismissed pretrial, or they10 settle, or the parties agree that the transferee courtOfficial34￼1 me them all proceed on their own. The judge may2 consolidate them, which is a formal act that has a known3 meaning and has real world consequences not just with4 respect to finality but with respect to the compromise5 of the individual litigant's rights during the period in6 which consolidation occurs.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But these statutes do not8 speak of consolidation of cases, they speak of9 consolidated proceedings. Where ­­ where do you get the10 notion that the cases have been consolidated? And if11 that notion were true, surely the consolidation must12 terminate when one of the cases is dismissed, how can it13 still be consolidated when it's dismissed and the other,14 and the other cases are proceeding.15 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not quibbling at all,16 Justice Scalia, with the language. I'm perfectly happy17 to say that the proceedings are consolidated. The point18 here um is ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes a big difference.20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the ­­ I don't ­­ I think21 it doesn't really make a big difference. The point here22 is, as this Court has repeatedly admonished, what23 constitutes a final decision under section 1291 is not a24 technical concept but, rather, quote, “the means to25 achieving a healthy legal system and that does not” ­­Alderson Reporting Company      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:from?

WAXMAN: Let's be very, very clear about what he says he's appealing from. The only document that he has pointed to that suggests that he had a judgment way back in March of 2013 is entry 43 in the Gelboim docket, which is reproduced on Page 11A of the joint appendix.JUSTICE GINSBURG: He has the word of the district judge you have an appeal of right, that's what she said.MR.

WAXMAN: The ­­ the ­­ the appeal period runs from the time that all of the ­­ that there is ­­ that all of the other consolidated proceedings, cases, have resolved or been transferred, and so ­­Official36￼1 certification, this is on Page 220 of the petition2 appendix is that these plaintiffs and the Schwab3 plaintiffs have an appeal of right, there is no question4 that she misapprehended the rule in the Second Circuit5 that just because she had dismissed all of the claims in6 their suit they have an appeal of right. But the notion7 that she entered a judgment ­­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She thought that she9 needed to the to do the 54(b) for the other cases that10 had more than one claim, not just the antitrust claim.11 MR. WAXMAN: Correct, and let me say12 something about their subsequent motion under ­­ the13 Gelboim subsequent motion under 54(b) after the14 dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by the court of15 appeals, but first point out to you that the order that16 she's referring to, 43, which says that the case is17 terminated pursuant to instructions from chambers, you18 know, I wondered, well, why isn't there anything in the19 docket that in fact terminates it, and the answer is on20 page ­­ pages 15 through 19 of the joint appendix where,21 as you can see on Page 19, she has reissued the same22 memorandum and order as modified, three days later.23 And the language that they like to cite for24 the notion that there was a judgment in their case is25 missing. And that's why they, in fact, continue to be aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial37￼1 party to the consolidated ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you're just ­­3 let's go back to my question. I agree with you, I'd4 always learned like Hornbook rule number 1 is, there is5 a separate piece of paper called a judgment entered by6 the district court, and that is what you appeal from.7 Now you have just told me, there isn't one here, in8 which case he can't appeal, okay, that's a separate9 reason. I'm now assuming another case. The case is,10 there is a separate piece of paper in his case called a11 judgment. His point is, that gives me a piece of paper12 called a judgment to appeal from, it was entered at a13 certain time and now I know when the clock starts.14 MR. WAXMAN: That's right, yes.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what I said was,16 some time ago, that I thought he had a point, is in such17 a case, if we treat the consolidation of18 proceedings like we treat a consolidation of cases19 without the multidistrict, he cannot appeal from that20 piece of paper. He has to wait in the ordinary21 situation, not multidistrict, until there is another22 piece of paper resolving everything, then he starts to23 appeal but at least he has a piece of paper which maybe24 he lacked here. All right, now, he's saying here in the25 multidistrict situation, there will be a separate pieceAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial38￼1 of paper, I can't appeal from, what is the piece of2 paper from which I know the clock on appeal begins to3 run?4 MR. WAXMAN: The same piece of paper that he5 lacks even to this day.6 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a red herring at the7 moment.8 MR. WAXMAN: Well okay but, et me at least finish my9 sentence.10 At the end, when the district judge11 certifies that the consolidation period is over, whether12 that's, you know, at the end of discovery or at the end13 of pretrial proceedings or in a case under rule 42 at14 the end of the trial of the case, or a case, the parties15 will seek to the extent the court has not entered it,16 under rule 58 a separate piece of paper that says either17 judgment or that's the functional equivalent of judgment18 under rule, under rule 54(A), which says a judgment is19 an appealable order.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, have you made21 this argument before, did you make this argument in22 opposition to the petition for certiorari, namely that23 there was no final judgment here.24 MR. WAXMAN: We did, and it got discouraged25 when the Court granted cert. But I mean, I'm not hereAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial391 just making a jurisdictional argument, my point in this2 case is ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, the Second4 Circuit didn't think that there was a problem because5 the ­­ a judgment hadn't been entered. They said in all6 of these cases when a consolidated or pretrial, there is7 no right of appeal, you have to get permission under8 rule 54(b). They did not say anything about the problem9 in this case is that there was no judgment document.10 And isn't there, I know that there ­­ there is a11 provision that says, if the judgment ­­ if for some12 reason you don't have the piece of paper, that's not13 fatal.14 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, I15 respectfully suggest that you're mistaken in reading16 what the Second Circuit said. This is on Page 2A of the17 petitioner appendix and what it says is, this court has18 determined sua sponte that it lacks jurisdiction over19 these appeals because a final order has not been issued20 by the district court as contemplated by section 1291,21 comma, and the orders of ­­ the orders appealed from did22 not dispose of all the claims in the consolidated23 action. The court ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you telling me that25 the Second Circuit doesn't have that rule if there is a￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialor, assuming the court of appeals agrees, whenis a recommendation under section 1292(b).  ThatJUSTICE SCALIA: But aren't ­­MR.

WAXMAN: The piece of ­­ the Second3 Circuit's rule, which is the rule we think that ought to4 be applied throughout the country is that the ­­ when5 there is ­­ when all of the claims of a party or, in6 a ­­ in any multi claim, multidistrict proceeding,7 whether it's a single consolidated complaint or8 consolidated proceedings, judgment is entered by9 district courts when a rule 54(b)(1) certification is10 made,11 there12 is ­­ 131415 judgments during the period of consolidation when the16 other cases are proceeding.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG:18 applicable here.19 MR. WAXMAN:20 JUSTICE GINSBURG:21 have a final judgment. It's an interlocutory appeal,22 the typical case for 1292(b) is the court decides23 liability, but it hasn't decided damages yet. You can't24 run upstairs at that point unless you get a 1292(b)25 order.Official411 MR. WAXMAN: You are absolutely right, and I2 stand corrected. My point is that during the period,3 when there are multi claim, multiparty proceedings,4 either because they are different cases that are5 consolidated for a period of consolidation or a single6 omnibus complaint which could have happened in this7 case, a ruling as to all the claims of a particular8 party or all of the parties as to a particular claim9 becomes a judgment when and only when the district court10 certifies a judgment under 54(b).11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's quite12 different. You were defending the proposition, I13 thought, that the Second Circuit said that there had14 been no final judgment in this case. Not in the15 consolidated cases but no final judgment in this case.16 And I don't read that ­­ that order on ­­ on Page 2A as17 saying anything other than that there's not been a final18 order under ­­ under 1291 because all the cases have not19 been disposed of.20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I guess, you know, we can21 speculate about what they meant. They didn't say22 because, they said there's no final order under 1291,23 and all of the cases in the consolidated proceedings24 haven't been disposed of. But let me just make one25 point.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. WAXMAN:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. WAXMAN:I mean, our ­­ look ­­    Given the opinion of ­­Official                         My case isn't turning on whatactually happened here, but I think in thinking aboutthe meaning of "final decision" under 1291, whichdoesn't use the word "action" what a final decision is,with an eye toward what is a healthy legal system, thiscase, I think ­­ I think it's important to focus on justthe features of this case as one of many, many exampleswhy the rule that they're advocating is not correct.JUSTICE ALITO: You raised the argument before us this morning that there wasn't a final judgment and Petitioner argues that there was under Rule 58(c)(2)(b) and you didn't address that, I believe, in your brief. So what is wrong with that argument?MR. WAXMAN: 58(c)(2)(b).      Well, the 58(c)(2)(b) is 150 days from the,quote, judgment that's reflected in 58(b), and 58(b)(1)in particular says, you know, entering judgment withoutthe court's direction.  And it says that if a courtissues an order otherwise ­­ unless the court ordersotherwise, the clerk has to enter a written judgment.      But the caveat there, which does apply inAlderson Reporting Company42￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I ­­ that's a very strange way to read that.Official431 this case for reasons because this does involve ­­ these2 consolidated proceedings are an action within the3 meaning of 54, is that 58(b)(1) is, quote, “subject to4 54(b).”5 Now, in terms of ­­ let me just make the6 point I was trying to make before, which is, look7 exactly at what the Petitioner is trying to do in this8 case, just as an example of what a healthy judicial9 system is.10 They say that they're entitled to ­­ they're11 required immediately to appeal and the Second Circuit is12 obligated immediately to consider their appeal,13 notwithstanding, among other things, two things in14 particular; one, even as we are ­­ the Court is15 considering this case, the district judge is considering16 claims by the Plaintiffs in seven other consolidated17 cases that have raised Sherman Act claims that, in fact,18 her prior ruling on Sherman Act antitrust injury does19 not apply to them. The briefing on those motions, on20 that issue, will be completed, I believe, on Christmas21 Eve, and so if an appeal had been proceeding, the Second22 Circuit would be considering precisely the same thing23 that the judge is reconsidering, and the cases are24 legion in which ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425seem to be very efficient.  It would save her thedifficulty of reconsidering it if the Second Circuitrules one way or another.      It seems to me that the efficiency argumentsin these cases, you know, they can go either way andprobably do go either way depending upon the nature ofthe case.  It would be very efficient, would save herthe time to reconsider it, if she had a ruling from theSecond Circuit.MR. WAXMAN: Just to be clear, Mr. Chief Justice, what she's considering are not requests to reconsider. She denied those a year ago August. These are Plaintiffs who claim that their antitrust claims are, in their mind, significantly different than the claims that Gelboim brought.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I thought you were making the other point. So the claims that she's looking at really are not affected by the Gelboim claims.MR. WAXMAN: That's right, although ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then what problem is it to appeal?MR. WAXMAN: Excuse me?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then what's the problem with going ahead with the Gelboim appeal?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial45￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the problem with going2 ahead with the Gelboim appeal is the inefficiency and3 the lack ­­ and the threat to the ­­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's a different5 reason. She said in the Gelboim case you have no6 antitrust injury. In other words, you have no standing,7 out the door. And you say the other cases are different8 from that. Is ­­ they don't center on antitrust injury?9 MR. WAXMAN: No, they do. They are claiming10 that we ­­ notwithstanding your prior ruling in the11 circumstances of our cases, we do have antitrust injury,12 and from a point of view of a healthy judicial system,13 you would want the court of appeals to be able to14 consider the question of antitrust injury after the15 district judge has finally come to a concluded view as16 to all of the consolidated cases.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think what the Chief18 Justice is indicating is to the extent that the issues,19 the claims are the same, the efficiency argument can cut20 both ways; to the extent that the claims are different,21 what's the problem with an appeal?22 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the ­­ the court of23 appeals is being asked to consider the ­­ the24 sufficiency of the allegations as to antitrust injury25 with respect to a common core of ­­ of – of a allegedAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 facts, a course of conduct, and different parties ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But is that the only thing,3 that they're going to have to learn the facts twice?4 MR. WAXMAN: Well, there ­­ look, you can5 always argue that there are certain efficiencies in6 taking immediate piecemeal appeals. Our system, since7 the Judiciary Act of 1789, has set its sight against8 that and said that piecemeal appeals are disfavored.9 Another feature of this very case ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG:11 had been right the first time,12 that's totally been dismissed,13 these other people that have antitrust claims and other14 claims, so what I'm going to do is this, final judgment15 for the one that has no other claims, 54(b) on the16 antitrust claims for the others so that the Second17 Circuit will then hear antitrust standing all at once.18 MR. WAXMAN: And the ­­ the point is that19 there are other parties in the consolidated pre ­­20 pleadings that say that their claims and their21 Plaintiffs stand in a different position under the22 Sherman Act with respect to antitrust injury than23 Gelboim does, and why wouldn't a healthy system ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the district judge25 obviously didn't think so because she said, I'm ­­ oneAlderson Reporting CompanyBut if the district judgeshe said I have a claimit's out, then there are46￼Official47￼1 party has an appeal of right and I am going to do the2 54(b) order for the others.3 MR. WAXMAN: She didn't consider, Justice4 Ginsburg, the seven parties that are now claiming that5 they are different. She was only considering the6 application by certain other parties for a 54(b)7 certification.8 And if you look at what the judge did after9 the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction, I10 think it's pretty revealing. Mr. ­­ Ms. Gelboim's11 lawyers and the lawyers of the parties who previously12 had had a 54(b) certification went back to the judge and13 said, okay, there was ­­ the Second Circuit thinks that14 there wasn't a final order, but it would be great to15 have the court of appeals decide the antitrust injury16 issue, please issue a 54(b) certification. And here is17 what the judge said. This is on Page 294 of the joint18 appendix: Quote, This case has a wonderful host of19 interesting issues. We could send six different issues20 up to the circuit. We're not doing that seriatim, we're21 going to clean up this complaint, we're not picking and22 choosing particular questions and sending them up.23 And at the end of that hearing, the counsel24 for some of the Plaintiffs with Sherman Act claims said,25 well, when you get done resolving ­­ when you get doneAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial48￼1 cleaning up the complaint and resolving the issues as2 the pleading disputes, would you then con ­­ would you3 then grant a 54(b) certification? And she said, I'm not4 prepared to rule on that at this moment. And obviously5 ­­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's7 efficiencies ­­ there's efficiency to the system and you8 have arguments about that, but there's also fairness to9 the parties. I mean, how many years are these people,10 whose case is done as far as the District Court is11 concerned, supposed to sit around and wait for the big12 fish to resolve their cases?13 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the ­­ the ­­ it is a14 feature of the rule against piecemeal litigation that15 individual litigants sometimes have to wait. But what16 is particularly ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just kind of18 begs the question whether this is piecemeal or not for19 these people.20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think here's the point,21 there is no case, they have found not a single case in22 46 years of MDL litigation where any party in their23 position or a similar position has had to wait an24 inordinate amount of time and that is because in25 appropriate cases, whether the cases are consolidatedAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial49￼1 for all purposes or some limited purpose, the courts2 exercised their discretion under Rule 54(b).3 It has never happened that someone in their4 position has had to re ­­ has been required to wait for5 years and years, at least neither we nor they, who I'm6 confident have scoured the record of MDLs, in fact, has7 done this. And ­­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then that sort of9 contradicts what you said before. You said she wasn't10 going to deal with these things piecemeal. By the way,11 on that point, she said, given the reaction of the12 Second Circuit more than once, it's time to give up.13 She said that first, as ­­ as far as that's ­­14 MR. WAXMAN: I think, Justice Ginsburg, that15 the point I wanted to make here is she has left fully16 open the possibility that when she finishes resolving17 the pleading problems, including the claims of the other18 seven Sherman Act plaintiffs who say they're different,19 she will reconsider whether to grant Rule 54(b).20 And while I, you know, my ­­ my friend on21 the other side says, well, there is ­­ you know, there22 are all sorts of obscure procedural mechanisms where you23 could get this flexibility, the point here is that we24 have a rule that has already been made to deal with the25 resolution of all the claims of a party or all theAlderson Reporting Company1234567 not ­­ 8 910111213141516171819202122232425parties of a claim which is 54(b) and ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. WAXMAN:JUSTICE GINSBURG:      But to what ­­ what ­­­­ the advantage of ­­Official                               What is obscure about astay?  Multidistrict cases have lots and lots of issues,and quite often stays of some cases are issued.  That'sMR. WAXMAN:JUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. WAXMAN:Here ­­      ­­ obscure.                         Here's the difference.  Thedifference is that under the ­­ under the stay regime,the status quo, that is the presumption is thatpiecemeal appeals will go forward unless the districtjudge affirmatively acts.  Under the regime, as weunderstand it, and as all courts and commentators haveunderstood it, the pros ­­ the appeal will not goforward unless the district court makes the two findingsthat Rule 54(b) requires.  One is that there really is afinal order or final decision; and, second, that thereis no just cause for delay, and it is that discipline,that focus, that the rules place on the party thatbenefit the system.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein, you have six minutesAlderson Reporting Company50￼OfficialON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice.      Three brief preliminary points and then justJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. You believe 9 that the notation on 11a is the final judgment you're10 speaking about?11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do, and this goes to12 Justice Scalia's point and the questions that were asked13 at oral argument. This argument was raised in the brief14 in opposition whether we did have an appealable15 judgment. We addressed it in Footnote 1 of our cert.16 reply brief, and we were so obviously right that this is17 governed by Rule 58(c) that the respondents abandoned18 this argument in the merits brief. The district said19 our action is terminated and we have an appeal as a20 matter of right.21 That was quite plainly the judgment. We22 appealed within 150 days after that. So this ­­ you23 considered this fully, I am sure, because if ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: You addressed it where,25 Footnote 1 of ­­Alderson Reporting Company51￼1234567 ­­ 8remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C.

GOLDSTEIN: That was actually the first point.      The second one goes to Justice Breyer'sconcern that no one thinks that we are right.  Andjust ­­ and Mr. Waxman's point that, oh, everyoneunderstoods ­­ understands, every commentator, that thisis done under Rule 54(b), that is, in a word,      JUSTICE KENNEDY:right on the rest of the case?Alderson Reporting Company52￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GOLDSTEIN: Footnote 1 of the briefin ­­ excuse me, our reply brief on cert. We have only one footnote.JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.MR. GOLDSTEIN: And we discuss at length their concession that there was a final judgment, what it is the Second Circuit did, why it is terminating as a judgment, all of those points. This was presented to you. And we were so plainly right that they didn't even make the argument in their merits brief. It's still jurisdictional, but there quite clearly was a termination of the action that the district court understood was appealable. That's why Rule 58 exists.Official53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ridiculous.  Ours is the rule in the overwhelmingmajority of the country and has been for decades.  Everytime ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, what is that word.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'll give you two kinds of case cites. The cert. petition cites all the cases in the court of appeals ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Okay.MR. GOLDSTEIN: ­­ including the D.C. circuit, that say when you enter the judgment in the individual action, it's appealable. I have given you the 1935 MDL that uses the 58(b) example.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.MR. GOLDSTEIN: But as Justice Ginsburg indicates, it's commonplace for MDL courts to enter stays and put act ­­ individual actions on ice without entering judgments. The system, as we describe it, has been working for decades without any difficulty.      And, Justice Ginsburg, my third preliminarypoint is that when Mr. Waxman says there are all ofthese other actions out there, it is a little bit of anoptical illusion.  When this district court entered thisopinion which resulted in our judgment, she entered thesame order in every other single pending case.  She wasAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial541 quite clear that it applied to all of the cases in the2 MDL. She denied reconsideration, explained that no one3 could have antitrust standing.4 If there are other unrelated antitrust5 claims, then there's no problem with our appeal.6 Now, my big point is that there is no reason7 for you to muck about with and cause confusion in the8 law with respect to what a final judgment is, what an9 action is, what a ­­ what a constituent matter in an10 action is, when we can address all of his policy11 concerns in the way that MDL courts have been doing for12 decades. There is going to be considerable confusion13 that results.14 What are we supposed to appeal from?15 Justice Breyer, if you know the answer to your question16 which you asked three times at the ­­ at the end of this17 argument, you are alone, I believe. I do not know what18 it is that I am supposed to appeal from, particularly if19 some of the cases settle. What is a ­­ it's called the20 Final Judgment Rule. We have a final judgment in our21 action.22 Imagine the following forms of confusion.23 What happens with American Pipe tolling? When was our24 action dismissed? Therefore, some other individual25 person is required to file an individual lawsuit. What￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425happens when you have multiple lawsuits that aretogether that look alike?  Are those now a singleaction?  What if the different lawsuits are coordinatedrather than consolidated?  Because, remember, the threeSchwab lawsuits were consolid ­­ coordinated here, notconsolidated.  What do those people do?      Why is it that you want to create a regimethat creates all of these doubts that has a new FinalJudgment Rule, a new definition of action, despite theuniform meaning in all of the civil procedures, thatwill create just follow­on confusion when I have offeredyou the simple solution, and that is the district judgewill enter a final judgment in the action if thedistrict judge wants it to be appealable?      If the district judge ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His is ­­ basically you're saying are there any other mechanisms for the district court to get to where it wants? A rake­off, don't enter anything.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Don't enter ­­ enter anything.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:under 58.  Tell the court ­­Stay and don't enterOfficialMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ the clerk of theAlderson Reporting Company55￼Official56￼1 court not to enter it?2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Under ­­ under 42 create a3 consolidated complaint as was done here with the OTC and4 exchange actions. That's actually very common. And5 that is the MDL court will say, I have four lawsuits in6 front of me. I am, under Rule 42, going to consolidate7 them into a single master complaint. That master8 complaint will have four different claims in it. And9 then the district court will simply resolve one of the10 claims in the master action without entering a judgment11 in the individual action ­­ not the master action, the12 master complaint. It's not actually an action. There's13 an MDL docket, a main MDL docket, and the district court14 just doesn't enter a judgment in the individual15 action ­­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can that be done when17 it's consolidated only for purposes of pretrial18 discovery?19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It can. It is what's20 known ­­ there's a Sixth Circuit case called Refrigerant21 that discusses this issue and a Second Circuit case22 called Katz. It is called an administrative complaint.23 The district court uses this administrative complaint to24 manage the litigation, and that administrative complaint25 doesn't have the same docket as the individual actions.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial571 And the district court is perfectly capable of saying,2 I'm going to resolve the antitrust claim ­­ not an3 action, an antitrust claim ­­ inside this larger4 administrative complaint without entering a judgment.5 And when there is no judgment, there's no appeal. And6 you can announce that rule and give the district courts7 the flexibility that the retired district judges want8 without creating all this necessary docck here trial.9 As you say, Justice Sotomayor, district judges pay a lot10 of attention to your rulings. They will know what it is11 that they are supposed to do, and we just don't have a12 mess later on.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see anything in14 the rules about it, and this is the first time I've15 heard about this administrative ­­16 MR.
