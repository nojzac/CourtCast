FRIED:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and mayit please the Court:1011121314   property of Brown and Hayes, the clients.  Second, that it15   was not regulated; it was taken.  Third, that it has16   value.  And fourth, that an injunction or declaratory          I wish to argue four propositions.  First, thatthe interest in these IOLTA accounts is the private￼relief is an appropriate and practicable form of relief inthis case.1718192021   ask you one broad question?  You don't agree, I take it,22   with the conclusion of the dissent in the court ofNow --QUESTION:  Before you start, Mr. Fried, may I23   appeals, which I don't think agreed with your fourth24   point.25             MR. FRIED:  No.  I think we are entitled to a3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   declaration, or to an -- or an injunction just as was2   received in Eastern -- in Eastern Enterprises, just as was3   received in Hodel v. Irving, just as was received in4   Nollan and Dolan.  And in our -- in our complaint filed,5 6 7 8 9we asked for declaratory or injunctive relief, so I thinkthat is available, and it is a practical and proper formof relief in this case.          QUESTION:  The only point I was really want --you -- you do not understand the dissenters in the NinthCircuit to have gone that far, though, do you?101112131415   no, they did not.  No, they did not.MR. FRIED:  How -- how far, Justice Stevens?          QUESTION:  To have held that you're entitled toinjunctive relief.MR. FRIED:  They did not go that far.  They --￼          QUESTION:  In fact, they specifically said thisequitable relief would not enjoin takings, but wouldsimply stop Washington Supreme Court from requiring theLPO's to comply with the IOLTA rules.1617181920212223   appendix.  I think it's on -- no, I'm sorry.  It's -- yes,24   in the -- in the joint appendix.  We ask specifically for25   injunctive and declaratory relief in general.          MR. FRIED:  Well, if the injunctive relief,which we asked for -- and here in the -- the complaint, Ibelieve, is on page 100 of the -- 100 of the joint4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005123456789   general.  A general injunction was sought.  I'm sorry.Now --          QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, what plaintiffs havestanding to ask for injunctive relief in this case?          MR. FRIED:  Certainly Brown and Hayes.  There'sa question whether Daugs and Maxwell do, but certain --          QUESTION:  But in the -- in the complaint was aninjunction sought on behalf of Brown and Hayes?MR. FRIED:  Yes.  An injunction was sought inI'm not putting my hand on the -- on the section in thecomplaint, but --101112131415   then finally -- yes.  Now I have it.  Thank you.  In the16   joint appendix on page 30, we ask specifically that they17   permanently enjoin the defendants.  This is paragraph 3.18   So we asked for that relief, yes.19             QUESTION:  And -- and you ask for it now on20   behalf of Brown and Hayes, not --21             MR. FRIED:  We certainly do.22             QUESTION:  -- on behalf of the foundation.23             MR. FRIED:  We -- we ask for it on behalf of any24   and all parties in this case.25 QUESTION: Mr. Fried, the question that Justice 5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  I -- I thought it read to thecontrary, that it was on behalf of the LPOs.MR. FRIED:  It was on behalf of the LPOs, but￼1   Stevens raised, which I was then addressing, was not what2   was in your complaint, but what was the position of the3   dissenting judges in the Ninth Circuit.  And I read from4   that dissent -- so you are clearly asking for something5   that the dissenters did not say you would be entitled to6   when they said --7             MR. FRIED:  We are asking for more than the8   dissenters would have given us.  That is correct, Justice9   Ginsburg.          QUESTION:  Yes.  They said the equitable reliefwould not enjoin takings.10111213   that.  We are asking for it because it's very clear on14   this Court's precedents that where compensatory relief15   would be impracticable, or is not contemplated in the16   program, an injunction is -- is proper.  And this CourtMR. FRIED:  Yes.  We are asking for more than￼has on numerous occasions in very similar cases grantedinjunctive relief.17181920   and then we have this passage in the dissent.  When did21   the idea of an injunction of the takings -- when was that22   squarely presented to any court?  Because it would seem23 24 25that if you had presented it, that this is rather curious,what we get in the dissent.          MR. FRIED:  It's been presented throughout,6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  You -- you mentioned your complaint,1   Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, in the Fifth Circuit case,2   which is virtually identical to this case, not only was it3   presented, but an injunction was granted.  And exactly the4 5 6 7 8 9injunction which we received --          QUESTION:  If you just could tell me at whatpoint you made it clear to the court that you were seekingnot what is described here, that is, that the -- that theinjunction would be addressed to the compliance of theLPO's with the IOLTA rules.          MR. FRIED:  I think that the -- I submit,Justice Ginsburg, that that paragraph, which I have readto you, makes that clear.10111213141516   judgment motion.  So that the courts were well aware, as17   the complaint should have made them aware, but also were18   well aware that we were seeking an injunction for all19   parties in all respects.  And after all, that is preciselyQUESTION:  But that paragraph --          MR. FRIED:  And in the summary -- and I'm -- I'minformed that it was also made clear in our summary￼the relief that was obtained in the Fifth Circuit case.          QUESTION:  Let -- let me see if I can help youget to the other major parts of your case by asking this20212223   question.24             In Loretto, could the property owners have25   obtained an injunction against piercing the building for7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   the little antenna or the wire on the grounds that there2   was no compensation?  I doubt it.  I would think the3   government, after Loretto, would continue to be able to4   poke the holes in -- in the wall -- or maybe I'm wrong --5   even though compensation was negligible.  Could there have6   been an injunction there, and if the answer is, well, no,7   why can there be an injunction here?  And maybe that gets89 10 11 12you to the --          MR. FRIED:  They --          QUESTION:  -- the nature of the taking thatoccurred in this case.               MR. FRIED:  The -- I think that's exactly the13   reason.  If there were an -- if there is compensation in14   this case, exactly as the Court said in Eastern15   Enterprises, it would -- in effect, compensation being16   dollar-for-dollar is the equivalent of shutting down the17   program.  And that was the case in Webb's as well.￼          I -- I might just mention, Justice Kennedy, thatthe respondents throughout this case say that the EasternEnterprises case, which is very important to our18192021   injunctive claim, was really only a plurality.  There was22   not a majority for the Court.  I don't believe that the23   fifth Justice, which was yourself, disagreed with the24   remedy.25             And indeed, the fifth Justice said that this was8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   not a takings case -- Eastern Enterprise -- because unlike 2   this very case we have, this was not the -- the -- you 3   said, rather the exaction is a forced contribution to 4   general government revenues.  I'm sorry.  I'm reading the 5   wrong -- I'm reading the wrong passage. 6             In the Eastern -- Eastern Enterprises case, you 7   said that the reason -- the reason that you didn't think 8   that was a takings case was that a valuable interest in an 9   intangible or even a bank account or accrued interest,10   which is, of course, this case, had not been appropriated.11   Well, this is a bank account and accrued interest --12             QUESTION:  Well, what about my hypothetical on13   Loretto?  I -- I take it Loretto establishes that therewas an invasion, a taking --          MR. FRIED:  Yes.1415161718   be calculated.  It was 10 cents or something.  Could you19   have had an injunction against installation of the20   antennas in Loretto on the ground that the compensation21   can't be figured?  I think not.  And if that's -- if my22   conclusion is right about that, how is your case23   different?24             MR. FRIED:  My -- our case is different because25   in this case, as in Webb's, as in Eastern Associates, to9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  -- but let's -- let's assume that thecompensation was just so minimal it just really couldn't 1   give compensation is to simply erase the program.  While 2   in the case where physical property is taken, to give 3   compensation still leaves it open to use that property 4   while -- where what you have is money and you must make 5   compensation for that, then to make compensation for a 6   dollar is to pay a dollar.  That's what the Court said in 7   Eastern Enterprises. 8             QUESTION:  Why doesn't that just prove that you 9   have the wrong clause of the Constitution?  That is, your10   clause of the Constitution, the one you're pushing, says,11   nor shall private property be taken for public use without12   just compensation.  Foreseeing that you can take the13   property for public use, you just have to pay money for14   it.  Just compensation.Now, if paying the just compensation can't work15161718   mean the government can't take it.  It just -- if there's19   something wrong with it, it means that that that which is20   wrong with it is that it violates the Due Process Clause,21   not the Just Compensation Clause.22             MR. FRIED:  That would be correct if Webb's had23   been a due process case, but it was not.  It was a takings24   case.  And in Webb's, they didn't say you can take that25   interest so long as you pay just compensation for it.10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼out, or it's too hard or, you know, the person doesn'thave enough of an interest to get anything, that doesn't 1   They say, you've got to stop. 2             QUESTION:  Then the rationale -- you'd say 3   even -- I mean, occasionally some case does have something 4   that's a little hard to follow, but the -- the theory that 5   that is consistent with the Just Compensation Clause, 6   rather than the Due Process Clause, is? 7             MR. FRIED:  That it makes no sense.  It's not 8   that it's hard to calculate.  We would be happy to argue 9   how you would calculate it.  The point is that to10   calculate it and to pay the just compensation is to shut11   down the program.  It makes no sense.  There's no programleft after you have paid just compensation.          QUESTION:  Yes, but if -- if it is shown -- and12131415   determined.  If it is shown that no compensation is due16   because it wouldn't have earned or produced anything, then17   how is it a taking?  I mean, that's -- because the Takings18   Clause refers to the taking without just compensation.  IfI guess we don't know here because it hasn't been￼the compensation is 0, how is it a taking?1920212223   taking?2425  QUESTION:  If.  If it were, how -- how is it a  MR. FRIED:  If it were.  But the --  QUESTION:  Well, then what is your answer?  Is11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. FRIED:  The compensation is not 0, and thepremise of the --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9it a taking if the just compensation is 0?          MR. FRIED:  Yes.  It is a taking, but it is --as the -- because this Court --          QUESTION:  How is it in -- in the language ofthe clause?          MR. FRIED:  Because this Court in Phillips hasheld that economic -- that -- that there is privateproperty and it has value even though it has no realizableeconomic value.          But we do not concede that there is no economicvalue here, and the fact that it could not have earnedinterest --1011121314   it?15             MR. FRIED:  Yes, it has.  It has been16   determined.  It has been determined and conceded by the17   respondents that there is interest in this case of $518   and $2.  They go on to argue, ah, yes, but absent the19   IOLTA program, that would not have been earned.  This20   Court in Webb's specifically addressed that point and21   said, we accept the proposition that apart from the22   statute, Florida law does not require that interest be --23   be earned on registered deposits.  So it was quite clear.24   This is just another version of --25             QUESTION:  But weren't those gross figures12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  But that has not been determined, has￼1   rather than net figures?  Those --141516171819202122232425is in -- involved here --          QUESTION:  Even if it had been --          MR. FRIED:  -- and that is the point --          QUESTION:  Do you agree if it was a taking andyou were to get just compensation, you would get the netloss rather than the gross loss?          MR. FRIED:  No.  We would get the gross loss.I think the --          QUESTION:  You -- you again, Mr. Fried, aregoing quite beyond the position of the original panel,later the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit, who made itclear -- and this is on page 83a of the original panel13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. FRIED:  Those are gross figures, yes,Justice Stevens. 2 3 4 5 6   the property owner?  We assume the -- the interest is 7   the -- goes with the principal, and therefore it's 8   property, and property has been taken.  But has there been 9   any net loss to the person from whom the property has been10   taken?11             MR. FRIED:  Perhaps and perhaps not.  Let's say12   that there has not.  I -- we argue that that does not13   matter.  It is the gross -- it is the gross interest that          QUESTION:  But can we assume, along withJustice O'Connor's question, that there's no net loss to￼ 1   decision -- that said, just as a client is not entitled to 2   the full amount that a lawyer collects for him, but only 3   that amount less the lawyer's reasonable expenses and 4   fees, so just compensation for the interest taken by 5   IOLTA, after IOLTA causes the interest fund to exist, is 6   something less -- is something less -- than the amount of 7   the interest. 8             MR. FRIED:  That is what the dissent says. 9   We do not agree with that.10             What we agree with is what this Court said in11   Phillips when this Court said that -- and it used the12   example of the rents -- the government may not seize rents13   received by the owner of a building because it can prove14   that the costs incurred in collecting the rents exceed the15   amounts collected.  If the argument that's being made now￼16171819202122232425were correct, then that statement would be incorrectbecause it would mean --          QUESTION:  Well, isn't the difference --          MR. FRIED:  -- that the government may seizethose rents.          QUESTION:  Isn't the difference, Mr. Fried, thatin the -- in the rent example, what the -- what themembers of the Court were assuming was that if somebodywants to be a bad businessperson, he's perfectly free todo it, and until he goes bankrupt, or loses the property,14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   he can collect the rent. 2             The situation here is different because the 3   situation here is such that there's nothing to collect. 4   The -- the way the background principles of the banking 5   statutes are set up, or -- which are effected by the 6   banking statutes means that the -- the rent, the penny, 7   the interest, never gets to the person who owns the 8   principal.  And isn't that why -- isn't that exactly why 9   Phillips does not determine the result in this case?10             MR. FRIED:  I think not, Justice --11   Justice Souter, because the Court in Phillips said12   specifically this interest -- so it assumes there is --13   this interest is the private property of the clients,14   Brown and Hayes.  It said that this is -- that's what this15   Court said.  It is their property.  Now, it doesn't16   disappear as their property because they would incur17   expenses in collecting it.18             QUESTION:  Well, I may not be the -- the best19   expert on what the -- what the majority meant by that.20             (Laughter.)21             QUESTION:  But I think thought what the majority22   meant by that was that when you aggregate, as -- as is the23   case in these IOLTA accounts, of course there is a24   fractional sense that is attributable to every item25   that -- a fractional sense of the interest that's15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   attributable to every item that goes into the aggregation, 2   but it doesn't follow from that that any of that 3   attributable amount could ever be netted out and ever be 4   received under the banking statutes by those individuals 5   to whom it is attributable.  If, in fact, it were the 6   other way, then the IOLTA scheme would force a separate 7   NOW account to have been set up. 8             MR. FRIED:  The -- the Court certainly did not 9   say that any of that interest could be netted out and paid10   net to Brown and Hayes, but it did say, quite11   unambiguously, that that interest -- not in some general12   sense, but exactly that interest -- was the private13   property of clients, Brown and Hayes.14 Now --15             QUESTION:  But was it taken from them?  So, I16   mean, I -- I can see why you see Webb is very, very17   similar, but the difference that I saw is that Webb says18   the money should be deposited in an ordinary interest-19   bearing account, and here it's being deposited in a -- in20   an account that is really the creation of the government's21   program that just couldn't have borne interest unless you22   collect all these funds together.  So without this￼23 24 25program, the person couldn't have earned interest.          Now, has the government taken that?  If theyhave taken it, then why didn't the government take it when16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   they -- when they tax it.  Suppose the tax law was illegal2   because it's very unreasonable.  Why wouldn't that then be3   a taking?  Why wouldn't the government take it when the4 5 6 7 8 9government has a currency reg that imposes certainconditions upon the use of that interest?          I'm back to the same point.  Why isn't thisreally a due process problem, not a takings problem?          MR. FRIED:  Well, that's a -- I mean, that is --that is an argument which depends on traversing thepremise established by this Court in Webb's and Phillips.10111213   bearing account.  Here it's an account that is nonexistent          QUESTION:  That's why I -- I said the differencein Webb's is that in Webb's it's an ordinary interest-without the IOLTA program coming in and saying we will putfunds together, and those funds could not have earnedinterest on their own.141516171819202122232425   premise?  Couldn't a -- a group of attorneys or real17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. FRIED:  Well, that is the argument that theSolicitor General made in Phillips, that this isgovernment-created property, and it was rejected.          QUESTION:  I'm making the same argument inrespect to taking.          MR. FRIED:  And it was rejected by this Court.It was rejected.QUESTION:  But do you agree with that -- that 1   estate brokers form their own consortium and say in order 2   to avoid wasting this interest, we're going to put the 3   interest in a special fund and we'll give clients a check- 4   off system where we'll expend it the way they want? 5   Private -- private enterprise could do exactly what IOLTA 6   is doing, could it not? 7             MR. FRIED:  It might very well. 8             QUESTION:  If -- if the government let it, and 9   just because the government doesn't want to let it,10   doesn't mean the government has a right to do it on its11   own.  Isn't that your point, or isn't it --12             MR. FRIED:  Well, that is -- that's one of the13   points.          QUESTION:  Well, it could do it theoretically,but as a practical matter, computing the -- the variouspayouts would -- would be so expensive that -- and the14151617   payouts so small that it's just not practicable.  Isn't18   that --￼               MR. FRIED:  If I could just address the20   gross-versus-net point.  The interest to which we are21   entitled, to which the clients are entitled, is -- it was22   calculated by respondents -- $5 and $2.  That is the23   amount to which they are entitled.  It may well be that24   along the way, the accountants will say, fine, and we'd25   like $3.50 of that, and the lawyers may say, fine, and we18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005191   want actually $4 of that.  And it may well be that at the2   end of the day they don't have any money.  That's not any3   of the government's business.4             QUESTION:  But that -- that was not the position5   that any judge has brought so far because the original6   panel that held in your favor said, yes -- and I don't7   want to repeat myself, but something less.  It would be8 9101112131415161718202122232425something less than the amount of interest.          I have a question that -- that's puzzling meabout this theoretically we could have it separate.I thought that the program can only work, as far as thetax law is concerned, if the client has no control overthe disposition of --          MR. FRIED:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  -- that interest.  If the client hascontrol, then it's taxable to the -- then it -- interestlike any other interest would be taxable.￼               So, here, the IOLTA has this peculiar aspect to19   it.  You can it's interest belonging to the client, butthat client has no right to dispose of it as long as it'sgoing to be nontaxable income.          MR. FRIED:  The client has a right to dispose ofit, but -- or ought to have a right, under theConstitution, has a right to dispose of it --          QUESTION:  But then it would be interest --19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1             MR. FRIED:  -- but he will pay taxes. 2             QUESTION:  Yes.  But that's another -- 3             MR. FRIED:  That's -- that's life. 4             QUESTION:  -- another -- I would like to go back 5   to a very basic question, and it's -- it's essentially 6   this.  If you had not -- no IOLTA program with the tax 7   advantage that you get that makes the whole thing work, 8   and we went back, we just got this injunction, stop it 9   all, it seems to me the big gainer, the person who is10   really benefitting, and who lost the last time around is11   the bank because the bank had the free use of these funds,12   and IOLTA comes along and takes it.  It really takes it13   away from the banks.  And then if you succeed, it goes14   back to the bank.  Am I right that that's the --               MR. FRIED:  It may.  It may go back to the bank,     which, in a competitive industry, would presumably work     its way down to the -- to the clients, but I don't need to     make that argument.               QUESTION:  Why -- why don't you, though, have to     make exactly the same argument if IOLTA goes down the     drain -- compulsory IOLTA goes down the drain on your1516171819202122   theory?  Why don't you have to make the same argument￼23 24 25about the -- the background government regulation which,in effect, gives the interest to the bank?          MR. FRIED:  It doesn't give the interest to the20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   bank.2             QUESTION:  Sure, it does.  It says, look, bank,3   you can take in money, but you can't pay out any interest4   on it.  You can't pay out interest on a straight checking5   account and you can't pay out NOW interest to a6   corporation.  Therefore, in effect, you get to keep it.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FRIED:  Well, the --          QUESTION:  And the -- the effect of that, itseems to me, is just as much to deprive your client of the$5, if there is any deprivation at all, as -- as it is todeprive it when it says IOLTA gets it instead of the bank.          MR. FRIED:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Except your -- your client is notcompelled by -- by those banking regulations to depositany money in the bank, is he?          MR. FRIED:  No, it is not.          QUESTION:  And your client, I suppose, is notcompelled to engage in this consensual transaction withthe broker.          MR. FRIED:  It is -- the client is compelled toengage in it if he wishes to buy and sell real estate.          QUESTION:  And the client --          MR. FRIED:  He's not compelled to buy and sellreal estate.          QUESTION:  And the client is compelled to21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9deposit the money if it wishes to get banking services.But in no instance -- either the IOLTA case, or thebackground regs case -- does the government say to theperson with $10 in his pocket, you've got to put it in thebank, or you've got to spend that money on real estate.          MR. FRIED:  Well, indeed, not.          QUESTION:  But the compulsion is the same oneway or the other.          QUESTION:  I think -- I think the point isthat -- that your client must -- must be willing -- whatis it -- must deposit money in the bank if he wants to101112   deposit money in the bank.  That's the compulsion here.1314151617181920   rebuttal.  Thank you.MR. FRIED:  He must --          QUESTION:  He must deposit money in the bank ifhe wants to deposit money in the bank.          MR. FRIED:  He must deposit money in the bank ifhe wants to buy and sell real estate, the way you have topay money to a grocer if you want to eat.￼21 22 23 24 25  QUESTION:  Mr. Burman.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BURMAN         ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT     LEGAL FOUNDATION OF WASHINGTON  MR. BURMAN:  Justice Stevens, and may it please22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005If I may, I'd reserve the balance of my time for1234   heart of the flaw in plaintiffs' case.  There is an5   independent requirement -- an independent element of their6   cause of action which is that they show that there was7   just compensation due and denied by the State of8   Washington.  That has not happened here.9 10 11          QUESTION:  So the position of the State ofWashington is that it can take any property so long as itdoesn't have -- so long as compensation can't bethe Court:          I would like to start with the question thatJustice O'Connor posed because I think it goes to the12   calculated.13141516171819202122232425          MR. BURMAN:  No.  The position is that there isno unconstitutional taking if we would pay compensation.Certainly the -- the plain language of the clause says theproperty may be taken.          QUESTION:  Doesn't -- doesn't the State havesome duty to recognize that the Constitution protectsproperty and it shouldn't take property that doesn'tbelong to it?          MR. BURMAN:  In certain circumstances, the JustCompensation Clause acts a shield.          QUESTION:  So -- so if you can get it --          MR. BURMAN:  The process might well --          QUESTION:  So if you can get away with taking23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

BURMAN:  That is the position of this7   Court's cases, not the position of the State of8   Washington, which does not go that far.  Our position is 9101112131415that --          QUESTION:  Well, there might be some due processclaim, mightn't there?          MR. BURMAN:  One was not stated here.          QUESTION:  We're trying -- what -- what we'relooking at here is a takings claim.property just because it can't be valued, then you cantake it.MR. BURMAN:  That is not --QUESTION:  That's the position of the State of               MR. BURMAN:  Correct.  Other plaintiffs might16   well have a due process claim.  These plaintiffs may well17   still have a First Amendment claim since their real18   complaint with this is their subjective ideological one,19   subjectivity which this Court has said is not the business20   of the Just Compensation Clause.21             QUESTION:  Once again, I -- $5 and $2.  It's not22   a whole lot of money, but it's their money.  Why -- why do23   you say it can't be calculated?24             MR. BURMAN:  Under this Court's cases, it is not25   their money.  The Court has been very careful to say that24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   what we look at, because the Just Compensation Clause is a 2   type of indemnity provision that is worried about 3   responding with -- to loss of pecuniary or monetary 4   value -- the Court in the parcel aggregation cases, such 5   as Boston Chamber and Sage, made it very clear that if it 6   is not economically practicable, if the costs of 7   aggregation would exceed the benefit, there is no just 8   compensation. 9             QUESTION:  But you're -- there you're talking10   about something that has to be sold for money.  This is11   quite calculable.  We know exactly how much interest was12   paid, and we know that that interest belonged -- under our13   case law, belongs to these plaintiffs.  What -- what is14   the problem?  $5 and $2.          MR. BURMAN:  Answering the question of whetherit's property, as the Court made clear in Phillips, doesnot answer the question of whether there is a taking, orthe question of whether there is just compensation.15161718192021222324   $5 and $2.  That's gross.  And with the --25             MR. BURMAN:  That is gross.  And, in fact, in￼QUESTION:  Well, who has the $5 and $2?          MR. BURMAN:  The government does, as it had theadditional value in the cases such as the Boston Chambercase, and in --QUESTION:  Mr. Burman, am I right?  It's not25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   Webb's, the very case they rely upon, the Court said the2   government can deduct the cost of protecting that money3   before you calculate what is due.  That is exactly what4 5 6 7 8 9happened --          QUESTION:  Right.  That's why he says he wantsthe injunction.          MR. BURMAN:  Webb's did not have an injunction.          QUESTION:  I know it didn't.  It didn't need it.And his point was -- his point was that since -- if youcould theoretically give the compensation, which isimpossible for the reason you say --1011121314   entitled to anything in cash.  But look, if you could do15   it theoretically, there would be no more program, so give16   us an injunction because it comes to the same thing.MR. BURMAN:  It's --QUESTION:  It's impossible.  They're not￼17             MR. BURMAN:  Where the textual language is just18   compensation, and where the value is economic or pecuniary19   or monetary loss, as this Court's cases often say, it's20   not just that there is no way to remedy this problem.21   There is no remedy called for by the Constitution.  The22   remedy is just compensation.  I take this --23 24 25          QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose there were a Statein which a group of lawyers or real -- people with realestate accounts got together and say, we really should26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   pool this interest and we'll give our clients a choice of 2   four different things that they can allocate the money to. 3   And we're just going to do that as a service, and we think 4   it's good business.  Actually we might -- the company that 5   does this might make a few dollars themselves. 6             If that were in place, could the State of 7   Washington do what it does now, say, you know, this looks 8   like a good idea?  We think we'll take it for what we 9   like.10             MR. BURMAN:  That may be a very different case.11   These plaintiffs have never tried that.  That is not their12   complaint.  They make no allegation --          QUESTION:  But can -- do they even have thepossibility of trying that given the regulation that younow have?1314151617181920212223   you to do it.  Why do you think you can do what private24   business can't?25 MR. BURMAN: Our burden is not to come up with 27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼MR. BURMAN:  Actually, we don't know that.          QUESTION:  You've taken away, in effect, abusiness opportunity, have you not?          MR. BURMAN:  No.  We don't know that that's thecase because they've never presented it to the Statesupreme court.QUESTION:  Well, it's certainly profitable for1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9hypotheticals for other cases that they might bring.These two plaintiffs brought their case.          QUESTION:  Well, your burden is to answerhypotheticals --          MR. BURMAN:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- that establish whether or not aproperty interest is being taken in violation of theConstitution here.          MR. BURMAN:  Correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And you say that simply because itcan't be computed, A, because of the small amounts, and B,because of the government's unique program, that it is notproperty anymore.101112131415161718192021   certain deposits above a certain amount.  And you're22   saying that if the government passes a law that says23   I have to -- I have to deposit my $5,000, together with24   other people's $5,000, thereby getting additional interest25   for all of it -- right -- you can keep the interest28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. BURMAN:  And the difference is what isunique about the government's program and what BostonChamber says would be relevant, if individuals could doit, was aggregation that reduces the transaction costs.In a hypothetical where --￼          QUESTION:  Now, does -- does this mean --let's -- you know, banks pay higher -- higher amounts for 1   because I wouldn't have gotten it anyway. 2             MR. BURMAN:  Justice Scalia -- 3             QUESTION:  What a -- what a wonderful scam. 4             (Laughter.) 5             MR. BURMAN:  There is an element of compulsion 6   there that is not present here, and there is no -- you -- 7   you posit no regulatory purpose.  This arose out of a 8   clear regulatory purpose to -- 9             QUESTION:  I don't care if there's a regulatory10   purpose or not.  I mean, that -- that may go to some11   other -- some other element, but as -- as to whether12   you've taken my property, the interest was paid because of13   my $5,000, and then you come back and say, oh, yeah, but14   you wouldn't have gotten that much because you wouldn't15   have been -- well, that's true.  I wouldn't have, but the16   fact is I was in with those other people and I did get17   them more money, and that more money is mine.18             MR. BURMAN:  And -- and they should present that19   argument.  It may well be that they could come up with a￼202122232425scheme that would reduce the transaction costs and createa net value, and the plain language of the rule says ifthat happens, the lawyer has to honor it.          QUESTION:  They're -- they're arguing --          MR. BURMAN:  It is the lawyer's obligation.          QUESTION:  All right.  I think they're saying, I29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   agreed with you.  You know, I agreed with you.  But I2   wrote a dissent.  So they're saying that was a dissent.3   You lost.  Now, it is the law of the United States that4   this is property.  Indeed, it is their clients' property.5             Now, you tell me on that assumption, since I6   lost, why is it not a taking of that property for which7   they are entitled to just compensation, and, in this case,8   the just compensation would have to take the form of an9   injunction.  Now, unless -- I'm -- I'm anxious to hear theanswer to that point.          MR. BURMAN:  You lost only on the question of10111213   additional elements.  The majority was very clear to say14   we express no opinion.  We state no view on these other15   questions.  That would be nonsensical if in fact it16   follows automatically from what the majority said, but17   clearly that's not the case.18             QUESTION:  Good.  So tell me why it doesn't.19             MR. BURMAN:  With respect to the injunction20   question, if I could jump ahead to -- to that part of your21   hypothetical, Eastern Enterprises, we believe, is a22   different situation where, as in the Youpee case, the23   Court basically said Congress could not have intended this24   circularity, and so we are not going to read the statute25   that way.  This is different when you have the State, and30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005whether the majority should have looked at those￼ 1   it's different where, even the dissenters in the Ninth 2   Circuit below admitted that the amount due, if any, is 3   going to be smaller than the gross interest.  In cases 4   such as Webb's, in cases such as Sperry, even in Phillips, 5   the Court seemed to acknowledge that the deduction made89 106 sense. 7          QUESTION:  But Justice Breyer's question I thinkwas, is there or is there not a taking of property here?          MR. BURMAN:  There is property.  We believethere is no taking, and Mr. Dellinger will address that11   perhaps more directly than I will.  But it is --12             QUESTION:  How -- how would you define what's13   happened to the property?  It's been regulated out of14   existence?               QUESTION:  Oh, it's been transferred but not          MR. BURMAN:  The property was transferred, justas in Connolly, just as in Eastern Enterprises.15161718   taken.19￼          MR. BURMAN:  Correct.  It has not been taken byapplying the multi-factor test that the Court says applieswhen you have a transfer of dollars, which is what202122   happened in those cases.  And when you apply that test,23 24 25these plaintiffs admit no investment expectation, no neteconomic loss.          QUESTION:  It -- it seems to me an odd rule that31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   it's not a right of the owner to decide to whom the owner 2   can transfer the property. 3             MR. BURMAN:  These owners transferred the 4   property to an intermediary on its way to a third party. 5   It would be a really odd rule if somehow the right to 6   exclude was independent of the economic value of money. 7   Just as interest may follow principal, it would make sense 8   that the right to exclude has to follow the economic value 9   when you send it to an --10             QUESTION:  Mr. Burman, let me ask you something11   as a practical matter.  If the Court disagreed with you     and concluded there was a taking and they were entitled to     some relief, can the problem be solved by simply adding a     little explanatory provision in the proposed escrow     instructions, that if you don't want your money in the     combined account, you can do something else with it?               MR. BURMAN:  The -- the --               QUESTION:  Otherwise, it's going in the IOLTA               MR. BURMAN:  The problem if -- as I understand21   it, is that if you give the client the right to opt out,22   the IRS says that becomes taxable.  We're not saying that1213141516171819   account.20￼23 24 25you net out the taxes --          QUESTION:  It would become taxable to the personopting out.32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. BURMAN:  Correct, and that --          QUESTION:  But not to everybody else.  If the --if -- if the person entering into the escrow says, havingunderstood it, look, if I opt out, I'm not going to getanything, so I don't care, you can do this, would -- couldit still function?          MR. BURMAN:  It -- I believe it might well beable to function, and I think it's important that there'sno compulsion --QUESTION:  How could it?

Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Are you sure it's not taxable to theperson who opts out?          MR. BURMAN:  It is -- it may be taxable to theperson who opts out.QUESTION:  Not to the others?￼          MR. BURMAN:  It may not be to the others.I don't know the --          QUESTION:  Why not?  Because that person wouldhave disposition either way.          MR. BURMAN:  Oh, if they had the right.  You --and -- you're correct.          QUESTION:  And -- and in order to have thisscheme work, the client cannot have any control over the 1 2   this -- 3 4   be netted out.  It's the cost of individually recording, 5   tracking, paying, and reporting to the IRS that eats up 6   these nominal amounts.  That is the problem here. 7             If I could make one correction to something 8   Mr. Fried said.  There is no compulsion here.  You don't 9   have to go to an escrow agency that has an LPO or a10   lawyer.  You can go to one that does not have one.  In11   Washington and many States, that's the case.  There is no12   compulsion here --13             QUESTION:  Except correct one -- or explain one14   thing to me.  I thought that if it netted out so that15   there was no net amount available to the depositor,16   that -- I mean, the other way around.  If it netted out17   that there was -- something was due, even 5 or 10 cents,18   then that would be improper, and you'd have to give them19   the money back.20             MR. BURMAN:  Absolutely.  Banks effectively21   encumber interest with their charges.  That's what the22   plaintiffs' complaint alleges.  They say prior to IOLTA,23   banks paid no interest.  They bundled and effectively24   encumbered it there.  When required to separate it out, I25   can guarantee you, you won't be allowed to go to a bank34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

BURMAN:  And it's not the tax that needs to￼1   and say, I'd like to withdraw my $100 and my 5 cents of2   interest and maybe I'll pay a year $5 in service charges3   later if I feel like it.  That does not happen.  This is4   money that is encumbered, and you should look at the net5   amount.6 7 8 9          If there is no value lost, there is no takingunder this Court's cases.          Kimball Laundry could not be more clear.  InKimball Laundry, the Court said for any --          QUESTION:  -- back to my example.  My example ofyou -- you compel a bunch of people to -- to101112   contribute $5,000 apiece.  No money lost?  I could not13   have made that -- that additional -- that additional14   interest on the $5,000.  So It's perfectly okay for the15   State to say, hey, you know, this -- this interest is16   ours.  We made it on your money, but you couldn't have17   gotten it otherwise.  That seems to me extraordinarily18   strange.19             MR. BURMAN:  If you compelled them to do it,20   that might be a different case.  It is Mr. Fried's21   proposal, which I believe if he had a narrower argument he22   would have made it, but he gives you the radical and23   startling argument that you only look at the gross amount24   and even -- and that even if there is no net value due,25   which in case after case -- such as Kimball Laundry and￼35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

They do not attack it.20   It's the Federal Government that creates a tax system that21   requires a lot of record-keeping.  They do not challenge22   that baseline cost, and our argument is that for that23   reason, there is no value lost, no violation --24             QUESTION:  Now, what choice did the plaintiffs25   have in going into this arrangement or not?36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

There has to be property -- established by20   Phillips.  There has to be a taking in the constitutional21   sense, and there has to be a denial by the State of just22   compensation.23             Mr. Burman has suggested why that is missing in24   this case because there has been no just compensation25   that's denied.  The justices of the Washington Supreme --37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSJUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON  MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Stevens, and may it￼please the Court:          To establish a violation of the JustCompensation Clause, let's remember there have to be three 1             QUESTION:  Well, but -- but that's the issue 2   before us.  I'm just not sure of a precedent which says 3   that if just compensation can't be calculated, the 4   government is free to take someone's property for itself. 5   And -- and I'm just baffled by what that principle might6 be. 7             MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Kennedy, it is a taking 8   when the government takes your property without a 9   sufficient regulatory basis.  And the compensation they10   owe you, if it is zero, and zero is paid, there is no11   violation.  I know it is somewhat surprising since the12   founding generation was so wedded to rights of property,13   but the Fifth Amendment expressly confirms the authority14   of government to take property for public purposes, State,15   local, and National.  They have to pay just compensation.16             If they take $1 million of your property and pay17   you $999,000, they've violated the clause.  If they -- if18   your property is worth $10, and they pay you $10, they19   haven't violated.  And if it loses $10 in value, and it's20   worth zero, then they owe you nothing.  There's no denial,￼no violation of the Fifth Amendment.          Professor Fried would say in that instance, if21222324   taking it.  That's not the answer.  The answer is that the25   compensation is zero.the value declines from $10 to zero, you enjoin them from38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1             Now, in this case, by definition, as the 2   justices of the Supreme Court of Washington -- insofar as 3   the English language would permit it -- said we do not 4   want to take property that individuals could earn on their 5   own.  They say at page 149 of the joint appendix from the 6   original IOLTA order, in adopting these amendments to the 7   Code of Professional Responsibility, we make clear that 8   those funds available for the IOLTA program are only those 9   that cannot under any circumstances earn net interest.10             And they even were careful at page 165 of the11   joint appendix to say that as cost-effective subaccounting12   services become available, making it possible to earn net13   interest on smaller amounts for increasingly shorter14   periods of time, more trust money will have to be invested15   for a client's benefit under the new rule.  The rule is16   self-adjusting.  Unquote.17             QUESTION:  So you give -- you give the same18   answer to my $5,000 hypothetical that your -- your brother19   would.  Right?￼MR. DELLINGER:  My answer is that --2021222324   government's.  Right?25             MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, because this Court's cases39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  I mean, so long as the governmentsets it up that way and I couldn't make any more money,the money that the government makes on my money is the 1   make it clear, Justice Scalia, that the amount of just 2   compensation that is due is the amount of your loss.  And 3   if your loss is zero, there's no denial of just 4   compensation. 5             QUESTION:  I don't think the cases make clear 6   what you have to deduct from it.  What if -- what if it 7   would be clear that I would have had to have to sue for 8   it, and -- and I would have had to expend attorney's fees? 9   Does that all have to be deducted from the just10   compensation?11             MR. DELLINGER:  No.  I would not -- I would not12   count that as all.  The -- the proper measure is what a13   willing buyer would pay a willing seller.  In thisinstance, I think, it's the -- what is taken is theability to use one's money to earn money for a period oftime. What would a willing buyer pay for that?141516171819202122232425   interest.  But that's not what you took here.  You40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼          If I have a few thousand dollars to investfor 72 hours and say to Professor Fried, you can pay mefor the value of that -- my right to earn that money; ifhe goes to the bank and the bank says, you can deposithere for 72 hours, but when you come back, you will owe usmoney, he's going to pay me zero.Now, if --QUESTION:  That's if you took his right to earn1   took $7.  He did earn interest.  It was not some abstract2   right to earn interest that was taken.  What was taken3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718   it -- it's their money that earned it.  Isn't interest by19   definition that which is netted out that the bank pays20   you?21             MR. DELLINGER:  Precisely, it's --22             QUESTION:  And if that is the definition of23   interest, then there was no $5.  There was no interest24   earned on this amount.  Isn't that --25             MR. DELLINGER:  That is exactly correct,41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005was $7.          MR. DELLINGER:  I think that is amischaracterization of the facts, Justice Scalia, that themoney that he put in, if invested at that rate, in a worldwithout transaction costs, would have earned that amountof money, but that world doesn't exist in the -- in theMilky Way.QUESTION:  Whose money earned the $7?MR. DELLINGER:  The $7 --QUESTION:  His money earned it, didn't it?  Anddidn't we say in our earlier case that if it's his moneythat earned the interest, the interest belongs to him?￼the --MR. DELLINGER:  That's not the case becauseQUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, isn't the -- isn't 1   Justice Souter. 2             QUESTION:  Or did -- did they -- I'd like to -- 3   just to spend a couple of minutes at some point addressing 4   the question of whether -- whether the program took it 5   from him.  That is to say, I guess there's a sense in 6   which -- suppose a robber had come and said to the 7   depositor, your money or your life.  I mean, what would 8   the depositor have done?  I guess he'd be dead.  This 9   money wouldn't have existed.  Did he take it from him?10   Did he obtain it from him?  There -- there is a problemthere that I'd just like you to address.          MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Breyer, I think the11121314151617   program took the money, but who did it take it from?  Did18   it take it from the property owner?  Is there a sense --19   or do you concede the point that there's a taking?20             MR. DELLINGER:  The money that is -- the money21   that is acquired -- taken in the common language sense --22   comes from the money that is generated by the pool of23   funds.  It's not money that could have been paid to the24   individual client.  And these rules make it clear that if25   you could pay it to the individual client, because you42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005cases make it clear that you look to what a willing buyerwould pay a willing seller.          QUESTION:  That's compensation, but I wonderwhat about -- I mean, there is a sense in which the￼1   can't -- you can't find out who he or she is, or allocate2   the money to them.  So it has no net value.3             QUESTION:  I thought we decided that issue in4   Phillips.  I mean, you could argue that point --5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- but didn't we decide that point inPhillips, that there was a taking --          QUESTION:  I don't know if we did that.  I mean,property --23 24 25made, and this money could have earned net interest, thenyou can get a refund.          MR. DELLINGER:  Absolutely correct.  You -- you43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  -- and that the property didbelong --10111213141516171819202122   the same program as in Texas?  That is, if a mistake is          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, you -- you did decide inPhillips that the interest was property, but you have tolook to what the value is.          QUESTION:  Somebody's property or the propertyof -- of the --￼          MR. DELLINGER:  It is the -- it is the propertyof the client, and if there is an -- a way of getting netinterest to the client, these rules require it.Now, several of the examples suggest --QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, does -- Washington has 1   inform the IOLTA program that the money could have earned 2   net interest, and if that's true, the interest comes to 3   you. 4             Now, several of the examples were in a sense 5   more naked wealth transfers.  What's different about this 6   program -- we've -- we've addressed the fact that 7   there's -- this third element of a denial of just 8   compensation is missing, but I do want to address the fact 9   that we don't believe that this is a taking because if you10   apply this Court's Penn Central analysis, all of the11   factors point in the same direction, in addition to the12   absence of investment-backed expectations.13             This is a program that serves an important14   regulatory goal of avoiding the appearance of self-dealing15   by lawyers.16             Now, it -- it raises money for an important17   cause.  And we don't deny the importance of that to the18   program.  It is a cause -- ensuring equal access to19   justice -- which enhances confidence in the system of20   justice, and helps the petitioners and everyone else who21   uses that system.22             But the relevant regulatory interest noted by23   the justices at the beginning of their process is that24   where lawyers are placing funds of their clients in a25   bank, and the banks are in a position to benefit the44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   lawyers, you have a risk of violating one of the first 2   principles of legal ethics that lawyers are not to benefit 3   directly or indirectly from their clients' funds. 4             QUESTION:  So the -- so the property can be 5   misused and the State can take the property.  That's -- 6   that's your formulation. 7             MR. DELLINGER:  That is not the formulation. 8   The -- the funds have to be taken from the bank.  They 9   can't remain with the bank because of the serious ethical10   problem that was noted in the briefing to the justices11   that the banks are earning interest and providing benefits12   to the very lawyers, or in the case the real estate escrow13   agents who placed the money there.  If you can't14   economically return it to the client, if that cannot --15   if that is not economically feasible, and you can't16   ethically leave it with the bank, then it has to go17   somewhere.  It doesn't have to go to IOLTA.  It has to go￼to some charitable use to avoid this ethical problem.          QUESTION:  Why can't -- why can't the private18192021   designate the cause to which they want it to go?  Then,22   they're having control over their property.system design mechanisms so that clients and attorneys can23             MR. DELLINGER:  Well, there are two problems24   with that kind of -- of client control.  One is the tax25   consequences to the client.  If the client directs where45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   the funds go, the interest would be attributable to the2   client.              QUESTION:  Well, I suppose if the client    designated a charity, that would be a charitableAnd secondly, if you --3456   deduction.  Maybe or maybe not.7 8 9          MR. DELLINGER:  That's correct.  It -- it --I think that goes to the right to control, and thegovernment often regulates the right to control one'sproperty, particularly in a heavy -- heavily regulatedindustry such as banking.10111213   I want to get clear on that example.  If there were such a14   designation, leaving the tax consequence aside, isn't --15   isn't it true on the facts under the Washington schemeQUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, in -- in that --￼16   that the cost of identifying the amount that would go to17   the charity would be greater than that amount so that, in18   effect, ultimately the -- the charity would net nothing,19   there would be no tax, a tax return would have to be filed20   saying zero.  Is -- is that right?21             MR. DELLINGER:  That is -- that is precisely22   right.23 24 25          Now, if you -- if you choose to have a law firmdo your transaction, but the client says, I want someother escrow agent, and not the lawyer, then you don't get46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   into IOLTA. 2             But here, I think we have a dispositive flaw in 3   that there is simply no just compensation.  And the reason 4   there is no compensation is that it's actually quite 5   complicated to track and allocate all of these funds. 6   It may seem counterintuitive that you can't allocate that 7   interest back.  But in Texas, for example, if you look at, 8   I think, footnote 2 of the -- of the brief of 49 State 9   bars, in Texas, where they made $5.5 million, it was on10   40,000 attorneys' trust accounts that may have had as many11   as 1 million discrete deposits.  And if we're wrongNow, the --that -- and there's somehow you can allocate it back, youdo so.121314151617   attorneys could choose.  You could choose Save the Whales,          QUESTION:  Well, you could have separate funds.You could -- you could have four different funds that￼or help -- help litigation fee --18192021   required.  I don't believe that the Fifth Amendment has a22   dog in the fight over -- over what charitable use the23   State of Washington chooses when they serve this important24   purpose of making sure that there is -- that there is not25   this ethical conflict.47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Or you can have an injunction.MR. DELLINGER:  It is possible but it is not 1             There are really five different ways that we 2   could win this case, just -- because there are so many 3   pieces on the gameboard. 4             You could conclude that it's not a taking 5   principally because it has a valid regulatory purpose. 6             It's not -- two, it's not a taking because of 7   the absence of any real investment-backed expectations. 8             Three, even if it's a taking, we've established 9   that zero compensation is due.10             Four, even if you think some compensation might11   be due, they've never gone to the State -- not a single12   client -- and tried to prove up the amount of13   compensation, which is very much in dispute if you look at14   their earnings credit analysis, unlike Eastern Enterprises15   where we knew the exact amount, it's very much in dispute16   whether some or all of those costs would have been borne17 down.18             And finally, even if you reject all our other19   positions, you then reach an argument that we don't need20   to make because we believe in our other arguments, and21   that is, why not treat this as a valid revenue measure?22   Unlike the bad revenue measures of Eastern Enterprises,23   where the State, or the Government was imposing a24   retroactive onerous burden on a few identifiable, known25   people, here it's prospective, reasonably broadly based,48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   and raises -- and modest in the exaction.  That looks evenas a financial transaction.          QUESTION:  Courts have the power to tax?          MR. DELLINGER:  I'm sorry?          QUESTION:  Courts have the power to tax?          MR. DELLINGER:  Courts have the power -- and234567   other agencies often -- to impose fees.  That's a State8   law issue, but whether it's an IOLTA assessment, or a user9   fee, or however you want to characterize it, if you look10   at it like that, I'm not sure why it doesn't stand up11   quite well.12             Whenever you're talking about money, you have to13   decide why isn't this just a valid way for the government14   to raise money?  And part of the Takings Clause shares an15   overlap with the bill of attainder and the ex post facto.16   Are you singling out a few individuals retroactively, as17   Justice Kennedy focused on in Eastern Enterprises.

Indeed, it is our answer to the arguments 8   made, the dog-in-the-manger argument that was made in the 9   court below, and the argument made by AARP, that if the10   government wants our money, they should get it the11   old-fashioned way.  They should tax.12             Now, the court said, and AARP said, it's13   inconvenient to tax because that comes with strings.14   That's called democracy.  They don't like the strings.1516171819202122232425And so the bar association and the justices wish toacquire the money.          QUESTION:  May I -- I shouldn't be taking yourrebuttal time, Mr. Fried, but are you saying that if theydid this by a statute, it would be perfectly okay?          MR. FRIED:  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm sayingthat if they did it as a --          QUESTION:  -- as part of the revenue code.          MR. FRIED:  -- as a tax -- if they did it as atax because it --          QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me the program was50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. FRIED:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.Just a few points.  First, this is not a revenue￼ 1   exactly the same, it was adopted by a legislature, and had 2   the title tax on it. 3             MR. FRIED:  Because in every jurisdiction and 4   certainly in the Federal Government, taxes have to jump 5   over certain hoops.  There are institutional constraints, 6   and it's exactly those constraints that the justices and 7   the bar associations want to escape.  They have told us 8   so.  It's all -- 9             QUESTION:  I'm not sure I know the answer to my10   question.  If they did exactly what I said, would it be11   permissible?12             MR. FRIED:  It would be an entirely different13   question.  I wouldn't want to concede it, but it would be14   a different question, and a harder one because this Court15   has granted greater leeway to tax, and the reason it has16   is because taxation is a recognized institutional form17   with lots of institutional hurdles that the respondents do18   not wish to endure.  They wish to do -- do an end run19   around them.20             Now, as to the regulatory purpose here, I think21   it's sufficient to note that prior to IOLTA, there were22   plenty of regulations -- both of escrow agents and23   lawyers -- to prevent them from self-dealing, and lawyers24   were disbarred if they violated them.  This IOLTA measure25   was passed, and it was passed only as a way to raise funds51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   for legal services.  So I think that the regulatory 2   purpose is an after-the-fact invention. 3             Now, also we do not say that it is impossible to 4   value the taken here -- the amounts taken.  It's perfectly 5   possible.  It's $5 and $2.  It's simply impracticable to 6   force Brown and Hayes to sue for it.  That's the 7   impracticability.  It's not impossible.  We do not say 8   that.  And that's why cases like Kimball Laundry are 9   completely beside the point.10             QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, may I ask you another11   question that is troubling me about this, in addition to12   the question of is it really the bank whose -- whose13   economic gain has been taken?  But this is a question14   about the -- the class sets involved.  Now, I know this15   isn't a class action, but the injunction is going to be to16   cover everyone in this group.  And some of them may be17   outraged by this and others may say, we'd much rather that18   IOLTA get it than the bank.  So there's something19   troubling about an injunction that's going to cover all of20   these people who may have very diverse views about what21   they would like to see happen.22             MR. FRIED:  Yes, and the solution for that is23   the political process rather than the process of judges24   and bar associations raising revenue.  And under the25   political process, the result you describe happens all the52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   time.  It should not happen here. 2             QUESTION:  I'm not sure I understand that 3   answer.  If the choice is between the banks and IOLTA, and 4   some of the people say we don't want to prefer the bank, 5   we want to prefer IOLTA.  You're -- you're making the 6   choice for them in saying, you have to prefer the bank 7   because we're enjoining it. 8             MR. FRIED:  Well, we're enjoining it -- we are 9   asking you to enjoin it because it is an illegal program.10   The result of the injunction, or a -- a declaration would11   be what you described.12             QUESTION:  Mr. Fried, you may have another13   minute if you didn't get your rebuttal through.14             MR. FRIED:  No.  I -- I think that's --15             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you.16             MR. FRIED:  -- sufficient.  I thank the Court17   for its attention.18             (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the19   above-entitled matter was submitted.)20212223242553Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
