Hendrickson.      Ms. Ward.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARDON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. WARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The core of the liberty interest protectedby due process is the right to be free from unjustifiedbodily restraint and harm.  It's hard to imagineanything more inconsistent with these core rights thanthe use of a weapon on a restrained detainee, and thatis why Respondents urge this Court to import asubjective intent element that doesn't relate to dueprocess, but is instead drawn from the test forviolation of a convicted prisoner's Eighth Amendmentrights.      Respondents candidly admit that they favorthis test because it better insulates guards fromliability, but that is no reason to ignore meaningfulconstitutional distinctions between those who have beenconvicted and those who have not.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 safety of the detainee, why isn't that just a facet of3 the use of excessive force? I think that's how the4 district court treated it.5 MS. WARD: The ­­ the safety of the detainee6 was the stated objective for the use of the force in ­­7 in this case. And that is a legitimate interest, but8 the determination of whether the ­­ the force itself was9 excessive is based on the Bell test for legitimate10 purpose, legitimate penological objectives. So then the11 test is objectively, then, whether or not the use of12 force was excessive to the state ­­ stated need and the13 Fourth Amendment test provides a ­­ a ­­ a good familiar14 workable standard that can be used to determine that15 question.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You ­­ you mentioned the17 Fourth Amendment now, but as I understand it, the18 complaint just alleged a due process violation. It19 didn't ­­ it didn't refer to the Fourth Amendment.20 MS. WARD: That's correct, Your Honor. And21 ­­ and the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process22 test as articulated in Bell does provide the clearest23 application by the Court of the rights of detainees in24 the prison context.25 And the Court has stated that Bell doesAlderson Reporting CompanyWell, why isn't the4￼Official5￼1 apply to the excessive force claims of pretrial2 detainees and it makes perfect sense because, like a3 prison policy that goes too far, it's easy to see how4 a use of force can be administered as punishment.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So suppose you have a6 detainee being held in a prison population. And ­­7 is ­­ is your point that the prisoners can be punished,8 but the detainee cannot be?9 MS. WARD: That's correct, under the ­­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Now ­­ now ­­11 now suppose the prisoners are misbehaving. They're12 unruly. They're yelling and throwing things at the13 guards and the guards say, alright, lockdown for 2414 hours; you can't go to the mess hall. Now, the detainee15 raises his hand and says, Oh, excuse me. I'm a16 detainee. I ­­ I have a different standing.17 Is that your ­­ is that what has to happen18 here.19 MS. WARD: Yes, but –­ but the problem with20 the hypothetical is that the ­­ that's a legitimate21 penological objective. So under either test, neither22 the prisoner ­­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was my next question.24 So there can be punishment for simply not ­­ in order to25 maintain discipline within the prison population. YouAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial61 can be deprived of your exercise or your right to go to2 the mess halls. So you can, quote, "punish" for that3 purpose, even if it's a pretrial detainee.4 MS. WARD: If it's a pretrial detainee,5 you ­­ you can discipline for ­­ to enforce legitimate6 objectives. If it's a convicted prisoner, even harsh7 conditions are ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You use the word9 "discipline;" I use the word "punish." Are they the10 same?11 MS. WARD: They're not the same. Punishment12 is the end result of application of the Bell test.13 Discipline is what happens to you if you fail to follow14 the rules.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it doesn't matter if16 the ­­ if the punisher, so to speak, is simply an17 individual guard at the prison versus the ­­ the State,18 which will run a prison that it knows has these cruel19 guards. It doesn't matter. The ­­ the tortification of20 the Due Process Clause, right?21 MS. WARD: Right. It ­­ it doesn't matter.22 And, in fact, guards are probably entitled to even less23 deference than prison administrators who are making24 policy for the Court. In footnote 38 of Bell, the Court25 acknowledged that ­­ or suggested that individual￼Alderson Reporting Company      MS.

What ­­ what is the rationale for why they should be different?MS. WARD: The rationale for why they should be different is it's a ­­ it's an after­the­fact analysis. And the Constitution requires that detainees not be punished. And it allows ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.

WARD: I think the difference is8 punishment is the result of applying the Bell9 rationally­related test. If use of force is not10 rationally related to a legitimate objective, we can11 define that as punishment. If the act complained of12 fails the Bell test, objectively, we can call that13 punishment.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But even ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm having a problem16 with trying to understand why we're talking about a17 difference between any of the Amendments, the Fourth,18 the Fourteenth, or the Eighth. The cruel and unusual19 punishment, I thought, was generally ­­ generally20 applicable to the sentence a prisoner receives.21 That's very different than to the22 application of ­­ of force separate from the ­­ from the23 sentence. We're talking about whether and under what24 circumstances a prison guard or a prison is liable for25 using unnecessary force on another person.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      I don't think that taking any prisoner andfor no reason ­­ arbitrary reason banging his head onthe wall because you think that'll send the message toother prisoners would be acceptable, do you, under anyof the Amendments?MS. WARD: That's correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I ­­ I just don't quite understand the difference. I think the issue is one, how ­­ how you instruct the jury. And the government is saying you instruct the jury by saying you have a subjective intent to punish the prisoner ­­ you just want to beat him up; or you're inflicting harm that's not necessary or reasonable for a legitimate penological reason, correct?MS. WARD: That's correct. That's correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have a different standard than the government?MS. WARD: We do, Your Honor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Then yours is broader.MS. WARD: Well ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And explain why. Why is the government standard not good enough?MS. WARD: I misspoke. I'm sorry. I misspoke. We agree with the government as to what theAlderson Reporting CompanyMS. WARD: We ­­ the Solicitor General on thewe are in agreement withstandard.What if ­­ what if I don'tOfficial      JUSTICE SCALIA:agree with the Solicitor?  Is there anybody here toargue for a different standard?  No?  We ­­ we just haveto pick between two people who argue for the samestandard, right?MS. WARD: I ­­ I ­­ I believe the Respondents have a different standard in mind, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Okay.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it possible ­­ I hadn't thought about it too much ­­ that you would have different priorities in training, depending on whether you're dealing with people who've already been convicted of crimes and people who are being detained, like, perhaps people who have been convicted tend to engage in particular activity more than people just awaiting trial?MS. WARD: I think the detainees can be asAlderson Reporting Company10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425appropriate standard is, but we disagree with thegovernment as to how the standard was improperly appliedin the jury instructions in this case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That I ­­ I understand. I'm just talking about the standard now.Official11￼1 dangerous as prisoners. But as to your point about2 training standards, currently, as the amici former3 corrections officers point out, they are trained to an4 objective standard. And it's ­­ it's difficult to even5 comprehend how you would train officers in view of6 particular subjective maliciousness element. Do you ­­7 do you explain to them how they can use force as long as8 they're not malicious, as long as they never admit to ­­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know ­­ of10 course you're not going to say you can't act with ­­11 with malice, but it would seem to me if the standards12 are broader with respect to people who have been13 convicted, you might tell the officers, look, you have14 more flexibility with respect to people who are already15 subject to a conviction. You have to be ­­ you phrase16 it the other way ­­ you have to be more careful with17 respect to people who are simply being detained.18 But it's very complicated in a case like19 this because the Respondents make a very persuasive case20 that the convicts are actually less of a threat than21 the ­­ often than the pretrial detainees. You go to ­­22 you're going to go to jail if you've got 10 days on a23 DUI or something like that, but the people who are24 detained preconviction may be multiple murderers.25 MS. WARD: That's certainly true. TheyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial12￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425certainly may be dangerous folks who are deserving of ­­you know, in the prison context, if they're dangerousand ­­ and discipline needs to be imposed, that's ­­that's a possibility.  The ­­ the question is:  How dowe evaluate their excessive force claims after the fact?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I still go back to my question: Why is there a difference at all? What you seem to be suggesting is that gratuitous violence, unnecessary violence, can be directed to pretrial and post­trial detainees. Isn't your objection that unreasonable, unnecessary force is not permissible? Why are we giving a license to prison guards to use unreasonable or unnecessary force ­­MS. WARD: We are ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ against anybody? MS. WARD: I think I understand yourquestion, Justice Sotomayor.  Convicted prisonersactually can be punished.  That is one of the legitimateobjectives with respect to convicted prisoners.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they can't be punished corporally. They can be denied good credit ­­ good time credit. Do you think we could put them ­­ you can knock them against the wall as punishment?MS. WARD: No.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not ­­ not in terms ofAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial131 discipline. It may be that some matter, immediate need2 justifies that action, but are you suggesting that as￼3 punishment they could do it4 Unnecessary, not punishment5 They ­­ they looked ­­ they6 word to the prison officer.7 MS. WARD: The egregious use force will fail8 both tests.9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's what I wanted10 to ask about. As a practical matter, in evaluating11 excessive use of force claims, how much difference does12 it make whether there's a purely objective standard or a13 subjective standard. It will be the rare case, I would14 imagine, where there's direct evidence of the officers'15 subjective intent. So the subjective intent is going to16 be inferred from objective factors.17 So what ­­ give me an example of an excessive18 use of force claim that would involve the unreasonably ­­19 a use of force that's objectively unreasonable, but there20 is not the subjective intent to harm.21 MS. WARD: Mr. Kingsley's case might be just22 such an example. It was unreasonable for him to be23 Tased, and under our jury instructions, the jury well24 could have found that that use of force was25 unreasonable. But yet the subjective element that wasAlderson Reporting Companyfor unnecessary force?­­ or even punishment.­­ they said the ­­ a badOfficial141 injected to our jury instructions could have made it ­­2 it could have resulted in the ­­ the finding for the ­­3 the verdict for the Respondents.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in a case where5 there's ­­ where the jury thinks that there was force6 that was objectively unreasonable, and in particular, if7 it's a ­­ if it's a 1983 claim or a Bivens claim, where8 the officer has qualified immunity, it doesn't seem to9 me that there are going to be very many cases where the10 difference between these two standards will result in a￼11 different outcome. Am12 MS. WARD:13 that juries give a lot14 they can ­­ if they're15 subjective good faith as part of a response to the16 elements for proving the ­­ the case by the ­­ by the17 prisoner, that would result in a lot more findings and18 verdicts in favor of guards, even in instances where19 objectively unreasonable, unjustified force is used.20 In the – in the21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how you could22 use excessive force ­­ unreasonably excessive force and23 be acting in good faith.24 MS. WARD: Well, there's the issue ­­ the25 issue of qualified immunity with respect to mistake ofI wrong?I think you are wrong.  I thinkof deference to officers.  And ifallowed to inject theirAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial6 qualified immunity until we know and until the officer7 knows the standard.8 MS. WARD: Yes.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY:And as of this point, I – 10 I do not know why the standard should be different for11 convicts as opposed to pretrial detainees, other than12 for purposes of rehabilitation. And even that has to be13 reasonable. You want to us say that under these facts,14 the result might be different, depending on if it's a15 pretrial detainee or an inmate, and that's just very16 difficult for me to understand why that should be.17 MS. WARD: It's ­­ it's ­­ using the18 objective test for a pretrial detainee is faithful to19 the Constitution. It's faithful to due process. Due20 process talks about deprivations of life, liberty, or21 property. Deprivations are X. The Eighth Amendment,22 which governs the use of force with respect to convicted23 prisoners, talks about cruel and unusual punishment.24 There's a ­­ there's a ­­ an inherently subjective25 element to cruel and unusual punishment.Alderson Reporting Company15￼1 law. They could believe that the law actually allows2 for them to engage in whatever use of force that3 they're ­­ that they're using, but ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But no ­­ but we're asking5 what the standard ought to be. We don't talk aboutOfficial161 JUSTICE KAGAN: But ­­ but Ms. Ward, you've2 said a few times that we're supposed to be looking to3 see whether something counts as punishment. And in the4 Eighth Amendment context, we've suggested that that term5 "punishment" does indeed have a subjective component;6 that it requires some kind of intent to chastise or to7 deter. So I'm a little bit with Justice Kennedy, that8 I'm not quite sure what the word "punishment" is doing9 in this context, but if we're looking for punishment, we10 have indicated that punishment is a subjective concept.11 MS. WARD: Yes. In the Eighth Amendment12 context, because the word "punishment" appears in the13 Eighth Amendment, but as it's used in Bell, it's14 referring to X. It's referring to evaluation of prison15 policies or uses of force that go too far.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you ­­ you ­­ you17 brought punishment into this discussion. We didn't.18 Justice Kagan didn't. Your brief is full of references19 to punishment. You say it's punishment that's bad.20 You ­­ you want to abandon all of that? That's ­­21 that's not the criteria?22 MS. WARD: No, that is the ­­ that is the23 criteria.24 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand it,25 either. It seems to me that there is some circumstances￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial171 where a guard is trying to punish someone, but there are2 many circumstances where a guard has something totally3 else in mind. He's trying to keep order in the prison.4 A policeman might try to stop a fleeing felon. That has5 nothing to do with punishment.6 And so what a guard ­­ normally, the7 provision that governs the policeman is the Fourth8 Amendment. I would guess that if you're talking about9 trying to keep order in a prison, the Due Process Clause10 may have something to do with it. This person who may11 be awaiting a lawyer is there, his liberty confined, and12 you cannot use excessive force.13 I – I don't see what punishment had to do14 with it. But I ­­ but I did think, and I don't know the15 answer, but I looked it up in the Model Penal Code, that16 either the policeman who's trying to stop someone, or17 perhaps the prison guard who's trying to keep order,18 cannot use excessive force.19 Now, what is excessive force? It is force20 that is objectively unreasonable. Now, suppose he does.21 The next question is: Is a state of mind required? We22 can imagine ­­ it would be a weird case ­­ but we can23 imagine a very weird case where the force is objectively24 unreasonable, but the policeman is totally innocent.25 Somebody told him, that is a Taser, but it's really a￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial181 gun. He uses it. Objectively unreasonable. State of2 mind, innocent. Is he liable?3 As far as I can tell, the government thinks4 he should be. As far as I can tell, you think he should5 be. End of case. We just say everybody agrees. Is6 that where we are? Because I'm rather worried about7 holding the policeman in this weird case, where his8 state of mind is a hundred percent innocent. What here9 happened is that they read in a little bit of10 culpability, the least onerous subjective intent. It's11 called recklessness. You have to be aware of the risk.12 So I'm rather tempted to say, yes, there should be13 something guilty about this policeman. Now, there's14 where I am at the moment, and I'd like you to explain15 where I should go.16 MS. WARD: The Fourth Amendment doesn't17 require any inquiry into the subjective state of mind.18 And the Fourth Amendment test, in the case of a police19 officer on the street, does the job adequately. It20 provides the adequate amount of deference, and it ­­ it21 protects people from excessive uses of force. That same22 analysis can do the job in the prison situation when a23 pretrial detainee's interests are at stake as well. A24 subjective intent element shouldn't be required of the25 test at all, because that only comes in when there is a￼Alderson Reporting Company15 MS. WARD: It's okay for the standards16 different, because it's more faithful to the17 Constitution. It's okay for the analysis of the18 excessive force claim in both situations to beto beOfficial19 different, and ­­ and I will ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ­­ I'm still21 struggling because we're trying to create boxes in22 that makes no sense to me. There are all sorts of23 reasons for doing things, and the Eighth Amendment24 that we have, have to do with punishment qua not25 bringing control, not responding to a prison outbreak,Alderson Reporting Companya waycases19￼1 question of cruel punishment.2 JUSTICE BREYER: At least in a prison, I3 would think a prison guard would have a pretty tough4 time thinking that if this person is in prison because5 he's been convicted of a crime, I can try to control his6 riotous behavior as long as I reasonably believe that7 what I'm doing is correct, even if it turns ­­ but now I8 have a totally different standard, where this person's9 in the same cell, doing the same thing, but he hasn't10 yet had his trial. He's just there waiting for his11 lawyer or he's been there because bail has been denied.12 I ­­ I don't see how you administer such a rule.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the answer to that?Official20￼1 or a fight, or anything else, but the types of2 conditions that are imposed on prisoners as punishment,3 i.e., you've broken an administrative rule, and now4 we're going to put you in shackles in the dark dungeon.5 We've already said in one case you can't do6 that. You may subjectively and legitimately think that7 that will keep you constrained, but that's too far.8 It's not ­­ it's unwanted and unnecessarily cruel and9 unusual. All right?10 MS. WARD: Yes.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's very12 different than this situation. Whether it's a pretrial13 detainee or post­trial detainee, I don't think the14 Constitution gives you a free pass to punish a prisoner15 by inflicting unwanted corporal punishment. I'm not16 talking about the conditions of ­­ of punishment; i.e.,17 good time credit, solitary confinement, segregation of18 some sort, deprivation of a prison job you have. That,19 clearly, you need an Eighth Amendment, sort of20 subjective intent element.21 I'm talking about the use of force for22 purposes of restoring discipline. That's what this was23 about, wasn't it?24 MS. WARD: Yes.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I keep saying why areAlderson Reporting CompanyYes.6 MS. WARD: And can I respond ­­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:8 MS. WARD: ­­ briefly?9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:Sure.We'll ­­ we'll giveOfficial10 you an extra minute since ­­11 MS. WARD: Thank you.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:13 intruded on your time.14 MS. WARD: Thank you.15 The Court could decide that the standard for16 all excessive force cases should be an objective17 standard. I think that the ­­ the jurisprudence related18 to convicted prisoners has already shut that door that19 require ­­ in requiring a subjective intent element for20 a convicted prisoner, but it's more faithful to the21 Constitution to actually give effects to the rights of22 detainees which are much closer to the rights of free23 citizens because they haven't received all of their due24 process pursuant to a legal conviction.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Alderson Reporting Company­­ the Court21￼1 we thinking about the necessity to impose subjective2 standards or any other standards or3 different?4 MS.

BASH      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,    AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCEMR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      If there's one point I would like to conveyto the Court this morning which I think is responsive toa number of questions that were asked in the openingpresentation, it's that there are two relevantdifferences between the standard we're advancing and thestandard Mr. Clement is about to get up and talk about.      One goes to what sort of purpose isrequired, and the other goes to how you establish thatpurpose.      On the first, Mr. Clement says it ismalicious and sadistic intent.  We say it is a punitivepurpose.  It is clear as day in the Court's EighthAmendment cases, Farmer, Wilson, Whitley, that maliciousand sadistic comes from the wantonness requirement ofEight Amendment, cruel and unusual.He is just wrong about that. The only argument he has on that ­­ that it should be malicious and sadistic is Judge Friendly's opinion that this Court cited in a couple Eighth Amendment cases. But if youAlderson Reporting Company1920 bring2122 it as232425 talked about it like that, but it's not exactlyJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just into the due process analysis ­­ MR. BASH: Justice Scalia,that you want toyou characterizeOfficial231 look at Judge Friendly's analysis ­­ this is on page 282 of the red brief ­­ he very clearly says that there's a3 whole list of factors relevant. Malicious and sadistic4 is one factor. It's not dispositive, and all of the5 other factors are objective.6 So I don't think you can extrapolate from a7 few citations to Judge Friendly that malicious and8 sadistic is appropriate for a due process claim for9 someone who has not convicted of an offense.10 And by the way, I think ­­￼11 JUSTICE SCALIA:12 right?13 MR. BASH:14 JUSTICE SCALIA:15 case, and it's not an Eighth Amendment16 right?17 MR. BASH: That's correct.18 Scalia ­­This is a due process case,It ­­      It's not a Fourth Amendmentsubstantive due process, and ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.MR. BASH: ­­ I think a couple cases haveAlderson Reporting Companycase; is thatNow, JusticeOfficial241 substantive due process. I mean, the rule this Court has2 established is that before you go through the procedures3 of the Bill of Rights conviction or a guilty plea and so4 forth, you may not be punished. So it really sounds a5 little more in procedural due process than I think your6 question gave it credit for.7 Now, the other point is how you establish8 that purpose. Under the Eighth Amendment standards this9 Court has set forth, it has interpreted cruel and unusual10 punishment to require a degree of subjective intent.11 Although it has used the term "punishment" to describe12 the general legal standard under the Due Process Clause,13 of course, that clause does not say the word14 "punishment."

And24 as this Court interpreted that in the context of25 convicted prisoners, it's that convicted prisoners mayAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial301 be subject to hasher conditions than pretrial detainees.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's ­­ so it's okay3 to use excessive force in the case of a prisoner,4 somebody who has been convicted? I mean, the question5 here is did ­­ what did the police ­­ was it6 objectively unreasonable to use the extent of force that7 was used in this case. So are you saying that in the ­­8 in the case of a convicted prisoner, that it would be9 okay to use excessive force?10 MR. BASH: Well, it probably almost always11 violate the Eighth Amendment if there was an actual12 intent to punish, and the punishment was carried out by13 the use of force.14 But I think often what we're talking about15 is these cases on the margin, where the officer maybe16 had mixed motives or whatever. And the idea behind the17 Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is that we're going to18 amp the standard up when you're talking about someone19 who is subject to the penological force of the State.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give us an example21 of what a guard could do to an inmate and a guard could22 not do to a pretrial detainee, other than for23 rehabilitation purposes?24 MR.

BASH: That's certainly not what we're2 saying. What we are saying is that the prohibition on3 what officers can do to convicted prisoners is they4 cannot punish them cruelly and unusually. And it makes5 sense that this Court has upped the subjective intent6 standard with respect to convicted prisoners because it7 reflects that the constitutional prohibition is only8 cruel and unusual punishment. Here is a ­­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bash, would you10 explain?

Can you explain how your bottom line15 is the same as Respondent, but your standard is the same16 as Petitioner?17 MR.

CLEMENTON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This Court should adopt ­­ adopt thesubjective test fashioned by Judge Friendly in Johnsonagainst Glick in addressing a due process claim forexcessive force by a pretrial detainee.      This Court has already adopted that standardin the Eighth Amendment context for convicted prisoners,and both doctrinal and practical reasons stronglysuggest that it should apply the same test in the dueprocess context in which that test originated, and thecontrary propositions are simply not compatible withthis Court's precedents.JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Johnson and Glick, theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial341 bottom line was that there was reliability; isn't that2 so?3 MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Ginsburg. The4 bottom line was a remand so that there could be a ­­ a5 factual determination based on the Four Factor Test that6 Judge Friendly articulated.7 So in the lower courts, they dismissed the8 claim. Judge Friendly recognized that the Due Process9 Clause does provide protection, and then he articulated10 that Four Factor Test, one important part of which is a11 subjective factor that, I think, sensibly tries to12 distinguish those situations where an officer is trying13 to use force in a good faith effort to maintain order14 and discipline and contrast that with a situation where15 the force is being used sadistically or maliciously for16 the very purpose of inflicting pain.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we look at18 this ­­ this case, the conduct was deliberate, using the19 Taser was deliberate. The effect known to the officer20 was that it would cause pain. So what subjective21 element other than when using ­­ I'm deliberately using22 force, I know it will cause pain. What beyond that?23 MR. CLEMENT: So the question is: Is this a24 good faith effort to try to get these handcuffs off, or25 is this somebody who's acting simply to punish the ­­￼Alderson Reporting Company18 that there was a jury trial here, and under a19 standard, they ruled in favor of our clients,20 seems to me that it would be very odd to have21 new jury trial.recklessnessand itto have aOfficial22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go back23 to ­­ that's why I keep trying to go back to what is24 the ­­ what are the ­­ under what circumstances and how25 does your test get to the gratuitous use of violence orAlderson Reporting Companyissue here.     Well, let's put the nubgive you the fact ­­ let's35￼1 the detainee? And I think that's what the good faith2 test really gets to. It gets to what, I think, in some3 respects is the nub of the4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:5 of the issue here. Let me6 use this actual situation.7 The ­­ the defendant says, I wasn't8 resisting, I wasn't spreading my arms apart, I was just9 laying there, and they came and Tased me. All right.10 The officers say instead he was pulling his arms and11 resisting it so we couldn't get the handcuffs open. So12 assuming a jury credits the Petitioner, what would that13 do under ­­ how would that be evaluated under your test?14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I suppose that if the15 jury actually credited Petitioner's versions of events,16 they might be able to find liability under the John ­­17 Johnson v. Glick standard. I think it's worth recognizingOfficial10 going to be given anyway.11 MR. CLEMENT:12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:13 v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow.14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, but I ­­ I don't ­­ I15 mean, I think there are real differences between the16 instruction, and if you look at – the way ­­ the clearest17 way to illustrate this is if you look at Joint Appendix18 page 78 and you look at the instruction that was offered19 by the Petitioners below, it flat out says you can't take20 into account the good faith intent of the officer. It's21 irrelevant.22 Now, I think that's perfectly appropriate in23 a Fourth Amendment instruction where there's objective24 reasonableness, and this Court said a bunch of times25 that the subjective intent of the officer doesn'tBut that instruction isWhat's that?      Under ­­ under the BellAlderson Reporting Company36￼1 the excessive use of violence where it's unnecessary?2 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it gets to it in3 a way that provides a degree of deference to the4 difficult decisions that the guard has to make, which is5 it recognizes that unlike the arrest context in other6 situations, prison environment's different. There are7 going to be lots of situations where guards are going to8 use force and legitimately.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Official37￼1 matter.2 But in the difficult context of a prison, I3 think Judge Friendly got it right, I think this Court4 got it right with respect to convicted prisoners, which5 is you give the guard a little bit of flexibility6 because it's a difficult situation. And if you say7 after the fact, maybe they shouldn't have used the8 Taser, or if, in a case where they used the Taser twice,9 maybe they should've used it once, but not twice, those10 questions of degree ought to be some degree of11 deference.12 This test allows for that. It gives a jury13 a landing place. If they look at this in hindsight and14 say, you know, I wish they hadn't used the Taser, but I15 think they were doing it to get the handcuffs off. This16 isn't a case like Hudson against McMillan where they17 were just taking the guy out and beating him up18 punitively. So I don't think there should be a19 Constitutional violation here.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true ­­ you21 know, what you say is equally true where you're running22 a jail, isn't it? And it's equally true where the23 person in the jail is ­­ has been convicted or hasn't24 been convicted. The need for order is the same.25 So how would it apply in a circumstanceAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial381 where there's a claim of excessive force to someone who2 has been convicted, but it has nothing to do with3 punishment. No one thinks it has to do with punishment.4 The situation was one where they were trying to maintain5 order, or the situation was one where they were trying6 to give medical treatment, or the situation was any one7 of a thousand.8 What I can't see is why the punishment9 standard should apply whether he's been convicted or10 not. And I also can't see why they should be different11 whether he's been convicted or not.12 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the punishment13 standard applies in both cases, Justice Breyer, because14 the relevant constitutional text has been interpreted to15 require punishment. In the Eighth Amendment context ­­16 JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you brought a17 lawsuit under the Due Process Clause? I mean ­­ and18 there are instances where people are seized in jail, so19 it was under the Fourth Amendment.20 I mean, why is punishment in these other21 situations? I can't figure that one out. I can't22 figure out ­­ and then I looked at the Model Penal Code.23 The Model Penal Code seems to require both excessive24 force and some kind of state of mind, which could be25 recklessness, which is what the judge said here or maybe￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial39￼1 even negligence.2 MR. CLEMENT: Well, obviously, if you adopt,3 as this Court has in the Eighth Amendment context, the4 understanding that punishment inherently requires some5 subjective mental state, the lowest available mental6 state is recklessness and under that standard, which the7 jury clearly was instructed under, we would prevail. So8 that would lead to an affirmance.9 Now, I would still think, since it is10 well­established that the relevant standard for11 excessive force in cases involving convicted prisoners12 is the Johnson v. Glick standard, I think since that's13 established and nobody here is asking for Whitley or14 Hudson to be overruled, and there are so many practical15 imperatives for treating pretrial detainees and16 convicted prisoners the same, I think this Court should17 apply the Johnson v. Glick standard in the due process18 claims of pretrial detainees.19 In a subsequent case, if the Court wants to20 reconsider what the test should be even under the Eighth21 Amendment and apply it uniformly across pretrial22 detainees and convicted inmates, that may make some23 sense.24 I also think there's some very interesting25 questions lurking out there about what kind of objectiveAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial40￼1 evidence of unreasonableness is enough in an Eighth2 Amendment case, or if we prevail, a Fifth Amendment3 case, what kind of objective evidence is enough to get4 to the jury on the subjective intent question. I think5 those are all questions that this Court may eventually6 have to confront, but I think the first step in a case7 where nobody wants to overrule Hudson and Whitley is to8 suggest that since the imperatives that the officers9 face with respect to pretrial detainees and convicted10 inmates are essentially identical.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why don't you12 tell us why that's so?13 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'll ­­ I'll tell you14 why that's so. And it's so in these ­­ particularly in15 a ­­ in a local jail like Monroe County, Wisconsin,16 where you have these individuals, they're housed side by17 side. As the Chief Justice has alluded to, in this kind18 of jail, the only way you can serve their sentence as a19 convicted individual is if you've been convicted for a20 relatively minor offense. But if you're there pretrial,21 awaiting your trial, any ­­ any ­­ any book ­­ any ­­22 any offense in the criminal book could be your charge of23 ­­ that ­­ where you're being held for, so it could be a24 murderer. And I think this Court has recognized, and25 this ­­ I mean, this is empirically true ­­ this CourtAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial41￼1 has recognized this empirical fact, first in Bell2 against Wolfish, then in Block against Rutherford,3 and ­­ and more recently, in the Florence County case.4 When you ­­5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, sorry. There's6 a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical7 concerns are the same for pretrial detainees and for8 convicted criminals. There's also something to the9 other point of view, which is that in our cases, we've10 consistently said that if you're a pretrial detainee, if11 you haven't been found to have committed wrongful12 conduct, you shouldn't be treated the same way as people13 who have been found to have committed wrongful conduct;14 that for the convicted criminals, it's kind of, you15 know, we're allowed to punish them, because they've done16 something wrong. And we haven't found that yet for the17 pretrial detainees.18 And so what place in your system is there19 for that, you know, very commonsensical, and also, you20 know, normatively attractive proposition that people who21 haven't been found to have done anything ought not to be22 treated with the same level of disregard for their23 interests as people who have been?24 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, there is a25 place for that in the doctrine. I would submit it's notAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial421 in the excessive force cases. So let me tell you where2 I think it is. I mean, Sandin against Conner is a good3 example. There the Court said that with convicted4 individuals, it was perfectly permissible to move them5 from minimum security to maximum security as a punitive6 matter, and you didn't even have to give them any7 process to do that. I don't think that same analysis8 would apply to pretrial detainees.9 Another example is footnote 17 of the Bell10 against Wolfish case, where I think it's understood that11 at least if the statutory law provides for it, that if12 you're convicted, you can be sent out to the work gang13 and have to pick up trash along the highway. I don't14 think you can do that to a pretrial detainee. But15 whatever differences there are, I don't think they arise16 in an excessive force context. I think if you think17 about this Court's cases, and start with Whitley. If18 you're trying to quell a prison riot, and you have an19 inmate who's going up the stairs, trying to go where20 there's an unarmed guard, it doesn't make a whit of21 difference whether that inmate is a pretrial detainee or22 a ­­ a ­­ a convicted individual.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: So that might be, but let's24 take another comparison. And the comparison is two25 people who have been indicted for the same offense, and￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial431 one makes bail and he's out on the street, and the other2 doesn't make bail, and so he is in an institutional3 facility. And the one who's out on the street has some4 kind of encounter with a police officer, and he reaches5 into his pocket to take out something, and the police6 officer shoots him. And let's just imagine that7 circumstances are such that this is utterly8 unreasonable.9 And then the same ­­ the same person10 indicted for the same offense, not convicted of that11 offense, same circumstances, the police shoot him, now12 he's not going to be treated in any respect the same13 way. Why should that be so?14 MR. CLEMENT: I think because the fact of15 incarceration really is a game­changer. When that16 person's out on bail, nobody is going to know that, so17 he has exactly ­­ or she, the exact same expectations as18 any reasonable individual. The same expectations as the19 individual in Graham v. Connor, who's doing nothing more20 than trying to buy orange juice in a convenience store.21 There are rules that apply to that, and they22 should be sufficient and they should be objective, and23 that's the Fourth Amendment standard.24 When you're in the incarceration context,25 things are different. The margin for error for the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial44￼1 guards is quite different. The need to protect the2 other inmates from a potentially violent person doesn't3 have the same kind of direct analogue when something's4 unfolding on the streets. Sometimes it can, but the5 quarters, I think, are ­­ are going to be different, in6 the main, in the incarceration context. And so I think7 it makes sense to apply a standard that's slightly more8 forgiving of the prison guards than of the police9 officers.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I ­­ I still find it11 very hard to understand how use of force can be excessive12 without being at least reckless. It's ­­ it's confusing.13 For excessive use of force, but yet what ­­ what does the14 reckless add to it? If ­­ if it's an excessive use of15 force, isn't that at least reckless by definition?16 MR. CLEMENT: I think often it will be.17 We're not here to defend the recklessness instruction as18 the platonic sort of form. We actually think that19 applying Judge Friendly's instruction from Johnson20 against Glick is the right way to go, which we think21 provides a little more separation between the two.22 I don't think, though ­­ I mean, we can ­­23 we can obviously come up with hypothetical situations24 where there are going to be different applications. I25 think the principal difference here is this instruction,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial45￼1 both in the Eighth Amendment context, and in the due2 process context in Johnson v. Glick, I think it gives3 the jury a practical landing place when they think, you4 know, with the benefit of hindsight, I wish the police5 ­­ I wish the corrections officer hadn't done that, but6 I don't think it was completely outside of the bounds of7 what was reasonable. I certainly don't think it's so8 purposeless and so arbitrary that it gives rise to an9 inference that it had a punitive motive.10 That gives the jury kind of a reasonable11 landing place, and I think this case is actually a12 pretty good illustration of this. I think if you look13 at this and you ask yourself, was it reasonable to use14 the Taser? That's a debatable question. Was it really15 punitive? Was it unrelated to an interest in trying to16 get the handcuffs off? Of course not.17 And so I do think in cases like this, it18 gives the jury an appropriate landing place to come up19 and make a judgment that doesn't second guess the20 officers. And this Court has said so many times that21 deference to prison officials is an important value.22 And I think this test that we've proposed that, again,23 originates with Judge Friendly in a due process case24 gives ­­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're giving ­­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial46￼1 you're ­­ you're loading the deck completely, because2 you're instructing the jury first to give the police3 officers deference, and then you're now giving them an4 instruction that assumes that whatever they do is okay.5 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so. I think ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, there's no ­­7 there's ­­ by adding that kind of subjective intent that8 you want, maliciousness and wantonness, which are not ­­9 are only one part, as your ­­ as the Assistant Solicitor10 General said, only one part of the Johnson test.11 MR. CLEMENT: But ­­ but if I ­­ if I12 could ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're ­­ you're ­­ the14 way you've articulated in your brief has really loaded15 the deck completely.16 MR. CLEMENT: Well, in ­­ in fairness, and17 to correct the Assistant Solicitor General, the18 instruction we asked for, which is at Joint Appendix 65,19 it has all of the Johnson factors. Now, it focuses, as20 we think ­­ and that's the pattern jury instruction in21 an excessive force case for a prisoner in the Seventh22 Circuit, we think it gets it right, which is it focuses23 the ultimate inquiry on this, is it a punitive intent or24 is it a good faith effort to restore order.25 But then if you look for the factors thatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial471 the jury can consider, all four ­­ all the rest of the2 Johnson factors are there. And we think that's actually3 the best reading of Bell v. Wolfish, too, which is to4 say it provides objective factors, but then it's5 basically asking, you can look at those objective6 factors and it allows –7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that –8 MR. CLEMENT: ­­ you to infer a punitive intent.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Bell v. ­­ Bell v.10 Wolfish, the first part of the application section of11 that opinion goes to whether there's an intent to12 punish. It assumes there's not, and then it goes to the13 objective test and says, in that particular case, that14 the conditions met that ­­ those conditions as well, but15 it treated it as alternative. That's ­­16 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think alternative ways17 to prove a punitive intent. And if you look at Bell v.18 Wolfish, when it talks about those objective factors, it19 then says, so if you have purposeless or arbitrary20 government action, the court may infer an intent to21 punish. So it's objective factors in service of what is22 ultimately a subjective inquiry.23 The other thing I think that needs to be24 added, though, is that Bell v. Wolfish, you know, we25 think we win under it. But it is a test that was really￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial48￼1 designed to judge some conditions questions. And we2 think Johnson against Glick, and we think, in the ­­ in3 the Eighth Amendment context, Whitley and ­­ and Hudson,4 are directed at the unique dynamic that you have in5 excessive force cases.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right that the7 pattern instruction in ­­ in this case, the pattern8 instruction asked only the excessive force question,9 asked the jury to decide whether the force was excessive10 in light of the particular facts and circumstances?11 MR. CLEMENT: Well, okay. So there were two12 pattern instructions, neither of which were used. There13 was the pattern instruction which my friends wanted to14 have, which was the Fourth Amendment pattern15 instruction. There was the pattern instruction that was16 the Eighth Amendment standard that we wanted to have.17 And Judge Crabb essentially split the difference and18 came up with this nonpattern jury instruction that asked19 the excessive force question, and baked in this notion20 of recklessness.21 Now, we think obviously that the lowest22 standard of intent that could be compatible with the Due23 Process Clause is recklessness, and so we think you24 should affirm if you think recklessness is the standard.25 But in fairness, we think the most coherent way toAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial49￼1 approach this issue is to apply a single unitary2 standard to pretrial detainees and post­convicted3 inmates when you're talking about these kind of4 excessive force claims.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, why not look at6 it this way? I mean, you said ­­ and it's really the7 basis of your argument ­­ that being in an institutional8 setting is the game­changer. There's no doubt it's9 important.10 But there's another potential game­changer11 as well, and that is this question of have you actually12 been convicted? Has the legal system found that you're13 a person who is a wrongdoer?14 So if we say that both of these things are15 important, why shouldn't we adopt a set of principles16 that say it is ­­ we're ­­ we're looking for objectively17 reasonable conduct, but in looking for that, of course18 we take into account the prison circumstances. Of19 course we take into account the context in making that20 evaluation, so that the person on the street does not21 necessarily come up with the same result as the person22 in prison because the contexts are different.23 But still, the test, the basic test is the24 same because they are both people who have not been25 found to have done anything wrong.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial501 MR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of responses,2 Justice Kagan. I mean, obviously, you could try to take3 the Fourth Amendment test and you could adjust it ­­ try4 to adjust it for the prison conditions.5 We don't think that that's going to work in6 a way that gives sufficient deference to the prison7 officials. We do think ­­ this Court has said so many8 times they are in a unique environment. It's not9 something that the normal jury is going to have any sort10 of insight into. So I think if you just ask them was it11 reasonable in hindsight, I don't think you're going to12 get sufficient deference. So that's one reason.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: I would think that the jury14 would give a lot of deference to prison officials, in15 part because they are unfamiliar with the circumstances.16 And folks will come in and will say, you know, here's ­­17 I think that there's ­­ that ­­ that that will be the18 natural tendency.19 MR. CLEMENT: I mean, I hope you're right20 for the sake of my clients, but I think that tendency is21 going to be embodied much more if you let them take into22 account good faith. And I think that's a really23 important way of thinking about the question here,24 because if you look at their proposed jury instruction,25 at JA 78, it's the one thing the jury is told they can't￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial511 take into account, is whether there was good faith. And2 that does not seem particularly productive.3 Another point you made was that, you know,4 there is this difference that these individuals are ­­5 have not been convicted. And I do think that's6 important, and I've talked about a couple of instances7 where I think that that makes an outcome­determinative8 difference.9 But you also have to take into account that10 the Bell decision itself said the presumption of11 innocence has nothing, really, to do with this. And I12 think that was a reflection of the reality that when13 the ­­ an institution is trying to deal with pretrial14 detainees and inmates, it's not dealing with different15 entities.16 Another thing I'd like to say about Bell v.17 Wolfish is I do think it's an analysis that applies most18 readily to conditions cases. And there are a number of19 cases we cite in footnote 9 of our red brief involving20 the lower courts' applications of various tests21 requiring subjective intent. There's a D.C. Circuit22 case called Norris against the District of Columbia. I23 paid more attention on rereading it because I noticed24 that Justice Ginsburg had written the opinion.25 It's decided in 1984, and I think it's￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 actually quite instructive because in 1984, the D.C.2 Circuit had the benefit of Bell v. Wolfish. It also3 had the benefit of Johnson against Glick. And when it4 confronted an excessive force claim, as opposed to a5 conditions claim, the D.C. Circuit looked to Johnson6 against Glick and not to Bell v. Wolfish, which it7 doesn't even cite, to provide the relevant standard.8 And I think that just shows that9 Judge Friendly got this one right. He has an analysis10 that of course looks to objective factors in terms of11 the amount of force used, the need for the force, the12 relationship of the two, but also says, was this a good13 faith effort to maintain or ­­ or restore order, or was14 this something that was just sadistic and malicious with15 the intent to cause harm?16 My friends from the Solicitor General17 Office, I guess, don't like the words "salist ­­ sadistic18 and malicious." I looked them up. I mean, they sound19 kind of rough, but they actually ­­ you know, Judge20 Friendly got that right, too. I mean, they're words21 that basically mean exactly what he said in the rest22 of the sentence ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if you really ­­24 MR. CLEMENT:25 intent ­­­­ which is there's noAlderson Reporting Company52￼Official1 JUSTICE KAGAN:2 MR. CLEMENT:3 JUSTICE KAGAN:4 Judge Friendly test ­­ and I guess you've talked about5 this before, but it is a multifactor test where the6 question of sadisticness is counting as a plus factor,7 a thumb on the scales. But it's clear under that test8 that even if that sadistic quality isn't there, it's9 still allowable to hold the prison official to have10 violated the law.11 MR. CLEMENT: I ­­ I don't think that's the12 right reading of it, which is I think the ultimate13 question under that test, and that's certainly the way14 it's been applied by this Court in the Eighth Amendment15 context, and you see that in this pattern jury16 instruction that we propose.17 The ultimate test is, is this a good faith18 effort to maintain order, or is this an effort to19 inflict punishment just for the sake of punishment? And20 then the rest of the factors inform that as, of course,21 they always would.22 And I think one way of thinking about the23 question before the Court in this case is that this24 Court has already borrowed the ­­ the Johnson v. Glick25 factors that were due process factors ­­ they've already  ­­ if you really ­­­­ other than to cause harm.Alderson Reporting Company­­ want to take the53￼Official54￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425borrowed them and used them in the Eighth Amendmentcontext.      And the question in this case is should theytake that due process test and apply it in a due processcase?  And that doesn't sound like a difficult question,and I really don't think it is.  I think this Court gotit right in Hudson and Whitley.  You think about thosecases.  Whitley, it wouldn't matter whether or not thatindividual going towards an unarmed guard was pretrialor post­conviction.  But in Hudson it's the opposite.  Imean, Hudson is this case where you have somebody who issingled out for a punitive beating in response to analtercation with the guard.Again, it makes no difference. That's not acceptable behavior, whether or not they are an inmate who's been convicted or pretrial detainee. Applying one test to both of these very similar individuals seems to be the appropriate response.If there are no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ward, 4 minutes.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARD       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMS. WARD: Thank you.Justice ­­ Justice Kagan got it exactlyAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial55￼1 right. The institutional setting is not the2 game­changer. The game­changer is the fact of lawful3 conviction pursuant to due process. That's ­­ that's4 the ­­ the dividing line between the right test and the5 wrong test.6 Justice Ginsburg also was looking at7 recklessness in our jury instructions, and you ­­ you got8 it right also. Disregard ­­ reckless disregard of9 someone's rights has no place in a jury instruction that10 should be objective.11 And I want to step through the jury12 instructions because we part ways with Mr. Bash on the13 jury instructions in particular. If you look at ­­ part14 of the confusion comes in in the three different uses of15 recklessness in the jury instructions, as the dissent16 below noted. There's three different ways that17 recklessness is used.18 If you look at 277 of the Joint Appendix,19 the first use of recklessness is that force is applied20 recklessly. Well, here we're asking whether force is ­­21 force is less than deliberate if you look at how force22 applied recklessly is ­­ is used in Farmer, for example,23 deliberate indifference. You're looking at ­­ you're ­­24 you're conflating deliberate indifference with a25 deliberate act. That's confusing.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial56￼1 And Question No. 1 of the special verdict2 questions, excessive force means force applied3 recklessly that is unreasonable. So the ­­ again, this4 is what I was talking about, force applied recklessly;5 that's also not deliberate.6 And then the ­­ the plaintiff is required to7 prove each of the following factors by a preponderance8 of the evidence. Factor 2 is the reasonableness test.9 Factor 3, which is in addition to the reasonableness10 test, is reckless disregard of plaintiff's safety, which11 is, again, a different use from acting recklessly.12 And ­­ and it's that reckless disregard for plaintiff's13 safety language that the Court said in Farmer was14 unquestionably related to a culpable state of mind.15 And then if there's any question about16 whether reckless in our jury instructions were related17 to a bad intent, the third use of recklessness, which is18 on 278 about halfway down the page, acted with19 recklessness disregard of plaintiff's rights. The jury20 instructions defined that specifically not in the ­­ the21 special verdict itself, but in the ­­ the instruction on22 punitive damages, which is found on page 281, where the23 court said to the jury that an action is in reckless24 disregard of plaintiff's rights if, under the25 circumstances, it reflects complete indifference to theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial57￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plaintiff's safety or rights.  If you find thatdefendant's conduct was motivated by evil motive orintent, unquestionable bad intent related to thatelement of reckless ­­ or that version of recklessnessthat was used in the jury instructions.      If the Court has no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
