Unitedand 11-5721, Hill v. United States. Mr. Eberhardt.ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. EBERHARDT: Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court:argument States,OfficialThe judges of the Seventh Circuit are unanimous in their belief that this case raises a good question. And, of course, that good question is: Why would Congress want district courts to continue to impose sentences that were universally viewed as unfair and racially discriminatory?My colleague sitting on the other side of the podium, I submit to the Court, does not answer that question. Petitioners feel that the answer to that question can be found in the text of the Fair Sentencing Act. And while we admit that there is no express answer, the text gives us the required fair implication.(10:19 a.m.)may it￼10-­The text in section 8, the text in sectionJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Is a fair4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 implication enough? You're talking here about a repeal,2 essentially, of an earlier provision, section 109. And3 our cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear4 implication, unquestionable implication.5 Do you think this is really clear and6 unquestionable?7 MR. EBERHARDT: No, it is not, but the8 standard from this Court, Justice Scalia, is fair9 implication, and it has been ever since Great -- the10 Great Northern case. It -- the standards began -- I'm11 sorry -- as a necessary implication in Great Northern,12 moved to plain and clear implication in Hertz and13 Woodman, and then Marrero, which is relied on heavily by14 amicus.￼1516 statute17 section181920 removed 2122 that's a standard that this Court has not accepted. And23 this is based on the provision, the well-settled24 provision, that an earlier Congress cannot bind a later25 Congress.5CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the itself says "express," right? Talking about 109.MR. EBERHARDT: That is correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we're pretty far from the language of the statute, I guess.MR. EBERHARDT: But, again, ever since 1908,Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, and I understand that. But presumably -- we also have the proposition that Congress, when it enacts legislation, knows the law. They would have known section 109 required an express statement if they wanted to apply the change retroactively. So, why shouldn't we hold them to that standard?MR. EBERHARDT: The answer is no, I don't believe that Congress felt that that was the standard. Again relying on this Court's jurisprudence that said you give us text and if we are able to find that the fair implication and the intent of Congress through that fair implication is that this new statute applies, because an earlier Congress cannot bind the newer Congress -­that the -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on your statementJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it -­Official￼JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- one Congress cannot bind a later Congress, do you mean we're not supposed to look at 109? We're not supposed to look at the Dictionary Act?MR. EBERHARDT: Oh, absolutely, the Court is, Your Honor. And we acknowledge -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, then -- so, then the6Alderson Reporting Company12 1314 do you have15 quite a few16 implication"?Official1 fact that 109 is on the books is relevant. And -- and2 it's not a question of one Congress binding the other.3 It's a question of what the second Congress did.4 MR. EBERHARDT: Yes, 109 is relevant, but5 it's the standard to be employed in determining whether6 or not there's a fair implication of what the later7 Congress meant.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really troubled by9 "fair implication" -­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're right that if -­11 you're right -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Scalia. JUSTICE SCALIA: How many -- how many cases that say "fair implication" as opposed to that say "clear and unquestionable￼1718 you rely on? 1920 Marrero -­ 2122 right?232425Marrero? Is that -- is that the one caseMR. EBERHARDT: JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. EBERHARDT: JUSTICE SCALIA: MR. EBERHARDT:7Fair implication fromFrom a footnote in Marrero,Correct.Yes. Anything else?Marcello.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Marcello? Where -- what's2 the cite for that?3 I mean, there are a lot of earlier cases4 that make it clear when you're repealing a prior statute5 if it isn't express, it has to be at least a clear6 implication. And I'm -- I'm astounded to think that in7 a footnote, we're suddenly going to change that to8 simply "fair implication."9 MR. EBERHARDT: Yes, Your Honor. You're10 correct, a clear or a necessary, but Petitioners contend11 that not only do we meet the fair implication12 standard -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different14 question. And we can talk about that. But how did15 Marrero come out? Did it -- did it find an overruling16 or not?17 MR. EBERHARDT: Marrero primarily was based18 on the fact that there was a specific provision for19 nonretroactivity. In an alternate holding, the Court20 held that 109 would also be relevant to the decision.￼212223 overcome by 2425Marrero, though, was a habeas -­JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it did not find 109 fair implication, right?MR. EBERHARDT: Correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's entirely dictum,8Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425right? Andalternativeway. The holding was that 109 governed. No?Officialdictum in a footnote.MR. EBERHARDT: No, I believe it is an holding, because the primary holding in -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was the otherMR. EBERHARDT: I'm sorry.JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said the holding was that section 109 governed, that it had not been repealed.MR. EBERHARDT: 109 was the alternative holding, saying that 109 would also preclude theretroactivity provision.JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And, therefore,whatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of 109 was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not repealed. So, even if fair implication was the test, it was not the test applied and determinative in the case. So, it's dictum. And dictum in a footnote.MR. EBERHARDT: I don't agree, Your Honor. JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's true of all ofthe cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or three that use "fair implication." The Court in all those cases found that there was no fair implication, so that 109 governed.9￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Isn't -- isn't that so?That was true in Marrero. It was true in Northern Securities.MR. EBERHARDT: In Marrero, the primary holding was based on the fact that there was a specific provision for nonretroactivity.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in none of the cases that used the fair implication language did the Court say: And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.MR. EBERHARDT: Correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you're relying on a standard that this Court did -- must have considered appropriate because it deviated from the words of the statute. It said it a few times. But in application, it always came out the same way.MR. EBERHARDT: Well, in application, when the Court applied this in Marcello, when they were weighing the language of the Administrative Procedure Act as opposed to the language of the Immigration and Nationality Act, I think the Court made clear, as it went through the statute there, that there was a fair implication. And then once you get to the point of fair implication, it necessarily means that there is some kind of an ambiguity.And then the Court followed up saying that10Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 we then did2 legislative3 find.4look to the legislative history, and the history backs up the implication that we didOfficialJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was not true of 5 the 109 cases. You don't have a 109 case that said the6 standard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old7 statute is not enforced.8 MR. EBERHARDT: Directly? I don't believe9 so.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if -­11 JUSTICE ALITO: What do -­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if we13 stick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed,￼14 looking for15 there isn't1617 provision, but obviously, we also contend that going18 back to the proposition that an earlier Congress cannot19 bind a later, that that standard has been rejected even20 though argued by my colleague to my left. That is no21 longer the standard ever since -­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure he's23 arguing that. I think he acknowledges, as our opinions24 say, that it can be done by implication, but it has to25 be clear and unmistakable implication. I think that's11an express provision, do you agree thatany here?MR. EBERHARDT: We agree there is no expressAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the position he's taking.2 Anyway, you want to tell me why this is3 clear and unmistakable?4 MR. EBERHARDT: When you look at the5 language of section 8, when Congress has mandated the6 Sentencing Commission to use their emergency authority7 to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions8 and applicable law, it makes clear that Congress meant9 this needs to take effect as soon as possible. Congress10 even said11 90 days."1213 regard to14 be sentenced, because there would be so few individuals15 who would be arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced16 within that 90-day period that Congress could only -­17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there might be a few,18 but there -- but assume that you're drafting this19 legislation and you want it to apply only to defendants20 who commit an offense after the enactment of the Fair21 Sentencing Act, but you also want to do everything that22 you reasonably can to make sure that when the very first23 one of those defendants comes up for sentencing, there24 will be new sentencing guidelines in effect that are25 geared to the new lower mandatory minimums rather than12"as soon as practicable and no later thanThis would be meaningless, actually, with the individuals who were in this pipeline to￼Alderson Reporting Company1 the old sentencing guidelines in effect.Official23 not require4 as possible56789 and it doesn't matter if a few -- a few defendants whoWould you not provide that the -- would you the Sentencing Commission to act as quickly to get the new sentencing guidelines out? MR. EBERHARDT: No.JUSTICE ALITO: No?MR. EBERHARDT: Because of the -­JUSTICE ALITO: You would say take your time10 are -- who commit the offense after the enactment of the11 Fair Sentencing Act come up and they are -- they're12 subjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing13 guidelines?￼1415 the average16 be at least17 to trial, it's going to be much more than that. So,18 there really need be no rush on the part of Congress to19 condense this down into 90 days. They could go through20 their usual 120-day -- or 180-day procedure, submit21 these to Congress, wait for approval or disapproval, and22 things like that.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are we just supposed24 to assume that Congress knows that? I mean, if you had25 asked me how long is the usual time from conviction13MR. EBERHARDT: No. I think it's clear that time from charging to sentencing is going to 11 months. In a case where a defendant goesAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 or -- I mean, arrest to conviction, I wouldn't know if2 it's closer to 90 days or 11 months.3 MR. EBERHARDT: I think we do, Chief4 Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice. We have to know that5 Congress --6 individuals78 mean -- and9 know that we can readily assume they know details suchCongress knows that because these are the who drafted the Sentencing Reform Act. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right. But I we assume Congress knows the law. I don't10 as that and evaluate their -- what would your position11 be if the Congress said do this as soon as practical12 but, in any event, no later than 8 months from now?13 Would we then think there's a fair implication that14 Congress meant it to apply retroactively or not?15 MR. EBERHARDT: On just the point of the16 immediacy placed on by Congress, I think that would take17 away from the fair implication that Congress meant that18 it -- the law should go -- or the law should be19 effective on the date of the President's signature.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you pick the date21 that the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it -­22 if what -- if the guidelines, the 90-day period that the23 Commission came out with its new guidelines on24 November 1st, that's some time after August 3rd, which25 is when the Sentencing Act. So, on your theory, why14￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 isn't the right date the date that the Sentencing2 Guidelines went into effect?3 MR. EBERHARDT: The correct date is the4 August 3rd date, Your Honor, because of the intent of5 Congress made known through the implication of the6 language taken in the legal context of the Sentencing7 Reform Act. When Congress meant to correct their error,8 I believe they made it perfectly clear that they meant9 to correct this error as soon as possible. This has10 been an error that had been discussed for 25 years and11 was finally 1213 the rest of 14trying to be corrected.And, Mr. Chief Justice, if I might reserve my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR. EBERHARDT: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.￼15 1617 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN18 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT19 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS20 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it21 please the Court:22 The Fair Sentencing Act manifests the23 requisite fair and necessary implication that Congress24 intended that its new mandatory minimum thresholds apply25 in all sentencings after the date of the Act.15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think it's a2 clear and unmistakable implication -­3 MR. DREEBEN: First of all -­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if we're going to5 argue about the language?6 MR. DREEBEN: I do, Justice Sotomayor.7 Although this Court has not used the words "clear and8 unmistakable" to describe what it takes to overcome of9 the presumption by section 109, it has used the10 words -­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, generally the word12 "express" incorporates "clear."13 MR. DREEBEN: There's no dispute here, I14 don't think, that there's a -- a lack of an express15 statement in the Act. But -­￼1617 that defeat 1819 explained in his concurring opinion in20 Lockhart v. United States, one Congress cannot impose21 standards of how another Congress is to enact22 legislation. The subsequent Congress is free to choose23 how it will express its will in the language or24 structure that it sees fit. And I'd like to give an25 example -­16JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that -- why doesn't your case?MR. DREEBEN: Well, as Justice ScaliaAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so then we -- we ignore the Dictionary Act?MR. DREEBEN: No, of course not, Justice Kennedy. These -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And we ignore 109?MR. DREEBEN: No. It provides a background presumption that overcomes the common-law rule of abatement, under which, if Congress had amended a statute, all prosecutions under the prior statute would be deemed to be a nullity and they would -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why doesn't it -­ why doesn't that bring us right back to what 109 says? MR. DREEBEN: This Court has made clear innot only the section 109 cases, but I think, as my colleague mentioned in Marcello v. Bonds, that there are no magical passwords that Congress has to use to explain itself.And let me give an example because I think that it will help to put in focus why I think the Fair Sentencing Act does contain the requisite implication. If Congress had written in the Fair Sentencing Act, henceforth, after the date of this Act, probation officers shall prepare presentence reports and submit them to courts in which they shall calculate the mandatory minimum penalties under the standards17Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425announced in this Act, I think this Court would draw the structural inference that it did not intend that probation officers prepare that information for nothing. They intended that it be prepared so that sentencing courts would use those new mandatory -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, and I think we would come out that way. I think you're entirely right. But the accelerated -- the direction to the Guidelines Commission to promulgate the guidelines on a -- on an emergency basis is not, as you just put it, for nothing. It has -­MR. DREEBEN: I agree with that, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA: As Justice Alito was suggesting -­MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it has some effect. MR. DREEBEN: I don't disagree with that. JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it -- it's notcomparable to what you've just said.MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it is becausethere's a piece of the -- that -- that section that I'd like to draw the Court's attention to, because I think that it critically explains what the Sentencing Commission was supposed to do. Section 8 is all over18Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the briefs, but I have it in the Government's gray brief2 at page 10a.3 This is the section that directs the4 Sentencing Commission to promulgate new guidelines and5 to exercise its emergency authority -- and I'm going to6 quote here -- "to make such conforming amendments to the7 Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission deems8 necessary to achieve consistency with other guidelines9 provisions and" -- here's the critical phrase -­10 "applicable law."11 That phrase, "applicable law," can only mean12 sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act, which are13 the provisions that increased the thresholds of￼14 quantities15 sentences.1617 they apply18 admittedly19 convicted,20 applicable212223 them, but it does not -- it does not deprive that24 language of all meaning.25 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I want19necessary to trigger the mandatory minimumJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. But it -­ that applicable law to those, as you say, few people who have been prosecuted,and are now being sentenced under that law.MR. DREEBEN: But -­JUSTICE SCALIA: There may not be many ofAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 to put this in the structural context of the Sentencing2 Reform Act. The Sentencing Reform Act directs courts to3 apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines that is4 in effect on the day of sentencing. It's not a time of5 offense rule; it's a time of sentencing rule.6 And there -- that means that everybody who7 comes before the sentencing court after the date of the8 Fair Sentencing Act when the new guidelines are in place9 will have those guidelines applied to those defendants.10 Those guidelines are supposed to be conformed to11 applicable law. The only applicable law that there12 could be is the new mandatory minimum standard.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, you're begging14 the question. The -- the law applicable to pre- -­15 pre-statute offenses continues to be the prior law, and16 the applicable law to offenses that have occurred after17 the enactment date is the -­18 MR. DREEBEN: But that would mean,19 Justice Scalia, that the guidelines would not be20 conformed to applicable law for the defendants who are21 sentenced after the FSA. They would be conformed to22 inapplicable law. And Congress knew when it set up23 section 3553(a) that the guidelines that would be24 applied are the ones that are in force at the time of25 sentencing.20￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial12 90 days? I3 ratio under4 throughout?5 that had been changed and changed it throughout the -­6 the sentencing provisions?7 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it was a little bit more8 complex than that, because what -- what the FSA did was9 two things: It lowered the mandatory minimums by10 increasing the crack thresholds, and it targeted role in11 the offense of the defendant for increased sentencing12 and mitigating factors for decreased sentencing. And13 the Commission had to translate that into new14 guidelines.15 It acted quickly. It was told to act as16 soon as practicable. It was entirely possible under the17 statute, and probably would have been desired by18 Congress, that new guidelines would have gone into19 effect on August 4th. At that point, the only people in20 front of the sentencing court would have been pre-FSA21 offenders.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but how -- how many23 are we talking about, say, a 3-month period? How24 many people commit -- most people -- everybody pleads25 guilty. They're caught quickly and sentenced quickly -­21CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why -- whymean, the Commission basically just took the the new Act and applied it, didn't they,They took the mandatory minimum formula￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DREEBEN: Not necessarily.JUSTICE BREYER: I know not necessarily. That's why I want your estimate of how many we're talking about.MR. DREEBEN: Well, roughly speaking, there has historically been about 5,000 crack offenders a year. So, that means that come -­JUSTICE BREYER: And how -- how long historically, roughly, if you know, does it take from the time the person's caught till the time he's sentenced, when he pleads guilty?MR. DREEBEN: We put in the brief the figures from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which indicate that the median figure is around 11 months, but -­JUSTICE BREYER: Eleven months?MR. DREEBEN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: But how many of -- you seewhat I'm trying to get at. I'm trying to get at a guess, if you like, of how many people we're talking about. The two numbers that I can't find in the briefs are roughly -- if your opponent is correct, and it only applies to new people, this thing. That's the applicable law. In other words, you're assuming the answer -- in your answer to Justice Scalia, you're22Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425assuming the answer.I haven't heard an argument for it, exceptthat there are very few people that his interpretation or the opposite interpretation would catch. And how many are there?MR. DREEBEN: I'm reluctant to guess, Justice Breyer.JUSTICE BREYER: About? I mean, is it more like 10, or is it more like 50, is it more like 100? Can you make a guess at all?MR. DREEBEN: Well, let me put it this way, Justice Breyer -­JUSTICE BREYER: All right -­MR. DREEBEN: I think that there -- there will probably be thousands of crack defendants who will be sentenced under the old mandatory minimums that Congress repealed because they were perceived as being racially disparate and unfair and -­JUSTICE BREYER: It isn't obvious to you what I'm trying to get at.MR. DREEBEN: Well -­JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you see what I'm trying to get at? I guess -­MR.

DREEBEN: -- the numbers -­JUSTICE BREYER: But you're saying it wouldbe absurd to think that this section 8 has to do only with prior -- the pre-enactment offenses. Absurd, all right? If there's just likely to be one person, I tend to buy your absurdity argument. If there's likely to be 500 or 1,000, I'm much less certain.MR. DREEBEN: I'm not making an absurdity argument, Justice Breyer. The argument that I'm making is that when Congress directed the Commission -­JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. DREEBEN: -- to conform the guidelines to applicable law, the only applicable law that it could have had in mind -­JUSTICE BREYER: No, that argument -- of course, they could have had both in mind. They could have had applicable law for the new people is our new statute; applicable for the old people, you don't need any amendment, we're not talking about that, just apply the old law.MR. DREEBEN: But they don't -­JUSTICE BREYER: That made perfect sense. MR. DREEBEN: But the Sentencing ReformAct -- it doesn't make perfect sense, because the24Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Sentencing Reform Act is set up to apply new guidelines to people based on date of sentencing.JUSTICE SCALIA: New guidelines to what people? That's the issue.MR. DREEBEN: Everyone.JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's only new -- you're begging the question again.MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't believe so, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA: If it's -- if it's only to people who have committed their offenses after that Act, then you have one set of applicable guidelines for those people, and you leave in effect, for people who committed their offense before the -- the enactment date, the prior guidelines. I don't think there's anything necessarily implied by -- by this provision to the effect that -­MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- there is only in the future one set of guidelines applied, you know, one guideline fits all. I don't think that's -­MR. DREEBEN: Let me refer to the statute because the statute answers this question differently than the way Your Honor has assumed it works. Okay? On page 30a of our appendix, we reproduce section 3553(a),25Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 and 3353(a)(4) establishes that when a -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. 30a?3 MR. DREEBEN: 30a -- I'm sorry, 39a.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: 39a.5 MR. DREEBEN: Sorry about that.6 The -- the Sentencing Reform Act provides7 that the applicable set of guidelines that will be8 applied are those that are in effect on the date that9 the defendant is sentenced. This is 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).10 And that provision has been in the Sentencing Reform Act11 since the -- since the time the Sentencing Reform Act12 was enacted. And Congress explained, for those who read13 legislative history, that it wanted -- and I am going to14 quote here from the legislative history: "The15 guidelines and policy statements to be applied are those16 in effect at the time of sentencing."17 Congress's reason for that was it wanted the18 most sophisticated statements available that will most19 appropriately carry out the purposes of sentencing, and20 to impose a sentence under outmoded guidelines will21 foster irrationality in sentencing and would be contrary￼22 to the goal 2324 which is -­ 25of consistency in sentencing. So -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: What is section 3742(g),MR. DREEBEN: That provides that if a case26Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 is reversed on appeal and sent2 the original set of guidelines3 date of the initial sentencing4 exception to the general rule.5 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this about6 your argument? Because I do think the one you're7 stressing now is a -- is a good argument and your best8 one. But what troubles me is that an earlier bill, H.R.9 265, which contained the provision that says "there10 shall be no retroactive application of any portion of11 this Act" contains the very language that you're12 stressing now.13 So, how do you reconcile that?14 MR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all,15 Justice Alito, what that bill would have done is16 postpone the effective date for 180 days so that there17 could be synchronicity between the guidelines and the18 new mandatory minimums. The retroactivity that it was19 concerned about would have reopened final sentences.20 There's no question here about reopening final21 sentences. So, that bill was explicit: We don't want22 to reopen final sentences.23 The Government is not asking for reopening24 of final sentences.25 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. But27back for resentencing, that were applied at the shall be used. It's an￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425wouldn't you want -- the problem that you're -- maybe -- I understand your argument to be that the language you're stressing now will mean, if this applies only to post-enactment offenders, that there will be defendants who will be sentenced to -- under the -- under old -­ under the old mandatory minimums but the new guidelines.MR. DREEBEN: Correct.JUSTICE ALITO: Would that not occur under the -- clearly occur under H.R. 265?MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so, because that -- that bill was designed to postpone the effective date for 180 days.I think everyone in Congress understood that these guidelines had undermined the credibility of the criminal justice system for years. The Sentencing Commission had four times submitted reports to Congress that bemoaned the fact that they were not only inconsistent with the purposes of -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But I mean -- yes, that's very nice, but let's talk about text, not what about the emotions of Congress.This section that you quoted, (a) -- what, (4)(A)(ii) -­MR.

DREEBEN: No, I'm saying that the18 background principle that our legislators are familiar19 with the law surely applies to sentencing law; and20 Congress understood that once the new guidelines were in21 effect, which it wanted to happen as soon as22 practicable, they would be applied to all defendants in23 the system based on time of -- of sentencing, not time24 of offense. And it wanted those guidelines to be25 conformed to applicable law.29JUSTICE SCALIA: It was in effect -­MR. DREEBEN: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: It was not the amendment. MR.

DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, may I20 answer the question?21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.22 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, what's23 unique about this context is that there's a confluence24 between the way that the guidelines treated crack and25 the way that the statutes treated crack. And for years,30￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Sentencing Commission had said: We can't fix this problem with the guidelines alone; we need the help of Congress to alter the mandatory minimums.And once you do that, give us emergency authority so that we can put new guidelines into place that will work hand-in-glove with the new mandatory minimums, as the Chief Justice explained, so that all defendants who come before the Court will not be subject to the discredited crack policy that Congress had repealed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Estrada.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA,AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENTS BELOWMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I think this is a difficult case for public policy but is not a difficult case for legal doctrine.Fairness is on both sides -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, what's so difficult for a legal doctrine to say that when Congress has made a finding that a law has a discriminatory impact -- because I always thought that when discrimination was at issue, that we should do as speedy31Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 a remedy as we could, because it is one of the most2 fundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been3 repeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws4 should be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way.5 Once Congress has said this law's not being6 enforced in a race-neutral way, we want to fix it, why7 shouldn't our presumption be that the fix is immediate8 rather than delayed?9 MR. ESTRADA: Because I think it would be10 wrong to assume that the passage of the Act reflects11 Congress's concession of intentional discrimination. I12 think it13 Congress14 the law.15does recognize that there were members ofthat had concerns about the disparate impact of￼JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, I've been a 16 judge for nearly 20 years, and I don't know that there's17 one law that has created more controversy or more18 discussion about its racial impact than this one.19 MR. ESTRADA: Absolutely.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't think there is21 any other law that had as much conversation about its22 racial implications than this one.23 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Sotomayor, that is24 absolutely right. But it is very significant that for25 20 years we had this argument. The Sentencing32Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Commission, as the Government points out, went to2 Congress again and again and again to say we don't agree3 with this, this makes no sense. And for 20 years,4 Congress could not bring itself to change it because5 there was no agreement on the part of the lawmakers that6 the public policy was that easy.7 And the fact is you have a whole assortment8 of bills that were considered by Congress in the last9 several sessions. For people who believe legislative10 history is significant, they're all very instructive.11 Most of them did a variant of the same thing. Most of12 them have very identical language, even some of the13 language that's at issue here.14 They had different proposals. There was one15 for 24:1, another one -- there were many one to one. It16 was clear that Congress could not bring itself to an17 agreement as to what the right answer was.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but this19 agreement -­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, I mean, that's21 true, that it took Congress a long time to decide to do22 this. I think the question is, once having decided to23 do this, what did it decide to do; and whether it would24 make sense, once having decided to do this, to have the25 guidelines be the new guidelines, but the mandatory33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 minimums be the old mandatory minimums.2 And what everybody understood was that if3 that were the case, if the new guidelines and the4 old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together,5 it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way6 people were 78 to do this,9 it?1011 to that. 1213 points here14 like people15 offense on the same date and may have done so with each16 other we would expect to get comparable punishment if17 they are comparably situated as to criminal history.18 And the -- that the solution that's being urged19 undermines that even though that is exactly what section20 109 says.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have to draw a22 line someplace, and that's inevitable, that -- that some23 people are going to fall on one side. But the point24 about the guidelines and the statute working together,25 wasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines -­34sentenced.And so, the question is, once having decided can't we assume that Congress decided to doMR. ESTRADA: No. Let me give three answersI think, you know, one of the fundamental is that a premise of the law is to treat alike. And people who committed the same￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 they wanted to do away with this distinction and2 Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do3 it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do4 it to the statute?5 MR. ESTRADA: There are two points about the6 guidelines that I think we have to keep in mind, Justice7 Ginsburg. The first one is that they are guidelines,8 especially in the world after Booker, which is the world9 that confronted Congress in 2010. They are guides that10 must be considered by the judge to inform judicial11 discretion. So, in the nature of the guidelines, there12 is nothing inherent in saying that we must have new ones13 that also implies a new obligation of statutory law to14 people whose offense conduct occurred earlier.15 The second aspect of it is that it has been16 part of the nature of a guidelines system for two17 decades that it has been consistent with the decision by18 Congress in some areas to constrain the exercise of19 discretion with mandatory minimums. And this Court has20 recognized that in multiple occasions, in Kimbrough, in21 Neal, in DePierre, any number of cases. And the22 guidelines themselves in section 5G1 recognize that the23 mandatory minimum may trump a lower guideline.24 So, when you have a long history in 2010 of25 rulings from this Court acknowledging, as you said in35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 your opinion in Kimbrough, that this may lead to cliffs,2 et cetera, and you also have a recognition by the3 Commission itself that they have to integrate this4 reality of sentencing law into their own guidelines,5 there is very little basis for an inference that6 Congress in providing new guidelines would have7 contemplated that the effective date of the law would8 change -­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress did say:10 Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines11 to applicable law. The applicable law has got to be the12 new law, because if it were the old law, there's nothing13 to conform. There's nothing that they need to change.14 It's only that this -- section A(ii) makes sense only if15 the applicable law is the new law. Otherwise, the16 Commission doesn't have to do anything to achieve17 consistency.18 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Ginsburg, I am19 prepared to admit for purposes of this case, and I think20 it's probably the right answer, that Congress intended21 that the guidelines had to line up with the penalties of22 the FSA. The question is cui bono? For whose benefit?23 And Congress clearly contemplated for some of the24 reasons that you outlined that the system in the change25 in the statute would not do any good for people coming36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 to be sentenced 6 months later if they still had higher2 guidelines.3 But much has been said here today about the4 90-day window. The 90-day window is irrelevant. The5 really relevant window is the comparison of what the new6 guidelines would have been and when they would have come7 out absent the emergency authority. Absent any8 emergency authority, new guidelines would have come out9 November 1st, 2011, which would have been a good10 15 months after the passage of the FSA. And even under11 the Government's accounting -­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, even13 without the guideline amendment, for those defendants14 who committed crimes after the effective date of this15 Act, they would not have had -- new offense, not old16 offense -- if the day after this Act they committed the17 offense, they wouldn't have had a mandatory minimum that18 required their imprisonment for a certain amount of19 time, because the Act had already done away with the20 mandatory minimum, correct? Or changed the -­21 MR. ESTRADA: For some of them. They have22 changed some of them.￼2324 the amounts. 25JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, changed it, loweredMR. ESTRADA: Some of them may drop from 1037Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to 5, for example, as one of the -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.MR. ESTRADA: -- as one of the particulars.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, those people would not have been bound to a mandatory minimum. And since district courts were not bound to the guidelines anyway, even if there had been no amendment to the guideline, the judges would have known they weren't bound to the mandatory minimum and probably not bound to guidelines that hadn't been amended yet either.MR. ESTRADA: That's correct on both counts.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it would have benefited these defendants no matter what.MR. ESTRADA: That's correct on both counts, but that's -- but that I -- you know, it sort of assumes that the guidelines are systemically irrelevant in all cases, because after an -- after an appropriateanalysis -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, only in cases like this, where we know they have to change because Congress has directed they be changed.MR. ESTRADA: But, look -- I mean, one of the interesting aspects about these cases is that one of the Petitioners, for example, got the benefit of being sentenced at the time that the post-FSA guidelines, the38Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 new emergency guidelines, provided a sentencing range of2 him of 110 to 137. That's -- that's Mr. Hill. These3 are the new guidelines. He was sentenced to a mandatory4 minimum of 10, which is on -- on the lower end of that5 guideline.6 The only reason that case is in the U.S.7 Supreme Court is because, even after the new statute,8 the judge was of a mind that he wanted to use a9 one-to-one ratio. And that's why there's a controversy10 here. But the -- that highlights, you know, the point11 that I'm trying to make and that the Court made in12 Kimbrough, which is that the mandatory minimums tend to13 enforce a species of uniformity in a world in which the14 guidelines are advisory, and they do help uphold, you15 know, the principle that people that committed16 comparable offenses will have some rough comparability.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that begs the18 question -­19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the problem with this -­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I started with, with21 you, which is if we know that this new Congress has22 already determined that those -- that mandatory minimum23 is discriminatory in the way that it had been24 constructed, what would be the purpose of delaying25 implementation?39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 MR. ESTRADA: If Congress had made that2 finding, Justice Sotomayor, I would fully expect them,3 as a citizen, to cut the sentences of everybody who is4 already serving the sentence irrespective of finality.5 And the fact that Congress did not do that, which is a6 proposition on which everybody agrees, I think is7 powerful evidence that the assumption that this8 necessarily reflects a conclusion that the previous9 system was indisputably discriminatory as opposed to10 arguably discriminatory -­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would find that12 extraordinary, that they say it's racist, but we're13 going to leave in effect all of the sentences that have14 previously been -- been imposed. That seems to me very15 unlikely.16 Mr. Estrada, I would like you to explain the17 effect of 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which -- which does seem18 to -- to be sure, it's not in the new legislation, but19 it's the background against which the new legislation20 was adopted, and it seems to require that -- that the21 court use the guidelines in effect at the time of22 sentencing.23 MR. ESTRADA: Right. This is a fight about24 competing background rules. Section 109 is one of them25 and it says the old law shall be applied to people who40￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425committed their offenses while the old law was in force. It is a directly applicable statute to the situation at hand.This purported competing background rule is a rule that simply says a judge shall consider the guidelines then extant. And this is part of the advice that he gets. It implies nothing about the duty to apply -­that. don't -­JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr.MR. ESTRADA: I'm sorry.you're wrong Estrada, youaboutOfficial￼JUSTICE BREYER: Supposethat. I mean, I think when they -- they meant do that considered. Does that change?about it,MR. ESTRADA: I think it would be a radical understanding.JUSTICE BREYER: No. I mean, I think thatwhen they wrote guidelines that look into that.But agree competing MR.3553, they were thinking those were the are going to apply. Do it. Now, I'llif I -- if I reach the conclusion I background rules -­ESTRADA: Justice Breyer -­41Alderson Reporting Companyyou're wrong1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: I agree applicable law doesn't help us, because -- all the time, there are two different sets of guidelines that apply depending upon when you committed the crime. That's very common. All right. So, I agree with you that far.But now I'm worried about -- the last question Justice Scalia asked does, I think, focus this question, because we have not only 109; we have also the -- the one we're talking about now, and that says, normally, you will apply the guidelines in effect even to people who committed the crime before the new statute.MR. ESTRADA: Okay.JUSTICE BREYER: And now, do we have any analogies? Has this ever happened before? Is there -- I can't find out how many people we're talking about. I'd like to know at least are there many other occasions when Congress amended mandatory minimums so there's some precedent? Any?MR. ESTRADA: Justice Breyer, this is a staple of what has happened in the lower courts in a routine application of section 109.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. ESTRADA: My best example -- and please do not think I'm pandering -- is a case called42Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 U.S. v. Smith from the Second Circuit, which -- which2 was authored by then-Judge Sotomayor. And it was a3 comparable case in which Congress had dropped the4 severity of 567 penalty that deals with supervised release.8 And Congress had gone from a world in which9 a violation of supervised release had to be subject to aa penalty.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. ESTRADA: It had to be -- you know, the10 mandatory sentence, to a world in which the statute had11 been changed, to say that it was up in the discretion of12 the judge. By the time the offender came to court, he13 had violated his supervised release. And his argument,14 which was actually a lot more plausible than this one,15 was that before he violated, the law had changed, and he16 was now in effect now coming to the court for a new17 sentencing. Which is exactly analogous to this.18 The Second Circuit had no trouble in saying19 that a routine application of section 109 killed that20 claim because the offense was considered completed at21 the time it was committed; and, therefore, this was a-­22 a claim that simply was not tenable in light of the23 language of section 109. And that, too, is a -- is a24 case where somebody could have said the law that now25 applies is the one that applies to my new sentencing43￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 under the new applicable guidelines.2 Now, I will say another two logical points3 about, you know, the competing rule that the Government4 is urging.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, before you do,6 if I can understand your argument as it relates to7 Justice Scalia's questions -- I just want to make sure I8 understand it. There's a person who has 4.99 grams of9 crack cocaine. And you do not dispute, do you, that10 that person would be subject to the new guidelines,11 which are based on the 18-to-1 ratio rather than the12 100-to-1 ratio?13 MR. ESTRADA: I do not. And -­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So, you do not15 dispute that. So -- so, then we're living in a world in16 which the person who has 4.99 grams of cocaine is17 getting the 18-to-1 ratio, and a person who has 5 grams18 is getting the 100-to-1 ratio that's embedded in the19 mandatory minimums.20 MR. ESTRADA: That is absolutely right, and21 that was the -- the paradox, if you want to call it22 that -- that the government brought you in Kimbrough.23 And the Court accepted that that was the case. It said,24 yes, this leads to cliffs. It leads to a lack of a25 straight line in between all of the possible penalties.44￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 We accept all of that. It is an artifact of the fact2 that Congress at certain points, but not on a continuous3 line, has chosen to constrain sentencing discretion with4 the rough tool of a quantity threshold.5 It is all set out in the Kimbrough case.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, when Judge Easterbrook7 talked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted8 the position that you adopted. But he just said, look,9 there is no earthly reason for this. It's just that we10 can't find a clear enough statement in the statute.11 I guess the question I would ask you is:12 Can you do better than Judge Easterbrook? Can you find13 an earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to14 create this weird halfway system in which, if you have15 4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you16 have 5 grams, another rule applies?17 MR. ESTRADA: I don't think that that's what18 he found inexplicable. I think the -- you know, the19 whole notion of changing it up to a point was more what20 he's saying.21 I can think that Congress has at least the22 rational reason that the Court ascribed to the system in23 its post-Booker way at the top of page 108, I think, in24 the Kimbrough case, where it is that now that we have a25 system in which so much depends on the discretion of the45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 individual sentencer, it is actually salutary to have a2 few points of confluence that work as an enforced,3 although rough, uniformity in the sentences of4 comparably situated offenders.5 If I go back -­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Government is7 arguing and the Petitioner is arguing for a uniform8 rule, the rule that the time of sentencing controls.9 MR. ESTRADA: Right.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that uniformity doesn't11 quite answer it, unless I misunderstood -­12 MR. ESTRADA: No, I think that they are13 competing visions of fairness and of uniformity in this14 case, Justice Kennedy. I am trying to hold, you know,15 the Government to the one they had in the McNeill case16 last year, because the identical argument was made to17 them in the -- on the other side, that it was somewhat18 irrational to apply the better sentence to the person 119 day later versus the person 1 day earlier.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Kagan's21 question concerning what interest is served by your22 position has particular force when we're talking about23 the sentencing judge. The hardest thing -- as we know24 in the judicial system, one of the hardest things is25 sentencing. And you're saying that a sentencing judge46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 who knows the law has been changed, who knows the law2 has been criticized, is nevertheless bound to determine3 that it's fair for this -- for this person to be4 sentenced to the longer term.5 That's a very difficult -­6 MR. ESTRADA: But if I could -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- position to put the8 judge in. Now, I would -­9 MR. ESTRADA: If I could take the -- I'm10 sorry, Justice Kennedy.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Go ahead.12 MR. ESTRADA: If I could take, you know, the13 other side of that argument. One of the reasons why I14 think, you know, the Court should accept that Congress15 contemplated new guidelines but not necessarily take up,16 you know, the Government's view that this is actually17 called for by the very end of that section, applicable18 law, is that the Government looks at this as a world in19 which Congress has now intervened and in effect20 compelled a -- a more linear function of sentencing so21 that, henceforth, I guess the Commission has to conform22 to the -- to the 18-to-1 ratio, and it would no longer23 be open to the Commission, for example, to do what it24 did in 2007, which is we changed our mind; there is a25 mandatory minimum that constrains us, but in light of47￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 the most recent scholarship, we think the ratio should2 be16to1.3 And -- and one of the reasons why I am4 reluctant to urge you to accept, you know, the5 Government's construction, which I can see how they6 would be helped by in future cases, is that I think it's7 very implausible for Congress to have considered this,8 as they say, the centerpiece of the statute and have -­9 have it be the last depending clause of section 8.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. This is -­11 just tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe12 I'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked.13 Think of before the statute. There were two sets of14 people: Those people subject to the mandatory minimum15 and those crack people who -- the mandatory minimum16 didn't matter, but the Commission wrote amendments17 consistent with.18 So, they were tough amendments, though the19 law didn't require it -­20 MR. ESTRADA: Right.21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- to produce consistency.22 Now the statute's passed. Now we have some of the23 pre-Act offenders. Because of the two sets of things,24 section 8 on the one hand and the 3553(g) on the other,25 in respect to those people who were not governed by the48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 mandatory minimum previously but were subject to the2 then-conforming amendments, now will have to be subject3 to new conforming amendments that conform to the new4 thing.5 And that -- because that'll have to be6 because of the combination of the two sections that Mr.7 Dreeben read, the -- all right. Now, if that's so, we8 get to the cliffs that Justice Kagan is talking about.9 And if I'm right so far, we're now back at the probation10 officer example, and it's so odd and so peculiar that it11 is not just 1213141516 ButI-­ 1718 things -­ 19202122 blame you. 2324 to make, Justice Breyer, is that the whole25 the guideline system now has to conform with applicable49a fair -- do you see where I'm going?MR. ESTRADA: Frankly, no. But -­ JUSTICE BREYER: Is that too complicated? (Laughter.)￼JUSTICE BREYER: I don't blame you, frankly. MR. ESTRADA: But let me -- let me say twoJUSTICE BREYER: All right. MR. ESTRADA: You know, the -­ JUSTICE BREYER: I don't blameyou. I don'tMR. ESTRADA: The simple pointI was trying thing thatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 law, which, you know, the Government reads as the new2 ratio and could extend to other things, could3 potentially disable the Commission from adopting its own4 ameliorating amendments that depart from the regime5 of -- of the mandatory minimums. And so, whereas there6 are mandatory minima that are troublesome and give rise7 to cliffs, there are also occasions in which the8 Commission is able to do things that are not consistent9 with the statute.10 Let me give one example that was mentioned11 by the Court in DePierre. As the statute was12 interpreted in DePierre, cocaine base is cocaine base;13 it gets you a mandatory minimum if it's chemically14 based. The Commission thinks that you only get the15 enhanced penalties if the cocaine base happens to be16 crack.17 Similarly, under the Neal case, you get to18 weigh the carrier medium for the LSD, but, you know, the19 Commission thinks that you give it a presumed weight20 that is probably lower than the actual medium. In both21 of those cases, the Commission comes up with guidelines22 that are lower than the methodology that is contemplated23 under the statutory analysis.24 Were you to adopt the applicable law on the25 assumption that the Congress has now dictated that these50￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425things have to line up and never to have cliffs again because they are bad, you could end up having untoward consequences as to what it is that the Commission can do in the future in order to deal with otherinequalities -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, I'm notsure I follow -­JUSTICE ALITO: -- the question -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead, JusticeSotomayor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I follow your example. I think that the guideline regulation is that the guideline -- the Sentencing Commission always has to be -- pass guidelines consistent with the mandatory minimum. And if the statute says that the mandatory minimum requires the -- the carrying medium to be included, the guidelines can't change that. The mandatory minimum would apply.MR. ESTRADA: For -- for purposes of the mandatory minimum, but not for the sentences in between. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But defendant -- I don'tknow that I know of one guideline scheme that changes whatever Congress has statutorily required.MR. ESTRADA: I just gave you two examples:51Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 The LSD guideline that was at issue in Neal and the2 crack guideline that was not at issue but was discussed3 in connection with the statutory interpretation in -- in4 DePierre.5 You know, my point -- I don't want to6 overstate the point. My point is there is reason to7 believe that Congress intended the new guidelines to be8 available for new offenses. The fact that Congress gave9 emergency authority so that that would be possible makes10 perfect sense because in the absence of emergency11 authority, the new guidelines would not -­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. You have to -­13 what you're arguing is not that the guidelines would be14 available for new offenses. What you're arguing is that15 they would be available for everybody except the16 cliffhangers. That -- that's what you're arguing.17 MR. ESTRADA: Except for? I'm sorry.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Everyone but the19 cliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out,20 those people who were subject to the old guideline at a21 higher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a22 lower rate. And so, they're going to get sentenced to a23 lower amount because they're not bound by the mandatory24 minimum.2552￼MR. ESTRADA: But there are -- there are twoAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 alternative worlds after the FSA, Justice Sotomayor. In2 the first one, guidelines don't change for 15 months.3 People who committed the crime after the FSA come to the4 court for sentencing 10 months later and they get the5 new mandatory minimum, but it doesn't matter because the6 old guidelines are higher. It is possible that the7 judge would8 necessarily9intervene and use Booker discretion, but not so.And the alternative world which Congress did10 give us is you change the guidelines as soon as you can;11 if you come to the bar of the court with a pre-FSA12 offense, it doesn't matter, because the new guidelines,13 like every guidelines book since the beginning, say that14 if a mandatory minimum applies, that controls over the15 then-current guidelines, which is one of the fundamental16 reasons why the alternative view of the world and the17 alternative rule of construction the Government proffers18 makes no sense.19 As a pure statutory construction matter and20 for those members of the Court who give weight to21 legislative history, I will point out that the emergency22 authority section that the Government thinks is23 dispositive on this point was in every version of this24 bill -- Senate 1711, Senate 1383, you know, the House25 versions that they cite -- even when those statutes, as53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 Justice Scalia pointed -- I'm sorry -- as Justice Alito2 pointed out earlier, provided an effective date for the3 new statute of 6 months hence. It is -­4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, along those lines,5 could I -- could I ask you this question, which is6 intended to explore the -- the issue whether the7 argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency8 with applicable law doesn't assume the answer that is -­9 that one attempts to get from it?10 Suppose the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said11 expressly this applies only -- the new mandatory12 minimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also13 contained a provision that says the Sentencing14 Commission has to bring the guidelines into consistency15 with applicable law. I assume there what they would16 have to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply17 only to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair18 Sentencing Act would trump this previous provision in19 the Sentencing Reform Act. Wouldn't that be correct?20 MR. ESTRADA: Correct. And I think that21 that would be true here as well. And the reason why I22 was highlighting the earlier bills is because each and23 every one of them had the same, almost word for word,24 "conform with applicable law" emergency authority. All25 of them uniformly said the new mandatory minimums will54￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 not apply for another 6 months after the enactment.2 As a logical proposition, if Congress3 thought that the identical language made sense to bring4 the guidelines into conformity with a law that would not5 take into -- that would not kick in for another 66 months, having it kick in sooner does not have any more7 logical import in saying that, therefore, you know, the8 guidelines now mean that previous offenses get a9 different sentence.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: But could I understand what11 you're saying, Mr. Estrada? Because if Justice Alito is12 right, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing13 Commission has in fact promulgated should not be being14 applied right now to those who committed crimes before15 the enactment date. And that's not what's happening now16 on the ground, is it?17 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Kagan, it is not18 happening in that manner because the guidelines, every19 book of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is20 the first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these21 are the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory22 minimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and23 that becomes the mandatory sentence.24 And so, there has never been any reason to25 have two sets of guidelines to account for cliffs or55￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425mandatory minimums, because every guidelines book has had a built-in solution to that problem, which is we understand that there are cliffs, we understand that there is a world of mandatory minimums; we can't fix those, this is our guideline sentence. If somehow, for some reason -- because it occurred, you know, before or whatever -- there is a mandatory minimum that applies, the guidelines say the mandatory minimum becomes the guideline sentence.So, in that sense, a Congress that knew the law would understand that saying you have to have new guidelines had no logical force in saying that, therefore, the effective date of mandatory minimums or any other factor that bore on the application of mandatory minimums would be changed.Mr. Estrada.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.Official￼CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Eberhardt, you have 3 minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. EBERHARDT: Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Obviously, this Court recognizes the56Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 difficulty of those district court judges sitting and2 asking themselves: What do I do with this defendant as3 opposed to another defendant? And after listening to my4 colleague, Mr. Estrada, I still have to ask the Court to5 consider the question that the Court has been asking:6 What possible reason could Congress have to want a7 district court judge to have to sit back, 5 years after8 the date of enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, and9 impose mandatory minimums that everyone agrees at this10 point are racially discriminatory?11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you could say12 that about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section13 109. I mean, that's what section 109 says: Even though14 we have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty15 should be lesser, even though we've decided, when we do16 that, you continue to apply the bad old penalty to17 people who committed a crime before the amendment.18 Isn't that what 109 says?19 MR. EBERHARDT: It can be, but, as Justice20 Sotomayor recognizes, there has never been a situation21 such as this basically in the history of criminal law22 and criminal law sentencing in our country.23 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd imagine you'd find24 disagreement with that. You know -- you know -- you25 know if -- as a matter of fact, in the year that these57￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 took effect, think of the sentences that were not2 governed by mandatory for crack, not governed by the3 mandatory minimum. Did the guidelines provide, let's4 call it a low sentence, disproportionately low?5 MR. EBERHARDT: Congress ultimately felt6 that they did, yes, because what they -­7 JUSTICE BREYER: And did they change those8 non-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?9 MR. EBERHARDT: The guidelines changed in10 different respects with regard to different amounts.11 The new -­12 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll look it13 up. I'll look it up.14 MR. EBERHARDT: I suggest the Court -- we15 admit that 109 has to be considered in the case, but I16 think to find what was really meant by Congress, after17 the Court looks to section 109, the Court does have to18 look to the 3553 sentence -- or 3553 section, that makes19 it very plainly clear, ever since the Sentencing Reform20 Act, that the date of sentencing clearly is the21 important date, as opposed to the date of the commission22 of the crime.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All those arguments24 have nothing to do with the provision about the25 Sentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any58￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of that, right?Your argument is what rational reason couldCongress have had to -- given the urgency of the problem, the seriousness, why wouldn't they have wanted the provisions to apply as you urged they should?MR. EBERHARDT: But it goes hand-in-hand with the mandate from the Sentencing Commission to put the new guidelines in place as soon as practical, as well as provisions of section 10.Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Eberhardt.Mr. Estrada, at the invitation of the Court, you have briefed and argued this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below.
