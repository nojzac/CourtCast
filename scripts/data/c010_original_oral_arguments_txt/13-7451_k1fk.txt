United States.      Mr. Badalamenti.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. BADALAMENTION BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. BADALAMENTI: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      The natural, sensible and contextual readingof Section 1519 is that the phrase "record document ortangible object" is confined to records, documents anddevices designed to preserve information, the verymatters involved in the Enron debacle.  Given theexpansive Federal nexus of this statute, which is theintent to influence the proper administration of anymatter within the jurisdiction of the United States, itis implausible that Congress would have passed subsilentio, an all­encompassing obstruction statute buriedwithin the altering documents provision of theSarbanes­Oxley Act.      A strong textual indicator that Section 1519is confined to record­related offenses is the inclusionof the unique term "makes false entry in," which3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 Congress only uses in record­related statutes. The2 canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis confirm3 that tangible object is related to the common thread4 between record and document which are information5 devices ­­ information mediums.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should ­­ why should7 the expression "tangible object," which stands alone,8 it's not falsifying documents, why should the word9 "object" in 1519 be treated differently than the word10 "other object" in 1512 ­­ 1512(c)?11 MR. BADALAMENTI: Justice Ginsburg, in12 Section 1519 ­­ it was passed at the same time as13 1512(c) as part of the Sarbanes­Oxley Act. And as this14 Court held in Russello, when Congress includes different15 terms in different statutes passed in the same act, it16 is intended to mean something different.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you think there's a18 difference between "tangible object" and "other object"?19 MR. BADALAMENTI: Yes, there is. The first20 reason is that the inclusion of "makes false entry in"21 indicates that the phrase "record document and tangible22 objects" refers to recordkeeping. Another difference is23 that ­­ a common sense standpoint ­­ is that records can24 only be maintained on tangible mediums. And it's a25 distinguishing factor between "record document" and4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 "other objects" in 1512(c). It's also limited ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But how does the3 Internet ­­ you could falsify Internet entries, or4 things that are in the cloud, those are intangible5 items.6 MR. BADALAMENTI: No, those are tangible7 items, Your Honor, because they are stored on a hard8 drive somewhere. The cloud is not existing above. It's9 merely being housed somewhere else that's accessed10 through the Internet on a tangible device that's11 designed to preserve that very type of information.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose a typewriter13 were used to prepare an incriminating document. The14 document and the typewriter were destroyed, would that15 be covered?16 MR. BADALAMENTI: The typewriter would not17 be. The piece of paper that the typewriter is18 inscribing on is a device that's designed to preserve19 information. It's simply making the information.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I ­­ I understand the21 argument and the argument that you make has considerable22 force about over criminalizing, but it seems to me that23 the test you suggest has almost more problems with24 vagueness, more problems with determining what its25 boundaries are than the government's test.5Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. BADALAMENTI:2 renders 1512(c) wholly superfluous. 1519 ­­ first of3 all, the words "record document" and "tangible object"4 are definitions providing meaning to all of them. The5 government is saying admittedly, "record" and "document"6 didn't need to be there and Congress had no reason to7 put them there because it's everything, it's all8 physical evidence. A record ­­ a tangible object is a9 discrete device. It is a device that is designed to10 preserve the information.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's the ­­ if12 that is the case, then why is it not surplusage? Why ­­13 what would be a tangible object designed to contain14 information that would not fall into the category of15 record or document?16 MR. BADALAMENTI: An iPad, a laptop17 computer, a desktop computer, an iPhone. Those ­­18 JUSTICE ALITO: Those things in themselves19 don't ­­ they have documents,20 could be called a document or21 MR. BADALAMENTI:22 JUSTICE ALITO: If you ­­ if you have an23 iPad that's straight from the store, has nothing ­­ has24 no information stored in that, do you think that would25 fall within the statute?6Alderson Reporting CompanyNo, the government's testthey have something thata record stored in them.That is ­­Official￼1 MR. BADALAMENTI:2 statute because what Congress was trying to intend to do3 ­­ and given the backdrop of the Enron situation where4 massive servers were destroyed or deleted or otherwise5 ­­ they were trying to ­­ to capture the devices that6 held information. And you cannot determine what's on7 the device unless you have the device, regardless of8 whether or not there's information on it or not.9 JUSTICE ALITO: What about destroying a10 brand new empty filing cabinet?11 MR. BADALAMENTI: That is not a device12 that's used to preserve information. That's a container13 of something. It's not specifically designed to14 preserve information. You could put bowling balls in15 a ­­ in a filing cabinet or otherwise. The information,16 the distinguishing factor, Your Honor, between a17 tangible object is that the information is being18 preserved within it, embedded within it, like a computer19 or otherwise. And Congress needed to use the general20 phrase "tangible object" for a reason, because in 2002,21 an iPad, an iPhone, and many other electronic devices22 that preserve information didn't exist, and they ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then the Congress24 could have said used ­­ tangible object used to preserve25 information, and then your case would be solid. But it7Alderson Reporting CompanyIt would fall within theOfficial￼1 just said "tangible object."2 MR. BADALAMENTI: It said "tangible object,"3 that is true, Justice Ginsburg, that it said "tangible4 object." But it did so using that general phrase5 following two specific terms, "record" and "document,"6 which is a classic methodology in which the legislature7 uses ­­8 JUSTICE KAGAN: But could I go back to9 Justice Ginsburg's first question, because, my fault I'm10 sure, but I wasn't sure I understood your answer. Not11 only in 1512(c)(1), but there are, you know, I think12 five times in 1512 from a prior enactment this same kind13 of phrase is used, which is "record document and other14 object." And you say that we should treat that phrase15 as it exists many times in 1512 differently from this16 phrase in 1519 because of the difference between17 tangible object and other object. And to me, it seems18 like other object is, if anything, a more classic case19 of that canon that I can't pronounce the name of,20 ejusdem whatever.21 (Laughter.)22 JUSTICE SCALIA:23 JUSTICE KAGAN:24 on my colleague for.25 (Laughter.)8Alderson Reporting Company Generis.Good.  That's what I countOfficial￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: I ­­ I deserved that.2 But to me, it seems like a more ­­ even a3 more classic case. So I guess I just don't understand4 why you're treating the two differently.5 MR. BADALAMENTI: It is, to answer your6 question, they're being treated differently not simply7 because of the inclusion of the word "tangible," but8 because of the other words surrounding "tangible9 object," like the unique phrase "makes faltering entry10 in," which is not included in any other obstruction of11 justice statute.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But just because Congress13 includes more verbs ­­ I mean, the reason Congress14 includes 20 verbs instead of 4 is presumably because15 Congress really wants to sweep in a very wide variety of16 conduct. And not every verb has to apply to every17 situation. In fact, we rather presume that they won't.18 MR. BADALAMENTI: Although this Court has19 never held that all the verbs, you know, applied to all20 the nouns, it would make sense that they would apply.21 The only instance that the United States points out is22 in an amended statute. This statute was written from23 "Whoever" to the last word of this statute at the same24 time. It makes sense that they all apply. And "makes25 false entry in" is a phrase that can be used only to9Alderson Reporting Company25 MR. BADALAMENTI:It ­­ it does not, YourOfficial￼1 apply to all of the nouns under our particular2 construction. And it's unique. It is only used by3 Congress in record­related statutes.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: So your whole argument here5 really comes down to the fact that Congress put some6 record­related verbs in there?7 MR. BADALAMENTI: It does not, Your Honor.8 There's additional things. We have a limited subject9 matter under our definition, which makes sense because10 you have a tremendously broad nexus to any matter within11 the proper administration of the United States. That's12 unlike traditional classic statutes. It makes sense13 that Congress wanted to narrow the subject matter of14 this particular statute when you're dealing with such a15 broad nexus to any Federal matter.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I would think ­­ I'm17 sorry. I would think that that cuts against you, that18 the fact that this is about any matter within the19 jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows20 that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that21 Congress had a broader set of things in mind. So I22 would think that that's ­­ that's quite the opposite,23 that everything about this statute, the "any matter,"24 the "any record," suggests breadth.10Alderson Reporting Company25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:But you think it could ­­Official￼1 Honor, because if you take the lens and you zoom it out2 a little bit further, if we look at Section 802 of Title3 VIII of the Sarbanes­Oxley Act, it's entitled "Criminal4 Penalties For Altering Documents." Two new criminal5 statutes were created: 1519, entitled "Destruction,6 alteration, and falsification of records;" and 1520,7 which is a 5­year record retention requirement on8 auditors. They were ­­ or else they get a 10­year9 penalty for that.10 Congress was referring, passing these, 151911 and 1520 within Section 802 of Title VIII, as a tandem,12 as another contextual indicator that this is intended to13 apply to record­related matters.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do you ­­ how do15 you respond to the illustration that the government gave16 in its brief? That is, what sense does it make to say17 you can be indicted under 1519 if you destroy a letter18 that the victim that you have murdered has sent you, but19 you can't be indicted under 1519 if you destroy the20 murder weapon?21 MR. BADALAMENTI: Congress did not intend22 1519 to be applied in that situation. And as you state23 the question, Justice Ginsburg, it is remarkable that24 the government would use 1519 in a murder situation.11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 would ­­ let me back up and ask what I assume was ­­ you2 would say yes to. A letter is shredded. It's a letter3 from the victim to the later­turned­out­to­be murderer.4 That letter is shredded. Does that come under 1519?5 MR. BADALAMENTI: That does, because that is6 record related. But the knife does not. That falls7 into the sweep ­­ that particular subject matter,8 because it indeed is a record, so that would be covered9 under 1519, but that ­­ not the knife. Congress didn't10 intend to sweep the knife into 1519, but ­­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where did the ­­ I'm12 sorry.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:14 had the defendant's name on it?

It's an identification on the knife.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but presumably21 the same would be true of a lot of documents or records22 that are destroyed.23 MR. BADALAMENTI: But in ordinary parlance,24 one would not consider an inscription on a knife to be25 it. It's evidence, but it's not a ­­ it's not a12Alderson Reporting CompanyWhat if the knifethat, destroying thea record?not.  One would not,      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:"possible."      MR.

Would the knife fall under that?MR. BADALAMENTI: 1519 and '12(c), it would make more sense that the knife fall in, and here's why. It's a more classic ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if the knife was used in the murder, but it was destroyed before anybody was caught?MR.

BADALAMENTI:Well, it ­­Official￼1 looking at Chapter 73 in total, is that you have this2 incredibly broad nexus to any Federal matter within the3 jurisdiction of the United States. What can the matter4 be? As the amicus briefs point out, any of 300,0005 Federal regulations that the Federal Government has6 placed down upon the American people.7 JUSTICE BREYER: And what is your view,8 given what you've just said, of the best way to narrow9 this statute?10 MR. BADALAMENTI: The best way to narrow11 this statute, Justice Breyer, is to interpret "tangible12 object" in the company it keeps, and that is a device13 that is designed to preserve information such that if14 that device is destroyed, the information contained on15 that device is destroyed.16 JUSTICE BREYER: You still have the problem17 of the language of the statute covering the destruction18 of a document such as an EPA questionnaire that comes to19 the door asking about recycling, where you know that the20 EPA would like to have that back to help them do their21 official work of finding out how the program works.22 You, believing that that's their business, not yours,23 tear it up and throw it in the wastebasket.24 Now, does that fall within the statute?15Alderson Reporting Company12345678 Our ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: But my problem, of course,10 is reading the statute and taking your argument in the11 context that you mean it, which is we must look for a12 way to narrow this statute, which at first blush seems13 far broader than any witness­tampering statute, any14 obstruction of justice statute, any not lying to an FBI15 agent statute that I've ever seen, let alone those16 within Section 15. So what I'd like you to focus on is17 not your problem, though they're connected, but my18 problem.19 MR. BADALAMENTI: Focusing on your problem,20 Justice Breyer, I would say that it is not an onerous21 situation for individuals to retain documents.

This statute's exceedingly broad.25 JUSTICE BREYER:Right.  I see where you're16Alderson Reporting Companyto a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425going.      MR. BADALAMENTI:      JUSTICE BREYER:Let's follow you down that road:  That you say in manysituations it should not be a crime to retain adocument, even though you know that the Census Bureauwould like it back or perhaps the EPA.MR. BADALAMENTI: Uh­huh.JUSTICE BREYER: And perhaps it's nothing more than trying to find out information. But where you end up at the end of the road is that this is void for vagueness, but not for any reason you have yet told us. So what am I to do with the fact, if that is a serious problem, that it has never been argued in this case?MR. BADALAMENTI: Well, I would accept the invitation that it would be void for vagueness, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it vague? It's ­­ it's just incredibly expansive.MR.

From Kolender v. Lawson ­­ Justice Ginsburg wrote it ­­ a penal statute defining the criminal offense, one, with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand. That's what Justice Scalia has just talked about. You can understand what is prohibited.But then there is two: In a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. It's that second part, that the doctrine extends the doctrine to statutes that, while they may be clear, are far too broad, well beyond what any sensible prosecutor would even want to prosecute.Official￼      MR. BADALAMENTI:      JUSTICE BREYER:the question.      MR. BADALAMENTI:would be that perhaps a way to reconcile this statutewould be not only to accept our position that it relatesto recordkeeping generally, but that it requiresspecifically, relates to business recordkeeping, where18Alderson Reporting CompanyThe answer to that, if you Well, I agree with that.All right.  Then back toThe answer ­­ the answer1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425businesses are on notice such as is he filing quarterlyrequirements or otherwise, that they are to do specificthings.  And if you look against the backdrop of theSarbanes­Oxley Act, there is plenty of support thatCongress was targeting businesses, corporations, andpublicly traded companies.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't ­­ isn't running a fishing vessel a business?MR. BADALAMENTI: It would be running a business, Your Honor, it would be. And a possible way to limit this particular circumstance would be to limit it to ­­ to businesses. It doesn't change the fact that "tangible object" doesn't mean everything.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you ­­ can you tell me the exact consequences for your client? Because as I understand it, he was also charged under 22 ­­ what is it ­­ 2232?JUSTICE GINSBURG:But he in fact got what?Official￼      MR.

BADALAMENTI:3 30 days by a judge that made that individualized4 decision under the Booker factors. But we can't count5 on judges being like those ­­ that judge around the6 United States. The fact remains is that ­­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're only arguing8 for your client. This is not some kind of class action.9 MR. BADALAMENTI: No, Your Honor, this is10 just related to Mr. Yates. But the idea is that ­­ my11 understanding is that when the courts are writing the12 opinions, they're thinking about all the judges in the13 United States and providing guidance to all the judges,14 providing guidance to the prosecutors when to use15 particular statutes.16 And if this Court permits that this statute17 be applied for the disposal of all physical evidence18 that would contravene the textual and contextual terms19 and indicators that I brought through throughout this20 argument, it is basically the overreaching broad thing21 that Congress has never passed, despite the government's22 attempt to inject in the Model Penal Code into this23 case, which 1519 looks nothing like the Model Penal24 Code.2520Alderson Reporting Company30 ­­ he ended up gettingJUSTICE KENNEDY:MR.

Liability?MR. BADALAMENTI: A picture? Although Congress didn't intend this in this circumstance, and we would hope the prosecutor wouldn't prosecute for this, it is a permanent account of an event that is preserving the information as to what the pictures ­­ what the fish looked like. So the fish thrown overboard indeed would be a record and would be covered under this statute.But it wouldn't be a tangible object because it's not a device designed to preserve the information.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The photograph isn't?MR.

BADALAMENTI: Although it's not what12 Congress intended, it's what requires that this statute13 read even under our interpretation, which brings up the14 absurdity of this particular case. This underscores15 everything about this case that's absurd, is that the16 prosecutor used this statute in this way. And had he17 thrown a piece of paper overboard that had the day's18 catch logs on it, that would have been covered, and we19 concede that that would have been covered.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, then why is that21 absurd? If you concede that that would have been22 covered, the catch logs, and the prosecutor is trying to23 do the exact same thing, it's just that he's thrown over24 a different piece of evidence, why is that such a crazy25 outcome?22Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, they ­­ it is ­­ thefilm itself is a record.Would its destruction be aYes, it would be.It seems very odd that you1011121314151617 doesn't.

Mr. Martinez.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. MARTINEZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Section 1519's key phrase, "any record,document, or tangible object," unambiguously encompasses24Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 all types of physical evidence. That's clear from the2 standard meaning of those words in ordinary speech and3 from the broader statutory and historical context in4 which those words appear.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why are those ­­ why6 are those the key words? Why don't you start earlier?7 "Knowingly alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, cover up,8 falsify, "those are certainly pertinent in analyzing the9 reach of "tangible object," aren't they?10 MR. MARTINEZ: I think they show that ­­11 that Congress was intending to essentially figure out12 every way that ­­ that someone might imagine tampering13 with or destroying or ­­ or obstructing justice by14 getting rid of evidence, and so they might shed light on15 it.

First of all, Petitioner has conceded that11 1512(c)(1) itself is of general application.

The statute as originally drafted and reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee had a 5­year penalty. Congress looked very closely at that penalty. It was ­­ sorry, it was drafted with 5 years. It was reported out of committee with 10 years, and it was ultimately at ­­ at the suggestion of the House of27Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Representatives, upped to 20 years.JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not talking aboutCongress.  I'm talking about the prosecutor.  What kindof a mad prosecutor would try to send this guy up for20 years or risk sending him up for 20 years?MR.

And9 I think that ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He said it has a stronger11 state of mind element.12 MR. MARTINEZ: It's ­­ the requirement is a13 little bit more rigorous with respect to 1512(c)(1).14 But I think the key point is Sarbanes­Oxley prohibits15 the destruction of fish. You said that, that's been our16 position, and I think that undermines the whole theme of17 his brief and certainly the theme of all the amicus ­­18 amicus briefs that's been ­­ that have been filed here.19 Their whole point has been it's impossible20 to imagine that ­­ that Sarbanes ­­ that Congress could21 have wanted Sarbanes­Oxley, an Enron­related statute, to22 prohibit the destruction of fish, and yet that's the23 point on which we all agree here today.24 I'd like to say a few words about the25 various textual arguments that ­­ that Petitioner has41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 put forward, the nouns, the verbs and the headings.2 First of all, with respect to ­­ with respect to the3 nouns, I think the historical evidence that we've put4 forward, I think, show conclusively that the term5 "record," "document," and "tangible things" is very,6 very similar to the standard formulation that7 essentially everyone has used to cover all physical8 evidence in the obstruction of justice context for over9 five decades.10 Secondly, 1512(c)(1) confirms that the ­­11 the ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Could ­­ could you tell me,13 Mr. Martinez, where are those other provisions?

MARTINEZ: We ­­ the ­­ the key18 provisions that we've pointed to in our brief, there's19 six different provisions of Section 1512. 151220 (a)(1)(b), (a)(2)(b)(1).21 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's okay.22 MR. MARTINEZ: Okay. So there's six in23 1512. There's 16 different State provisions that have24 essentially the same language. I think most of them say25 "record," "document" or "thing." Some of them say42Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 "record," "document" or "other object."2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but ­­ when3 you say this ­­ I understood your friend to say4 "tangible object" is only used in record statutes. In5 1512 ­­6 MR. MARTINEZ: No.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ it's ­­ it's8 "object," I mean tangible ­­ yeah, "tangible thing." In9 1512 it's "object," right?10 MR. MARTINEZ: In 1512 it's "other object."11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, see, the12 reason ­­ I mean, maybe that makes a difference if you13 have records, documents, and then a tangible object14 suggests that the tangible nature of it is what's15 significant, which suggests that it may be one of the ­­16 you know, whatever the drive thing is as opposed to a17 record. And that's a point that's not present in the18 statutes that you were citing.19 MR. MARTINEZ: I think ­­ I think it's true20 that the term "tangible" is different. I think that the21 way to understand the term "tangible" is the way in22 which Congress and ­­ and the rules always use the term23 "tangible" in connection with things or objects, which24 is as a way to refer to all types of ­­ of objects, all25 types of evidence.43Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 We've cited 35 different provisions of the2 U.S. Code and of the ­­ the discovery rules in the3 criminal context and in the civil context. Those are at4 Footnote 3 of our brief. In all of those instances,5 they use the phrase "tangible things" or "tangible6 object" to refer to everything. And so there's no7 reason to think that the addition of the word "tangible"8 somehow shrunk the scope of the statute. And even if it9 did shrink ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there such a thing as an11 intangible object? I'm trying to imagine one.12 MR.

MARTINEZ: I ­­ I don't think that the19 word ­­ I agree with what Petitioner said in his opening20 brief, which is that ­­ that the word "tangible" here21 doesn't really do much. He said that at page 13 of his22 opening brief. When you get to his reply brief,23 suddenly the word "tangible" is doing all this amazing24 work that ­­ and it's the key difference between this25 statute and all the other statutes. So that's with44Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 respect ­­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG:3 to the Model Penal Code as the model for 1519. But the4 Model Penal Code describes a misdemeanor, and this is a5 20­year felony. That seems kind of a mismatch.6 MR. MARTINEZ: You know, if ­­ the tradition7 of ­­ of the degree of penalty to attach to this offense8 has changed over time. As you point out, the Model9 Penal Code did identify this as a misdemeanor. The10 Brown Commission, which built on the Model Penal Code,11 treated it as a misdemeanor or as a felony, depending on12 the severity of the underlying offense.13 When Congress sat down in the '70s and '80s14 and was trying to incorporate, essentially, that15 provision into Federal law unsuccessfully, over a dozen16 times it treated it as a felony. And then, or course,17 Congress in Sarbanes­Oxley Act in both 1512(c)(1) and in18 1519 also treated it as a felony with a 20­year penalty.19 And ­­ and with respect to that penalty, again, I think20 it's important to emphasize that the text that's at21 issue here, any tangible object, that was fixed and that22 was drafted ­­ it was in the bill that was introduced by23 Senator Leahy at the time when it was only a 5­year24 penalty. And there's no reason to think that when25 Congress tinkered with that penalty, it meant to kind45Alderson Reporting CompanyYou, in your brief, pointOfficial￼1 of, by implication, shrink the scope of tangible objects2 that's at issue here.3 And I think just to emphasize the ­­ the4 textual point, it's ­­ it's a very unusual and I think5 it's ­­ it's highly implausible to believe that Congress6 chose this broad and expansive phrase, "any tangible7 object," when really what it really wanted to do was8 refer only to a very narrow and specific category of9 information storage devices.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that11 like the Bond decision? I mean, you had text that could12 be read broadly, and yet we suggested, well, Congress13 could not have meant the Chemical Weapons Treaty to14 cover a minor dusting of ­­ with toxic, irritating15 chemicals.16 MR. MARTINEZ: I think Bond it's ­­ I think17 Bond is actually in some ways helpful to the government18 in this case. Because as I understand the ­­ the Bond19 decision, it turned essentially on the everyday meaning20 of ­­ of the phrase and of ­­ and Federalism concerns as21 well. And the everyday meaning of the phrase ­­ I think22 it was "chemical weapon" in that case ­­ didn't apply23 to ­­ to the chemicals at issue that Miss Bond used.24 But in this case, the everyday meaning of25 the phrase "tangible object" applies to all tangible46Alderson Reporting Company11 asked them that question and12 the fact that ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 a polite answer to either of15 (Laughter).you ­­ you pointed them toI don't think you would getthose questions.Official￼1 objects. Everyone ­­ and if you stop someone on the2 street and ask them is a fish a tangible object, the3 answer would almost certainly be ­­ would be yes. And4 so, you don't have as well what you had in Bond, which5 was the concern about ­­ about Federalism and the6 application of that canon.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if you8 stopped them on the street and said is a fish record9 document or tangible object?10 MR. MARTINEZ: I think if you ­­ if you16 MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, maybe I could say17 a word ­­ having talked about the nouns, maybe I could18 say a word about the verbs in this statute because they19 make a ­­ they place a lot of emphasis on the "makes a20 false entry" language. Petitioner's argument rests on21 this premise that each of the verbs has to work with ­­22 with each of the nouns, but that premise is ­­ is23 flawed. It's not consistent with how Congress drafts24 statutes, it's not consistent with Petitioner's own25 interpretation, and I think there's significant tension47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 with this Court's decision last year in Roberts. Let me2 say a word about each.3 With respect to how Congress drafts4 statutes, I think you only have to look to Section 15055 of the statute to see that that's yet another example of6 where Congress has used ­­ had a bunch of verbs and a7 bunch of nouns and some of the nouns don't work with8 some of the verbs. You can't mutilate oral testimony.9 With respect to Petitioner, the inconsistency with10 Petitioner's own theory, Petitioner agrees that 151911 covers the destruction of an e­mail in electronic form.12 You can't mutilate an e­mail. No one would ever talk13 like that.14 Similarly, he says that it would apply to a15 blank hard drive. But no one ­­ I've never heard anyone16 talk about falsifying a blank hard drive. So the17 implications of his argument are inconsistent with ­­18 with where he wants the Court to go. And then finally,19 the Roberts case. Roberts dealt with a circumstance, it20 wasn't perfectly analogous, but it was ­­ it raised a21 similar problem, which is that there was a broad22 statute, it had many different applications, and there23 was some language in the statute that was a little bit24 awkward and a little bit superfluous with regard to some25 of the applications of the statute.48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And the response that the Court had to that2 problem was not to say, well, the statute doesn't apply3 to those circumstances. The response was to say that4 that's the linguistic price to be paid, linguistic price5 to be paid for having a broad statute. And then the6 Court said Congress does not need to write extra7 language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase,8 applications with respect to which a portion of a phrase9 is not needed. I think that was right in Roberts and I10 think the same principle applies here.11 Finally, Your Honor, with respect to the12 headings, a couple points. First, I think the headings13 in this case as in ­­ as in the Lawson case that this14 Court also dealt with last term also involving15 Sarbanes­Oxley, the headings here are just obviously and16 unambiguously under inclusive. The heading is a17 shorthand reference to the general subject matter. It's18 not intended to spell out what the operative provisions19 say or to mirror those operative provisions. It's20 obviously under inclusive. It omits a whole bunch of21 the verbs. It omits two of the nouns. The heading22 argument, I think, is especially unreliable in this23 context where if you look at what Congress did with24 Sarbanes­Oxley generally, it was not paying very close25 attention to the headings under which it put various49Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 provisions.2 That's true with respect to 1519, that's3 true with respect to 1514, the statute that was at issue4 in the Lawson case, and it's also true with respect to5 Section 1512(c)(1). Section 1512(c)(1) prohibits me6 from ­­ prohibits any person from destroying evidence.7 But they put that ­­ that provision inside the8 witness­tampering statute. It doesn't make sense; it9 doesn't fit there. And that just shows that Congress10 was not paying close attention to the headings and that11 that shouldn't drive the outcome of this case.12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Martinez, you are13 really ­­ I mean, you have arguments on all of these14 points, but you are really asking the Court to swallow15 something that is pretty hard to swallow. Do you deny16 that this statute, as you read it, is capable of being17 applied to really trivial matters, and yet each of those18 would carry a potential penalty of 20 years, and then19 you go further and say that it is the policy of the20 Justice Department that this has to be applied in every21 one of those crazy little cases. And this involved a22 business and a number of fish. What if it was one fish?23 What if it was one undersized fish that was caught by a24 fisherman in a national ­­ on Federal land? This would25 be ­­ would it apply here?50Alderson Reporting CompanyJUSTICE BREYER:MR. MARTINEZ:JUSTICE ALITO:  What about every camper ­­That's what the statute says.Official￼1 MR. MARTINEZ: Your Honor, I want to answer2 that question, but I just want to clarify what I said3 about our policy. Our policy is not that we prosecute4 every trivial matter. That is not our policy. I want5 to be very clear about that.6 JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. But7 if you choose to ­­ if you want to find the guy who8 caught one trout that was undersized on Federal ­­ on a9 Federal ­­ on Federal land, you want to charge him with10 whatever regulatory offense that would be, you have to11 charge this, too, because this is the more severe12 penalty.13 MR. MARTINEZ: We only have to charge this14 if ­­ if the person with knowledge and the intent to15 obstruct the administration of Federal law deliberately16 takes17 it so18 19that one fish and throws it overboard or destroysas to escape liability.2021 he sees the inspector coming toward him, throws it in22 the lake.23 MR. MARTINEZ: That's what the statute says,24 Your Honor. Now, I ­­ I appreciate the force of the25 hypothetical and I understand it, but I think I want51Alderson Reporting CompanyHe catches the fish and nowOfficial￼1 to ­­ the point I want to emphasize, because maybe2 there's ­­ I understand why the Court might have3 concerns about that. The problem ­­ there's a mismatch,4 though, between Petitioner's argument and the5 hypothetical.6 The problem with the hypothetical is that7 this statute might be harsh in certain particular8 outlier applications. But Petitioner is not arguing for9 some sort of de minimis rule, he's not saying that this10 statute can't be applied in trivial cases. He's arguing11 that an entire class of12 scope of the statute ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY:14 doctrinal basis to make15 that there is such a doctrine as prosecutorial16 discretion and, A, that it's enforceable and, B, that it17 has some substance, and you've indicated that it hasevidence is entirely outside the      But he has no ­­ he has nothat argument other than to say18 neither.19 MR. MARTINEZ: I ­­ I think, Your Honor, I20 don't think that ­­ I think prosecutorial discretion is21 not an issue that he's raised. I don't think that it's22 an issue in light of this Court ­­ what this Court has23 said about prosecutorial discretion. I don't think that24 would be a basis ­­25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:52Alderson Reporting CompanyWell, it seems to me thatOfficial￼1 we should just not use the concept or refer to the2 concept at all anymore.3 MR. MARTINEZ: Well, Your Honor, I think4 that ­­ that ­­ again, to go back to some of the answers5 I was ­­ I was giving earlier, I think that the concerns6 that the Court has flagged about the potential breadth7 of this statute, they're serious and they're the kinds8 of concerns that courts and juries and judges are going9 to take into consideration when they're dealing with any10 of these crimes. But the issue in this case is not ­­11 is not that. The issue in this case is what is ­­ what12 did Congress intend with the term "any tangible object."13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if that's14 so, then that's the dilemma. Suppose I worry about15 Justice Alito's single fish in the case of a camper who16 kicks an ember away, knowing you shouldn't have built17 the campfire or picks a flower, knowing you're supposed18 to let wildflowers blossom. What about that 20 years,19 and you could multiply those beyond belief. So if20 that's the problem, does his client go to prison because21 we've just assumed that problem away from the case?22 MR. MARTINEZ: No, we do not ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: How ­­ how do we handle it24 if, as you say, there is a genuine concern in that25 respect, but it wasn't argued here?53Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MARTINEZ: I think that you write a very narrow decision that says this case is about the meaning of the term "any tangible object." And if the case ­­ the ember case comes up or the postman case comes up, then ­­ and if the arguments are made, then I think those arguments can be fleshed out, they can be briefed, they can be thought through by the parties, and I think they'll be properly presented to the Court in that case.      In this case, though, this case presentsjust a common sense, straightforward question ofstatutory interpretation.  Does the phrase "any tangibleobject" actually mean what Congress said?  Does it referto all tangible objects?  We think that the unambiguousanswer based on the text of the statute, based on thehistory of the statute, is ­­ is clearly yes, and we askthis Court to affirm.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps Congress shouldhave called this the Sarbanes­Oxley      (Laughter.)Grouper Act.Official￼MR.

BADALAMENTI      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER54Alderson Reporting CompanyYour Honor.Thank you, counsel.Official￼1 MR. BADALAMENTI:2 Justice Breyer's question regarding the void for3 vagueness, the government stated that we had not stated4 that in our brief. It's on pages 25 and 26, as well as5 squarely raised in Footnote 7.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it wasn't raised7 below. And these are very difficult issues and it's8 sort of flying blind not to have lower court opinions9 and the thing fully argued out before we get it.10 MR. BADALAMENTI: Yes, Your Honor. We just11 wanted to point out where it was in the briefing in12 this ­­ in this Court.13 The "tangible object" notion is extremely14 important, which the justices have pointed out under15 Russello. You have the fact that you have two statutes16 passed in the same act. One includes different language17 than the other. To presume that that language is18 included in there intentionally and that major19 significance makes false entry in all of the statutes20 that are ­­ we've cited in our brief in Footnote 4, that21 reference of the reply brief ­­ all of them are22 record­related statutes. Every single one of them has a23 textural indication of what Congress had meant.24 The breadth of the statute regarding any25 Federal matter is ­­ is an extraordinary thing that the55Alderson Reporting CompanyI'll be brief.  RegardingOfficial￼1 American people will be walking on eggshells for if this2 Court were to not limit, at least, the subject matter of3 this. And the last point ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it doesn't5 entirely solve that problem, simply to narrow ­­6 MR. BADALAMENTI: It does not ­­ it doesn't,7 Your Honor. And Mr. Yates would open up any other8 constitutional issues as well. But no, certainly the9 last comment is directed ­­ is that for more than 20010 years, the United States has existed without this mega,11 all­inclusive obstruction of justice statute with the12 intent to impede anything, any matter, that the13 possibility of the United States could or may or may14 never be interested in. It didn't create it buried15 within the Sarbanes­Oxley Act and this Court shouldn't16 put it in there now.17 For these reasons, Mr. Yates requests that18 this Court vacate the conviction under Section 1519,19 reverse, remand the decision to the Eleventh Circuit.20 Thank you.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.22 The case is submitted.23 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in
