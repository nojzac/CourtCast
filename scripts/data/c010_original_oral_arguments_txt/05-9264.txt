CRAWFORD, ESQ.                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. CRAWFORD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Official            We confront today the Eleventh Circuit'stroubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the101112   Armed Career Criminal Act.  Under the text and structure13   of the act, as well as the categorical approach that this14   Court recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida15   attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as16   they -- these types of convictions do not involve17   explicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious18   potential risk of physical injury to another.19               The Respondent in their brief has enunciated20   a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify,21   and that test that they enunciate is basically a22   district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their23   common sense and experience to determine whether an24   offense should qualify.  That type of test is not the25   kind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and3Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   Shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at 2   determining whether convictions should qualify. 3               The categorical approach that this Court 4   enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of 5   prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements 6   of those crimes. 7               As such, the Government's argument would 8   open up a -- is a broad mandate that courts could use to 9   bring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to10   be included within the Armed Career Criminal Act.  For11   instance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree12   felony in Florida.  It's a five-year statutory maximum.13   Under the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated,14   it would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory15   maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs.  Yet,16   if the Government's approach to the interpretation of17   the otherwise clause is to be used, that simple18   possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using19   their common sense and everyday experience determines it20   presents a serious potential risk of physical21   injury to another.  Obviously --22               JUSTICE ALITO:  If we were looking at23   attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that24   involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk25   of physical injury to another?4Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1               MR. CRAWFORD:  Your Honor, in Taylor, this 2   Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or 3   generic burglary, the offense becomes a -- has that 4   serious potential risk when the person actually enters 5   the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an 6   attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most 7   other States, that act has not occurred.  You haven't 8   entered, the defendant has not entered the property. 9               JUSTICE ALITO:  If the would-be burglar is10   climbing through the window or on a ladder with the11   intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that12   involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?13               MR. CRAWFORD:  If the conduct -- again,14   we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry.15   Obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far.16   Other attempted burglaries are caught well before that17   actually occurs.  But if you were to say that the18   attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to19   get into the place and the person actually didn't get20   in, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the21   person enters.  The risk is much less outside the22   dwelling than inside the dwelling.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But in Florida, that24   would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the25   curtilage around the house?5Alderson Reporting Company￼Official1234   enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes.  So if5   the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to6   the residence, that would actually be a burglary within7   the State of Florida.  In other States, it may not.            MR. CRAWFORD:  The curtilage is a uniqueconcept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is theenclosed space around the house that has some kind of 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  And we don't 9   even have to ask whether that presents a serious10   potential risk under the statute, right?  Because, if11   burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without12   the need to resort to the definition?13               MR. CRAWFORD:  Well, it would be a burglary14   in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated15   in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very16   specific.  It is the entering a dwelling or structure.17   And in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary18   without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a19   curtilage burglary.20               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you could do it in a21   noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the22   ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of23   the ladder.  I mean, you would have -- you would have taken24   a substantial step.  You would have made an attempt.  Now25   why would that not qualify under the words of the6Alderson Reporting Company￼5678 first? 9Official1   statute that referred to a potential risk?  Haven't you2   created the potential for the risk of harm that the3   statute is getting at when you take the substantial4 step?            MR. CRAWFORD:  Well, trying to use theCourt's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that --10111213   ladder?14JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, how about my questionMR. CRAWFORD:  Okay.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, haven't you in thewords of the statute, created the potential for the riskwhen you take that substantial step by starting up the            MR. CRAWFORD:  If you started up the ladderand that's the way the attempted burglary convictioncame down, it would be a lot closer call to say that151617   would be a potential risk.  Whether it's a serious18192021   ladder.  As I understand, you would -- you have to22   analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted23   burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk;potential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you wouldn't analyze iton the basis of whether this defendant started up the24   isn't that the way it has to be done?25               MR. CRAWFORD:  That's the way that we submit7Alderson Reporting Company￼Official1   it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those2   facts.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but I thought yourargument was that that analysis would not lead to theresult unfavorable to your client because the nature ofstarting up the ladder did not create or could notreasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk.            In other words, I thought you were saying --maybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reasonthe Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking asubstantial step -- which is what the indictment wouldcharge -- could not be seen as creating the potentialrisk that the statute talks about.            Now if I'm not understanding your argumentcorrectly, you know, straighten me out here.            MR. CRAWFORD:  I think I understand.  Thatsubstantial step in even taking a step up the ladder,Mr. James would submit based on the language of thestatute, would not qualify and would not create thatserious potential risk of physical injury.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  And that's why simplycharging attempted burglary will never satisfy thestatute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.            MR. CRAWFORD:  That's correct.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But even if it would,8Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   that's only one manner of attempt.  And it seems to me, 2   if you're going to do it generically, you have to look 3   over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does 4   the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say, 5   a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the 6   specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or 7   extortion?  Indeed, I guess you have to use the least 8   dangerous.  Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of 9   those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or10   the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct.11   Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes12   already mentioned, and I would say that means that the13   unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a14   risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes15   mentioned, which I would take to be extortion.16               Wouldn't you say?17               MR. CRAWFORD:  Of those four, extortion does18   seem to potentially have the least risk of all those19   crimes enumerated.  But --202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what's a potentialrisk, by the way?            MR. CRAWFORD:  A potential risk --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  A potential potential?  Imean, every risk is potential, isn't it?            MR. CRAWFORD:  In the Government's -- in the9Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Respondent's brief, they talked about how risk andpotential and serious, some of those worlds potentiallyknock each other out, and I apologize for using thatvery word, but --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think potential risk isjust risk really?            MR. CRAWFORD:  I think it is a risk.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But isn't one way oflooking at it -- I mean, I, when I read it, you know, IOfficial10   thought it's just redundant.  But it may very well be11   that the word potential is in there in order to12   accommodate attempts.13               MR. CRAWFORD:  If that were true, I mean,14   Congress when they wrote the statute, and in15   924(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically16   enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that17   violence.  So it has an element, use of or attempted use18   of, or threatened use of physical force.  But under19   prong two, they specifically deleted that word20   "attempt".21 22 23 24 25            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Specifically deletedor didn't --under --MR. CRAWFORD:  They did not include it, andCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's quite10Alderson Reporting Company￼1   different than specifically deleting it.  In otherOfficial2345   burglary would qualify.  That was passed by the Senate,6   never passed by the House, never enacted.words, it was never there in the proposal.            MR. CRAWFORD:  In 1984 actually, there was aproposal where burglary would qualify and attempted 7               So later on when burglary was actually 8   defined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary 9   that Taylor came close to defining the same way.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, do I understand11   your submission to be that putting a ladder against the12   side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the13   ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential14   risk of physical injury?15               MR. CRAWFORD:  If that were the only way to16   prove an attempted burglary within a State, if that17   would be -- that would be the requirement, the legal18   requirement that you have to put the ladder against the19   house and that's an element of the offense, that to me20   would be a much closer call; but still, under the21   analysis that we have provided the Court with the22   Russello presumption, it should not qualify.  But it is23 24 25a closer case.            Whereas categorically when you look atattempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the11Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9side of the house is an element of the offense.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We understand fromyour friend on the other side that an overt act towardfulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law.In other words, it's not just enough to have burglarytools in your house.            MR. CRAWFORD:  Correct.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You've got to takean affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.Official            MR. CRAWFORD:  It is an overt act that isbeyond mere thinking about it.10111213   know, count.  It sounds to me if you're wondering about14   whether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could15   find out.  Look at the conviction that in Florida for16   attempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary,17   and see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which18   people are harmed is roughly similar.  We have all these19   law professors who like statistics.  Now they like law in20   economics and everything.  So why don't they go out21   there and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of22   sitting here and trying to figure out something I know23   nothing about.  I've never been involved in a lot of24   burglaries.  I don't know how the burglaries operate.  I25   suspect some people are hurt, but rather than my12JUSTICE BREYER:  Why doesn't anybody -- youAlderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911   example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess12   burglary tools.  Does it mean or does it exclude casing13   the house, walking up and down the street, around the14   block?            When is a step substantial enough toconstitute an attempt under Florida law?Officialsuspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We're not going to beable to do that in time to decide this case.            JUSTICE BREYER:  But wouldn't it be, as amethod of approaching --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would also keep theprofessors from other mischief.            (Laughter.)                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what do we know about10   the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime?  For15161718   analysis, a substantial step analysis.  It is an overt19   act.  It's some overt act manifesting your intent toMR. CRAWFORD:  Well, it's not really a step20212223   place.  What qualifies as an overt act that would make24   one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?actually --It's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing theJUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is that concretely?25               MR. CRAWFORD:  If you had a diagram of the13Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1   person's house and you had burglary tools in your car 2   and you had maybe even called to make sure the business 3   was closed and you were driving there and as you're 4   driving there you're telling the person sitting beside 5   you:  I'm going to break into that, you know, business 6   at 254 Main Street.  That would be enough under Florida 7   law to convict someone for attempted burglary of a 8   structure. 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess we have to decide10   how many attempts involve that kind of initial action,11   which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how12   many of them involve putting a ladder up against the13   side of the house.14               How do we possibly figure that out, to15   decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from16   attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of17   risk from extortion?18               MR. CRAWFORD:  That may be -- that may be a19   very difficult question to answer, and maybe the20   Respondent had that obligation in the district court,21   because they have the obligation to prove that this22   enhancement has that substantial or that serious23   potential risk of physical injury to another and of24   course they didn't do that.  But if you look back in25   this Court's decision in 1985 in Tennessee versus14OfficialAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   Garner, this Court was talking about completed 2   burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a 3   person would only occur in a rare case, and it gave the 4   percentage I think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time. 5               But that's in a completed burglary.  That's 6   not even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the7 risk -- 8 9   question:  It seems to me there are two ways to read the10   burglary, arson or extortion examples:  That they are11   clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to12   individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put13   in the statute to say, even though they don't involve14   serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered,15   because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that16   burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime17   that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the18   statute nevertheless defines it.19               So do you read those terms as giving20   examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of21   injury or as examples of crimes that would?22               MR. CRAWFORD:  I think it can be read either23   way, although I think even the Government's brief in24   -- or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about25   extortion and burglary being crimes that can be15JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you thisAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   committed with no risk of physical injury to another 2   person and yet Congress still specifically 3   enumerated those -- 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Crawford, if you had 5   that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word 6   "otherwise".  You would have simply said is burglary, 7   arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or 8   involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk. 9   The other purpose of the "otherwise," which means in10   some other manner, some other manner -- other from what?11   Other from the preceding ones.12               I don't think there is any sensible way to13   read it except, you know, in some other manner than14   these previously named crimes involves a physical risk;15   and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the16   least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and17   any crime you want to get into this residual category18   has to be at least as dangerous as that.  As I've said,19202122232425I think that's extortion.            MR. CRAWFORD:  Using that analysis, it'shard to figure out, but again the Government had thisobligation or we submit the Government had thisobligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglaryto be any more dangerous.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think that,16Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   they have determined that.  But again, we submit under10   that Russello presumption or even the statute itself,11   Congress enumerated those four property crimes,12   primarily property crimes.13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Doesn't that seem14   like a fine line?  I mean, if you're sitting around with15   your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under16   this provision, planning a burglary.  But if you17   actually get out there with the burglary tools, you put18   the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder,19   that somehow involves less of a potential risk of20   physical injury?21               MR. CRAWFORD:  They both present very little22   potential risk.  They don't even really -- under a23   serious potential risk, they don't present that.  A24   conspiracy shouldn't either.  A conspiracy and attempt25   are not different things because a conspiracy doesn't17is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses aserious potential risk as burglary does?            MR. CRAWFORD:  In Florida, or in theEleventh Circuit, they have determined that conspiracyto commit enumerated offenses do present that seriouspotential risk.JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry, go ahead.MR. CRAWFORD:  So in the Eleventh CircuitAlderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9qualify --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think theEleventh Circuit is wrong?            MR. CRAWFORD:  I believe the EleventhCircuit is wrong with conspiracy as well.Official            JUSTICE BREYER:  If we don't know and if Ican't get too far with the language and I frankly couldsit in my office looking at the computer screen I thinkfor hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whetherthere is or is not a lot of injury that accompaniesattempted burglary, but that is something that is101112   possible to know.  All we have to do, as I said before,13   is count and there are a lot of people who can do that.14   In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to15   do it and that is the sentencing commission.  So they16   have the tools.  They have the ability.  And so in the17   absence on a question like this of my being able to get18   anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a19   borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as20   a Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of21   what the sentencing commission did in the absence of22   better information from some other place?23               MR. CRAWFORD:  Well, the sentencing24   commission when they were interpreting the career25   offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a18Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   guideline that is worded different than the -- 2               JUSTICE BREYER:  They're trying to find out 3   the same answer to the same kind of question:  How many 4   of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how 5   many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being 6   hurt?  And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that 7   question in a borderline case without trying to find the 8   numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I 9   don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second10   best alternative, which is at least they could get them,11   and I hope they did get them before coming to the12   conclusion they did.13               MR. CRAWFORD:  Well, they came to that14   conclusion dealing with whether a career offender15   provision should include attempted burglary not under16   the armed career criminal statute and they specifically17   recognized that.18               Moreover, when they dealt with whether they19   wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing20   with career offender, which has, although it increases21   the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it22   certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero23   to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense.24               So for those reasons, even if the sentencing25   commission feels that the career offender statute or19Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   guideline should include attempted burglary, that 2   doesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed 3   career criminal statute. 4               Moreover, the career offender statute says 5   it's only a burglary of a dwelling, although the armed 6   career criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if 7   it's a dwelling or a structure. 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Crawford, we've held 9   that the named crimes have to be considered generically10   according to their elements, right?  Burglary, arson.11   Have we ever held that the residual category or12   "otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious13   potential risk of physical injury," that that has to be14   decided generically?  I mean, if we could apply that15   residual category, not generically but according to the16   crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant17   has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against18   the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to19   me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't20   it?  We'd be able to tell whether there was a serious21 22 23 24 25risk of physical injury.            Is there any obstacle to doing that?            MR. CRAWFORD:  Well, Taylor and Shepard bothtalk about that predicate offenses under 924(e) shouldbe looked at in a -- using a categorical approach, and20Alderson Reporting Company￼123456   to the residual category.  But even in Shepard --7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe it's not too late tosave ourselves from sending out legions of lawprofessors to do studies.            MR. CRAWFORD:  If the Court were to stepback and say that the "otherwise" clause should beinterpreted in a noncategorical manner and we're goingto -- the Court decides it's a factual-based approach,in Mr. James' case there are no facts, so it may notmake any difference for him because there's no facts toindicate what kind of burglary really occurred here.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You mean no facts in theindictment or charging documents?            MR. CRAWFORD:  Correct.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there is in thepresentence report?            MR. CRAWFORD:  That is correct.  There werefacts that were presented in the presentence report thatcame from police reports.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't have any21Officialthe Court has talked about that being an approach lookingto the elements of the offense.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was it referring to theresidual category?MR. CRAWFORD:  It didn't specifically referAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other 2   named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential 3   risk?  In other words, attempted arson or attempted use 4   of explosives?  You concede those would be covered,5 don't you? 6               MR. CRAWFORD:  Actually, no.  Those crimes, 7   attempted crimes, also should not come in unless there's 8   something about an attempted arson statute that has as 9   an element or something that presents a serious10   potential risk of physical injury to another, which at11   least in Florida that's not the case.12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you think attempted13   use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion?14   I mean as far as the risk of physical injury is15   concerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is16   much more dangerous to physical health than extortion.17               MR. CRAWFORD:  Getting back to your18   question, maybe this answers part of it:  Although the19   Court -- you asked, Justice Scalia, you asked a question20   about why can't we make this basically maybe a21   fact-based inquiry.  And if you were to do so, the whole22   categorical approach that we're dealing with in all the23   other sections would almost become irrelevant because if24   something doesn't apply categorically, then we'll go to25   a fact-based inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole22Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9purpose of the categorical approach.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Crawford, does therecord show that the facts in the PSR came from policereports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in thecourt records?            MR. CRAWFORD:  The plea colloquy was notever presented or produced, and it does show that theycame from police reports.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Where is that in the record?101112131415161718192021222324   burglary to be as follows:  that there must be an overt25   act taken toward entering either a dwelling or aOfficial            MR. CRAWFORD:  I believe that is stated inthe PSR regarding the facts that they alleged under theattempted burglary, which again were objected to.Specifically, the facts weren't necessarily objected to,but the use of the attempted burglary was objected to,and both the district court and the Eleventh Circuittook that as being an objection to using anythingregarding the attempted burglary.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Crawford, may I ask you aquestion about the relationship between generic burglaryand what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt?And what I'm getting at is the issue that at least wasalluded to in the Jones case.Do you understand Florida law on attempted23Alderson Reporting Company￼89 10 11 12            JUSTICE SOUTER:  So there's no such thing asattempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offenseunder burglary under Florida law.            MR. CRAWFORD:  Under Florida law attemptingto enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is13   the same thing.  Dwelling is defined as the building or14151617   curtilage.1819202122232425            MR. CRAWFORD:  Correct.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.            MR. CRAWFORD:  Thank you.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Crawford.            Mr. Marcus?          ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS,               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT24the curtilage.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, so when you saydwelling you mean dwelling as defined to includeOfficial1234   is up.  Little me briefly answer this question.  Or -- I5   want to remain, or let some remain for my rebuttal.structure, as distinct from an overt act taken to getwithin the curtilage?MR. CRAWFORD:  The evidence -- I see my time6   Very quickly, the overt act has to refer to the7   attempting to enter the dwelling.  And so --Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1               MR. MARCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 2   and may it please the Court. 3               Petitioner's conviction for attempted 4   burglary of a dwelling under Florida law is a violent 5   felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because like 6   the crime of burglary Petitioner's crime categorically 7   involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk 8   of physical injury to another. 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Marcus, do you agree10   with your brother's answer to my last question that11   there would be an attempt -- could be an attempt under12   Florida law simply to take an overt -- to commit an13   overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from14   entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?15               MR. MARCUS:  Yes, while I would disagree16   with that, but while there are -- with your17   characterization.  But there are no -- the number of18   reported cases involving an attempted burglary that19   involved an attempt to get on to the curtilage, if -- I20   think -- based on --21               JUSTICE SOUTER:  We don't know basically22   what Florida law is?  I mean, is that the best answer?23               MR. MARCUS:  Yes.  I don't, I don't think24   you could conclude, they have -- there is no decision25   telling you whether that would suffice.  But we're not25Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   taking the position that it could not involve an 2   attempted entry into the curtilage. 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that literally, I take 4   it then if someone did have a fence around the house, 5   and I, I -- I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn 6   toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the 7   fence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as 8   an attempted burglary under Florida law? 9               MR. MARCUS:  Yes -- it could.  It could --10               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would that be true if I11   simply wanted to get into the -- if my intent was to get12   on the other side of the fence but not into the13   dwelling?  For example, you know, I wanted to steal the141516171819202122232425apples on the tree?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, I think --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would that qualify asattempted burglary?            MR. MARCUS:  I think it could.  I think --but I think you --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Doesn't that give you apretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is asufficient potential risk of the sort of harm thatqualifies under the act?            MR. MARCUS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.I mean Florida, in the State versus Hamilton case, we26Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   discussed in our brief, Florida has defined curtilage 2   narrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage 3   narrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that 4   immediately surrounds the dwelling.  And the case 5   discusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts 6   of appeals where the courts construed the concept of 7   curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana 8   that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling 9   house, in another case a whiskey still that was a10   distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house,11   that those were too far out to be considered part of the12   curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds13   the dwelling that's associated with the intimate14   activities of the dwelling.  So Florida -- and Florida15   -- and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme16   Court at its word when it said it's going to strictly17   construe that concept, and when it said it's not going18   to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable19   results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of20   burglary is.21               So I think the -- so the first step, I22   think, if you don't -- if you don't believe that the way23   Florida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress24   had in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it25   presents a categorically different set of risks such that it27Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   would even fall outside the otherwise clause. 2               JUSTICE ALITO:  There are a number of 3   Florida cases that involve open carports.  How would you 4   apply it there?  Somebody, if you had a carport that's 5   not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the 6   street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a 7   garden rake? 8               MR. MARCUS:  Well, I think under the 9   current, I think under the current statute, it has been10   amended since, since 1993 and '94, and -- which is11   relevant, the statute is relevant to this case.  I think12   now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself,13   the structure itself but under -- but if it -- but under14   the Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not15   enclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other16   structure it would not be considered part of the17   curtilage.  And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case,18   it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that19   had found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and20   noted that the court in that case hadn't determined21   whether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed.22               So it does -- the statute does -- the23   concept does require an enclosure and the area24   immediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is25   very difficult to conclude that that, that defined in28Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   that way, in that limited way, that someone who's 2   intending to get on to a residence into the area either 3   in or right around the dwelling, that that person is not 4   sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that 5   Congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of 6   the paradigmatic offenses in the statute. 7               JUSTICE BREYER:  So in an ordinary city street 8   in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of 9   houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in10   front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or11   there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes12   up to the house and starts to monkey around with the13   window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted14   burglary, not burglary, in Florida?15               MR. MARCUS:  That -- yes.  That is my16   understanding.  If it was not enclosed.17               JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So then I doubt18   -- then again I'm left at sea.  I don't know how often19   that happens or is dangerous.  So if I think that this20   is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it21   is -- and the Government is in the best position, they22   have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over23   there.  So what about a presumption against the Government?24   In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a25   statistical question, and the Government doesn't have29Alderson Reporting Company￼Official1234567   I think?  I just don't know how dangerous attempted8   burglaries are.  I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit9   there are a lot of things I don't know but there are.any statistics?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, I think -- I don't thinkwhen Congress enacted this law that it expected thecourts would have statistics available to --            JUSTICE BREYER:  How are you supposed todecide it if there's a question as there is this instance10   And this is one of them.11               MR. MARCUS:  Well, there are several things12   you can do.  First you can look at the text of the13   statute.14               JUSTICE BREYER:  I read the text several15   times.1617   by setting out four examples of crimes that do present18   the type of risk they had in mind.19               JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct.  And here I think20   it might be less than burglary.  And extortion, though21   one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or22   something and revealing a secret from the past -- many23   such crimes are threats of violence.  I mean, and that24   just read through the statutes, and that's what they are25   aiming at.  So I would say extortion is something that30MR. MARCUS:  Congress provided some guidanceAlderson Reporting Company￼Official1   quite often could involve violence.2               But again that's cogitating.  So I get3   to attempted burglary.  I don't know.  Now what do I do?4567   serious potential risk that an offense presents.  I8   think that just -- and criminal law requires courts and9   juries all the time to take into account and to use            MR. MARCUS:  Well, I think -- I think youhave to consider what Congress's purpose -- in enactingthe statute, Congress directed your attention to the10   their common sense and experience to judge the risks11   that are presented by a particular crime.  I mean, the12   very concept of recklessness itself refers to a13   substantial disregard of --14               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Marcus, it is a lot15   easier to do that with respect to the facts and16   circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it17   generically -- you know -- picking out attempted18   burglary.  It is very hard to do that.  Why shouldn't we19   read this, this residual category to refer to the facts20   and circumstances of the particular crime of which the21   defendant has been convicted?  The language enables you22   to do that.  The term violent felony means any crime23   punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year24   that involves conduct that presents a serious potential25   risk of injury, physical injury to another.31Alderson Reporting Company￼10   of a categorical approach that, while these courts had,11   sort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post12   basis, it might not present any risk, the idea that13   these crimes categorically present a potential -- a14   serious potential risk of physical injury.15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And would you agree,16   Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard17   excludes that interpretation?  If you look at theOfficial12345   been interpreted for many years.  No courts of appeals6   have, have construed that it way.  They have construed7   it to require a categorical approach.  And then if you8   look at the structure of the provision, Congress clearly9   with respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort            Why can't we not, not interpret that to meangeneric crime, but rather the particular crime of whichthis defendant stands convicted?MR. MARCUS:  Well, all that -- this law has18192021   Congress's approach.  And under the statute, that sort22   of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to23   crimes that are inherently presented --24               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Didn't we -- didn't we also25   go further and say one reason to construe it that way is32particular crime?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, I think the Courtreferred both in Taylor and Shepard to the -- toAlderson Reporting Company￼2122   language.232425Official 1   we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having 2   sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to 3   establish -- you know -- the facts of old trials.  There 4   was an administrability analysis involved.  I think 5   there was.  Yeah, I wrote Shepard.  And I think that's6 what -- 7               MR. MARCUS:  There was that as well.  And I 8   don't think it is beyond the ability of courts to 9   take a crime, look at the elements of the crime, figure10   out what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements11   and then use common sense and experience to make a12   judgment about how that -- the risks that are posed by13   that conduct.  Looking at the situation --14               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Marcus, isn't there15   this -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway?16   Because this language if it said -- that sometimes17   presents a serious risk, then the answer would be18   obvious.  If otherwise it said that characteristically19   presents a serious risk, then it might be closer.  And20   which do you think is the more normal reading of it?                 I think either is -- certainly fits the                 MR. MARCUS:  And either --33            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Either means sometimespresents a potential risk of physical injury, thenAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   obviously they're all covered.  Or if it says 2   characteristically presents the risk, potential risk, 3   then do you have to decide whether that, it is a 4   characteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it 5   does present this risk or that just once in a while it6 does. 7               MR. MARCUS:  No.  I think it's not -- no I 8   think it has to, characteristically taken at a general 9   level, the conduct required to commit a burglary, of10 getting --11               JUSTICE STEVENS:  If that were true, and if12   as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's13   only three percent of them actually involve risk to --14   of physical injury to another, then attempted burglary15   must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent.  I16   would think that.  Would that satisfy the characteristic17   requirement?18192021   percent?22            MR. MARCUS:  I think it would.  First ofall, Congress --                 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why is it two or three25   one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically34                 MR. MARCUS:  The statistics he is referring23   to came out before Congress amended the statute in 198624   and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary asAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   presented a serious potential risk of injury. 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I don't think that's 3   perfectly clear.  The "otherwise" language does suggest 4   that you are right.  But if the statute instead of 5   saying "otherwise" had said, "or involves other conduct 6   that presents a serious risk," which I think is a 7   permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but 8   if it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as 9   a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent10   requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether11   or not they do.12               MR. MARCUS:  Well, this Court interpreted13   the statute that way in Taylor -- I mean, I'm sorry, on14   page -- on page 597 of Taylor.  I mean this Court said15   that Congress's choice of language indicates that16   Congress thought ordinary burglaries as well as17   burglaries involving some aspect making them especially18   dangerous, presented a sufficiently serious potential19   risk to count toward enhancement.  I mean, that's right20   in the Taylor decision, and I think that has got to be21   the correct reading of the statute.  Because why did22   Congress identify -- they created two categories of23   violent felonies.  The first is with respect to an24   element of the offense that goes to targeting a person25   for physical harm.  The second category are those crimes35Alderson Reporting Company￼Official1   that don't necessarily target a person for physical harm2   but necessarily present, inherently present a risk of3   physical injury to a person.4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would be fine if5   burglary were the only thing that Congress said there,6   but it also said extortion.  And I think it absolutely7 8 9fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically --characteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm.I just don't think it does.            MR. MARCUS:  Well, Congress identified it asa violent felony presumably because it believed it had-- it had the criteria.101112131415161718192021   risk the level that exists in extortion?  Right?  That's22   what the otherwise refers you to.23               MR. MARCUS:  Yes.  To the level of risk24   that's presented by any of the preceding examples.25   That's correct.36            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but is the criterion"characteristically," or is the criterion whateverminimal risk of harm there is in extortion?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, that it carries thepotential risk, because when any -- when someonecommits extortion there might be a tendency to -- ifthere --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the level of potentialAlderson Reporting Company￼Official1234   pretty close to zero?  I mean, they're not in the house.5   They're just on the ladder, in the kind of examples            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Maybe, the same point,isn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm inthese attempt cases is characteristically going to be6   we've been talking about.7               MR. MARCUS:  I don't agree, Your Honor.  The8   statute directs you to consider the serious potential9 risk.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  One way to do that is tosay the potential risk is the potential for the risk ofthe harm that comes from the commission of the crime10111213   itself.14               I mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo15   it, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the16   step on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the17   act itself of putting the ladder up against the building18   and taking the step.  It's only because that creates the19   potential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is20   measurable.  I mean, we know there are cases in which21   victims get shot when they appear in the course of22   burglaries, but the risk associated with the mere23   attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.24               MR. MARCUS:  When you're assessing the risk25   presented by particular conduct, I think you have to37Alderson Reporting Company￼Official1   take into account the intent that goes along with that2   conduct.3               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, I agree with you.  But4   the act that involved -- the act that constitutes the --5   that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it.  I'm6   trying to help you here.  I mean --7 8 9a minute.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't believe it for(Laughter.)            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why do you look atthe risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of101112   lesser included offense?  I mean, attempts themselves13   have their own independent risk of physical injury.14   Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of15   my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's16   a risk of injury there, even though there's no --17   regardless of whether the person gets into the house or18   not.19202122   Why don't they succeed?  Because something interrupts23   them.  And what interrupts them, it may well be the home24   owner.  So I don't know that you have to look to sort of25   attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.38            And I think perhaps there's even a greaterrisk of potential -- greater potential risk of injurywith respect to attempts because they don't succeed.Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1               MR. MARCUS:  Well, Congress doesn't look to 2   attempt as a lesser offense.  We pointed out in our 3   brief that the vast majority of provisions in the U.S. 4   Criminal Code punish the attempt the same as for the 5   completed offense.  And if you think about the purpose 6   of the ACCA, and the ACCA is not focused on the results 7   of the prior crimes of the armed felon committed, it is 8   focused on the risk, the propensity that somebody has, 9   has demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior10   violent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage11   in behavior that is dangerous, that presents12   dangers to public safety.  So if you think about the13   attempt and the whole concept of attempt, I mean, someone14   who has committed attempt by definition has intended to15   commit the offense and as you said, Mr. Chief Justice,16   has only failed by reason of an unforeseen event.17   Why would Congress in this statute want to differentiate18   between the frustrated burglar whose only -- who hasn't19   succeeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event, and the20   successful burglar?  I think the serious potential risk21   language allows you to sort of look at the attempt as22   you said, Mr. Chief Justice, as virtually the23   equivalent --24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would suppose the25   unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical39Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   injury than the successful burglar. 2               MR. MARCUS:  Arguably.  I mean, if you look 3   at the case law, the vast majority of cases, the 4   furthest out, the furthest case the Petitioner can find, 5   the most extreme case that he's found involves someone 6   who's in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or 7   casing the dwelling, and that was the most extreme 8   example.  So even with attempts, you find in all the 9   case law, you do find the physical proximity to the10   premises.11               And one of the main reasons it wouldn't12   succeed is because somebody, there's the presence of13   someone who frustrates the entry.  So that even on that14   level, at that level, it is hard to say that there's any15   lower risk presented by the attempt.16               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what do you say about17   your brother's argument that the statistics show there's18   a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of19   violence in the course of committing the burglary?  I20   take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want21   to take Justice Breyer's approach, about the22   potential -- the actual proven potential for violence at23   the near attempt stage.24               MR. MARCUS:  But again, I think -- I don't25   think you need to have those statistics.40Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I don't think you doeither, but I mean, I think your whole argument has gotto rest really on the potential for harm in thecommission of the offense.            MR. MARCUS:  That's the very reason thatattempts are prohibited, because they present theserious potential to produce the harms that thecompleted offense presents.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do I correctly understand,we don't need the statistics, I guess they're notavailable, but in your view if we did have statisticsand they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of thecategory of crimes across the nation, there was thisrisk, that would be enough?            MR. MARCUS:  For attempts?            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.  Well, for attemptsor complete -- I mean, just say the standard of whatpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever thecategory, did present such a risk, that would besufficient under your view.            MR. MARCUS:  Yes, I think Congress wanted totreat a frustrated burglar the same --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  The answer is yes?            MR. MARCUS:  Yes.  They've shown the same41OfficialAlderson Reporting Company￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   asking the Court here.  We're asking the Court to look 9   at the elements of the offense, and to look at the10   elements of the offense to see whether that creates a11   situation in which violence is likely to arise.  Here12   you're talking about, this is attempted burglary of a13   dwelling where you have --14               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but none of the15   elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical16   injury in the burglary case.  You can have unarmed17   burglars.1819202122232425Officialpropensity to engage in the conduct that Congress wasconcerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  So then it's a really easycase, because really there is some risk in every case.There's some risk that somebody will, you know, bumpinto somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.MR. MARCUS:  But that's not what we're            MR. MARCUS:  But in considering the conductinvolved in the offense, the attempting to get, theattempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home,someone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation inwhich violence could occur --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.  And as Iunderstand your view --MR. MARCUS:  That doesn't --42Alderson Reporting Company￼12345   I don't think the statistics would show that.  I don't6   think logically they would show that in light of the7   numbers that are shown for completed burglary.  ButOfficial            JUSTICE STEVENS:  If in 1/10 of 1 percent ofthe cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation,that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.MR. MARCUS:  Yes.  But again, first of all, 8   again, I don't see -- with respect to the offenses that 9   are covered that are at the core of the statute, I don't10   see why you would distinguish between the person who11   tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen12   event.  They have created the same set of risks, they've13   triggered the same set of risks that the successful14   burglar has.15               JUSTICE ALITO:  So in other words, you're16   saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider17   not just what this particular defendant succeeded in18   accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to19   accomplish?20212223   serious potential risk.  And that -- and also in looking24   at the rationale for attempts and why we punish25   attempts, in terms of the person is, you get punished43            MR. MARCUS:  That's correct.  I think thestatute permits you to do that with its plain languageof focusing on the potential risk of the conduct, theAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   for attempts because you sufficiently manifested your 2   dangerousness in the same way as someone who's completed 3   the offense.  Again, the State codes, the vast majority 4   of State codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt 5   behavior.  They predicate felony murder convictions on 6   attempted burglary as well as burglary.  And as I said 7   -- 8               JUSTICE BREYER:  What about attempted 9   assault?  I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an10   attempted assault.11               MR. MARCUS:  Well, I think, my understanding12   would be that would be covered under the first subsection13   for the use -- attempted use or threat, threatened use of14   force.15               JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But it wouldn't16   fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens17   when you try to get away from numbers.  Maybe there are18   a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or19   embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during20   an embezzlement and start hitting each other.21               I can't get away from the numbers.22               MR. MARCUS:  But there in those type23   offenses, if you look at the elements of the offense,24   there's no nexus between those elements and the -- a25   reaction that someone might have just to being44Alderson Reporting Company￼1   prosecuted.  I mean, that's not --6 7 8 9because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no ideawhat it means.(Laughter.)Official            JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's the test?  Thetest is either a high statistical number of injuries orif not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high2345   statistical number of injuries?  I like the word nexus            MR. MARCUS:  Well, in this statute you'retalking about career criminals, people who have101112   convicted of being an armed felon.  And I think13   that's -- when you look at -- that can be your starting14   point, and take -- so this case doesn't present15   questions about other cases that might present --16   arguably present, or present a serious risk of physical17   injury, but don't necessarily seem to fit with the18   crimes that are listed and what the crimes that Congress19   had in mind.  I think that's another case.  This case20   falls at the core of the statute; we're talking about21   someone who intends to commit the core crime Congress22   was talking about.23               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Marcus, assuming we24   accept your view about the way the statute should be25   read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage45committed a number of crimes and have recently just beenAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that 2   burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary? 3               MR. MARCUS:  We haven't argued that it is 4   generic burglary.  That's correct. 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:  I guess my -- so that leads 6   me to this question, because -- I mean, I, my 7   understanding is it's not a generic burglary. 8               Therefore, even on your reading of the 9   statute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't10   necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in11   under the residuary clause, of course.  And because12   there is a possibility that the only burglary charged13   was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't14   we have to send the thing back to find out either from15   court records whether something more than a mere16   penetration of curtilage was involved here?  And if so,1718192021222324   attempt at burglary.  If the burglary were a generic25   burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the46whether -- whether that penetration carried with it thepotential for harm?            MR. MARCUS:  I mean, no.  That's why youhave the otherwise clause, to cover offenses just asthis Court said in Taylor, that they weren't --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but the only thing weknow under the otherwise clause, is that this was anAlderson Reporting Company￼end of the case.            MR. MARCUS:  Yes.Official 1 2 3 4   burglary.  Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt 5   in this case could have been nothing more than stepping 6   across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over 7   to take the apple.  And therefore, don't we have to go 8   to court records?  In other words, don't we have to take 9   advantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor10   before this case can finally be decided?11               MR. MARCUS:  No.  I mean, you've identified12   an additional step that the Court has to consider in13   deciding the question in this case, but that step doesn't14   necessarily require you to go to court records.  I mean,15   it's our position that even including the curtilage, the16   area, enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling17   presents a serious potential risk of physical injury18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, could you tell us19   what your position is if we choose to use the20   noncategorical or the modified categorical approach?21   Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence22   report and some other charging documents, or is it just23   in the presentencing report?24               MR. MARCUS:  Yes.  The charging documents25   are not part of the record in this case.  The record47JUSTICE SOUTER:  But this is not a genericAlderson Reporting Company￼1234 that? 5Officialright now is solely comprised of the presentence report.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  And we don't have anytranscript of colloquies with the court or anything like            MR. MARCUS:  No.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, what about -- do youthink the facts in the presentence report are admittedby your opponent or not?6 7 8 911               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Therefore, can we consider12   them?                 MR. MARCUS:  He didn't object to the facts10   in the presentence report.  He also did not object --13141516171819202122232425            MR. MARCUS:  Yes.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  So therefore, then thequestion is whether throwing the hammer through thewindow is sufficient; is that right?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, that would resolveJustice Souter's question about whether it would involvethe curtilage at all, which would show that there was anattempted physical entry into the residence.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you think that thehammer through the window is a decisive fact if we dolook at the individual case?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, we don't -- yes,certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a48Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   dwelling presents a serious potential risk 2   categorically.  But if you didn't agree with that, then, 3   and you thought that only a subset of attempted 4   burglaries of dwellings would present serious potential 5   risk, then clearly this offense here that would certainly 6   satisfy any conception of that. 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because the hammer is 8   thrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be 9   sure I understand your view of the importance of the10   hammer.11               MR. MARCUS:  Because there was an attempted12   physical entry into the residence.  The person was right1314151617   to attribute any particular significance to that.  I18   mean, it's our position that categorically this crime is19   covered.  And again, the case law shows that there's --20   that with attempted burglary cases, there is a physical21   proximity to the dwelling, but even if there was --22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though there's some23   cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't24   involve any risk to anybody.  Say the enterprising but25   careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see49on the threshold of the dwelling.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm still a little unclearas to how much significance we pay to that hammer.            MR. MARCUS:  Again, we don't think you haveAlderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses 2   to make his entry. 3               MR. MARCUS:  That's correct.  You can always 4   posit, under the categorical risk, you could always 5   posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that 6   equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted 7   burglary.  And so while you could posit a hypothetical 8   where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might 9   seem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think10   categorically about people who are trying to surmount,11   get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the12   dwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're13   presenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the14   Court can conclude that it also -- within the otherwise15   clause, the burglary under Florida law is not so16   different from the kind of burglary that Congress had in17   mind that it would just drop out of the picture18   entirely.  Armed felons who have the propensity to go19202122232425into the curtilage of someone's home, to either go inthe house or right around the house, present the verykind of risk that Congress was concerned about.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that thispresentence report cannot be consulted under thereasoning of Shepard, we need more?            MR. MARCUS:  Well, under Shepard, the50Alderson Reporting Company￼Official 1   defendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police 2   reports.  My understanding is he also submitted an 3   affidavit saying he didn't acknowledge the truth of 4   anything in the police report.  So I think this case is 5   distinguishable in that there was no objection to the 6   facts in the PSR and there was no objection 7   specifically to using the police report as the source 8   for those facts. 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't think the PSR10   has some kind of significance that the police report did11   not?12               MR. MARCUS:  It wouldn't, no.  I don't think13   it would.  But -- no.14               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is the following sort of15   summary fair:  Because Florida is not a generic burglary16   State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy17   the burglary prong in subsection 2?  But on your1819202122232425argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglaryState, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the"otherwise" prong; is that correct?            MR. MARCUS:  Argument --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that a fair statement ofyour argument?            MR. MARCUS:  Yes.  If the completed offenseis a violent felony, the attempt to commit that offense51Alderson Reporting Company￼1   is also a violent felony.  That's a fair statement of2   our position.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.                MR. MARCUS:  Thank you.             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER34   Marcus.56789Official            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Crawford, youhave four minutes.            MR. CRAWFORD:  It seems to me thatRespondent's position is taking the "otherwise" clause101112   to trump the entire rest of the statute.  Any crime, any13   felony, has a potential of violence.  In fact, in14   footnote 9 of the reply brief we cited the Golden opinion15   from the Seventh Circuit and in that particular opinion16   the court found that serious potential risk for someone17   who failed to report to a jail because they speculate,18   you know, law enforcement might have to go and arrest19   them and there could be violence in that situation.20   Well, that happens in all crimes, the potential for law21   enforcement to arrest somebody.  There's always a22 23 24 25potential for violence.            So the Government's position --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's different whenyou're dealing with an escapee or someone who has52Alderson Reporting Company￼Official1   visitation right and then doesn't report back and2   qualifies as a escaped felon from prison.  That's quite 3 4 5 6 7   greater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit.  There's 8   a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with 9   someone who's escaped from prison than with someone10   else who's being arrested.  Of course there's always the11   potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater12   degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend13   someone who's escaped.14               MR. CRAWFORD:  For someone who's escaped.15   Golden wasn't dealing with that.  Golden was dealing16   with someone who failed to report to a facility after17   being sentenced to do so.  The same could be said for18   someone failing to report to a court for a hearing.  A19   bench warrant is issued.  The same type of risk would be20   inherent in that type of -- for that person as for21   someone who fails to report to a jail upon being22   sentenced.23               All of those potential crimes, basically24   that would leave open any potential felony to qualify25   under the "otherwise" prong.  Congress obviously53a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.            MR. CRAWFORD:  But there's still the samepotential for violence in either one of those.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  There's aAlderson Reporting Company￼10111213141516171819202122232425components, the risk of the conviction, which is not thesame thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction.            If there are no further questions --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Crawford.            The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)Official1   couldn't have intended that.2               Moreover, there's still an issue that was3   brought up in Shepard on the constitutional avoidance.4   How do we actually make these determinations and are5   these necessarily determinations that were found by the6   Florida court or by the Florida system for a Florida7   attempted burglary conviction?  We submit it's not.8               And you're going beyond the mere fact of the9   prior conviction.
