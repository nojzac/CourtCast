Tri County Industries.          Mr. Reischel.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. REISCHEL                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. REISCHEL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The principal issue here today is fundamental tothe functioning of our civil jury system, but it is onewhich the courts of appeals have disagreed about fordecades.  That issue is whether a trial court which setsaside a jury verdict in a civil case as against the weightof the evidence is entitled to very substantial deferenceby an appellate court.          We submit that the trial court is entitled tosuch substantial deference.  Indeed, we submit that thestandard is whether any reasonable judge could haveconcluded that the verdict was against the weight of, thegreat weight of the evidence.          We submit that the D.C. Circuit below appliedthe strict scrutiny standard, which boils down in practiceto whether there was sufficient evidence for the question31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9to go to the jury.  We submit this was error.  It'sinconsistent with what a trial court does.          QUESTION:  I thought that the court of appealsused the expression, a more searching inquiry than had themotion been denied.  I didn't realize they used the term,strict scrutiny.          MR. REISCHEL:  I'm sorry, more searching inquiryis the phrase that they do use.          QUESTION:  And they use the term, more searchinginquiry, as I understand it, to compare it with the sortof inquiry where the district court has denied the motionfor a new trial?101112131415    something.16              MR. REISCHEL:  Yes, and there are also other17    distinctions about the sort of error that's involved, but18    yes.MR. REISCHEL:  Yes.QUESTION:  Certainly it's comparing it with19202122    it?23              MR. REISCHEL:  Yes, Your Honor, it is, and our24    position is, can any rational judge have made that          QUESTION:  Is it your position that it isexactly the same inquiry in the court of appeals whether adistrict court grants a motion for a new trial or denies25 decision.4 1              QUESTION:  It seems somehow counterintuitive, 2    though I realize that doesn't make it wrong, that where a 3    district -- where the trial judge is in effect giving 4    effect to the jury's verdict, he shouldn't get a more 5    lenient standard of review than when he disapproves it or 6    sets it aside. 7              MR. REISCHEL:  I don't think, on analysis, it 8    is.  This is ultimately rooted in the unique perspective a 9    trial court has on the evidence.  As Justice Black said in10    Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper, when a trial court in11    ruling on a motion to set aside a trial, to order a new12    trial, he has a fresh perspective on the evidence, he has13    just seen it go in, he has also got a fresh perspective on14    the effect, the impact of the evidence on the jury --15              QUESTION:  But that's true whether he denies the16    motion or grants it.17              MR. REISCHEL:  That's true.  It's true in either18    case, but the trial judge is there.  The trial judge sees19    what happens, and for that reason the trial judge and the20    trial judge alone can actually engage in weighing the21 evidence.22              QUESTION:  Well, when you say what this is23    ultimately rooted in, I mean, whatever decision we come24    out with has to be ultimately rooted in the Seventh25    Amendment, I assume.5 1              MR. REISCHEL:  Yes, Your Honor. 2              QUESTION:  And the Seventh Amendment certainly 3    has quite different application when you're talking about 4    a trial judge who has accepted the jury's verdict and, on 5    the other hand, a trial judge who has rejected the jury 6    verdict, in effect overridden it and said we have to have 7    a new trial.  I don't know why the same standard of review 8    has to apply to both of those situations when the Seventh 9    Amendment treats them differently.10              MR. REISCHEL:  Well, the -- there is one minor11    difference, and that is, the court has to look to whether12    the trial court applied the proper standard.  That is,13    when he sets side a verdict that's contrary to the weight14    of the evidence, the question is, can a rational judge15    have made that decision?  That is, was it clearly contrary16    to the weight of the evidence.17              QUESTION:  Sometimes the evidence would be18    evidence that juries have particular ability to evaluate,19    or at least the power is given to them saying witness20    demeanor.  There could be other cases in which the matter21    is not particularly one that's suited to a jury.22              I mean, it turns -- he gives a new trial because23    of something to do with a document and its admissibility24    or something like that.  Would you at least say that where25    it's a matter that the juries are entrusted with the6 1    decision, a trial judge should be particularly careful of 2    granting a new trial contrary to the jury? 3              I mean, what I'm wondering at is -- what I'm 4    wondering about is if it perhaps is the same standard, but 5    in applying that same standard you should pay particular 6    attention when you overturn a jury verdict because, judge, 7    the jury has responsibilities to decide things that you8 don't have. 9              MR. REISCHEL:  That's true, but the trial judge10    has a much better take on both the force of the evidence11    and the impact on the jury.12              QUESTION:  No, if that's true, would you be13    satisfied with that result?  Suppose this Court said,14    well, in a sense it's the same standard, but what15    searching inquiry means is, it means, after all, here you16    are upholding the jury, not going against the jury, and if17    you were going against the jury there are many reasons why18    you should be very careful.  Does that satisfy you?19              MR. REISCHEL:  I think that's implicit in the20    great weight of the evidence part of the test.  The21    rational judge has to be able to say that this was against22    the great weight of the evidence.23              QUESTION:  Oh, well then are we arguing about24    anything other than just, which is often true in such25    cases, words?71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. REISCHEL:  I think the words have had realconsequences in appellate review.  I think if one looks towhat the D.C. Circuit and other circuits following theLindh decision actually do is, it boils down to was thereevidence to support the jury verdict?          If there was, they say that it was an abuse ofdiscretion to set it aside, but it's Hornbook law that acourt can set aside a jury verdict even if there'ssubstantial evidence to support it if the court makes anindependent determination, without drawing inferences forthe verdict, an independent determination that it'scontrary to the great weight of the evidence.          QUESTION:  Do you think that a jury verdict canbe against the great weight of the evidence when the onlything that the judge disagrees with, the trial judge, isthe jury's evaluation of credibility?          MR. REISCHEL:  There are --          QUESTION:  Can that possibly be against thegreat weight of the evidence?          MR. REISCHEL:  There are a -- my answer is yes.          QUESTION:  And if -- let me tell you why I askedthe question --          MR. REISCHEL:  My answer is yes it can be.          QUESTION:  -- because if not -- if not, then thecourt of appeals is fully able to evaluate the issue as8 1    effectively as the trial judge is. 2              MR. REISCHEL:  There are, Justice Scalia, a 3    range of different kinds of credibility determinations. 4    One might be what someone might call eyeball credibility. 5    You look at a person testifying, and are they lying, are 6    they sweating, are they nervous, all of that. 7              The other kind of credibility finding is, is 8    what they're -- does what they're saying make sense, and 9    to the extent that there's a credibility determination10    involved here, the question went to the credibility of the11    financial expert because the financial expert, Dr. Morris,12    based his financial projections on data that wasn't rooted13    in, and was contrary to, what the industry expert,14    DiRenzo, said.15              QUESTION:  Well, that's queer -- that's a queer16    description of credibility.  I mean, on that basis any17    facts that don't make sense are incredible.  Yes, I18    suppose that's right, but I wouldn't consider that a19    credibility determination.  I'd consider that a20    determination of whether there was substantial evidence on21    the record.22              If there's something on the record that is23    utterly incoherent and makes no sense, that's not24    evidence.  It's not adequate evidence, and a court of25    appeals can evaluate that.9 1              I thought that when we're talking about 2    credibility we're talking about the eyeballing the 3    witnesses.  I don't believe this fellow, he's shifty- 4    eyed, or whatever. 5              MR. REISCHEL:  If we're talking about what I 6    would call eyeball credibility, the courts are -- the 7    circuits are in disagreement as to whether the trial judge 8    can reevaluate that independently.  Some of them say no. 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Reischel, I wasn't of the view10    that this turns -- this power relates only to the11    credibility of witnesses.  I thought the judges exercised12    their determination to turn over a jury verdict based on13    maybe a whole range of things that occur at trial,14    including a judge might feel, I gave instructions that15    would pass muster with the court of appeals, so they're16    reversal-proof, but the jury didn't understand a damn word17    I was saying.18              Or a judge might say, I excluded certain19    evidence that was favorable to the defendant.  That, too,20    could survive appellate review, but on thinking it over I21    should have admitted the evidence and, either way, the22    court of appeals wouldn't touch me.23              Those kinds of considerations don't go to24    credibility of witnesses.25              MR. REISCHEL:  That's true.10 1              QUESTION:  But it's a sense that the judge has 2    that something went wrong at this trial. 3              MR. REISCHEL:  That's true, and the judge here 4    made two kinds of findings.  One, he made a finding that 5    he excluded evidence he should not have and disabled the 6    jury in performing its function, and the most important 7    evidence that he excluded was the October 15 invitation to8 be heard. 9              The harm here was that Tri County Industries10    said they were harmed because they hadn't been heard, but11    then they turn around and spurn an invitation to be heard,12    and the judge excluded that evidence, and he did so in13    part because of his ruling that all these issues had been14    resolved earlier, and then when he thought about it said,15    that wasn't -- that isn't right, and it probably confused16    the jury.  But --17              QUESTION:  Those things -- my point maybe wasn't18    clear.  I'm not saying that eyeball credibility is the19    only thing that the district judge can take into account.20    Of course he can take into account these other things, but21    these other things are evaluable by the court of appeals22    just as readily as they're evaluable by the trial judge.23    A court of appeals can say, well, this stuff was excluded.24    It could have been let in, and if it had been let in, then25    it would be different.1112345678    jury.9              The key witness here for purposes of future          This instruction to the jury was confusing, youcan tell that from the cold record, and if that's so, Idon't know why you should give any special deference tothe trial jury.          MR. REISCHEL:  Well, the court of appeals can'tsee the witnesses, and it can't see the jury, and it can'ttell what impact a particular witness might have on the10    earnings was Dr. Morris, Dr. Morris who came on as a Ph.D.11    and said, I've read a ton of things and I'm an expert in12    this field, and I can do all these mathematical things,13    but when he was cross-examined said, yes, but I based all14    of my industry stuff on -- all my prices on the Apex15    report by DiRenzo, and what DiRenzo's report said was that16    prices were being driven down so that they barely covered17 costs. 1819202122232425          QUESTION:  Doesn't that go to the credibility ofthe expert, whether what he relies on is worthy ofcredence by the fact-finder?          MR. REISCHEL:  It goes to the probative force, Ithink, of his testimony.          QUESTION:  How much weight you should give thetestimony, which I thought --          MR. REISCHEL:  That's correct, and that --                            121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  -- is a form of credibility.          MR. REISCHEL:  That's right, Justice O'Connor,and that's precisely what the trial court could weigh andwhat an appellate court cannot weigh.          QUESTION:  Well, but that's precisely what thejury, the fact-finder must determine, and in this case itwas a jury.          Do you think that the appellate standard forreview is basically an abuse of discretion standard?          MR. REISCHEL:  Yes, Your Honor.  We think thatfollows from Gasperini.  Gasperini says, if we read itcorrectly, that an appellate court can assess matters offact only if there's no reasonable disagreement about the1011121314    facts.15              QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, if it is abuse of16    discretion there is still room within that standard, I17    suppose, to say that a jury fact-finder determination on18    credibility of witnesses is not to be disturbed by the19    trial judge, and if the trial judge does, it's an abuse of20    discretion.21              MR. REISCHEL:  But this wasn't simply eyeball22    credibility.  This was, is what the expert is doing here,23    does it make sense?  He's testifying about projected24    future profits where the underlying industry evidence, the25    only industry evidence produced also by Tri County, showed131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that this heat remediation that they were getting into wasa declining industry, and that the last --          QUESTION:  Yes, but didn't the jury discount histestimony by about 50 percent anyway?          MR. REISCHEL:  The jury discounted histestimony, but the jury still came up with a $4.64 millionreturn --          QUESTION:  And he said it should have been --          MR. REISCHEL:  -- on a $9 million investment.          QUESTION:  Well, I understand, but he said itshould have been twice that amount, didn't he?          MR. REISCHEL:  He said -- yes.  He said, 150percent return per year, or 125 percent return per year.The jury found 49 percent return per year for each of 7years, in an industry where the segment of the industrywas shrinking, and the last entrant who had tried to comein had found it necessary to gain market share to cutprices below cost and had failed.          QUESTION:  I understand all that, but I thoughtit was fairly elementary damage law that if you prove thefact of damage, and I guess that was proved here, that --and if there isn't a clear measure of damage out there,the jury's allowed quite a bit of leeway in figuring theamount of damage, and here they took half the expert's --          MR. REISCHEL:  The question is whether or not                            14 1    the damage assessment is a reasonable one. 2              QUESTION:  Correct. 3              MR. REISCHEL:  And where Tri County's own 4    evidence is that the last person who entered failed, it's 5    a shrinking industry, and that prices are being driven 6    down just barely to cover costs, it's not reasonable to -- 7              QUESTION:  But you didn't take the position 8    there was no damage. 9              MR. REISCHEL:  No.  There were --10              QUESTION:  You took the position the amount was11    exaggerated.12              MR. REISCHEL:  The judge didn't take that13    position, either.  The judge took the position that a14    million dollars of damages, which would have been a 5-15    percent return on investment, was about right because16    there was a -- well, I assume because there was a17    differential for transportation costs, but to project 49-18    percent return each of 7 years in a declining industry19    where the last person failed is not a reasonable20    projection, and the judge said, this is pro forma.  It21    has nothing to do with reality.22              He said, at page JA-79, how do you explain this23    in light of the fact that prices are being driven down to24    costs?  How do you explain, he said in his decision --25              QUESTION:  Well, how did the judge explain the151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425million dollars, other than that was just a furtherdiscount?  He said, oh, it's a failing industry.  I'lldiscount it more.  It seems to me that's all he said.          MR. REISCHEL:  I think what he was finding was,if one looks just at the industry testimony, that isDiRenzo's testimony, that there was a slight boost forthis industry in D.C. because transportation costs wereslightly better, so one could say that they might beentitled to make a modest return on investment.  5 percentper year is a modest return on investment. 49 percent peryear for 7 years, I'd like to have that kind of --          QUESTION:  Mr. Reischel --          QUESTION:  What we've got here, Mr. Reischel,the question before us is the standard that the court ofappeals should have applied, as opposed to, perhaps, whatit did apply, not whether it was right or wrong in thisparticular case.          MR. REISCHEL:  Right, but --          QUESTION:  I was about to make the samesuggestion, and the discussion we're having, it seems tome, demonstrates quite clearly that an appellate court caninquire into this matter just as effectively as thedistrict court.          MR. REISCHEL:  As I read --          QUESTION:  You know, you're making points that16 1    are there on the record, and reflected in the record 2    material. 3              MR. REISCHEL:  Well, as I read Gasperini, 4    appellate courts are not allowed to weigh evidence.  Trial 5    courts are.  Appellate courts aren't.  Trial courts are 6    allowed only to -- 7              QUESTION:  Mr. Reischel, I'd like to clear the 8    air on Gasperini, because frankly I don't think it has 9    anything to do with this case.  I mean, Gasperini10    concerned New York's attempt to get a handle on excessive11    damages, and it did it -- instead of having a substantive12    cap it had a procedural way of doing it.13              Gasperini said, New York gave it to a court of14    appeals.  You can't do that in a Federal system because15    courts of appeals can't always see juries.16              MR. REISCHEL:  Weigh evidence.17              QUESTION:  The only one who can do it is the18    trial court judge, so Gasperini had to do with the control19    authority of a trial court judge.  It didn't have anything20    to do with the perspective that the court of appeals was21    to take vis-a-vis the trial court judge, and it didn't say22    anything about the difference between, if there is any23    between grant or denial, so I did not understand Gasperini24    to address this question.25              MR. REISCHEL:  No, Gasperini doesn't talk about17 1    the difference between grants and denials, but the 2    linchpin of Gasperini as I read it, in terms of assessing 3    facts, is, they're quoting Dagnello v. Long Island, 4    whether there has been -- there must be an upper limit, 5    and whether that has been surpassed is not a question of 6    fact with respect to which reasonable men may differ, but 7    a question of law. 8              As I read Gasperini, what the Court was saying 9    was -- and this was about excessive damages -- that trial10    courts can weigh things and examine things, but appellate11    courts must take the facts as given unless it's beyond the12    point where reasonable men can disagree.13              Here, I don't think there's a question, and I14    think that drives us to the standard that we propose,15    which is whether a reasonable judge could have come to16    this conclusion.  If a reasonable judge couldn't have,17    then there's room to disagree.18              QUESTION:  Well, there's a difference, too, when19    we're talking about --20              MR. REISCHEL:  There's no --21              QUESTION:  -- is the flaw the excessive damages,22    or is it some other thing that went wrong so that the23    wrong person won.24              Here, I take it it's the former, because the25    judge said, remittitur, or if you won't take the18 1    remittitur, a new trial, and I thought there was a legal 2    standard to govern remittitur.  That is, a trial judge is 3    supposed to set it at the maximum amount that a reasonable 4    jury could award on the basis of the evidence presented. 5    Isn't that the standard? 6              MR. REISCHEL:  That's correct.  That's correct, 7    and the judge thought, on the basis of the only competent 8    market evidence there could have only been a very modest 9    gain and not the sort of 49 percent per year gain that the10    jury awarded, much less the 124 percent per year gain that11    the financial expert projected.12              But the court did say several different things.13    Two rulings, the rulings on mitigation, which was a ruling14    that if, as Tri County testified, that they thought they15    were going to be $2 million a year in profits -- $216    million a year in profits from this new entity that they17    were going to set up -- is it reasonable for them to do18    absolutely nothing?19              They didn't respond to a letter inquiry about20    what their position was.  They didn't pay a $50 fine,21    which said on its face if you don't pay this your license22    is going to be suspended.  They didn't show up at a23    hearing, and they said --24              QUESTION:  Mr. Reischel, you're still arguing25    the merits of this particular ruling and what the court of19 1    appeals did with it, rather than fitting it into a 2    standard argument.  I mean, I don't think we're going to 3    decide here whether or not the court of appeals properly 4    reversed the trial judge's decision.  We're going to 5    decide whether it applied the right standard. 6              MR. REISCHEL:  Yes.  I do that in part, Your 7    Honor, to show what the circuit's test has boiled down to. 8              QUESTION:  But can you say, as -- I thought that 9    the only question that I saw was that the D.C. Circuit10    wrote one sentence that I thought was a throw-away line,11    frankly, where it said that there's a more searching12    inquiry when the judge grants a new trial motion than13    where he denies it.14              Then I thought to myself naively, where he15    grants a motion, the court of appeals has to see if he16    invaded, say, the credibility province of the jury, and17    where he denies it they don't have to do that job, so18    obviously it has to be more searching, and that stopped19    right there.20              All right, now, what's the response to that21    naive argument?22              MR. REISCHEL:  The response to that naive23    argument is, the D.C. Circuit's standard boils down to, if24    there's sufficient evidence to go to the jury, that's the25    end of the inquiry.20 1              QUESTION:  But why isn't that answer -- I have 2    the same question that Justice Breyer does, and why isn't 3    your answer, in effect, another answer of the sort, they 4    got it wrong in applying their standard? 5              I mean, you're saying, you know, what they were 6    really doing was something other than what the verbal 7    formula suggested, and maybe that's so, and maybe they 8    applied their verbal formula wrongly, but is the formula 9    itself, is the statement of the standard wrong?10              MR. REISCHEL:  The standard as the D.C. Circuit11    has explicated it, particularly in the Taylor case, which12    respondent cites at page 26 of its brief, explains what13    the D.C. Circuit understands, and it says that when a14    trial court sets aside a jury verdict, the appellate15    court's normal allegiance to the trial court falls away,16    and its allegiance is to the jury, and that drives them to17    the point, which they did in this case, of saying, if18    there's enough evidence to go to the jury, that's the end19    of the inquiry.20              QUESTION:  All right.  May I put my question in21    a different way?  I think it's the same question that22    Justice Breyer has been asking.  Here are two ways of23    looking at the problem, and after I've stated the two ways24    I'm going to ask you whether there is anything other than25    a verbal difference between them.21 1              One way of looking at the problem of trying to 2    derive a standard would be this way.  There is only one 3    standard for the appellate court to apply, and it's an 4    abuse of discretion standard.  When applying an abuse of 5    discretion standard to a denial of a new trial, it's 6    fairly easy, because we place great weight on the jury 7    verdict itself.  We place great respect on the jury8 verdict. 9              But when applying the abuse standard to a jury10    verdict -- I'm sorry, to an appellate -- to a trial court11    decision that grants a new trial, that vacates the12    verdict, we have to look very carefully at the facts and13    the record for the simple reason that we do have great14    respect for the jury verdict.15              In each case, we're applying the same standard,16    abuse of discretion, but in the two cases we have to look17    to different kinds, or at least to different degrees of18    factual data.  That's one way of looking at it.19              Another way of looking at it is to say, when a20    trial court in effect denies a new trial, we say, well,21    abuse of discretion.  That's all we look at.  But when a22    trial court grants the new trial we engage in reviewing it23    in a more searching inquiry because, in fact, we have24    great respect for the jury verdict.25              Is there any difference, except a verbal22 1    difference, between those two ways of looking at what an 2    appellate court does when it reviews a trial court's3 decision? 4              MR. REISCHEL:  There has been a difference in 5    application which has driven the appellate courts to ask 6    only, was there sufficient evidence to -- 7              QUESTION:  Well, is your answer then that the 8    way I put it there's nothing but a verbal difference, but 9    the way the courts are applying it, they are importing10    something beyond a verbal difference in the way they are11    applying it?12              MR. REISCHEL:  They are imposing a more13    stringent standard.  In a way the standard is more14    stringent anyhow, because the great weight of the evidence15    point is built into it when there's a reversal, and it's16    not built into it when there's a denial.17              QUESTION:  Well, what is your standard?  If the18    standard is not, was there sufficient evidence to go to19    the jury, which I assume is the same as saying, could a20    reasonable jury, on the basis of this evidence, have found21    for the plaintiff, if that is not the test that the22    appellate court is supposed to use in deciding whether it23    was wrongful for the trial court to set aside the jury24    verdict, then what is the test?25              Do you think the trial court can set aside the23 1    jury verdict even when a reasonable jury on these facts 2    could have found for the plaintiff in this amount? 3              MR. REISCHEL:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's Hornbook 4    law, that when -- even though there's sufficient evidence 5    to uphold a jury verdict, it can be set aside so long as 6    the trial court thinks it's against the great weight of 7    the evidence, and that goes back to Blackstone, whose test 8    was, was the judge reasonably dissatisfied therewith.9 Our --10              QUESTION:  The difference between insufficient11    evidence, which would be -- it used to be JNOV, but now12    it's -- judgment as a matter of law -- insufficient13    evidence is JNOV.  New trial is something -- is more14    discretion.1516171819202122    evidence.23              MR. REISCHEL:  And both kinds --24              QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. REISCHEL:  Precisely, Your Honor.  Courts ofappeals are substituting the matter-of-law test for thenew trial test, and that's exactly what --          QUESTION:  Aren't you overlooking somethingrather important?  It isn't only the weight of theevidence.  Sometimes an error of law was committed oneither refusing to admit evidence or erroneously admitting25              MR. REISCHEL:  -- Justice Stevens, were                                  241    committed here, but I do want to point out what the D.C.2    Circuit did.  They seemed to agree with the statement on3    page A-7 of our petition.  Tri County responds that it is4    improper now to assess the relative strength of the5    parties showings, and then they go on to say that it was6    error for the court to take it away from the jury.7              This is a directed verdict standard.  It's the8    wrong standard.  It negates what the trial court is doing,9    and an appellate -- the standard should be whether a10    reasonable judge could have come to the conclusion that11    this was contrary to the great weight of the evidence, and12    we believe that was clearly so here for two reasons, one13    because it was clearly unreasonable for a company that was14    going to get $2 million a year to do nothing whatsoever to15    protect that investment and because the forecast evidence16    of financial gain was so out of line with the market17    evidence that Tri County produced.18              QUESTION:  Then you would be satisfied in this19    case for us simply to say there is a difference between20    the JNOV standard and the great weight of the evidence21    standard.2223242525          QUESTION:  You can answer that yes or no andthen sit down.MR. REISCHEL:  No, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Okay.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Reischel.          Mr. Emig.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK J. EMIG                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. EMIG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          I find that the standard for granting a newtrial was suggested in the Honda Motor v. Oberg case,where, in situations involving excessiveness of a juryverdict, or a verdict against the clear weight of theevidence, could a national trier of the fact have reachedthe same conclusions as the jury?          If a rational trier of the fact could come tothat conclusion, then those traditional common law groundsfor granting a common law trial simply do not exist.          QUESTION:  But if a rational trier of fact couldnot have reached that conclusion, it isn't setting aside ajury verdict JMOL.  I mean, if a rational jury could notreach a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, it seems to methe case never should have gone to the jury in the first101112131415161718192021    place.2223 24 25          MR. EMIG:  That's correct.  It's probably a Rule50 disposition at that point.          QUESTION:  So you say there's no differencebetween JNOV and setting aside a jury verdict that's26 1    contrary to the great weight of the evidence.  I mean, 2    that's revolutionary, I think. 3              MR. EMIG:  No, I don't think I'm going to that 4    extent, Your Honor.  I think, though, that in situations 5    in which there is a verdict against the clear weight of 6    the evidence or excessive damage, you have an element of 7    sympathy or prejudice that is injected in the jury verdict 8    which makes it not tied to the specific facts of the case, 9    and for that reason the trial judge has some discretion10    and of course can grant a new --11              QUESTION:  But by hypothesis there a rational12    jury could reach a verdict in favor of the party whom it13    did, but there are other considerations brought to bear.14    You have great weight of the evidence, you know, improper15    admission, things like that, that permit the grant of a16    new trial where it would not have permitted the grant of a17    motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.18              MR. EMIG:  There are situations in which a new19    trial can be granted, you're correct, that deal with20    improper instructions, improper admissions of evidence, I21    would agree with that, but to the extent of a verdict22    being against the clear weight of the evidence, if a23    rational trier of fact could come to the same conclusion24    as that jury, then I don't think it should be set aside by25    a trial judge.271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Okay, but you also accept thedistinction that there is a distinction between whether anissue of damages can go to the jury, i.e., is there enoughevidence to get it to the jury, and on the other hand thequestion whether the jury's verdict of damages should beset aside as against the great weight of the evidencebecause it's excessive.          MR. EMIG:  Yes --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. EMIG:  -- I do see a distinction.          QUESTION:  Okay, well, if you do accept thatdistinction, then what is your criterion for whether itever gets to the jury or not?  I assume it is somethingdifferent, as you've just said, from the criterion ofwhether, after the jury verdict, the judge can declare anew trial.          MR. EMIG:  I think it --          QUESTION:  And I assume it is not, therefore,whether a rational jury, on the basis of this evidence,could reach that result, which is your standard for a newtrial.  So what is your standard for JNOV, then?          MR. EMIG:  Well, certainly the JNOV is phrasedin the light most favorable to the party that is seeking,or that the judgment is being sought against.          QUESTION:  Yes, but isn't the --                            28 1              QUESTION:  That's the distinction, that for JNOV 2    you do not have to view all the evidence in the light most 3    favorable to the plaintiff, that -- I'm sorry, for a new 4    trial you don't have to regard all the evidence in the 5    light most favorable to the plaintiff.  You're allowed to 6    sit back and evaluate it impartially. 7              MR. EMIG:  I think that -- 8              QUESTION:  That would be a distinction. 9              MR. EMIG:  That would be, and I think the rules10    under Rule 50 do talk in terms of phrasing it, or phrase11    it more in terms of in a light more favorable to the12    plaintiff, or to the --13              QUESTION:  What we've got here, Mr. -- some14    fundamentals first, and that is, a refusal of the trial15    judge to let the case go to the jury on the directed16    verdict against the plaintiff and a judgement as a matter17    of law, or call it that, or granting a motion for a18    judgment as a matter of law after the jury returns a19    verdict is the rational basis standard.  That is, no20    rational jury could have reached the verdict that this21    jury did, and that is not involved here, I take it.22              What we're talking about is the grant of a new23    trial by the trial judge, and by hypothesis, a rational24    jury could have reached a verdict but still have it set25    aside because it's against the great weight of the29 1    evidence, and the standard now we're talking, we want to 2    find out, when the trial judge grants a motion for a new 3    trial that way, what standard should the court of appeals4 apply? 5              MR. EMIG:  Well, I think the court has to decide 6    whether there is a conflict in the evidence.  Could a jury 7    reasonably have reached the conclusion, based upon the 8    evidence, that it did, and unless -- I would point out 9    this, also --10              QUESTION:  But you're just -- when you start11    talking about, could a reasonable jury have reached the12    result, you're back to the judgment NOV, or judgment MOL13    as they call it now, rather than weight of the evidence.14              MR. EMIG:  I think that's the only way I can15    explain how a trial judge should look at the evidence in16    terms of whether or not a new trial should be granted.  I17    would suggest it's certainly not the standard that the18    District of Columbia suggests, that a trial judge has19    unlimited discretion to grant a new trial as long as his20    view of the evidence is reasonable.                QUESTION:  Well, what is -- what should be the302122    standard?232425          MR. EMIG:  I think it should be the standardthat was referred to in the Honda v. Oberg case, a --could a rational trier of fact reach the same conclusion1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as the jury.          QUESTION:  What does Wright and Miller say?  Imean, this is a subject -- I can only remember -- it wasin my first year of law school, and all I remember fromthat is, they said, it's certainly different.  I might noteven remember that right.(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  I thought it was absolutelydifferent, and everything's changed since then anyway, sowhat do Wright and Miller and the people who write aboutthis say is the standard for giving a new trial, asopposed to a standard for giving a directed verdict?          MR. EMIG:  Well, I don't see them distinguishingthem.  I think that a number of the circuit court ofappeals cases talk in terms of whether, on great weight ofthe evidence --          QUESTION:  They use the words, great weight ofthe evidence?  What does Wright and Miller say?  What dothe writers -- this is a rather basic question, I think,that must be -- I can go look it up myself, but -- I will,too, but --(Laughter.)          MR. EMIG:  There's certainly some discretion,Your Honor, but at the same time, at no point in thisopinion from the district court does it ever say that this31 1    jury verdict is being set aside because it was against the 2    great weight of the evidence.  That is a term that is 3    foreign to this district court opinion, and the only 4    grounds that is asserted by the district court judge is 5    excessiveness on one point of view.  He does not rely on 6    the traditional, this is against the great weight of the7 evidence. 8              QUESTION:  Mr. Emig, well, that's perfectly 9    appropriate.  That's what the whole remittitur thing is10    about.  If the judge thinks that the verdict is excessive11    the judge can say, plaintiff, you either take a reduction12    or I'm going to order a new trial, and that is quite13    distinct from, was there sufficient evidence to go to the14 jury.15              MR. EMIG:  That's correct, except in this16    particular situation we know that it was not an17    excessive -- we knew that from the evidence that was18    presented of approximately $12 million that a rational19    trier of the fact could have brought back a verdict20    anywhere up to that amount.21              QUESTION:  But you're going back again to the22    sufficiency, and Rule 50 would never, if these two23    standards were so close, put the -- put on the district24    court the very difficult chore of having to say, now, if I25    reject the judgment as a matter of law, I have to rule32 1    alternatively, or if I grant the motion for judgment as a 2    matter of law I have to rule alternatively on the new 3    trial motion, so that making a district judge do that 4    would be cruel and unusual punishment if these weren't 5    discrete inquiries. 6              MR. EMIG:  Well, except that a trial judge must 7    be limited, I think, by the evidence to some extent when 8    he rules on whether or not a verdict is excessive, 9    otherwise he can call whatever verdict he wants and term10    it excessive, thereby nullifying a valid jury.  There has11    to be some basis other than the judge's characterization12 of --13              QUESTION:  Did this trial judge decide that he'd14    made an error in excluding evidence at trial, and15    therefore wanted to correct that error somehow?16              MR. EMIG:  He did, Your Honor, but the problem17    of that analysis was there was no proffer by the District18    of Columbia to show how the health and safety of this19    project could ever result in a revocation of the permit.20    The District of Columbia came into this trial with the21    expectation --22              QUESTION:  But at least the trial judge's ruling23    may have been based on his notion that he'd made a mistake24    by excluding certain evidence that the defendants offered.25              MR. EMIG:  That's correct, except that that331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conclusion was not supported by the evidence.          QUESTION:  Okay, well, you've shown us why youthink the trial judge's ruling was improper.  We're notthe court of appeals.  What standard should the court ofappeals have decided when it heard your argument?          MR. EMIG:  Well, I think it should have appliedan abuse of discretion standard.  The problem that I havewith this entire more searching inquiry, Your Honor, is,the D.C. Circuit has been using it for 30 years, and at nopoint in that course of time did they ever say, we areapplying it, that's changing the standard of review to astrict abuse of discretion.          QUESTION:  Well, certainly the term, moresearching inquiry, suggests they're going to be a littlemore demanding, or more willing to reverse the grant of anew trial than they will the denial of a new trial.          MR. EMIG:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And is there anything wrong with thatpoint of view?          MR. EMIG:  Well, I don't see any --          QUESTION:  It would help you here.          MR. EMIG:  I'm not sure it changed the standardof review.  The --          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. EMIG:  The review was still abuse of                            341    discretion.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yes, well, but as pointed out by someof my colleagues abuse of discretion, but being morewilling to reverse the grant of a new trial under somecircumstances than the denial of a new trial.          MR. EMIG:  I don't think they actually saythey're more willing to reverse --          QUESTION:  Well, but then, certainly, what doesa more searching inquiry mean, then?          MR. EMIG:  Well, I think it's a simplerecognition that we're dealing with a jury reaching acertain determination and the judge disagreeing andgranting a new trial.          QUESTION:  That is to way, there are just morethings in the record to review?          MR. EMIG:  I think it's just an indicationthey're being a little more careful, Your Honor.  Idon't --          QUESTION:  Do you --          MR. EMIG:  I don't think it really substantivelychanged the analysis of the case.  They said on threeoccasions they reviewed for abuse of discretion, nothingmore, and if they intended more searching inquiry to meanstricter abuse of discretion, they would have said it, butthey never --351              QUESTION:  Why do you think they said, more2    searching inquiry, then?345 mean? 67 8    dictionary and figure out for yourself what it means. 9              MR. EMIG:  I understand.  It certainly means, at10    the very least, a more close look at the evidence, but --11              QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's take a more close look,12    rather than more searching inquiry.  Both a pretty much13    the same thing, and it means a greater willingness to14    reverse in the case of grant of a new trial than denial of15    a new trial.16              MR. EMIG:  No, I disagree with that.  I think17    you're making a jump in terms of an outcome that is18    suggested by that standard that is not accurate. I  think19    it just -- it says we're going to look at it.  We're not20    favoring the plaintiff.  We're not looking at favoring the21    defendant.  We're just going to look at what happened more22 closely.23 24 25          QUESTION:  Well, you don't have to favor aplaintiff or a defendant in that sort of an equation.  Youfavor the person who got the jury verdict.36MR. EMIG:  Well, because I think --QUESTION:  What does more searching inquiryMR. EMIG:  They don't define that, and --QUESTION:  But it -- you can always go to a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. EMIG:  Well, I don't think it favors eitherthe jury verdict or the district court, which --          QUESTION:  Well, sure it does.  If you're goingto conduct a more -- look, if the plaintiff had thejudgment, any inquiry regarding the setting aside of thatjudgment which is going to be more searching is going tomake it more likely that that setting aside will be heldto be improper, so it will inevitably favor the plaintiffwhose jury verdict has been set aside.          MR. EMIG:  Or a defendant.  I mean, it's notalways the plaintiff.          QUESTION:  Yes, okay, whichever.  In the case ofa remittitur it's always going to be the plaintiff, but --          QUESTION:  Yes, but it's still true that eventhough it's more searching than the converse, it still hasto be an abuse of discretion, and an abuse of discretionstandard itself tends to protect the trial judge from101112131415161718    reversal.19202122232425          MR. EMIG:  An abuse of discretion is adeferential standard, I would agree, but at the sametime --          QUESTION:  Do you support the court of appealsdecision or do you not?  I can't tell from what you say.          MR. EMIG:  Oh, I do, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I thought you won, and I thought you371234    apparently.5              MR. EMIG:  No, I am.6              QUESTION:  I simply do not understand your7 argument.89 10 11MR. EMIG:  I am saying that they did --QUESTION:  Did they get it right?MR. EMIG:  They got it right.QUESTION:  And they said they applied a morewere here saying yes, they got it right.          MR. EMIG:  I --QUESTION:  But you're not saying that,12    searching inquiry, was that right?13              MR. EMIG:  Yes, that's correct.14              QUESTION:  So they did do that, and that's okay?15              MR. EMIG:  That's okay.16              QUESTION:  All right.17              MR. EMIG:  But my other point, too is, just18    looking under, if this verbal formulation was omitted from19    the opinion it would still be the correct result.  It was20    still an abuse of discretion by the trial court.21              QUESTION:  But if the court of appeals had not22    applied that standard, maybe it would not have been in23    your view the correct result.  Maybe they would have24    affirmed the trial court.25              MR. EMIG:  Well, I think --38 1              QUESTION:  You're saying that you don't mind if 2    we remand this for determination of the abuse of 3    discretion standard.  It doesn't make any difference. 4              MR. EMIG:  I think it's already been reviewed 5    under an abuse of discretion standard, but I would 6    secondly say that this Court affirms judgments, not 7    opinions, and that even if this Court were to find that a 8    stricter abuse of discretion standard was applied, the 9    result is still the same.  The district court abused its10    discretion.1112131415161718192021222324    trial.25              MR. EMIG:  Well, I don't think that this is39          QUESTION:  Then we shouldn't dismiss the writ asimprovidently granted.QUESTION:  You'd be happy with that, right?MR. EMIG:  Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Nothing turns on it.  But there isone feature of this, we go back for the Seventh Amendmentto how things were at common law, and at common law, as Iunderstand it, the appellate bench had no role at all inany of this, that it was the trial court, it could be thepoll court at Westminster, but here it's kind of an ironythat the appellate court that shouldn't have been in it atall is exercising muscle vis-a-vis the trial court that atcommon law had the only word on whether there be a new 1    completely out of the range of appellate review.  If -- 2              QUESTION:  But why, if you were adhering to the 3    model at the time that the Nation was formed, why wouldn't 4    you say the appellate court, whatever roles there are in 5    this, yours has got to be minimal, because you didn't even 6    have a say at common law. 7              MR. EMIG:  Well, I think you had a say to the 8    extent if an error of law was committed that could always 9    be appealed, but at the same time, the modern courts have10    allowed if the judge makes an error to have that decision11    set aside and a new trial, or the original jury verdict12    reinstated.13              QUESTION:  But the discretion on setting aside a14    verdict as against the weight of the evidence was15    entirely, as I understand it, in the hands of the trial16    bench.  Just, not any errors of law made, no errors in the17    charge, no errors, no reversible errors in the admission18    of evidence, but against the weight of the evidence was19    trial court business and not appellate business.20              MR. EMIG:  Well, I guess that depends on whether21    the en banc court was looked on as operating in an22    appellate capacity in reviewing the facts.23              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Emig, you didn't give us24    any assistance by discussing that common law in your25    brief, but I have scratched around and I think there was40 1    a -- you know, I dissented in Gasperini because I thought 2    that there was no review at common law, but what the 3    situation as I understand it was, was that there was no 4    review when the district judge, when the trial judge 5    refused to set aside the trial, but that there was review 6    in the situation we have here, when the trial judge did7 set aside. 8              There are several cases in which the appellate 9    court looked into whether that was proper or not, so10    I'm -- you know, I'm -- now, where does that leave me?  If11    I thought we were wrong in Gasperini, and there were12    several on this who joined me, in allowing appellate13    review at all -- we allowed appellate review there on the14    basis of abuse of discretion.  I guess to be consistent we15    should have an even stricter standard when there's review16    in the situation where the jury verdict is ignored, so I17    guess there should be something beyond abuse of18    discretion, or should -- I don't know.19              MR. EMIG:  Well, I -- my position in this, Your20    Honor, is that it was not set aside, the jury verdict,21    because it was against the great weight of the evidence,22    that there was no evidence in this case of damages.23              QUESTION:  You want to reargue your case.  Now,24    why did you take it as an assumption that if you lose on25    this issue it's going to go right back to the D.C.41 1    Circuit, if you lose on the issue which is in front of us, 2    which is not the issue that either of you apparently wants 3    to argue, and that's the issue about whether -- it says, 4    did Gasperini make unlawful the throw-away line that the 5    D.C. Circuit threw in. 6              Now, maybe we shouldn't be hearing that, but 7    we're hearing it, so my question concerns that, and I've 8    looked at Wright and Miller, and as I look at their 9    standards for new trial it strikes me that I understand10    very well your uncertainties, because what it says is,11    there are all kinds of verbal formulations all over the12    place, and you say the D.C. Circuit has adjusted to this13    over 30 years, and I expect other circuits have adjusted14    over similar periods of time to different verbal15    formulations, and if we start fooling around with those in16    this case, there is no matter so close to the heart of the17    trial bar, and suddenly we will discover different18    circuits doing different things in light of what we say.19              So if we say you're right on these words,20    searching inquiry, some other circuit is going to take21    that as a signal that they're wrong and, therefore, if we22    allow the D.C. Circuit to do what it did for 30 years,23    some other circuit will be unable to do what it has done24    for 30 years, so what do we do?25              MR. EMIG:  I think the one thing that can be42 1    done is simply to look at the opinion itself from the 2    district court granting the new trial and, if you feel 3    only an abuse of discretion standard is applicable and 4    should not be applied more strictly, does that opinion, in 5    and of itself, constitute an abuse of discretion. 6              QUESTION:  You want me to go back and look at 7    the facts here in your case, which I do not intend to do, 8    so ruling that out, what do I do? 9              MR. EMIG:  Then I think in that situation my10    position is, it's entirely unclear in terms of what they11    meant and how it was applied.12              QUESTION:  But I thought one of your arguments13    in answer to the petitioner was, petitioner, you knew all14    along that the D.C. Circuit is applying a stricter15    standard when it's reviewing grants than when it reviews16    denial.  You knew it, and you didn't tell the D.C. Circuit17    when you were before that court, so it's too late.  If you18    knew that they were going to apply a stricter standard to19    grants than denials, you should have told them, D.C.20    Circuit, don't do what you're doing for 30 years.  You21    didn't tell them that, so you effectively forfeited the22 point.23              You made that argument in your brief to us.24              MR. EMIG:  I did.25              QUESTION:  So you must think that this was a43 1    standard that had some bite to it. 2              MR. EMIG:  I think when we included it in our 3    brief we were simply asking the Court to pay close 4    attention to the facts of the case. 5              If D.C. thought that that entailed a stricter 6    abuse of discretion review, that should have been brought 7    up at that point and it could have been resolved one way 8    or the other by the court of appeals, but they had their 9    opportunity and all of a sudden it becomes a problem now,10    when the decision comes, and there's this verbal11    formulation of a more searching inquiry.12              But the fact of the matter is, the D.C. Circuit13    only says, abuse of discretion, and I think that under14    those circumstances that was the correct standard to15    apply, and that they were certainly entitled to review the16    record more carefully because a jury verdict had been set17    aside.181920212223242544CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Emig.MR.
