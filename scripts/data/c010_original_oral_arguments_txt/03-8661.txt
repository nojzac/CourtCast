NATHANSON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. NATHANSON:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          The trial judge found Melvin Smith not guilty onthe merits and unequivocally so.  That acquittal entitledMelvin Smith to repose.  Instead, what he got was a movingtarget.  The trial judge's later reconsideration ofSmith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that sameoffense twice.          Smith's position on the matter is completelyfaithful to this Court's precedent, and it makes sense inthe real-world practice of criminal law.          The State, on the other hand, asks this Court tomake exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittalsterminate jeopardy.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No.  Just to say that this --what happened here was not a final determination.          Take an analog -- an analogy to rule 54(b).  Thejudge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 You see, I'm going to give you a separate piece of paper2 that says judgment, but if I don't give you that separate3 piece of paper, even though I said judgment granted, it4 doesn't count until the very end of the case. I can5 always change my mind. Why shouldn't it operate the same6 way on the criminal side?7 MR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, obviously,8 that's a civil case. The Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't9 apply to civil cases. Second of all -- except with some10 rare exceptions.11 What I think the best way to -- to really define12 finality here -- and -- and whatever finality is, I really13 do think we -- we do have it here because this Court has14 said an acquittal under Martin Linen, a resolution,15 correct or not, of some or all if the factual elements --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I looked at Martin17 Linen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of18 acquittal entered. Here we have an endorsement on a19 motion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying --20 what does the entry say? Motion granted or something like21 that.22 MR. NATHANSON: Allowed, and it was attested by23 the clerk.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- this25 might be significant. Is there in Massachusetts, when a41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 motion for acquittal is granted and there are other2 charges still going on, is there a piece of paper that3 says, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?4 MR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor. The -- the5 formal rule, which is not always observed, but the formal6 rule is that it must be recorded on -- on the docket and7 announced in an open courtroom. That happened here.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have a State9 and the State has a statute, and the statute says any10 motion for acquittal may be granted by the -- the trial11 court at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that12 motion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by13 the district court at any time before -- or by the trial14 court at any time before the submission of the case to the15 jury. Then there's no repose element because the -- the16 defendant is on notice that this may not be final. What17 would be the -- your position in that case if a statute18 like that were on the books? And if you say that that's19 different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court20 of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial21 matter.22 MR. NATHANSON: Well, to answer the first23 question, I think that if -- if such a statute were24 enacted, I'm willing to grant, for purposes of this case,25 that it wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem. It may in51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a later case -- and you know, I'd be very interested inthat -- a problem under a combination of Jackson andWinship because the defendant may have a -- a right tothat determination.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay, well, let -- let's justassume that you've conceded that.  Now, you've beenguarded about it.  If we can do that by statute, why can'twe do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of-- Judicial Court of Massachusetts?          MR. NATHANSON:  Well, first of all, the SupremeJudicial Court of Massachusetts is the one who promulgatedthe rules in this case.  Rule 25(a) is promulgated by theSupreme Judicial Court of --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but they put a gloss onthe rule by their decision.          MR. NATHANSON:  Well, that was the MassachusettsAppeals Court, I might add.          Second of all, the rule itself requires that themotion shall be ruled upon at that time.  It says nothingabout reconsideration, and clearly --          JUSTICE BREYER:  They've held that in this case.We have a Massachusetts decision.  It's their law andunder their law in Massachusetts, the judge can revise it.          MR. NATHANSON:  Actually --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if it isn't their law,61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425then I don't know how -- why they affirmed this convictionrather than reversing it.          MR. NATHANSON:  I'm not sure I know either, YourHonor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, but I mean, I -- Itake it that it is their law, otherwise I'd see reversal,wouldn't I, and not affirmance?did --MR. NATHANSON:  Actually I think what theyJUSTICE BREYER:  What?          MR. NATHANSON:  -- Your Honor, is they assumedthat there was an error in -- in -- when dealing strictlywith the rule, at the -- at the end of the section dealingwith this, they assume that there was an error and said noprejudice, which I've contended in the brief --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so in other words,they're saying that in this case -- how could there not beprejudice?  He had another trial.  I mean -- how could --I don't understand this from beginning to end then.          But let me go back to my original question.What rule do you propose?          MR. NATHANSON:  As for finality, the rule Ipropose is, first of all, we have to start with the basicfoundation, which is an acquittal, under Martin Linen witha resolution --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'm saying is, for doublejeopardy purposes --          MR. NATHANSON:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- an acquittal in your view isan acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?          MR. NATHANSON:  There's -- there's three thingsthat I think Court should look at.  One, first of all,because we treat acquittals from the bench for doublejeopardy purposes the same as acquittals from a jury, aprosecutor can poll a jury immediately after the verdict.A prosecutor clearly --          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I'm asking you for a --I'd have to write -- if I agreed with you, I'd have to saywe have here a judge who changed his mind.  Under theclause of the Constitution, a judge cannot change his mindwhen.  Now, go ahead.  Now, fill in the blanks.          MR. NATHANSON:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  According -- I know what theirrule is.  Their rule is a judge can change his mind up tothe point that the jury is dismissed, something like that.I understand that.  Now, I want to know what your rule --is your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writesthe word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says,oh my God, I meant to say no acquittal?  Too late.  Toolate.  Okay, now, so I want to know what your rule is.  Is81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that the rule?MR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What is the rule?MR. NATHANSON: The -- your first question -- the constitutional point of no return, shall we say, is further proceedings. If there is an acquittal and there are further proceedings --JUSTICE BREYER: There is no further proceeding if he writes the word acquittal, I guess until he changes his mind. So 3 minutes later, he says I change my mind. Now there are further proceedings.MR. NATHANSON: Well, then at that point you look to other indicia of finality that this -- this Court referenced that in -- in Vincent, and that -- that's generally compliance with State procedure. Compliance with State procedures --JUSTICE BREYER: I need to write a simple rule. All I'm trying to get from you is what is your rule. Is your rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal -- an acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing left for the jury to do on that charge. That's what it means. When he writes the word acquittal, he cannot change it. Is that your rule?MR. NATHANSON: No. The rule is that the -- JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And what is your rule?91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. NATHANSON:  The rule is that the judgecannot change it, as a matter of Federal constitutionallaw, if there are further proceedings.  In a multi-countcase, count A is acquitted.  We initiate furtherproceedings on count B and C.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But your answer just isn'tresponsive.  When has it become final?          MR. NATHANSON:  It ripens at the --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  When?  When the judge sayssomething, when he writes something?  When does it becomefinal?  At what point in time?          MR. NATHANSON:  What I'm suggesting is --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What is your proposed rule?You haven't said yet.          MR. NATHANSON:  What -- what I'm suggesting is-- is two things.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Just one thing.  Just whendoes it become final?  Let's limit it to one thing.there arethat.MR. NATHANSON:  It -- it becomes final whenfurther proceedings initiated.JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.  I don't understandJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  That doesn't make sense.          MR.drawn by mostNATHANSON:  The -- the -- that is the lineof the lower courts.10Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  You're not understanding myquestion then.  Imagine a case in which a judge writes theword acquittal.  Now, half an hour later, he thinks, oh,my God, what have I done.  The jury is still sittingthere.  Of course, they're sitting there because he hasn'thad a chance to dismiss them yet.  They happened to behaving lunch or something.  Is it final?          MR. NATHANSON:  It is not final --          JUSTICE BREYER:  It is not final.          MR. NATHANSON:  -- if -- if the defense has notbeen forced at that point to choose to rest or put on acase.  That is the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Say that again.          MR. NATHANSON:  If the defense is forced to restor put on a case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But he wrote the wordacquittal.  There's nothing more for anybody to do untilhe changes the word.          MR. NATHANSON:  Well, I think we're talkingabout two separate things.  Is Your Honor's questionpresupposing a single-count case or a multi-count?          JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's try single-count.  Okay?          MR. NATHANSON:  Okay.          JUSTICE BREYER:  There he is.  He writes theword acquittal and the jury says, oh, what do we do now? 111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Go home, says the clerk.  Now, before they can get out thedoor or anything else happens, before they get out thedoor, he says, oh, my God, I made a mistake.  Can he dothat under your rule?          MR. NATHANSON:  I'm not entirely sure of theanswer to the question, Your Honor, but I -- I think,first of all, we look at compliance with State procedure.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  What I thought fromreading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule-- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it.If he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind.Now, that rule to me is inconsistent with most law.          MR. NATHANSON:  If we're talking about aclerical error, Your Honor, the Massachusetts rules andthe Federal rules provide for correction of clericalerrors.  What -- what we're talking about here is not aclerical error, but the judge clearly intended to do whatshe did.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, was your client --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But a very plain error --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- was your client prejudicedin any way by not putting on some evidence that the -- hewould have put on?          MR. NATHANSON:  May I begin, Your Honor --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Just answer the question for121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 once.2 MR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there3 was a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being4 aware that the judge was going to, at some point --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a terribly risky6 defense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I7 didn't do it, somebody else did it. How could he then8 turn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the9 jury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have10 the gun? I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do11 that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the12 other guy, it wasn't this defendant? And then to make13 this defense that he had a right to possess this gun14 because he belonged in the house, that would be15 extraordinary.16 MR. NATHANSON: Your Honor, counsel for co-17 defendant, Felicia Brown, presented just such a defense18 and she was acquitted. She presented the defense that19 Melvin Smith did not shoot Christopher Robinson, but if20 Melvin --21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody charged her with22 possessing a gun.23 MR. NATHANSON: But what I'm saying is --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- look, there were a25 lot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 is a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of2 events so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses3 doesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to4 the possession of a gun. That's -- that's all that it is.5 MR. NATHANSON: What I'm saying is that it6 wasn't risky, Your Honor, because the -- this jury was7 willing to consider an alternative defense that would have8 otherwise appeared as a concession. They did not take it9 as a concession.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he would be -- the11 defendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and12 the jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law13 pleader. I didn't borrow the kettle. It was broken when14 I got it. Or, I returned it unbroken. To -- to do that, to15 say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then,16 jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that17 I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a18 criminal defense.19 MR. NATHANSON: I'd just respectfully disagree,20 Your Honor. But -- but the -- the larger point is if we21 allow this rule in general, we are going to engender22 serious problems. I'm saying that there -- that there was23 some reliance here, but we're going to engender much more24 serious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps25 presents a defense that is helpful to the remaining141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 charges, but damaging on the acquitted charge.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if -- if -- you3 know, we shape the expectation by what we say. If -- if4 we say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling5 and as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any6 kind of reliance is -- is misplaced.7 MR. NATHANSON: What Massachusetts law says in8 -- in the Zavala case, they said that there is not a right9 to reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence10 is insufficient.11 Second of all --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That is when the case is not13 ongoing. I mean, here we had a case that was continuing14 and -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which15 is common at the trial level. I mean, these decisions --16 she made this decision in a split second. Maybe she was17 too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk18 went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial19 Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so20 of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't21 prejudice.22 The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it23 came up at closing. Right? So if the defendant was24 prejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute,25 judge, I want to put on that defense that I really was151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 there but I had a right to have the gun.2 MR. NATHANSON: He didn't say that, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. So he --4 so I don't see that you have a realistic claim of5 prejudice.6 MR. NATHANSON: Well, I -- I don't think7 prejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence.8 Either the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or9 he has not.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to set a --11 a point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not12 exactly clear, but there's one point that says when the13 jury is discharged. Then there may be other reasons why14 there's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't15 permit it, other than double jeopardy. But if -- why16 isn't that a sensible place to draw the line?17 MR. NATHANSON: Because if -- if discharge of18 the jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an19 acquittal at any point in a defendant's case. 2 weeks20 into a defense case, the judge could reconsider an21 acquittal.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question -- we're talking23 about a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you24 pointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate25 court. Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 interpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule2 allows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as3 long as there's no prejudice to the defense. That's what4 our rule means.5 MR. NATHANSON: I don't think that's6 permissible, Your Honor. It -- it is -- granted, for7 purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for8 States to order judges to withhold rulings, that there9 shall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence10 prior to the return of a jury verdict. Louisiana, for11 example, does that, and I think Oklahoma.12 But for the Supreme Judicial -- Judicial Court13 of Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is14 simply straight contravening what this Court has said.15 It's -- it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you do agree, I take it,17 that if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't18 a scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm --19 I'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do20 it now just in case I have a second thought, but at least21 by the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you,22 I take it, concede that that is permissible.23 MR. NATHANSON: I think that is permissible24 because --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that -- if that's171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 permissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be2 the way trials are conducted when -- when there are mid-3 trial motions like yours? Every judge is going to say,4 yes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll5 -- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and6 then I'll rule. That's -- that's the way they're all7 going to respond, isn't it?8 MR. NATHANSON: No, I don't think so, Your9 Honor. I think judges are -- are intelligent people.10 They read the pleadings beforehand. Justice Donovan11 clearly read the pleading beforehand in this case, and she12 -- she was prepared to ask for argument on it. I don't13 think that judges do these things so precipitously that14 they are not going to be confident in their ruling.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but every judge knows he16 drops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to17 guard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating18 an appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious19 and hold onto it.20 MR. NATHANSON: And judges should be cautious,21 Your Honor.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also important to23 know, though, whether the defendant has to put on a case24 or not? So he can't just reserve judgment. I'll tell you25 after the trial is over whether you should put a case on181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425or not.          MR. NATHANSON:  That -- that is, in fact, thepoint, Justice Stevens.  The Double Jeopardy Clause is aconstitutional policy of finality for the defendant'sbenefit.  He -- that's what this Court said in Jorn.  Thedefendant has to know whether he -- he's defending a case.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But does -- does --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the defendant here ask tobe -- to have the right to reopen?          MR. NATHANSON:  He did not.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  May I ask --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Did he --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- you another question here?There -- there were three charges against your client, asI understand it.

NATHANSON:  Yes.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, he was given concurrentsentences.          MR. NATHANSON:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is that correct?          MR. NATHANSON:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So would you explain to me ifthere's any practical effect to your winning in this case?          MR. NATHANSON:  There is a practical effect.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What is it?          MR. NATHANSON:  Firearm possession offenses inMassachusetts have restrictions as to parole and good timedeductions that the other offenses do not have.  So thereis a practical effect, aside from the fact that it's a --it's a conviction on his record, Your Honor.          Moving on, Justice Breyer, just to address thequestion that you were asking me, I think perhaps a goodway to phrase it is -- is if the first factual resolutionof the elements of -- of the offense results in acquittal,there can be no further proceedings.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What I was thinking is -- Imean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in thetrial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, isthere any evidence here that this was less than theshotgun -- this was not a shotgun.  You know, it had to be201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 a barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence2 here of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there3 was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there4 aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's5 thinking, something may be missing here. She's a little6 uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few7 minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there8 was all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't9 have done that.10 I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a11 hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she12 supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because13 after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a14 case? Or is she supposed to enter something and think,15 well, I could change my mind before it's over? Or what is16 she supposed to do? She just thinks she made a mistake.17 MR. NATHANSON: So your hypothetical is that18 there's evidence of two guns?19 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought here there was20 evidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.21 MR. NATHANSON: I'm sorry. Yes, in this case --22 JUSTICE BREYER: There was evidence it was a23 pistol. So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that24 there was evidence. That's beside the point, but I'm --25 I'm just using it as an example where a judge might think211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 she made a mistake. She thought there was no evidence2 that it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that3 there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a4 shotgun.5 MR. NATHANSON: She -- she clearly didn't6 forget. The prosecutor said to her the evidence was7 testified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it8 was a .32 --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm quite sure -- not10 quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence11 it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. And now a12 few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is,13 it couldn't have been that good. Or maybe she thinks that14 that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now.15 What's the line? Suppose she thinks of it a second from16 now. Suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal,17 she thought, oh, my God, a pistol is not a shotgun. Of18 course, it isn't. I know that. I better change it. Is19 it a second from now? Is it she can never change it no20 matter what once the pen leaves the paper? What's your21 rule?22 MR. NATHANSON: In a single-count case, Your23 Honor --24 JUSTICE BREYER: Whether it's single-count or25 double-count or triple-count. I want to know what -- how221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 you see it, not how I see it.2 MR. NATHANSON: It -- compliance with State3 procedure informs the inquiry and once -- once we have4 what is determined to be a resolution --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once it's final under State6 procedure, right? And you also would add once there's no7 clerical error. She didn't mistakenly say, you know,8 affirm when she meant to write deny. Leaving that aside,9 once it's 10final under State procedure, it's final.MR. NATHANSON:  That's correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA:  And sometimes it's wrong.MR. NATHANSON:  That's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it'd be sometimes wrong no11 12 1314 matter how you define final. I mean, you know, she15 let's --16 JUSTICE BREYER: That's excellent.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let's all the evidence on18 and -- and does it after all the evidence is there, and19 then she -- and then at the close of all the evidence, she20 gives a directed verdict for -- for the defendant, and21 then discharges the jury, and as soon as the jury walks22 out, oh, my God, what a mistake I made. Too bad. Right?23 I mean, we say double jeopardy.24 MR. NATHANSON: Correct, Your Honor. That's25 what --231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Excellent.  That was anexcellent answer.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I would like to know,given that answer, why is this final under State procedurebecause it seems as if the State courts of Massachusettshave said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go andlook into this again.  She can change her mind.  Andthat's what I'd like you to focus on because I agree thatthat was a good explanation of the rule.this --MR. NATHANSON:  If -- if State procedure, as inJUSTICE BREYER:  I'm thinking of this case.MR. NATHANSON:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose I took Justice Scalia'srule and I said, that's the rule.  Now, I would say that'sthe rule of a Federal law.  Very well.  That turns on yourdecision here being final as a matter of State law, but itseems to me we have State courts here saying, at least fordouble jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter ofState law.  And therefore, I want to know how we reachyour conclusion here.          MR. NATHANSON:  Well, there's -- there clearlyis a line beyond which the State cannot go, and that'swhat Justice Brennan was talking about in his concurrence241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 in Lydon. He said the -- the State cannot fashion a2 procedure whereby the judge never discharges the jury, and3 in -- in Kepner, this Court held that the Philippine4 procedure of withholding finality from an acquittal in a5 bench trial also violated the Constitution. So State6 procedure does not control. It is sufficient but not7 necessary.8 If -- if you comply with State procedure to say9 this is -- this is an acquittal, okay, it's an acquittal.10 If you do not comply with State procedure, it can still be11 an acquittal under Federal law.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the State have the power13 to say whether -- whether an acquittal under State law14 constitutes an acquittal for purposes of Federal15 constitutional double jeopardy purposes? Is16 law question or a Federal question?1718 question, 192021 Smalis quite clearly.22 If I -- if I may, two things and then I'd like23 to reserve. But the -- the State would have this Court24 draw a distinction between acquittals by a judge and25 acquittals by a jury. That simply has been rejected by251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMR. NATHANSON:  No.  It -- it is aYour Honor.  This Court --JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it was.MR. NATHANSON:  -- this Court saidFederalthat inthat a State￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this Court numerous times.  Sanabria, Rumsey.  Anacquittal is an acquittal.          Again, the -- the State would have this Courtdraw distinctions between acquittals based on law andacquittals based on fact.  Sanabria unequivocally rejectedthat.  Sanabria says that in fact sufficiency of theevidence is not a legal defense.  An acquittal is anacquittal.          If there are no further questions, I'd like toreserve the balance of my time.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          Ms. Neaves.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHRYN A. NEAVES                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MS. NEAVES:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          I'd like to start with where the Court left offon the notion of reconsideration and finality.  TheMassachusetts Appeals Court here specifically stated thata judge's right to reconsider his or her legal rulings isfirmly rooted in the common law and permitted JudgeDonovan in this case to reconsider her legal ruling thatthe evidence was insufficient.  Certainly that common lawright of reconsideration could not run afoul of thisCourt's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 court specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause2 was not violated because there was no second proceeding3 and that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted4 to reconsider her ruling.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if this had6 been the sole count, the gun possession count had been the7 sole count, and -- and the same ruling had been made by8 the judge? Would you say that there was double jeopardy9 attaching or not?10 MS. NEAVES: Not so long as the jury was still11 there. If the prosecutor had the opportunity to say,12 Judge Donovan, give me 10 minutes, I know there's a13 Supreme Judicial Court case on the point that I'm arguing14 to you, which is that you did not need a witness to15 directly testify that the gun barrel length was less than16 16 inches, I know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take17 a recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the18 prosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and19 the judge said, absolutely, you're -- you're correct, I'm20 going to send the charge to the jury, there's no double21 jeopardy violation there.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what if it's a bench trial?23 MS. NEAVES: A bench trial is a very difficult24 situation. And the Smalis case certainly seems to be the25 hardest case here, but bench trials present different -- a271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425different situation because the judge is both the fact-finder and the law-giver.  And in that context, it's muchmore difficult --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know it's difficult.  What'syour answer?          MS. NEAVES:  My answer to that is I believe thatif the judge stated the evidence is insufficient, as -- asthe judge did in Smalis, as the trier of fact and law, Ifind the evidence --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's over.          MS. NEAVES:  It's over.  It's over.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The minute --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  What if in the case --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the minute he --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- we have before us the Stateallowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of theprosecution right after the judge's ruling?          MS. NEAVES:  In a jury case, Your Honor?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MS. NEAVES:  I think --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Conceivably they could allowan interlocutory appeal from a judgment of acquittal atthe close of the prosecution's case.          MS. NEAVES:  If such a -- if such a processcould be put in place where there was an appellate panel281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that would be willing and available to hear that while thejury remained empaneled, I don't think it would run afoulof the Double Jeopardy Clause.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But is that necessary?  I -- Imean, that's what I think is the difficult question here.Can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court,but it's not final in respect to the judge having a rightto change his mind within the court?  That -- that makes alot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible toget there.          Why not?  I -- I think, well, the reason is thatyou want judges to be able to reconsider things and youdon't have that problem when you're talking about anappeal.          MS. NEAVES:  That is --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Or is there any -- is thereany, in other words, to reconcile our case that you'retalking about, Smalis?          MS. NEAVES:  The Smalis case?          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.          MS. NEAVES:  I think there are a number of waysto reconcile it.  Certainly Massachusetts' position isthat it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425trial, but there is also no doubt that the case left thetrial court and went up on appeal.  I think both of thosefactors are significant.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but isn't -- isn't thesignificance supposedly the existence or nonexistence ofour continuation of the jury panel, going back to JusticeStevens' question?  And what if the -- what if the Statehad a procedure whereby the trial judge would simplydecline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal weretaken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tippedover, it could come right back to the same jury panel?Would -- would the -- would the answer have to bedifferent?          MS. NEAVES:  I don't think it would.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why?          MS. NEAVES:  I think -- I think for a -- I thinkfor my -- to my way of thinking about the cases, the juryis what matters and it's the defendant's right to hisparticular tribunal, and that's the first jury that'sempaneled --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but on my hypothesis he'sgoing to get the same jury.          MS. NEAVES:  Exactly.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  They have not been discharged.          MS. NEAVES:  Exactly.  So I would say that it301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 would not be a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause,2 and that's why --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. It goes all the way up on4 appeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I5 guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or6 while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is7 overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and8 recommences the trial? Wow.9 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that's so, then10 why shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way? Because11 they can send it right back to exactly the same judge.1213 fact, and 1415 fact.161718 before, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and19 it can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem. In20 Smalis, it's going to be the same judge. It was a bench21 trial. It should have come out the other way.22 MS. NEAVES: Well, I think the difference is the23 -- the judge in Smalis was the trier of fact. He made a24 rule -- he is both the trier of fact and the law-giver.25 He's decided that the evidence is insufficient. If that311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMS. NEAVES:  Because he -- he is the trier ofI think at that point --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, the jury is the trier ofMS. NEAVES:  That's --JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, on the hypothesis￼1 case goes up on appeal, that is -- that is factual -- that2 is oversight of his factual determination in essence.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it ordinarily true --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is another -- is another5 difference -- and I don't know if this -- is another6 difference that in the hypothetical case with the jury,7 the jury has not yet deliberated --8 MS. NEAVES: Thank you.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY:10 facts.11 MS. NEAVES: Yes.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY:13 JUSTICE STEVENS:14 JUSTICE KENNEDY:15 is -- is --16 JUSTICE STEVENS:17 JUSTICE KENNEDY:18 JUSTICE STEVENS:19 MS. NEAVES: That's where I was headed.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this case the judge did21 not reconsider until the end of the defense case?22 MS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Stevens.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, during that period, did24 the defense lawyer have the right to rely on the acquittal25 in deciding whether or not to put in defensive evidence on321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO-- in order to consider theWhereas in your --Yes, but ---- your case, the -- the judgeMay I ask this?-- apparently deliberating --Is it not true that in this --￼1 the count from which he thought his client had been2 acquitted?3 MS. NEAVES: Well, he certainly had some sense4 of reliance, but it wasn't a double jeopardy reliance.5 And I would -- I would point the Court to --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if the Double7 Jeopardy Clause did apply, if it were treated as a true8 acquittal, he could just say, well, we can forget about9 that, send your witnesses home, we won't have to worry10 about it.11 I understand under your view they could send the12 witnesses home, and a week -- a week later the judge could13 say, well, we haven't submitted it to the jury, I've14 decided to change my mind. You could bring all those15 witnesses 1617 think -- 1819 thinks --20 able to change his mind as long as the jury is still21 there? Yes.22 MS. NEAVES: Yes.23 JUSTICE BREYER: Should you24 appeal in the same circumstance while25 there? No.back.  That's the way you think it should work.MS. NEAVES:  Absolutely, Justice Stevens.  And IJUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what about a judge whoshould the judge -- should a judge in trial be331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005be able to take anthe jury is still￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Now, suppose a judge thinks both those things.Is that judge, like me, for example, hopelessly confused?(Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is the judge thinkingcontradictory things or is there a way of reconcilingthose two instincts?          MS. NEAVES:  I -- Justice Breyer, I -- Icertainly believe that the -- that the double jeopardyrule that we're -- we're advocating would permit that, butI -- I think that most trial judges would not be verypleased about doing something like that.  And practicallyspeaking, there's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  By the way, if it'sconstitutional, it's pretty easy to see a State might wellsay, let's do that, what a good idea.  I mean, they mightthink it's a good idea.  I don't know what people think isa good idea.  We'll provide for interlocutory appealsright in the middle of cases because the prosecution cannever appeal at the end of the case.  That's reallyunfair.  And we'll do this little thing here, and that waywe give the prosecutor a chance.          MS. NEAVES:  I -- I have to stick with the rulethat -- that --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  You think it's --I'm just inconsistent.341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼12 it's -- I3 that jury4 Double Jeopardy Clause and permitting a trial judge to5 reconsider a legal ruling up to that point, then if a6 State court could fashion an interlocutory review process7 of that legal ruling, that would not violate the Double8 Jeopardy Clause.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the conceptual basis10 for saying that jury discharge makes the difference? Why11 is that the touchstone?12 MS. NEAVES: I think this Court has said over13 and over again that it is the jury -- the defendant's14 right to hold onto his chosen jury that matters in a15 number of different contexts in the double jeopardy area.16 This Court has drawn the line at attachment of jeopardy17 when the jury is empaneled and sworn based on the18 historical value of a defendant having that particular19 jury resolve the government's case against him. And so I20 think that it matters, particularly where a motion for a21 required finding is not constitutionally mandated. It's a22 tool that --23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would think prejudice to24 the defendant should be a factor, and if the defendant is25 misled by what the judge says into not putting on part of351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMS. NEAVES:  I think it -- I -- well, it's --think if -- I think if you accept the notiondischarge is what matters for purposes of the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the case that otherwise would have been put on, that's apretty serious matter.          MS. NEAVES:  That is a very serious matter, andit is the sort of prejudice that falls within the rubricof due process and -- and --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but we usually don't use --          MS. NEAVES:  -- would grant you a retrial.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- we don't use the -- I mean,you could use the Due Process Clause for everything, fordouble jeopardy, for all of the other protections in theConstitution.  I think our cases say if -- if there's aproblem that has been created by ignoring the doublejeopardy rules, you don't solve that problem by -- by thedeus ex machina of the Due Process Clause.correct.MS. NEAVES:  No.  That's -- that's exactlyJUSTICE BREYER:  What about --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this a problem created bythe judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had everyreason to rely upon as being the end of that part of thecase.  I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, infairness it's a -- it's a double jeopardy problem, not adue process problem.          MS. NEAVES:  Well, with respect, Justice Scalia,I would say it is the sort of reliance that a -- that a361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 defendant may have, as for example the case in Sanabria,2 where a -- where a judge excludes certain evidence, and3 the case goes forward. And as a result of that -- a4 result of that decision, the judge in that case granted a5 motion for acquittal. And at the end of the case, the6 prosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of7 the evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to8 go ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically9 said if I had let it back in, I would have vacated my10 motion for required finding and allowed the case to go to11 the jury. So that sort of prejudice -- a defendant has an12 expectation of certain things that may or may not happen13 at trial, but the remedy outside of the double jeopardy14 context, if the defendant is acquitted, is a retrial.15 The drastic remedy of double jeopardy is -- is16 used when a defendant has been subjected twice to a trial17 before a second trier of fact. This -- this Court has18 been consistent that when the government subjects the19 defendant over and over again before a second --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you correctly21 to say that if the defendant is acquitted, the remedy is a22 retrial?23 MS. NEAVES: No, no, no. I'm sorry, Justice24 Stevens. No. Only if the defendant is convicted is the25 remedy a retrial because, indeed, if the jury acquits him,371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there is no harm at all.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the reason you didn'twant a fairly simple rule that I was thinking of?  I'lltell you what it is and you'll tell me honestly why youdon't.          It's final.  The word acquittal is -- is finalif the jury has been discharged or the decision is sent toanother body for review.  One or the other.          MS. NEAVES:  I could live with that rule.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, so you haven't foundsomething in your research that suggests that -- that --          MS. NEAVES:  No, no.  Our position has beenconsistent.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under -- under that viewof things, suppose in this -- in this case there's amotion for acquittal and the judge says, yes, I -- I thinkthere's no evidence on the gun.  Then the prosecutor saysI want 10 minutes because I think there's a case on it.Then he says, you know, there's a case and I think itcovers this, and the judge says, well, I think you may bewrong.  I'll let you reopen to put on evidence of -- ofthe gun.  What would -- what would be the result in thatcase?          MS.trial and theNEAVES:  I think that because if it's a jurycase is still -- and the jury is still38Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 there, it could be done without violating the Double2 Jeopardy Clause.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you have to say that4 under your view.5 MS. NEAVES: I think so. I think honing -- what6 this Court has talked about in honing is -- is refining a7 case before a second trier of fact. And as a matter of8 Massachusetts' procedures, certainly the prosecution may9 be able to reopen if there's good faith or mistake, but10 for purposes of --11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did the12 Massachusetts Supreme Court say -- and I thought it did13 say this in its rules -- trial judge, you rule on the spot14 when a motion to acquit is made? We will not allow you to15 reserve judgment. Because the normal thing would be a16 trial judge would say, why should I decide this17 definitively now? I'll wait till the end of the case.18 But as I understand the Massachusetts rules, it says,19 judge, you can't reserve on a motion to acquit. You must20 rule immediately.21 MS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,22 and if I misunderstood the hypothetical, that -- that was23 my mistake. As a matter of Massachusetts law, a trial24 judge does not have that option. She must rule on the25 motion before the defendant decides to put on the case,391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 and that is what happened here.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so part of Justice3 Breyer's question needs editing because it would not be4 possible under Massachusetts law for the judge to say --56789 points toMS. NEAVES: That is correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I reserve.MS. NEAVES: That is correct. She could not. And -- and if I could just highlight a couple of -- to demonstrate the significance of -- of10 permitting trial judges the ability to reconsider legal11 rulings. In Massachusetts, the fact that there's a12 written motion here is quite unusual. These motions are13 made orally generally. The prosecution is not given an14 opportunity -- does not -- there's no requirement that he15 be given advance notice ever. There's no requirement of16 that. The prosecution argues in opposition to the motion17 on the spot, and the judge rules on the spot.18 And -- and I think that -- that procedure is19 demonstrated quite clearly here. The -- the defendant20 filed the motion. The prosecution did, indeed, argue the21 correct response, legal response, did not have a case at22 hand and as --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your position would be the same24 if the -- if the Massachusetts law provided that the25 motions at the end of the prosecution's case shall not be401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ruled on unless -- after they're written briefs filed byboth sides and they have 3 days of argument.  You'd stillhave the same position.          MS. NEAVES:  That's true.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And in fact, the -- the quickand dirty procedure you describe is probably a boon toprosecutors because a judge is -- is not likely to takethe serious step of dismissing a charge on the basis of --of such a procedure and is more likely to say, well, we'lllet the trial go ahead and see what the evidencediscloses.  I mean, I can't imagine that this is not aboon to the prosecutor rather than, as you -- as you seemto paint it here, a disadvantage.          MS. NEAVES:  I -- I wouldn't want tocharacterize --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a very unusual judge Iwould think to --          MS. NEAVES:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to whip it out like that and-- and enter an acquittal without -- without letting it goforward.          MS. NEAVES:  I would say it is unusual, but ithappens where -- and I think the trial judge certainly inthis case who believes that if she's mistaken, can -- cancorrect her ruling and send it to the jury, then feels411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 somewhat free to -- to do what the defendant asks, if it2 seems reasonable, and -- and knows that if -- if it can be3 corrected --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: You may -- you may regret what5 you've asked for.6 MS. NEAVES: I hope not, Justice Scalia. I hope7 not.8 I think --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen -- I think10 one of the briefs suggested that suppose you have a multi-11 defendant case and the judge says, after the prosecution12 case is done, defendant A, I'm going to grant a motion to13 acquit. He's out of it, but there was enough evidence to14 require the -- the defense to go on for B and C. And then15 after hearing B and C's defense, the judge said, I think I16 was wrong about acquitting A, so I'm -- I'm going to17 withdraw it. Would there be -- could that be done without18 any -- any double jeopardy bar? The jury hasn't been19 discharged.20 MS. NEAVES: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it21 presents a double jeopardy bar, but a defendant has a22 right to be present at his trial, and so it certainly23 would be a reversible error if -- if a trial judge --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the -- he's25 sitting there. Defendant A is sitting there throughout421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the whole trial.          MS. NEAVES:  Then there's certainly no doublejeopardy bar to that.          JUSTICE BREYER:  There could be a problem thatyou have to have a fair chance to present evidence and soforth.          MS. NEAVES:  Absolutely, Justice Breyer, and --and --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I guess there are a lot ofrules in Massachusetts that deal with that.  They can't --you have to be fair to the defendant in -- is that right?          MS. NEAVES:  Well, certainly.  Rule 25 itselfspecifically states that the defendant shall have theopportunity to present evidence after the motion is deniedor allowed in part without reserving that right.  Socertainlythat option is available.Unless the Court has further questions.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Ms. Neaves.MS. NEAVES:  Thank you.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. -- Mr. Srinivasan.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN          MR.may it pleaseSRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andthe Court:43Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT￼1 The trial court in this case was permitted to2 correct its erroneous ruling in favor of the defendant on3 the motion for judgment of acquittal. Because the4 prosecution is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to5 prove its case, that's a value --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same7 question I asked your -- your colleague? Supposing we're8 not in Massachusetts, but we're in another State that9 provided for an interlocutory appeal immediately after the10 judge's ruling in this case. Would -- would you have the11 same appraisal of the case on those facts?12 MR. SRINIVASAN: Would we have the same13 appraisal as the State? We don't --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Would you still say it15 was not final, even though it was sufficiently final for16 appellate purposes?17 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. We -- we think that the18 Court's holding in Smalis applies equally to jury trials19 and to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory20 appeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be21 permissible. But we also think that there is a sound22 basis for drawing a distinction between --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question is assuming a24 State procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was25 permissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 would bar that appeal.2 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, because we read that to3 be the holding of Smalis.4 But we think there's a basis for distinguishing5 between appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings6 before the initial tribunal on the other hand. First of7 all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v.8 Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of9 adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that10 case was permissible because it entailed continued11 proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an12 appeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically13 distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United14 States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate15 review.16 And the other basis for drawing a distinction17 between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the18 trial court on the other is historical tradition. I think19 the Court could look to history and history would show20 that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent21 authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because22 the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial23 courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of24 justice require trial courts to have the authority to25 revisit their mid-trial rulings.451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you allow a2 trial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution3 to reopen 45 it raises6 served by7 interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its8 evidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial9 judge were permitted to reopen the case to give thethe case?MR. SRINIVASAN:  We would, Justice Kennedy, buta distinct problem because one value that'sthe Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's10 prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate11 that interest.12 Now, we still think that the proper line is jury13 discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would14 present a distinct interest.15 Now, with respect to historical tradition on16 appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the17 government has lacked authority at common law to take an18 appeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on19 that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United20 States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v.21 the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why22 the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the23 government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite24 narrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a25 distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the2 Court often looks at history to shape the contours of3 double jeopardy protections. And that would afford the4 case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while5 appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court6 reconsideration should be permitted.7 And I think the lens through which the Court8 would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the9 valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and10 fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while11 that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal,12 because the Court held as13 exclude reconsiderations.14 JUSTICE SOUTER:15 prosecution gets its full16 a rule that says to trial17 on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not18 make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've19 done it, it sticks? Why -- why doesn't the prosecution20 have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule?21 Everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are22 going to be careful.23 MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, we think a24 constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness25 of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects.471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOmuch in Smalis, it doesn't Why -- why doesn't the -- theand fair opportunity if we havejudges, when you make a ruling￼1 First, the line between a definitive ruling and2 a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've3 outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a4 variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases5 where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on6 a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that7 ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which8 page of the transcript you happen to be looking at.9 But even if we're dealing with a situation in10 which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of11 the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court12 might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively13 but still be incorrect. Trial courts make mistakes.14 That's why this issue comes up as often as it does. For15 example, in this case --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: All these cases -- we've17 had several, not too many over the -- the whole line of18 cases -- and the trial judge has always committed a rather19 plain error. And we all have the case where if you just20 try to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say21 no. A case just like this. The judge made a mistake, but22 we've always said that's not something we -- we look at.23 MR.24 I'm following25 because --1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400SRINIVASAN:  I don't -- I'm not quite surewhat you're saying, Justice Stevens,48Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I say as a typical matterthese double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which thejudge made a rather plain error, and when you look at itlater, you say, gee, he goofed.  And so I'm not sure weshould consider the plainness of the error or the factthat they -- they do mistakes because they do.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  But -- but I don't -- but thereason why the Court accepts errors in some situations isbecause there's some other value under the Double JeopardyClause.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  The value of finality is whatis really at stake here.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's not just the valueof finality.  It's that, for example, if the judge makesan error and then the jury is discharged, it's the valuethat the defendant has in obtaining a result from theparticular tribunal.  In the circumstances of this case,where the trial judge can correct her error within the --within a matter of minutes, at least in some situations,there would be no double jeopardy purpose served --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But here it was not a matterof minutes.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  In this --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Here it was --          MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  I acknowledge in this case491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. For2 example, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme3 Court, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the4 same scenario as this case, but the only distinction was5 that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling,6 the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a7 span of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize8 her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the9 charge.10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it matter if the -- if11 the ruling is conveyed to the jury even though the jury12 isn't discharged?13 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would matter, Justice14 O'Connor, but I don't think it would necessarily preclude15 the prosecution from going forward on the charge under the16 Double Jeopardy Clause. The question would be one of due17 process and prejudice to the defendant.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You had three -- three reasons19 you were going to give Justice Souter. One is it's not20 clear always that it's definitive. The other is that21 trial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?22 MR. SRINIVASAN: And the third is -- it's an23 issue that you raised earlier, Justice Kennedy. It's that24 this case might look different as an atmospheric matter if25 the trial judge at the time she rendered her ruling had501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 said, I'm ruling in the defendant's favor, but I may2 reconsider this decision at a later point in the3 proceedings. Now, that might be seen to fall on the4 tentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect5 of this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of6 Massachusetts law. And we don't think there's a7 constitutionally significant distinction between a trial8 judge explicitly saying that a ruling can be reconsidered9 and State law saying that the ruling can be reconsidered.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't the distinction the11 right to rely?12 MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- there -- there -- that13 would be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the14 right to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of15 claim and that could be handled in the way that trial16 courts typically handle claims by the defendant that17 they've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the18 trial court has subsequently reconsidered.19 It would be equally the case, for example, as20 the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling21 that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of22 evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the23 proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question24 would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in25 prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial2 determination. And we don't think that prejudice inquiry3 is meaningfully different when you're dealing with4 evidentiary rulings as when you're -- as when you're5 dealing with the reinstatement of a previously acquitted6 charge.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why shouldn't you have8 -- what's magic about the jury? Why shouldn't you have9 the same rule on a bench trial? A judge in a bench trial10 makes a ruling, thinks about it, and says, you know, I11 shouldn't have ruled that way. Why shouldn't that judge12 be able to change? Just because there's no jury to13 discharge.14 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would depend. If --15 if the bench trial judge were making a mid-trial ruling,16 as -- as in this case, then the judge could change his or17 her mind. But if the bench trial judge were resolving the18 entire case and entered --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the line? I20 mean, is there -- there no point at which he can't change?21 I mean --22 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- the -- I think the23 Constitution would step in and impose a line at some24 point, and probably the best indicator is a rule --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not dismissal of the521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 jury. We'll have to make up some other line. Right?2 MR. SRINIVASAN: It can't be discharge of the3 jury, but I think where the Court would look, first and4 foremost, in defining a line for bench trials, if the5 issue would ever arise, would be a ruling that would6 essentially have resulted in discharge of the jury if the7 trial were before a jury. And for example, the Federal8 Rules of Criminal Procedure --9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But how do we -- how does10 Smalis fit into this discussion? I thought in Smalis in a11 bench trial, we said it was final.12 MR. SRINIVASAN: It was, Justice O'Connor, for13 purposes of an appeal, and that's why I think the critical14 distinction between Smalis and this case is that where the15 prosecution might not have authority to take an appeal16 from a ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your line would be something18 like if it -- if -- from all of the transcript, it appears19 that the judge is -- is giving consideration to the entire20 case or something like that in a bench trial.21 MR. SRINIVASAN: In a bench trial, that -- that22 would be part of the inquiry, Justice Kennedy, and I would23 also point, by the way, to -- can I just finish the24 thought, Justice Stevens? To Federal Rule of Criminal25 Procedure 32(k)(1), which says that when a bench trial --531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 when a judge sitting in a bench trial issues a ruling that2 finds a defendant not guilty, that ruling will discharge3 the defendant. And I think a discharge4 would be one of critical consideration.5 Thank you.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.7 Mr. Nathanson, you have about8 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J.9 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER10 MR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, may it11 the Court:12 I'll try to be as brief as I can.13 The argument about inherent authority to14 reconsider an acquittal really has it backwards. Inherent15 authority bends to the Constitution. The Constitution16 does not bend to a judge's inherent authority.17 Second, the -- the Government is trying to18 substitute a standard here of a second proceeding, which19 is not this Court's standard. This Court's standard is20 further proceedings after an acquittal, including21 resumption of the same trial. That's what this Court said22 in Smalis.23 The Government is also trying to move this case24 into the particular tribunal analysis. That comes from25 cases that are mistrials. This is an acquittal. This is541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOof the defendant3 minutesNATHANSONleft.please￼1 not a particular tribunal case.2 As to the judge resolving all the issues in a3 bench trial and -- and that's why that -- that acquittal4 would be more final than a motion for a directed verdict,5 it was a motion for a directed verdict. It was a demurrer6 in Smalis. It was the exact same standard that the judge7 applied in that case.89 factor inAs to prejudice, prejudice has never been athis Court's double jeopardy analysis.  As afact, in -- in one of the really classical10 matter of11 statements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of12 that case, that looks like complete gamesmanship. The13 defendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the14 -- the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine. He15 said, oh, I'll pay -- I'll pay the fine. It's a get-out-16 of-jail-free card. There's complete gamesmanship, but17 prejudice was not a factor. And in fact, this Court has18 said prejudice is not open to judicial examination in19 double jeopardy cases.20 As to honing, in -- in fact, in Rumsey --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Honing?22 MR. NATHANSON: Honing. Not the name of a case,23 Your Honor. But whether or not the Government has honed24 its cased through -- and -- and they would say evidentiary25 honing. But it's not evidentiary honing. In Rumsey, it551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 was only argument that was presented at -- at the remand2 after acquittal.3 Justice Souter, I want to heartily endorse the4 -- the way you phrased what the rule should be, which is,5 trial judges, you ought to take this seriously.6 Pretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious7 matter. You cannot take it back. So think about it. Do8 it right the first time.9 As to -- to rule 25 itself, it's true that the10 -- the judges can't reserve. So what they do as -- as a11 matter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny,12 and -- and they deny the first one and they have two more13 opportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case14 and they have an opportunity at the close of -- after the15 jury has returned a verdict. At each of those steps, they16 can make a motion for acquittal.17 As to the full and fair opportunity, this Court18 said in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to19 try the case. They do not have a right to have it proceed20 to verdict. I'm just taking that straight from Martin21 Linen.22 As to, finally, whether or not State law sort of23 insulates this from Federal -- I see my time is up. Thank24 you.25JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nathanson, thank you. 561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)57Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
