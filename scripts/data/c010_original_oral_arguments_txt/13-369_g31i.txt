Biosig Instruments.      Mr. Vandenberg.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. VANDENBERGON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. VANDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court.      The Patent Act requires particular anddistinct claims, but the claim in this case is notparticular and distinct.  It is ambiguous because it hastwo reasonable readings with very different claimscopes, even after all of the interpretive tools areapplied.      Such ambiguous claims defeat the publicnotice function which is at the heart of Section 112,and they increase litigation.  They cause more claimconstruction disputes, and they cause more reversals ofdistrict court claim construction rulings.      Taken all together, ambiguous claims and theFederal circuit's test allowing ambiguous claims defeatsthe very purpose of Section 112 and the patent system,namely, to encourage and promote innovation by others3Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 after the first patent issues.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is this claim3 ambiguous? It's evident that these electrodes have to4 be close enough so that the user's hand contacts both5 electrodes, but separate enough to heap ­­ keep6 electrodes distinct. Why isn't that sufficiently7 definite?8 MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, if ­­ if that9 were the only reasonable construction, then that may10 suffice. However, here, the other reasonable11 construction is that the spaced relationship is a12 special spacing that causes the electrodes to achieve13 the desired result. And that was the construction that14 the majority found at the Federal circuit, namely, that15 spaced relationship is not what it sounds like, namely,16 any spacing, but rather is a special spacing that is17 derived by trial­and­error testing to get the spacing18 just right so that the electrodes detect ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't think the20 majority or the ­­ or the concurrence or the other side21 disagreed with that. The only question was whether it22 was part of the specifications or not. I thought that23 was the only difference between them. They both agreed24 ultimately that the electrodes had to cancel out ­­ was25 it the EMGs?4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 MR. VANDENBERG:2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 that was part of the scope. The only issue was, was it4 part of the specifications or part of the claims,no? But5 both of them make up the scope of the patent.6 MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, we would submit7 that the disagreements between the judges and, in fact,8 between Biosig itself went to the scope of the claim,9 namely, does the scope of the claim cover all ways of10 achieving the desired result no matter how the11 electrodes are spaced. That's one possible reading.12 The other possible reading is that the13 claims cover only a special spacing of the electrodes to14 achieve the desired result. And why that matters is if15 you think of the inventor in 1994 who invents a new16 material for electrodes, and this new material achieves17 the desired result of detecting equal muscle signals on18 the left and right side, regardless of the19 the electrode. So it doesn't matter where20 electrodes, as long as you can touch them,21 material achieved the ­­ the desired goal.22 That inventor would not know in 1994 if they23 infringed or not, because if the claims had the24 interpretation that the majority eventually gave them,25 namely, that the spaced relationship has this functional5Alderson Reporting CompanyCorrect.   So they both agreed thatspacing ofyou put thethis newOfficial￼1 limitation and it must be the result of this2 trial­and­error balancing, there'd be no infringement.3 But if spaced relationship meant any spacing, then there4 would be infringement. So that is the exact type of5 zone of uncertainty that United Carbon warned against6 and which deters the innovation.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it can't mean8 any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would9 know the hand has to cover it. So you're basically10 talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of11 the hand and the other and not too close together but12 they don't ­­ don't work. And that seems to me that13 someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of14 things and see where ­­ where the trial and error.15 Trial and error makes ­­ could mean a very difficult16 thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light17 bulb. But here you've got a very limited range and18 someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try19 it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so20 far apart. But it's not any spaced relationship.21 MR. VANDENBERG: And that's correct, Your22 Honor, and I do ­­ when I refer to any spacing, it's23 really a shorthand for any spacing that is narrow enough24 so that the hand can actually touch both electrodes but25 not touching. So I agree that under each interpretation6Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 it makes sense that the electrodes have to be touchable2 by a single hand, and they can't be touching each other3 or there'd simply be a single electrode.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be the5 purpose of the invention if it were only covering6 spacing without the function of canceling the EMG? I7 can't understand, if I read this patent, what it would8 do unless you add its function.9 MR. VANDENBERG: Well, Your Honor, the10 purpose of the patent is it would cover possibly, again,11 all techniques for achieving the desired function. So12 again, going back to the invention of the new material,13 if the inventor comes up with a specific way of14 achieving the result, and here they came up with trial15 and error spacing, they didn't describe that in the16 patent. That didn't ­­ that wasn't described by the17 inventor until 15 years later. But nevertheless, let's18 say they had this specific way of achieving it. They19 very well could have drafted the claim intentionally the20 way they did to have a broader coverage so that they21 cover all possible ways of achieving that desired22 result. Patent attorneys are trained to try to draft23 the claims, you know, some claims as broadly as24 possible. So that reading by the concurrence was a very25 plausible reading of this claim. Reading the claim, it7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 has any spaced relationship as long as, as the Chief2 Justice indicated, I can touch them and they're not3 touching each other. But that's it. There's no other4 restriction on what "spaced relationship" means. That's5 a very reasonable interpretation and that was the6 interpretation that Biosig asserted at the Markman claim7 construction in this case.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you ­­ you acknowledge9 that it ­­ it would be a valid patent if all you said is10 you have to space these things and you figure out what11 the spacing is going to be. You ­­ you can ­­ you can12 get a patent for ­­ tell somebody trial and error.13 Let's take Edison's light bulb. I mean, could he say,14 you know, get some material that ­­ that will ­­ will15 illumine when ­­ when electricity is passed through it16 and you figure out by trial and error what this material17 might be. Might be tungsten, who knows, you know.18 Maybe it's chewing gum. Would that be a valid patent?19 MR. VANDENBERG: It would not, Your Honor.20 That ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't ­­ I don't22 really understand this trial and error spacing stuff.23 What ­­ what is the limit on trial and error? Can you24 get patented anything when you say, you know, this is25 the basic principle, you figure out what ­­ you know,8Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what makes it work.      MR. VANDENBERG:Official￼                             Well, Your Honor,there's ­­ there's two levels of indefiniteness here.First, it's unclear which construction was intended.  Sobasically, there are two reasonable ­­JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. VANDENBERG:JUSTICE SCALIA:No.  I understand that.But the second ­­I'm asking why the secondconstruction is ­­ is a plausible patentable invention. MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, it's not patentable. In fact, it would be indefinite. However,the person of skill in the art reading the claim is notexpected to do a full­blown invalidity analysis.They're simply trying to figure out, where can Iinnovate.  I see this patent.  It issues in '94.  The ­­the alternative ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: All the person skilled in the art will know is that he has to figure out what the spacing is, right?MR. VANDENBERG: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but still the ­­ the inventor doesn't tell you what the spacing has to be. MR. VANDENBERG: Well, that is the secondproblem.  We agree.  The second problem with theseclaims is they're purely functional.  They simply have a9Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 clause that says whereby good things happen, namely,2 that equal muscle signals are detected. The claims3 don't tell you how. They leave that up in the air.4 Maybe it has something to do with the spacing5 electrodes, but maybe not.6 And the further problem is that the7 specification here did not describe any technique for8 achieving the desired result. If one reads the9 specification, you read it and it says various things10 and it says, whereby the muscle signals are detected as11 being equal on both hands, on both electrodes. Well, in12 reality, the ­­ the electrical signals on my left and13 right palms are unequal. Somehow, however, the14 electrodes detect them as if they're being equal. The15 patent doesn't say how. It doesn't say why. It doesn't16 say what causes it. So this is the purely functional17 type of claim that United Carbon and General Electric ­­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you ­­ do you19 have any disagreement with a standard that's articulated20 by the Solicitor General? He says that, you know, a21 patent satisfies the requirement if, in light of the22 specification and the prosecution history, a person23 skilled in the art would reasonably understand the scope24 of the claim.25 MR. VANDENBERG:10Alderson Reporting CompanyYour Honor, we may or may 1   not, depending on how the Solicitor General would apply 2   that standard to a claim that has two reasonable 3   interpretations after the person of skill in the art 4   reads the claim in light of the specification and 5   applies all the interpretive tools.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Court has to come up 7   with a formula.  You were saying the Federal Circuit's 8   formula is no good.  The Solicitor General has, as the 9   Chief Justice just said, has suggested an appropriate10   formula.  And you say, well, it depends on the11   application.  As a formula, do you agree?12131415   ambiguous test.  The Solicitor General refers to16   reasonably understand.  The parties have agreed on the17   phrasing of "reasonable certainty."  We think18   "reasonable certainty" comes out of this Court's cases,19   and therefore, we prefer that.  To the extent,Official￼MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, we ­­ we think it's ­­ it would certainly be an improvement over the Federal Circuit's amenable to construction and insolubly20212223   I'm having trouble dealing with.  I would suspect your friends24   on the other side will say yes, right, that they accept25   that, too.  And you say, but it can't be insolubly11obviously, "reasonably understand" means the same as"reasonable certainty," then ­­ then we accept that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's whatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 ambiguous or not amenable to construction. And they2 say, well, that's not really what the Federal Circuit3 said.4 So until we get to the application, I don't5 see much disagreement among any of you about the6 standard or what's wrong with the Federal Circuit's7 articulation. And the questions kind of suggest we move8 very quickly into the particular invention and the9 application. And I'm just ­­ I'm curious what you want10 us to do if it seems like in every case, we have to get11 right into the application rather than the legal12 standards.13 MR. VANDENBERG: Well, I think the ­­ the14 key dispute here is what happens if, after all the15 interpretive tools are applied, there's a genuine16 ambiguity, meaning there really are two reasonable17 interpretations of the claim. Genuine ambiguity, person18 of skill in the art applying all the interpretive tools,19 trying to understand the claiming. What happens then?20 Our position is that if such a claim, which21 essentially points in two different directions, is22 indefinite, the problem with the Federal Circuit's test23 is the Federal Circuit would not find that indefinite.24 Instead, the Federal Circuit would pick one because it's25 amenable to construction. They would pick one. They12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 would then ask is the construction they picked itself2 sufficiently clear for a person of skill in the art.3 JUSTICE ALITO: What if a ­­ what if a4 person who's a skilled artisan says that the claim could5 mean A and it could mean B, they're both reasonable6 constructions, but this person is reasonably certain it7 means A, but not B? What would happen then?8 MR. VANDENBERG: Well, I think the ­­ the9 proper analysis would be to look at the alternative10 construction and ask: Was that a reasonable11 interpretation? Was the second interpretation a12 reasonable interpretation of the claim? And courts13 every day make judgments like that, whether14 interpretations, for instance, of statutes. A second15 interpretation of a statute is reasonable.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the only ­­ the only17 analog that comes to my mind immediately is our review18 of agency action. Is ­­ is that the standard that you19 want us to use? If ­­ if, you know, it's within the20 scope of the ambiguity, oh, we don't think that's the21 right answer. But it's close enough for government22 work. Is that ­­ is that what you want us to apply to23 patents?24 MR. VANDENBERG: No, Your Honor, because the25 starting point here is the text of the statute. The13Alderson Reporting Company25 MR. VANDENBERG:What ­­ what we're ­­ weOfficial￼1 text of the statute could hardly be more emphatic.2 Section 112 requires that the invention be described in3 full, clear, concise, and exact terms and then be4 claimed particularly and distinctly. Given that text of5 the statute, given the statutory purpose of protecting6 the next innovator from uncertainty, we think that that7 statutory language needs to be enforced, you know,8 forcefully.9 JUSTICE SCALIA:10 wrong.11 MR. VANDENBERG:12 ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 interpretation is wrong is ipso facto unreasonable?15 MR. VANDENBERG: If ­­ if I understand16 correctly, a claim has only one proper construction. If17 a claim is subject ­­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So whatever is wrong19 is ­­ is, by your definition ­­ you know, we ­­ we20 construe statutes all the time, and we certainly don't21 think that the result we come to is the only reasonable22 result. We think it's the best result, but not the only23 reasonable one. But you're saying in this field there's24 a right result and everything else is unreasonable.14Alderson Reporting CompanyCan it be reasonable butNo, Your Honor.  If a claimI see.  WhateverOfficial￼1 would analogize it most closely to ­­ to the Chevron2 ambiguity analysis.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's what I proposed4 first. But I thought ­­ I thought you didn't like that.5 MR. VANDENBERG: Well, if I misunderstood6 the question I apologize. But my understanding is in7 order to determine whether or not there is ambiguity in8 the statute, that the Court first looks to the statutory9 language and then applies interpretive tools. The same10 is true here. And then the Court ­­ if the Court finds11 there are more than one reasonable readings, then the12 Court will designate the ­­ the statute as ambiguous and13 then move on for the remainder of the Chevron analysis.14 Under this statute, however, if the Court15 determines the claim is ambiguous, the proper result is16 invalidity.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is ­­ what is18 the ambiguity? Is it ­­ I thought from your brief that19 it was the term "space relationship." Is that the ­­20 what ­­ what is the ambiguity?21 MR. VANDENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. It is the22 term "space relationship" in the context of the claim.23 And again, the ambiguity is that this claim either24 covers all possible spacing of the electrodes within the25 boundaries that we've discussed or it only covers15Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 special spacings of the electrodes that are a result of2 trial and error in order to achieve the desired result.3 Those are hugely different claim scopes and that ­­ that4 uncertainty between those two is what would chill5 innovation.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you ­­ did you7 proffer any evidence below showing that a person with8 ordinary skill in the art did not understand what this9 claim meant? Your brief seems to rely only on the10 dispute between the majority and the concurrence. But11 was there ­­ did you proffer any evidence below?12 MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, we did not13 proffer our own experts. The ­­ the evidence below14 included that Biosig's own expert asserted that each of15 the competing constructions was reasonable, in essence.16 More specifically, he said that ­­ this was Dr.17 Gannoulas said at Joint Appendix 274 ­­ that "The person18 of skill in the art could readily discern the trial19 court's construction of spaced relationship." The trial20 court's construction was any spacing.21 Then the expert went on and said, "The22 person of skill in the art could easily discern the23 claim scope because the EMG signals have to be24 substantially removed." That was the competing25 functional construction of spaced relationship. So16Alderson Reporting Company14 there's another interpretation, that that's15 to invalidate a patent as indefinite?16 MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, we17 taking the position that because the judges18 disagreed on the construction, that that is19 or proves ambiguity in the claim. We ­­ we20 fact that Biosig itself took both competing21 constructions as the need arose ­­sufficientare notbelowdispositivedid say theOfficial￼1 their own expert supported both of these competing2 constructions and the reason they were comfortable doing3 that is because ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I have a really big5 problem, which is we as Justices disagree on the meaning6 of things all the time, and one side will say, this is7 perfectly clear from the text of the statute, from8 its ­­ from its history, from its context. And we do9 all the statutory tools, and there’ll be one or more10 of us who will come out and say, no, we think it's a11 different interpretation. Would we have any valid12 patents in the world if that's the standard that we ­­13 that we adopt? That if any judge on a panel thinks that22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the majority ­­ but23 the majority here said that it was clear from the24 prosecution history, the specifications, and the25 description that this was definite. I don't know on17Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 what basis I would have to overturn their review of that2 issue.3 MR. VANDENBERG: Well, that ­­ that Biosig4 has taken both claim constructions. We've not seen them5 assert that either claim construction was unreasonable.6 The majority did not find the concurrence's construction7 unreasonable. Nor did it find the trial court's8 construction unreasonable. Their experts took both9 positions. So we have a claim that on its face ­­ I10 mean, the starting point is looking at the patent, of11 course, not what judges or experts or parties said12 later. The patent on its face is grammatically13 ambiguous. There is a whereby clause dangling in the14 middle of the claim that says whereby something good15 happens.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. We understand all17 that. I ­­ I'm still having trouble understanding what18 your standard is. You ­­ you agree that your standard19 is not, there is a right answer and everything that is20 not the right answer is unreasonable. That's not your21 position.22 MR. VANDENBERG:23 JUSTICE SCALIA:24 MR. VANDENBERG:25 JUSTICE SCALIA:18Alderson Reporting CompanyThat's right, Your Honor.Right?Right.Okay.  Then you invokeOfficial￼1 Chevron. Do you mean that anything that would pass2 Chevron's step one is okay?3 MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is, if it would pass5 Chevron's step one it's ambiguous.6 MR. VANDENBERG: Well, if ­­ let me be clear7 about "pass." If it's ambiguous under Chevron step one,8 then that is a close parallel to being ambiguous9 under ­­ under Section 112, paragraph 2. But again, our10 starting point, of course, is not Chevron. It's the11 statutory text, which ­­ and the standard we submit is12 to assert ­­ I'm sorry, to enforce the statutory text by13 its plain terms.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would this ­­ would this15 help? Do you agree that the standard at the PTO, and16 let's say that it's whether or not ­­ the claim is17 definite if a person skilled in the art would be18 reasonably certain of its scope. Is the standard used19 by the PTO the same standard that the CA Fed ought to20 use?21 MR. VANDENBERG: Yes, it is, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. How does ­­23 that's a sensible answer, I think. Now, how does the24 presumption of validity bear on ­­ on the application of25 the ­­ of that same standard in the court of appeals?19Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. VANDENBERG: The presumption of validity certain applies to this defense. It requires thechallenger to raise the defense, to preserve thedefense, you know, plead it as affirmative defense, to make the initial argument as to why the claim is ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Doesn't that imply some deference on findings of fact?MR. VANDENBERG: Your Honor, it would be rare for there to be, in an indefiniteness case, to be any underlying finding of fact. The ­­ the issue of indefiniteness is really subsidiary.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does it imply ­­ what sort of deference does it accord to the PTO?MR. VANDENBERG: If indeed ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is, the presumption of validity, does that accord some deference to the PTO? And how would that apply or not apply here?MR. VANDENBERG: It would apply ­­ it doesnot apply in this case. There are no fact findings outof the Patent Office regarding indefiniteness. But if there was ­­ the same indefiniteness issue came up andthe Patent Office found, for instance, that a term ofart, so let's say nanotechnology, biotechnology term of art had a particular meaning, then that fact­finding may be entitled to deference by the trial court.20Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 However, indefiniteness itself is a legal2 determination. The Federal Circuit said that. They3 review this. They know ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's no deference to5 the PTO as to that legal interpretation.6 MR. VANDENBERG: No, Your Honor, no more7 than there'd be deference to the Patent Office claim8 construction or any other legal decision.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: The ­­ the quotation that10 the Chief Justice read to you from the Solicitor11 General's brief referred to the use of prosecution12 history. Do you agree with the Solicitor General about13 that use, about the permissibility of that use?14 MR. VANDENBERG: Yes, Your Honor, so long as15 the prosecution history that's being used to clarify16 existed at the date the patent issued. If the person of17 skill in the art again is supposed to be motivated to18 innovate around the patent the day it issues. Here19 there is a re­examination prosecution history.20 Sometimes there is later prosecution history in a21 related patent. That type of prosecution history22 shouldn't be used to sort of ex post facto cure an23 initial indefiniteness.24 But putting aside that rare instance, yes,25 the prosecution history and the specification are part21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 of the interpretive tools that are available and would2 be used.3 I think it's important to remember here that4 there is no legitimate need or excuse for ambiguity in5 patent claims. Once the applicant has satisfied6 paragraph one and its strict requirements for describing7 the invention, it is easy to claim the invention8 particularly and distinctly. The only reason that there9 are so many ambiguous claims out there today is that10 patent attorneys are trained to deliberately include11 ambiguous claims. Ambiguous claims make the patent12 monopoly more valuable. Every patent attorney knows13 that.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government tells us15 there are some 22,000 patent grants since 1976 that use16 the term "spaced relationship." I suppose many of those17 would fail your test?18 MR. VANDENBERG: Not likely, Your Honor. It19 would be highly unlikely in more than 99 percent of20 those cases that there'd be any uncertainty of what21 "spaced relationship" meant. The problem here is not22 those words. It's the grammatical ambiguity in the23 claim. It's the fact that the specification did not24 describe, even arguably, the invention. That wasn't25 described, the trial and error spacing, until 15 years22Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425later, and that the patent specification has no concreteexamples of embodiments inside the claim or outside theclaim.      So we ask that the Court reaffirm itsprecedents in United Carbon, General Electric and EibelProcess.  Eibel Process upheld a claim that had vaguesounding language.  The language was "high elevation,""substantial elevation," but it was upheld because thatpatent specification concretely described the invention,its theory of operation, concrete examples that cameinside the claim scope, concrete examples that felloutside.  And that's why that patent satisfied theparticular and distinct claiming requirement and thisone does not.I'll reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Harris.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The decision of the Federal Circuit shouldbe affirmed for two reasons:  First, that courtcorrectly held that the test for definiteness is whethera claim puts a skilled artisan on reasonable notice of23Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 the boundaries of the invention, and secondly, whatever 2 ­­3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's ­­ if that's what it held we wouldn't have taken this case. I thought we took it because it had some really extravagant language.MR. HARRIS: The court, the court below used the word ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's one thing to run away from that language, as your brief does. It's another thing to deny that it exists.MR. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, we are not denying that those words exist, "insolubly ambiguous," but what I think this court below, the Federal Circuit, in this case explained, and it's explained consistently, is that that ­­ those two words are not the test all by themselves. In this very case ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would agree, I take it, that if, was it, "insolubly ambiguous" were the standard that the court used, that we should reverse?MR. HARRIS: If there were no other context and only those words alone would be used, it seems that some district courts might misinterpret those words, as the Solicitor General has mentioned, but ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it was fair, as I suggested earlier, nobody agrees with that formulation;24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 right?2 MR. HARRIS: Yes, I guess so, Your Honor.3 But I want to ­­ I just want to clarify what that point4 is. What the Federal Circuit said below, the full5 statement of its test that it was applying in this case,6 was: If reasonable efforts at claim construction result7 in a definition that does not provide sufficient8 particularity and clarity to inform skilled artisans of9 the bounds of the claim, the claim is insolubly10 ambiguous and invalid for indefiniteness. There is no11 suggestion that the court ­­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a subtle ­­ no,13 there is, if you read that language carefully. It seems14 to be saying that what has to be reasonably definite is15 the court's construction, and it takes the emphasis away16 from whether a skilled ­­ someone skilled in the art17 would be definite. There is a big difference between18 can I read this and give it a construction and whether19 or not a construction is definite enough so someone20 skilled in the art could understand it.21 MR. HARRIS: We would completely agree that22 the test needs to include what the skilled artisan would23 have understood at the time.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my problem with25 the Federal Circuit's articulation and as you read its25Alderson Reporting Company17 government ­­ explain ­­18 you think the difference19 MR. HARRIS:20 the concurrence below, first, we don't think ­­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He says there is a22 difference in scope, so address that.23 MR.

Its focus is not always on that question.2 Its focus seems to be on the reasonableness of its3 construction, as opposed to the reasonableness of a4 skilled artisan's or whether skilled, someone skilled in5 the art could reasonably6 patent.7 MR. HARRIS:8 from the way the Federal9 standard in this case that the Federal Circuit was10 looking to what the evidence was as to what skilled11 artisans would do with this claim language. If anything12 it's Nautilus that's arguing that it doesn't seem to13 matter what a skilled artisan thought at the time.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you see as15 the difference?

I know whatis, but ­­Well, between the majority andAlderson Reporting CompanyWhy don't you see thatOfficial￼1 MR. HARRIS: It would be a difference if2 there were a difference in scope, but there isn't one.3 I think it's very important to look at what the majority4 and the concurrence actually did. The majority was5 addressing definiteness. The majority did that in two6 steps. The majority said we are going to apply the7 principles of claim construction. The first thing it8 did was it looked to the claim language, the written9 specification, the diagrams, all the traditional tools10 of patent interpretation. It said there is definiteness11 here because there are bounds to the spaced12 relationship. It isn't just anything, it has to be13 greater than zero, it has to be less than the width of a14 hand. It's implicit in the ­­ actually explicit in the15 statements of the patent.16 Then it said that the functional limitation,17 which is the whereby clause in the patent, sheds18 additional light. That's where the concurrence got off19 the train and the concurrence said: I don't think we20 need to reach that issue. Nautilus has turned that21 approach on its head. Nautilus says that the fact that22 the concurrence didn't think it was necessary to reach23 the functional limitation, in fact said that it's not24 before us for procedural reasons, Nautilus reads that as25 if the concurrence was somehow disavowing or disclaiming27Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the majority's approach.  It never said that.  It was aprocedural argument that it had.  Then, in fact, thereis no disagreement between the majority and theconcurrence.JUSTICE SCALIA: Would this patent be valid if the concurrence's approach prevailed? It wouldn't work, would it? It would not work. The mere fact that you spaced it somewhere where the hands can touch it would not necessarily produce the result, would it?MR. HARRIS: If the patent said nothing other than there is a space between ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: That's all the claim said.MR. HARRIS: Well, no, no, Justice Scalia. The whereby clause explicitly said ­­ it described the structure. This case is quite different from General Electric, where there was no structure being given. It said that there is going ­­ there are going to be EMG signals that are going to be detected by the electrodes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.MR. HARRIS: Then those signals, which will be detected as equal, are going to be fed into a differential amplifier and thereby subtracted or canceled out.JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereby. Whereby. I would read that as saying so long as you put the spacing at28Official￼Alderson Reporting Company7 JUSTICE SCALIA:8 MR. HARRIS:9 JUSTICE SCALIA:    No, no.­­ it would produce that.Official￼1 some point where the hands can touch it and they are not2 touching, that will produce the result that the signals3 will be equalized. That's how I would read the claim.4 MR. HARRIS: Well, in fact, if the5 electrodes are configured in such a way that they6 detected the signals as equal ­­No. Yes, I understand10 that, but that's not what it says. It doesn't say space11 the electrodes in such a manner that the signals coming12 from each side will be equal and you'll have to do this13 by trial and error. That's not what it says. It just14 says, you know, keep the electrodes apart. They have to15 be apart so that the hands don't touch, and on the other16 hand they can't be outside the scope of what the hands17 grip. That's all it says. Whereby, if you do that, the18 signals will be equalized. That's ­­ that's how I would19 read it. It wouldn't work that way, would it?20 MR. HARRIS: It wouldn't work if it gave no21 specifics. But this is where the fact that it all22 depends on what the skilled artisan would do is23 critical. Because there was uncontested evidence that a24 skilled artisan in 1992 was able to read this patent and25 understand how to put together this invention in such a29Alderson Reporting Company      MR. HARRIS:sides ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:that one hand.MR. HARRIS:If the distances on the two    Look, look.  This is likeYes.    And this one's like the      JUSTICE BREYER:other hand.  Okay?  So does it work or not?Official￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425way that it worked.  In fact, Dr. Galiana's researchassistant did it, in 2 hours was able to build thisinvention based on the diagrams.JUSTICE BREYER: I'm a little confused here. Imagine there are two kinds of electrodes, a blue one and a green one, and you have to have a blue one and green one on left hand and a blue one and green one on right hand. And now, you cannot let them touch. The blue can't touch the green. I got that. And suppose on your left hand you put the blue one here and the green one there. And in the right hand, you put the blue in here and the green in here. See, they're not touching, but they're different distances from each other in the two hands. Does it work or not?MR. HARRIS: I don't ­­ I don't know whether ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Let the record show that the Justice is holding his fingers in the air.30Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)      JUSTICE BREYER:green one is two inches ­­ the space between the greenone and the right one is like a half inch for the lefthand, and it's like one inch for the right hand.  Okay?Does it work?MR. HARRIS: If I could answer that question, Justice Breyer, in a ­­ in a more roundabout way. What the ­­JUSTICE BREYER: It was asked in a pretty roundabout way.(Laughter.)MR. HARRIS: What the uncontested evidence showed was that a skilled artisan at the time knew how to space electrodes.JUSTICE BREYER: Then did he know that they had to be ­­ like if you put it two inches across here, so there are two inches between them, and over here it's like a half inch between them, did he know it did work or did he know it didn't work?MR. HARRIS: He would know by ­­JUSTICE BREYER: He knew if it worked, but I want to know if it does work.MR. HARRIS: It probably would not work in that situation.31Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyAll right.  Look, on theOfficial￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 say that, that's his point. His point is that when I3 read it ­­ I guess that's the point that's being made.4 When I read it, it just seems to me that the green one5 can't touch the blue one, and the whole thing has to fit6 within your hand, so each of them catches a finger. And7 he's saying that isn't good enough. That doesn't work.8 They have to be the same distance. And what that9 distance is, this document doesn't tell us. And it10 doesn't even tell us they have to be the same distance.11 So therefore, since it doesn't tell us that, it's12 ambiguous. Is that the correct argument? All right.13 We think it's the correct argument. So now, what's your14 answer?15 MR. HARRIS: This Court has never found a16 problem with the need for some amount of experimentation17 in order to get the parameters exactly right.18 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't even say that.19 It doesn't even say that. It doesn't say go experiment20 whether somebody with great big fingers on one hand and21 tiny little fingers on the other hand ­­22 MR.

Didn't say anything more than that.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it part of an3 answer to Justice Breyer's question that the diagram4 shows them equally spaced or is that not relevant?5 MR. HARRIS: I don't think the equal spacing6 is the only issue, Mr. Chief Justice. The issue is how7 do you find what that spacing is. And the answer, the8 uncontested answer, is that skilled artisans were able9 to do that very quickly. It's not trial and error as if10 it's throwing darts and just seeing what might work.11 It's just like tuning a radio. Just happen to move12 things around in order you get that ­­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why doesn't that ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I can understand15 that if the claim said that. If the claim said, you16 know, fiddle with it until it works. But it doesn't say17 that. It just says, you know, spacing, and I would18 think so long as there's space, they don't touch, and19 they're no more than the widths of the hands, it'll20 work. It doesn't say that. I don't think the "whereby"21 is ­­ is an invitation to experiment.22 But the other case you were talking about,23 tell us more about it. It just said a high angle.24 MR. HARRIS: It's at a high angle. Minerals25 Separation maybe is even a stronger case. In Minerals33Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Separation, it was a method for extracting ore from ­­metal ­­ metallic ore from ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why are you ­­ why are you running from ­­ the working here is that it cancels out a signal, correct?MR. HARRIS: Yes.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:said is that that function is part of the understandingof the spacing.  Isn't that what the majority said?MR. HARRIS: It said that an additional constraint on the spacing is the fact that it has ­­ that it will work in a certain way.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I don't know whether it has to be equal spacing or one could be one inch and the other half an inch apart. The bottom line is that to work, it has to cancel out, that that's part of the scope.MR. HARRIS: Yes. Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, the concurrence said, no, you don't have ­­ you can't ­­ I'm not looking at the specification.MR. HARRIS: Yes.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:without it.MR.

That's what I think Justice Scalia issaying and Justice Breyer is saying, that if we don'tunderstand what the purpose is, how can that spacing bedefinite enough to make this thing work.      So tell us why you think that theconcurrence's interpretation is wrong.  What's hemissing?MR. HARRIS: The word ­­ when ­­ when it says "whereby," the whereby means the elements that came before are going to produce that result.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mm­hmm.MR.

HARRIS: But what the whereby clause says, it ­­ it conveys a structure. It says they have to be detected, the signals, in such a way that they're equal. That normally wouldn't be the case.

Signals would come in from the right and the2 left hand that during exercise would be unequal, because3 when a person is running or moving, the right hand and4 left hand have different amounts of contact with the5 electrodes.6 The whole novelty of this was the fact that7 you didn't have to cancel EMG signals, what we call8 downstream, meaning by just9 could be detected in such a10 and then be cancelled.11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 provide more specificityfiltering them out.

It depended ­­ the16 actual spacing in every single instance would depend on17 four variables. This was made clear in the expert18 declarations. The size of the electrode, the shape of19 the electrode, the spacing between the electrodes, and20 the materials, those four things. Just like in Eibel21 Process, what the Court said was, you may not know in22 advance what it is. But a skilled artisan will know.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the apparatus24 on which the electrodes are mounted? Isn't that another25 variable way you can't say half an inch, because it36Alderson Reporting Companyto the exact spacing?Official￼1 depends, as you said, on size, shape, and materials of2 the electrodes. But doesn't it also depend on the3 apparatus?4 MR. HARRIS: Yes. Yes, it does. It does.5 The critical point is that there's no question that a6 skilled artisan knew how to do this. They've introduced7 no evidence that a skilled artisan didn't know this. In8 fact, their entire argument is based on attorneys coming9 up with arguments later.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What ­­ what about11 the case that he postulated, an abstract one, where you12 have two perfectly reasonable constructions. What ­­13 what happens then?14 MR. HARRIS: If there are two constructions,15 each of which has survived the Markman claim16 construction process, and each one of them does the17 things that Markman says the correct construction needs18 to do, which is that it fully comports with the19 instrument as a whole and it preserves the patent's20 internal coherence, then yes, we would agree in that21 case it's indefinite. But what they've put forward ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Doesn't Markman exist for a23 different purpose? I thought that Markman existed in24 order to explain things to a lay juror or a lay judge.25 Why should the Markman test be used in this context,37Alderson Reporting Company5 that the nature of the test may need to be ­­ or6 nature of the process may need to be necessarily7 sophisticated.

HARRIS: Well, I ­­ I'm not sure I agree4 with the premise, Your Honor. The Markman explained10 Just to return to that ­­ to that ­­ to the11 point again, because I think it's such an important12 point. All they're relying on here are attorney13 arguments. In fact, this morning, just now,14 Mr. Vandenberg mentioned that the ambiguity isn't even15 in the words "space relationship." This is the first16 time I ever heard that. It's actually somehow in the17 whereby clause. That argument was never made at any18 time below or up until now.19 And the reason that's critical ­­ I'm not20 arguing waiver ­­ but the reason that's critical is the21 rule that Nautilus is suggesting here will encourage22 attorneys years after infringement has occurred to just23 come up with some way to argue that there is something24 that's unclear in the patent.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ­­ could I38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 just go back to my ­­ you know, the two reasonable. Is2 there a range? The Chevron ­­ the Chevron analogy again3 comes to mind. Let's say one is more reasonable than4 the other, but they're both reasonable. What type of5 range do you have before you say that the patent is6 invalid?7 MR. HARRIS: I think I agree with the8 comments that were ­­ the questions that were asked9 before, that it's very common in matters of statutory10 interpretation to have different answers, some of which11 are reasonable but are incorrect. We hold ­­ we believe12 that the test requires that the ­­ if there's ­­ there13 has to be more than one correct construction before it's14 going to be indefinite. If it only depends on the fact15 that there are reasonable interpretations that are made16 in good faith that lawyers are arguing or that jurists17 have come to, that's not going to be enough. Any more18 than it is ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's never more than one20 correct construction. Even ­­ even when there is there21 isn't. I mean, we always have to come up with an22 answer. And the patent office has to come up with an23 answer. It means this or it doesn't mean this. Have24 you ever heard of a court that says, well, you know, it25 could mean either one of these?39Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      MR.

HARRIS: As this Court has said in the rule of lenity context, there can be situations where a statute isn't clear. A judge at the end ­­JUSTICE ALITO: It sounds like you really are advocating the "insolubly ambiguous" standard, that's what you're saying. Unless you have to throw up your hands at the end and you say, we can't figure out which one this means, there is no correct interpretation, unless that's the case, then the patent is valid.MR. HARRIS: The premise of Markman is that in most, if not all, cases or many, many, many cases40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 where there is going to be real substantial disagreement2 between two parties, good faith disagreement where each3 side is supported by its reading of the materials,4 nevertheless, the court can come to an answer and should5 come to an answer.6 I just want to mention quickly, this Court7 has had several cases where words appeared to be8 ambiguous on its face and yet the Court didn't have the9 trouble of applying them and interpreting them in the10 patent context.11 Markman was a case about the word12 "inventory." "Inventory" on its surface could mean13 either accounts receivable or the actual stuff. In the14 Yeomans case, the word was "manufacture." Does15 "manufacture" mean the result or does it mean the16 process?17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was the Federal18 Circuit wrong when it said the test should be insolubly19 ambiguous? Was that wrong or not?20 MR. HARRIS: If "insolubly" means applying21 the standard tools of claim construction, then it's22 correct to say that that is what's required. But that23 term, I think by some district courts, I'll acknowledge,24 may be misinterpreted to mean as long as we can come up25 with anything, and it makes it sound as if it's not41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425necessary to actually tie it back to the language of thepatent.      If the court is doing it the correct waythat Markman prescribes, looking at all the patentmaterials and the prosecution history, if it can come toan answer, then we would agree that answer ­­ that thepatent is definite.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you agree with your adversary that the prosecution history is that at the time the patent was issued and not on re­examination or anything else subsequent?      MR. HARRIS:out the same.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:that question.      MR. HARRIS:prosecution history later also can count.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain that. Because he says, and it seems logical, that you're going to stifle inventiveness if people can't, once the patent is issued, know how to get around it.MR. HARRIS: Well, let me clarify what I mean by that. If evidence is introduced at a later stage during ­­ in, say, in re­examination, some of that evidence may be, it may be ­­ a court may be able to42I think in this case it comes       No, no.

MR. HARRIS: Yes, the answer.If the court ­­ in other words, if evidence,as here, was introduced at re­examination about whatskilled artisans knew at the time, the mere fact that itwas introduced at a later stage is not a problem.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR. HARRIS: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTSMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:     If I'll start with a question that theChief Justice asked.  You’ve already recited the standardthat we support here, which is that a patent claims issufficiently definite under paragraph 2,if a person ofordinary skill in the art would reasonably understandthe scope of the claim.  And I understand Petitioner'ssubmission to be a dispute about what happens if thereare two potentially reasonable constructions at the endof the Markman claim process.43Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 And we think that if there are two2 constructions that are of nearly equal persuasiveness,3 then that would be ambiguous. But if one construction4 is appreciably better, then that is good enough without5 having to take the second step of saying that the second6 best construction that's not as good and appreciably not7 as good IS ­­ is also unreasonable. We think that8 that's not the way this Court or judges ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: What worries me about that,10 which is certainly attractive, what you just say, is11 that lawyers will come up with all kinds of experts, you12 know. And quite often, if this situation ever arises,13 and I don't know if it really ever does, it could14 reflect a difference of opinion among scientists. I15 mean, you could have those who followed the phlogiston16 theory of fire. You could have those who17 follow the oxygen theory of fire. All we have to do is18 update that, and you could find different experts who19 would have different opinions while all agreeing that it20 is absolutely clear.21 I doubt that the Patent Office will very22 often find that problem arising. And if it does, why23 not just say, forget about it? As long as you can say24 reasonable experts can clearly ­­ you know, what you25 just said ­­ that's the end of it. And we'll tell you44Alderson Reporting Company25 JUSTICE SCALIA:Well, it's still close, butOfficial￼1 what to do later, when we really find the problem or you2 tell us what to do. I mean, I'm having a problem about3 it, and I'm explaining what my problem was.4 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the question5 is what does it mean when the Court has demanded6 reasonable clarity or reasonable certainty, and that's7 the standard that we read in this Court's cases on8 definiteness.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Can't we just stop there?10 I mean, do we really have to go into this theoretical11 dispute between the two scientists, who have opposite12 theories of ­­13 MR. GANNON: Well, I don't think it's a14 dispute between two scientists with opposite theories.15 The question of what a person of ordinary skill in the16 art would think, I think that a person of ordinary skill17 in the art is a hypothetical legal construct, like the18 reasonable person from tort law.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: When do we ever decide a20 case in which we would not say that our result is21 appreciably better than the result we reject?22 MR.

I have noidea what "appreciable" means. Let's say we have a 0 to 1 ­­MR. GANNON: Something more like 60/40 than 52/48. And I think in general the Court recognizes the difficulty of that type of mathematical precision in applying tests like what it means to be clear and46Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 convincing.2 JUSTICE ALITO: Usually when we ask whether3 something is reasonable, we have in mind this reasonable4 person and the set of circumstances in which the5 reasonable person is going to act. So in torts, the6 reasonable person is going to engage in an activity that7 has some benefits but also has some risks; what would8 that person do in that situation.9 Now, here you're saying what would the10 reasonable skilled artisan do in what situation? What11 is this person doing, setting out to build the device?12 What ­­13 MR. GANNON: They are trying to understand14 the scope of the claim. And so, and I ­­ I do think15 it's important here to recognize that there are two16 different questions that are getting conflated in some17 of the discussion. I think that with respect to18 definiteness under paragraph 2, as the court of appeals19 majority recognized, that this is ­­ in this case the20 question is whether the claim clearly states that it21 requires the electrodes to be arranged in such a fashion22 that they will have the effect of detecting23 substantially equal EMG signals at the electrodes. It's24 not with downstream circuitry, which is what Petitioner25 suggested in the opening brief. In Petitioner's reply47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 brief they've suggested they could use some sort of2 protective sleeve on the electrodes, but that wouldn't3 be consistent with the parts of the limitations that say4 that there needs to be physical and electrical contact5 with the electrodes.6 And the majority recognize that there are7 multiple variables that come into play here, the8 spacing, the materials, the separation, as my, my9 co­counsel was just explaining, and ­­ but the10 disagreement between the majority and the concurring11 opinion here is just in whether the functional12 limitation inheres in the phrase "spaced relationship"13 taken in isolation or whether it can be read from the14 rest of the claim as a whole.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you say16 something like "appreciably better," that's a term that17 may acquire meaning over time. Just like18 reasonableness, we get a good sense of what it means.19 Is it your sense that the Federal Circuit has been20 applying its test in this case? I mean, not in this21 case but in a series of cases that is ­­ it is close to22 appreciably better or is it something quite different?23 MR. GANNON: Well, we do acknowledge that24 the phrases that the Federal Circuit has used about25 "insolubly ambiguous" and "amenable to construction" are48Alderson Reporting Companynot overread.MR. GANNON: Well, I think that theyOfficial￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425subject to be ­­ to be overread and ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, nobodylikes those phrases ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ subject to beingread,                                                 ­­ thatthey could cause mischief if applied in isolation.  Andwe haven't taken a position on every case that the courtof appeals has applied these standards in, and I don'tthink that the court of appeals was intending a markeddeparture from this Court's overarching ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases where there are two reasonable constructions, but both would be patentable?MR.

GANNON: I think that we are arguing now about when the second best construction ceases to be a reasonable one, I think. And I think that if the Court wants to think of just whether there is a good enough construction such that there is reasonable clarity as required under United Carbon and in the Minerals Separation case where the Court said that the certainty that's required is not greater than is reasonable.49Alderson Reporting Company24 JUSTICE KAGAN:25 Chevron step two ­­­­ that would get you toOfficial￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: What do you think of this2 Chevron analogy, Mr. Gannon? Because sometimes we do3 say something close to it's a tie. We say there are a4 couple of reasonable constructions or a number of5 reasonable constructions. We could pick one, we think6 it might be better, but it's all close enough that we7 don't think we ought to pick one. So similarly, it's8 all close enough that the definiteness requirement has9 not been met. Is that a good analogy?10 MR. GANNON: I ­­ I think that that would11 probably ­­ we think that the sorts of constructions12 that would be reasonable under Chevron that the agency13 could take as a second best construction probably aren't14 sufficient to be the definite construction here. And so15 I ­­ I don't think it's a close analogy because we don't16 think that anyone is seeking that type of deference to17 another decisionmaker as ­­18 JUSTICE KAGAN: No. I'm not sure I quite19 got that.

GANNON: I don't think so.JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ is also the kind of ambiguity that would fail to satisfy the definiteness ­­MR. GANNON: No. And I'm sorry if I wasn't clear about this before. I was trying to say that in a 60/40 situation that I said would be adequate here, such that the second construction did not prevent there from being sufficient clarity, I think that we would think that an agency would be entitled to choose the 40 percent option. But we don't think that that would be ­­ that that would prevent the 60 percent option from being good enough in the context required here.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Federal Circuit seems to say that if there's two reasonable constructions and one would make the patent valid, I think this goes to Justice Kennedy's question, that they're obligated to pick the one that makes the patent valid.MR. GANNON: The case, I think ­­ I believe the case that's being talked about there is cited in the Exxon opinion.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh­huh.MR. GANNON: And that talks about when there are two equally­plausible constructions. I think that that probably is the ­­ the knife edge of insolubly51Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 ambiguous. And there, the Federal Circuit suggested2 that ­­ that, as Justice Scalia was ­­ was saying3 before, that ­­ that because there would be a decision4 rule, that you would pick the construction that would5 save the patent, that that would be okay.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that right?7 MR. GANNON: I don't think that that allows8 for sufficient clarity. We believe that if there are9 two constructions ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they're wrong in that11 as well.12 MR. GANNON: In that particular statement13 of ­­ of the rule, yes. We do think, however, that14 there is a distinction between the ­­ that the15 presumption of patent validity does play a role here.16 It doesn't change the standard, but it ­­ it does ­­ it17 does play a role in indicating that, as the PTO has18 recognized, that courts will do more to save a patent19 than the PTO does when it's examining one. And I20 would ­­ I would say that we also disagree with the21 notion ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How can that be if it's23 the same test?24 MR. GANNON: Well, it's ­­ the overarching25 question is, is the same of whether a person skilled in52Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the art would reasonably understand the scope of theclaim, but ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the same test at both levels.MR. GANNON: It's ­­ it's not the same test that the PTO applies in examination proceedings because it uses a slightly different threshold of ambiguity.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you finished with your answer?MR. GANNON: I could give an explanation of why.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you do it in a sentence?MR. GANNON: I could say that it involves the different circumstances there that include the different record, the different burden of proof, the lack of adversarial presentation there, and mostly critically, the fact that it's easier to amend the claims before the patent has been issued.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Four minutes, Mr. Vandenberg.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN D. VANDENBERGON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. VANDENBERG: Thank you. I think the ­­the essential points here are, first, the emphatic53Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 language that Congress chose, and then thinking about2 ambiguous claims. There is no legitimate need for3 ambiguous claims. There is a strong economic incentive4 for patent attorneys to draft ambiguous claims, not to5 put all their eggs in that basket. They want some clear6 claims in case some copyist comes along, but they want7 ambiguous claims so they can ­­ their client can treat8 it as a nose of wax later, as happened here. That is9 well established in the patent bar, that there is this10 strong economic incentive. But patent attorneys have11 ample tools to avoid ambiguous claims if this Court12 tells them that it will no longer be permitted. That ­­13 that is the key here, is that there's a strong economic14 incentive. The patent attorney and the inventor are in15 the best position to avoid the ambiguity that Congress16 prohibits and therefore, the problem is, the Federal17 Circuit has blessed ambiguity with its test. And in18 order to stop all of the problems that the amici have19 pointed out that are caused by ambiguous claims, we20 submit this Court needs to be clear and go back to21 United Carbon and General Electric and to the statutory22 text and be clear that ambiguity is simply not23 permitted.24 In terms of how the Federal Circuit ruled25 here, and we point to the majority's opinion at petition54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial￼1 appendix 15(a), the court, the majority, definitely2 applied the insolubly ambiguous test. They said,3 "Because the term was amenable to construction,4 indefiniteness here would require a showing that a5 person of ordinary skill would find spaced relationship6 to be insolubly ambiguous." And therefore, if the Court7 rejects that test, we submit, at the very least, the8 Court cannot affirm the judgment below on that basis.9 But more importantly ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Federal Circuit11 said something ­­ I'm looking at the petition appendix12 at 20(a) ­­ that sounded very close to what the13 government standard is. It said, "Sufficiently" ­­14 "that the claim provides parameters sufficient for a15 skilled artisan to understand the bounds of spaced16 relationship." That sounds very close to what the17 government says and it isn't ­­ they don't say anything18 about insoluble in ­­ in that statement.19 MR. VANDENBERG: It is true that here in20 some of their cases, the court will ­­ the Federal21 Circuit will use language like that saying that one22 could have understood. However, it's clear they were23 not applying the type of test that United Carbon and24 General Electric required. They did not even consider25 whether the person of skill in the art may have read the55Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425claim the different way.      And in terms of the two different claimscopes, we would simply invite the Court's attentionback to our reply brief at page 20, which explained thedifferent claim scopes.  We think the governmentmisunderstood the point, and therefore, in the reply, weamplified it some more.      But as ­­ as I said, the Court at the veryleast should not affirm.  But we think it's importanthere for the Court to create another concrete guidepost.  In KSR and Bilski, this Court provided a hugeservice to the patent bar in applying the correct law toan actual patent claim, creating concrete guide postsfor Section 101 and 103.  Well, the patent bar and thetrial courts need another concrete guide post ifapplying the correct law of Section 112, paragraph 2 tothis particular claim.      If there are no further questions, thankyou.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.(Whereupon at 11:07 a.m., the case in theabove­entitled matter was submitted.)56Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialPage 57￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼A abilities 38:9able 29:24
