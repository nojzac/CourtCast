Mensing, and the consolidated cases.Mr. Lefkowitz.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. LEFKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:This case involves the ordinary operation ofthe Supremacy Clause. As the government agrees, Hatch-Waxman's plain text requires generic drugs to have the same warnings as their brand-name equivalents, so State law can't require generic drugs to use different warnings. After all, generics can't simultaneously comply with a Federal duty to be the same and a State duty to be different.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that makes a lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that seems to cut the other way.MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth decision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that Federal law obligates and accommodates the brand manufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE4Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 regulation, in order to make a warning change, in order2 to comply with its obligations under 201.57. And, as3 the government agrees, we don't have the opportunity or4 the authority to use a CBE regulation change.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another -­6 you have another route, and that's what the government7 is telling us: That you could propose a revision of the8 label, and if you did that, then you would be home free.9 You would not be subject to the State suit.10 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Ginsburg, the11 government agrees with us that we can't actually change12 the label. What they say is, we could have an13 obligation, or they actually, in -- for the very first14 time ever in their brief in this Court at the merit15 stage, said that there is a -­16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it was in the -- at17 the cert stage as well.18 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, I didn't19 read the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty20 to ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that21 we have a duty to ask the FDA. And of course that's not￼22 a duty that23 rulemaking.2425 steps -- isappears in any of their notice and commentJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we call this the take this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes5Alderson Reporting Company7 position on 89 We maintainthat point.MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you, Justice Kennedy.Official - Subject to Final Review1 of discussion here?2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy, this3 is the take-steps.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me5 whether you say that that is preempted or just that it6 was not well-pled. I'm not -- I'm not sure of yourthat a claim that under State law ageneric make awhata subject of traditional State tort law. JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, whyJUSTICE SCALIA: Would the -- excuse me,20 Justice. 2122 manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA23 for a change?24 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, Your Honor, and in fact25 that was in part what was -- what came up in the610 company can11 labeling change is preempted under this Court's12 decisions both in Buckman and in ArkLa, because13 the -- what the Court has said is that the disclosure14 obligations between a Federal agency and a Federally15 regulated party are inherently Federal in character, and16 this is not 1718 should -­ 19be liable for not asking the FDA to￼Would the Federally licensed drugAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 briefing in the Wyeth case. Wyeth initially said it2 didn't have the obligation and couldn't use the CBE, and3 then Ms. Levine said: Well, in that case you could have4 asked the FDA to make a change, and the Court didn't5 need to even address that issue, because the Court found6 that there actually was a regulation on point that gave7 the brand manufacturer the ability to change.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But assume there hadn't9 been. Assume there hadn't been such a regulation. Do10 you understand it to be the government's position that11 the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from12 State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to13 give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to14 change those warnings?15 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I -- I don't see16 anything in the history, the 27-year history of17 Hatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said18 that there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a19 labeling change.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. There is a21 legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports22 of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong.23 Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the24 FDA when something's wrong?25 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not, Justice7￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Sotomayor.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please describe3 what the difference between that obligation and the4 obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's5 been misbranded.6 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Under the FDA Regulation7 314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure8 obligations. Any time a generic learns about an adverse9 report, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to10 investigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not11 in compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA12 has plenary authority to take all sorts of action.13 But just as the Court said in the Buckman14 decision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make15 appropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are16 hurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be17 injured and States might otherwise want to compensate18 them for them, those disclosure obligations are up to19 the FDA with its discretion to enforce. And the Court20 looked directly to Congress in section 337.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's -- so what's22 the conflict with State law, meaning you have an23 obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also24 have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of25 adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change,8￼Alderson Reporting Company3Official - Subject to Final Review1 why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation2 because you can go to the -- to the FDA?MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, first of all, there's4 a little bit of a difference between reporting all of5 the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the6 FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is7 only for the FDA to make with respect to generic8 companies.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you contest,10 Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I11 know that you contest your obligation to make that12 request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and13 make that request and set a process in motion?14 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, there's no15 question that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in16 fact if we had reason to believe that a label was not17 accurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that.18 The question is whether or not there's either a Federal19 obligation or a State duty to do this, and -­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you could go to the21 FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way:22 That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to23 warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense,24 that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to25 litigate that preemption defense, the question will be,9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA2 have done? Would it in fact have required both brand3 names and generics to change the label? And if it would4 have, you would not have had -- been put in an5 impossible position.MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is theof issues that this Court addressed both in in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could67 precise set8 Buckman and9 have done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the10 FDA. For a State to hold us liable for not asking the11 FDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes12 of the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided13 hypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in14 an area where the Federal Government, the Federal15 agency, has exclusive authority. And in Buckman, the16 Court said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion17 of the agency to decide whether to punish and how to18 punish disclosure.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Buckman --20 Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that21 there's a concern expressed in that case that22 requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would23 cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency24 with proposals and warning revisions, so that there25 would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be10￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 able to process them, and they would become meaningless2 to the consumers. That doesn't seem to me to be a3 concern in this case.4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the5 government had articulated that proposition in the6 Buckman case and again several years later in the7 Warner-Lambert case. Obviously, they're taking a8 different position here.9 But I would submit, Your Honor, that what10 lay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the11 relationship, the disclosures, between the Federal12 agency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal13 and States simply don't have a business trying to14 enforce those obligations, because that does take away15 from the authority and the discretion. And the Court16 looked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended17 that violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal18 Government.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal agency says20 that these suits complement, they're not at odds with,21 the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers22 an incentive to come forward. Everyone is interested in23 making sure that only safe drugs are marketed. So, far24 from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency25 responsible says, this helps us; it encourages11￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 manufacturers to report.2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, we know from the3 current FDA database that there were over 1600 requests4 for labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on,5 and that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth. And there6 are far more generic manufacturers who would be burdened7 by this new obligation. But, Your Honor, I would -­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there any9 breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic10 and how many from branded?11 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, almost all of12 them I would believe are from branded manufacturers,13 because generic manufacturers until the briefing in this14 Court have never believed that they have any obligation15 to ask the FDA.16 In fact, interestingly, the FDA has17 addressed what happens in the marketplace when a brand18 exits the market and the only drugs left are the 10 or19 15 generics. And what the FDA has said, and they have20 published 52 Federal Register notices -- we cite one of21 them in our reply brief -- they have said: In such a22 situation, we will designate one of the generics to be23 the leader for purposes of establishing the label, and24 everyone else has to follow.25 But critically, what the FDA has said is:12￼Alderson Reporting Company9 it happened10 something.1112 obligation,13 to the FDA.14 equipped in15 the -­that it was associated, a special group or What are you supposed to do?MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, we have an actually, to provide all of that informationGenerics, unlike brand companies, aren't the same way, necessarily, to evaluate16Official - Subject to Final Review1 In those situations, we, the FDA, will tell you when the2 label needs to change.3 JUSTICE BREYER: So what are you supposed to4 do if your company happens by chance to come across a5 very, very high correlation between people who take your6 generic drug and who get seriously ill?7 And now what you know is that nobody else8 has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are;￼JUSTICE BREYER: And so are they saying that17 you -- is it conceded in this case that you did tell the18 FDA everything you knew about that?MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, no. We -­ JUSTICE BREYER: Or is that a point in192021 dispute? 2223 we violated24 there's no basis for a State claim for that.25 In fact, to -- to address Justice Ginsburg's13MR. LEFKOWITZ: The plaintiffs allege that Federal disclosure obligations. Of course,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 question -­2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how would it3 conflict? Suppose the State said: Here is what we4 want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you5 must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an6 association, you must revise your warning. Now, we7 understand you can't do that without FDA approval. But8 as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you9 come across this serious problem you have to tell the10 FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it.11 Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that12 law would conflict with?13 MR. LEFKOWITZ: I think that law, Your14 Honor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and15 the ArkLa principles.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said you had17 to tell the FDA about it.18 MR. LEFKOWITZ: If the -- I understood19 Justice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not20 only did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do,21 but whether we then had some additional duty to ask the22 FDA to change the warning.￼2324 that. 25JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I didn't understand JUSTICE BREYER: What I wonder -- see, I14Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 wonder if that's this case. I wonder if this case is2 what they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA3 every single thing, so they were just as informed as you4 are about the risks here, but you did not add the words:5 And please change our -- your permission, so that we can6 change the warning. Is that what this case is about?7 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, I think that's what8 they're suggesting. But even if it were just the9 former -­10 JUSTICE BREYER: When they come up here they11 might say this isn't just what this case is about.12 MR. LEFKOWITZ:13 former, Your Honor, even if14 disclose adverse reports -­15 JUSTICE BREYER:16 MR. LEFKOWITZ:17 obligation to do, there is no history of State18 regulation of communications between Federal -- Federal19 agencies and the regulated parties. Those are not the20 kinds of parallel claims cases, like in Lohr v.21 Medtronic -­22 JUSTICE BREYER: So your argument is that if23 we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can24 make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a25 serious problem, and you're saying the State has no15Alderson Reporting CompanyEven if it's just the it's just the failure to￼Yeah.-- which we know we have anOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell2 anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get3 involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything4 because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get5 involved with our failure to try to change the warning6 because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell7 them, which we didn't fulfill?8 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Breyer, correct,9 because that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what10 happened was an individual was injured because the11 company had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled12 the agency about the purpose of marketing these bone13 screws. Clearly there was a State interest in14 protecting and providing a remedy to that consumer, a15 State interest in ensuring accurate disclosures to the16 government, and in fact an allegation that had there17 been accurate disclosures to the government, the FDA18 would have made a different safety and labeling19 determination.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that if the21 claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly,22 that claim could be brought?￼2324 Honor. 25MR. LEFKOWITZ: Not in a State court, YourCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To disclose -- I'm16Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 sorry. To disclose to the FDA?2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: To disclose to the FDA.4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: A claim, Your Honor, of5 disclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal6 relationship.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you just described8 Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to9 tell the FDA the purpose of the screws. You said that10 the State -- the State suit would lie because of that11 failure.12 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, I said the State suit --13 I apologize. I meant to say and I thought I said the14 State suit would not lie because Buckman preempts that15 type of lawsuit. Buckman says even in that terrible16 situation, misleading to the FDA, failure to disclose17 what the FDA requires you to disclose, there is no State18 cause of action because this is a uniquely Federal area19 and States can't supplant the FDA in its enforcement20 discretion.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think22 what the Respondents would say is that you are23 mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into24 something that it's not. Their complaint is a standard25 state failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense2 there's going to be questions about your disclosure3 obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in4 a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's5 in a fundamentally different posture than the one that6 you're suggesting.7 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, I would agree8 with you that what they pled below was a traditional9 failure to warn. A failure to warn claim means you did10 not warn the public in the way that we think under State11 law you should have. And whereas in Wyeth the Congress12 through the FDA has said a brand manufacturer ultimately13 is responsible for the warnings it issues and therefore14 can change the warning and therefore can be held liable,15 we don't have -- and the government agrees with us -- we16 don't have any mechanism under law to change the￼17 warnings. So to the extent this is18 failure to warn claim, it has to be19 simple Supremacy Clause principles.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I21 have any ability yourself to change22 here's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an23 ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA24 applicant -- believes new safety information should be25 added to a product's labeling, presumably because18Alderson Reporting Companya traditional preempted underagree that you don't the warning, butOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 they've gotten information that suggests that the2 product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the3 FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for4 the generic and listed drugs should be revised.5 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is exactly6 what the FDA says. They point for that to a preamble in7 1992 to a rulemaking that didn't address the relevant8 201.57 regulation, a preamble that was issued without9 notice and comment rulemaking, and a preamble that10 doesn't actually impose a duty. It says if,11 subjunctively, we believe that there should be a label12 change, we should do something, we should ask the FDA.13 Not we must, not we shall.14 And even then it said: And the FDA will15 then make a decision, which makes clear that this is not16 a decision for State juries to make. Your Honor, the17 FDA has articulated a Federal duty today in its briefing18 in this case that is very much at odds with what it has19 specifically said about what a generic's obligation is20 under 201.57. In the two notice and comment rulemakings21 at issue during the relevant time period here, in 200022 and 2006, what the FDA said very specifically was a23 generic's obligation under 201.57 is to use the brand24 label, even if the brand label isn't the most25 up-to-date.19￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 And the reason is the policy underlying2 Hatch-Waxman is that brand companies do safety and3 efficacy testing; generics do sameness testing.4 Generics are required to make copies of the drugs and by5 definition make copies of the labels, because it6 wouldn't make any sense to go into a drugstore to buy7 Advil and to see 15 different generic ibuprofen and to8 have 15 different sets of warnings.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think -­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Buckman was a case -- I'm11 pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a12 branded manufacturer, was it not?13 MR. LEFKOWITZ: It was a medical device14 manufacturer.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: A medical device16 manufacturer. So there it was -- it was an FDA process,17 and we said there's no State cause of action for saying18 that the FDA process -- that's slightly different from19 saying that you have a duty to warn the FDA. You might20 say it's a fortiori.21 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I do think it's22 a fortiori. Buckman involves the branded process of23 coming on with an equivalent medical device under the24 510K process. This is actually a situation where, after25 intensive back and forth with the FDA, the brand company20￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 crafts the label that the FDA approves and the generic2 is given one responsibility by Congress. The3 responsibility is to maintain the same label as the4 brand. That's the critical difference.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think6 Congress really intended to create a market in which7 consumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if8 that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic?9 And why in the world would Congress create a different,10 or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named11 products or generic products to give them information12 about labels when they know there's been a misbranding?What the government says is you start bya jury that there had to actually have been that proved a misbranding. That's the first tort suit according to the government. So1314 instructing15 information16 step of the17 why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have18 intended to treat the two differently?19 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, I want to20 take both halves of your question. In 27 years of21 enforcement under Hatch-Waxman, the FDA has never once22 said that a generic drug that uses the brand label, as23 required under 505(j) of the statute is misbranded. And24 the -- look, I understand that from the consumer's25 perspective it may not make a lot of sense. But what￼21Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Congress specifically said is that a generic has to bear2 the same label, and it's because they do have different3 purposes, different functions. Congress said that4 whenever there is a brand drug on the market that no5 longer is protected by its patent monopoly but has been6 selling for7 selling for8 branded and9$10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics pennies for the pill, and they've given generics different obligations.And the different obligations are seen most10 clearly through the prism of the Wyeth case. The Wyeth11 case was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this12 Court found that the brand company had the ability, had13 the obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually14 change the label, whereas here what the FDA has said15 time and time again is: We'll tell a generic when the16 generic has to change the label, because we don't assume17 that the generics are going to know when the label18 should change because they don't have the same basis of19 clinical testing and results.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a21 certain overlap, is there not? Some of the generics are22 made by the same people that make the brand-name drugs,23 isn't that so?24 MR. LEFKOWITZ: That is correct, Your Honor.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at least for those22￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 people, they have the means.2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I don't know3 whether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold4 differently in a case where the generic at issue was an5 authorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand6 company that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety7 testing and might have a different basis for assessing8 the occasional adverse reports that they get.9 But, again, the keys to understanding the -­10 the generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse11 reports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the12 doctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off13 the box that says a generic can be issued. If a patient14 comes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor15 has no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the16 market actually was dispensed, so he'll actually tell17 the brand company. He'll report the adverse event to18 the brand company.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you're20 arguing is that this rule will have little practical21 effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that22 could be brought against your companies because you're23 just not going to have enough information to suggest a24 label change.25 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, what I'm arguing23￼Alderson Reporting Company15 exclusively16 government.17 it looks at18within the province of the FederalThat's what Buckman says very clearly whenSection 337.If I may, I would like to reserve my time. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,Official - Subject to Final Review1 is that for the FDA to impose a new Federal obligation2 that will significantly change the way generic companies3 conduct their business should go through notice and4 comment rulemaking. It should not rely on a preamble to5 a different rulemaking that didn't go through notice and6 comment. It should not rely on briefs that are filed at7 the merits stage, because this would totally change the8 way generics do business.9 Generics don't have a practice -- they're10 not even set up -- to go and figure out what label11 changes would be appropriate. They are set up to report12 adverse events to the FDA, and what Congress has said13 and what the FDA has said is violations of those14 statutes, violations of those regulations, are￼1920 Mr. Lefkowitz.21 Mr. Bograd.22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS M. BOGRAD23 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS24 MR. BOGRAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it25 please the Court:24Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 The central issue in this case is that2 Petitioners, in the face of considerable information3 that the warnings on their products were inadequate, did4 nothing. The generic drug companies' position is that5 they -- no matter how much they know, no matter how6 grave the risk, they are under no obligation to do7 anything to warn of the dangers of the products they8 sell.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're -­10 they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the11 facts which establish the grave risk, right?12 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.13 They're obliged under -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the argument here is15 whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that16 determines whether there was a grave enough risk to17 modify the -- the label or whether that call will be18 made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would19 have done, right?20 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, that's not21 correct. What this Court said in Wyeth v. Levine is22 that State juries are a perfectly appropriate vehicle23 for assessing whether warnings in the past were24 adequately given. We do -- we do not dispute that the25 issue about what language will be on a label going25￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425forward rests with the agency.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but -- no,but -- but surely you have to establish not only that the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but that a label change would have been approved. Otherwise there's no causation. Surely -­MR. BOGRAD: That's correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's part of your case, isn't it?MR. BOGRAD: No, it's not, Justice Scalia. The -- as Petitioners concede in the brief, under traditional State law failure to warn claim, our affirmative case is that the warnings that were given to the doctor and to the patient were inadequate, and that because adequate warnings weren't given, the patient was injured.JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but their -­ their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, and you don't contest that. They had to give the warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the warnings must be changed, so -­MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, I don't see how you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to give the warnings that they had to give.26Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: And they could have lobbied the FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the FDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the FDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no.Would your lawsuit still proceed?MR. BOGRAD: No, it would not, Your Honor. JUSTICE SCALIA: No.MR. BOGRAD: Once the FDA said no, we wouldhave clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected the warning -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say -­MR. BOGRAD: -- which is what this Court said in Levine is the touchstone.JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. You're drawing a line between the FDA rejecting a warning and the FDA not accepting the warning; is that the line you're drawing?MR. BOGRAD: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of impossibility. In order for the -- preemption is an affirmative defense, and for the defendants to establish that it was impossible, i.e., that the duties under State and Federal law were in direct conflict, they have to show that the FDA would have rejected -­JUSTICE BREYER: It appears also that the -­27Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not2 Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've3 learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties;4 they must tell the FDA every detail.5 MR. BOGRAD: Well -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: That sounds awfully7 familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically8 a claim of fraud on the FDA. And we said it's not up to9 the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim10 for fraud on the FDA. The FDA has to enforce their own11 stuff. And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA12 has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us13 everything you know? What's the answer to that?14 MR. BOGRAD: Well, there are two answers,15 Your Honor. First -- first, this Court's decision in16 Levine is inconsistent with that sweeping reading -­17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, because Levine involves18 the Wyeth case, right?19 MR. BOGRAD: Yes. I'm sorry, I -­20 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The -- the difference21 there is the difference that the SG points out: There22 is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker23 to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the24 warnings. But here the FDA tells us they have no power25 to change their warnings. They can't, unlike Levine.28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 They have to copy the original maker. So -- I'm -- I'm2 just referring there to the whole SG brief.3 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, let me respond to4 that in -- in two ways. First -­5 JUSTICE BREYER: Be sure you answer, please,6 my original question.7 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I will, Your Honor.8 The -- to focus first on the CBE issue, one9 of the things this Court noted in Levine is that even10 under the CBE process, the ultimate decision about11 whether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not12 with the manufacturer. The -- the fundamental issue in13 Levine was that the primary responsibility for labeling14 rested with the manufacturer, not with the agency,15 subject to the agency's review. And we don't dispute16 that the agency has the right to review and can reject a17 label.18 The -- what was at the core and what this19 Court cited, although the -- the number has changed in20 Wyeth v. Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR21 201.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they22 renumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be23 revised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an24 association of a serious hazard with the drug.25 The government says, and the regulatory29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 structure makes clear, that that provision applies with2 full force to generic drug manufacturers, not just to3 name-brand drug manufacturers. It is the regulatory4 implementation of the obligation under the Federal5 misbranding statute, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2) that says you6 can't sell a drug that doesn't have adequate warnings7 about its risks.8 So, when you're -- when the manufacturer is9 confronted with information that the warnings on its10 drug are not adequate, it -- the way it -- the way it11 should respond is by immediately going to the FDA and12 saying to the agency: We have this new information; we13 ask you, not that we want a different warning from the￼14 name brand,15 on both the16 equivalents.171819 know -- one20 the agency would have approved the warning, stronger21 warnings would have been given and our clients -- my22 clients likely would not have been injured; or they23 would have said, no, we don't think there's sufficient24 information to justify this warning.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long does it30but we ask you to approve a stronger warning name-brand product and its genericCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens -­ MR. BOGRAD: And had they done so, we would of two things would have happened. EitherAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425take -- how long typically does it take the FDA to respond to a request from a generic manufacturer that it -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the label?MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, as you just heard from Mr. Lefkowitz, generic manufacturers typically haven't been fulfilling this obligation and have not been asking the agency. But the latest data from the agency, and this is from its -- its web site, is that under -- they've been publishing performance data since 2007, and they now say that safety labeling changes, which are the labeling changes required under FD -­ under FDA, are processed typically in a matter of months, 94 percent within 3 months.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those the ones that are submitted by generic manufacturers?MR. BOGRAD: They're -- they are -- they could be ones submitted by generic manufacturers. Those are ones where the information that comes to the agency triggers a -- a labeling revision process.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the -- does the -­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether about -­ MR. BOGRAD: I'm sorry, what was that? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going toask, does the FDA give you an up or a down, or does it31Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425just not take action sometimes if you submit one of these requests?MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, my understanding -­ there were certainly procedures available that would have required an up-or-down: The citizens petition process, for example, the supplement process, for example. The -- what -- the government has represented that even if the request came in a more informal form, the government would nevertheless take a request for a -- a labeling change to reflect a serious inadequacy in label warning seriously and act on it promptly.JUSTICE SCALIA: Just so I understand what you've said, this 3-month turnaround that you mentioned, they are all requests from labeled manufacturers, right?MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, these are -­ these are actually -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that generic manufacturers don't make any requests.MR. BOGRAD: I -- they could be -- they could be from name-brand companies; they could be from private citizens.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.MR. BOGRAD: It's whenever the agency becomes aware of information.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see.32Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. BOGRAD: But the agency also processes2 supplement requests, according to its web site, in 973 percent of the cases or something, within 4 months.4 It's not -- it's -- it is a matter of months, not -- not5 years.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you, and I think7 that this is part of what your adversary has been8 talking about when he says we don't usually receive9 adverse incident reports; they go to the brand10 manufacturer. So tell me what you view as your main11 obligation. This is a little bit like what Justice12 Scalia was asking.13 You come in and you say there's a drug, it14 has an adverse effect, there should have been a warning15 about it because look at all of this literature, look at16 all of this proof -­17 MR. BOGRAD: Uh-huh.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that this drug is, in19 fact, in some way plausibly or otherwise causing this20 incident, and the label was inadequate to tell me not to21 do it. Is that your obligation completely? You don't22 have an obligation to show that this particular23 manufacturer knew that in some way?24 MR. BOGRAD: Well, under most -- under the25 law of most States, and this is true in both Louisiana33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 and Minnesota, there is a reasonableness element in a2 failure to warn claim, but it's -- the standard is "knew3 or should have known," so that the manufacturer -­4 manufacturers are typically held to the -- to the5 knowledge of an expert in the field of the products they6 manufacture. And here the -- our contention has been7 that if the generic manufacturers had merely examined8 the publicly available FDA database of adverse event9 reports, and merely paid attention to reports in the10 published literature that had since 19 -- the early11 1990s had documented a serious association between12 long-term use of metoclopramide and tardive dyskinesia,13 they would have had more than sufficient information to14 say to the agency, we need a change here.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does a generic manufacturer16 have to be an expert in the field in which it17 manufactures?18 MR. BOGRAD: Under State law, yes, it does,19 Your Honor.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does -- what does21 being an expert mean?22 MR. BOGRAD: It means -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: In this context, being an24 expert means being able to produce exactly the drug that25 has been approved by the FDA, right? You don't have to34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 be expert in anything else?2 MR. BOGRAD: That's incorrect, Your Honor.3 They have to be -­JUSTICE SCALIA: What else do they need?MR. BOGRAD: They have to remain informed of posed by the products they sell. They have -­JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make them an4 56 the dangers7 obligations89 expert. I'm talking about what expertise does -- does10 the company have to -- to possess. It surely has to11 possess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the12 product that the -- that the -- that has been approved13 by the FDA. What other expertise is necessary?14 MR. BOGRAD: Well, Your Honor, one of their15 obligations under Federal law is to go to the agency16 every year and identify significant new information that17 would affect the safety or efficacy or labeling of their18 product, which means they have to have the capacity to19 evaluate information that is out there, and that -­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that'd take21 any expertise. You have people who complain, I've taken22 -- I've taken your pill, and it -- it, you know, it's23 caused -- this is expertise? That's not what I normally24 think of. Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed,25 require expertise, conducting tests and knowing what35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 changes will produce what results and so forth; right?2 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor. In fact, in3 this particular context we're talking about a use that4 was never approved by the FDA. We're talking about use5 beyond 12 weeks, which had never been evaluated. So6 there's really no basis to assume that the name-brand7 manufacturer here had any more expertise -­8 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they had. Suppose9 that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident10 reports?11 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, imagine a13 company that files every adverse incident report,14 complies completely; period. Now, in your view does it15 have an additional obligation?16 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, it does, Your Honor.17 JUSTICE BREYER: And what is that?18 MR. BOGRAD: It has an obligation under19 201.57(e) to initiate a label change -­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.21 MR. BOGRAD: -- process whenever it has22 reasonable -­23 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, their argument is that24 in respect to their failure to do the first, that's25 Buckman. That is similar to Buckman.36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. BOGRAD: All right. If we -- we were2 talking about -­3 JUSTICE BREYER: Now. And that's what I -­4 now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything.5 The FDA has all that information.6 MR. BOGRAD: Oh, that's -- that's incorrect,7 Justice Breyer.8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is it?9 MR. BOGRAD: It's -- well, as this Court10 said in Levine, the FDA has 11,000 drugs it needs to11 monitor and stay on top of, and it doesn't have the12 resources necessary to pay attention to every adverse13 event report it gets and every report that is published14 in the scientific literature. The reason that15 manufacturers bear the primary responsibility is because16 they -- they need to trigger the FDA's focus on a17 particular issue here. Here this information was18 available since the mid '90s.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic argument, I'm20 getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the21 failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to22 require them to keep track of adverse incidents and23 other things in the -- and do their best to change the24 label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely,25 and asking them to change.37￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BOGRAD: Exactly, Your Honor. Their obligation -- their obligation under State law is to provide a warning. What they should have done, and if you take -- what they should have done is go to the FDA and ask the FDA to approve a stronger warning. If the FDA had said no, they would have a preemption.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -­JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a generic -- suppose that the FDA issued a rule that says a generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to request a change in labeling. Could a generic drug manufacturer be held liable on a failure to warn claim on the theory that it could have lobbied the FDA to change the rule that says that the generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to ask for a change in labeling?MR. BOGRAD: I -- I don't have an immediate answer to that, Justice Alito. The -- the -- the State -- the -- I -- the question is whether there would be a direct conflict between State and Federal law. It seemsOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼to me unless -- I'm sorry. light.Unless the -­JUSTICE ALITO: where your theory leads?MR. BOGRAD: My38Oh, that's the 5 minuteIsn't that why -- isn't that -- my theory leads to the -­Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 to the proposition that, unless Federal law precludes2 them from -- from going to the process of strengthening3 their warning label, then the State may legitimately4 enforce its5 and safety.67 have a duty8 nowhere provided for under the FDA rules; and so I don't9 -- so it's a duty to lobby the FDA basically to change10 the rules, isn't that right?11 MR. BOGRAD: Justice Alito, well, as you12 know, we disagree with the government about whether13 certain formal processes were available. But -­14 JUSTICE ALITO: Assuming that they're15 correct in their interpretation of their own16 regulations.17 MR. BOGRAD: But assuming -- but -- but if18 we're talking -- but there may not be a formal process,19 but there is a formal obligation, both under statute,20 not to sell a misbranded drug, and under regulation, to21 revise your labeling as soon as there's reasonable22 evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the23 drug. And I think it's -­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your -- what is25 your explanation for why Buckman isn't applicable here?39obligation to protect its citizens' health I think it's important in this regard -­JUSTICE ALITO: But your theory is that they to pursue an informal process that is￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. BOGRAD: Because, Your Honor, this is -­2 and I should start by saying that in Buckman there was3 -- the suit was not against the manufacturer; the suit4 in Buckman was against a consultant that -- that helped5 the manufacturer get FDA approval. There was a separate6 product liability action against the manufacturer that7 had already been litigated and settled.8 The -- Buckman said: We're not talking9 about traditional causes of action, State law causes of10 action like in Lohr, or like in -- or as this Court11 again said in Wyeth v. Levine; we're talking about a12 case where the whole centrality of the claim is premised13 on the relationship between the company -- or the14 defendant and the agency.15 This is not that case. We're -- this case16 is about the -- the duty that the company owes to my17 clients and their doctors to provide them with adequate18 warnings. That duty, which is -- has been recognized by19 this Court innumerable times, complements the FDA20 statutory scheme by creating incentives for companies21 like the Petitioners to -­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the suit was brought23 by the injured person in Buckman.24 MR. BOGRAD: But -­25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's similar in that40￼Alderson Reporting Company9 consultant,10 The Buckman11 exclusively12the Buckman Company, and the injured person. Company's dealing were -- had beenwith the agency.They had had no dealing whatsoever -- theyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 respect. And in Buckman there was a -- a formal2 relationship which did not permit the cause of action,3 and it seems to me you could at least argue that a4 fortiori there should be no cause of action when there5 an informal relationship.6 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I'm not sure I follow the7 a fortiori point in this context, Your Honor. But in8 Buckman there was no relationship whatsoever between the13 had not failed to warn. That's why we -- the plaintiffs14 had created this bizarre cause of action, and it's -- we15 think it's a wholly distinguishable case.16 I think it's important to remember, first17 off, the world in which we live today. 70 percent of18 all prescriptions are filled with generic drugs. A19 third of generic drugs no longer have name-brand￼20 competitors21 name brands2223 in all those cases to sort of carry the flag, right?24 MR. BOGRAD: Somebody has been appointed to25 be the reference-listed drug. They have not beenat all, because the economic -- because the have withdrawn from the market, so that -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: Somebody has been appointed41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 appointed to have obligations distinct from the other2 generic companies as far as updating label claims.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't they have a distinct4 obligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when5 they think they're necessary?6 MR. BOGRAD: I -- Your Honor, that would be7 a question better directed to Mr. Kneedler, but I don't8 believe -- I don't believe that there's a -- there's a9 difference.10 Any -- we have a system today where every11 State has a drug substitution law that drives12 prescriptions to be filled with generics rather than13 name-brand products. We have a system where Medicare,14 Medicaid, and insurers force or encourage the15 substitution of generics through -- through price16 incentives. If generics are not responsible, in many of17 these cases no one is responsible.18 The -- we -- the position that the generics19 are proposing here is one in which they would be immune20 from liability for selling a product with inadequate21 warnings, even though the name-brand company selling the22 same drug with the same warnings would be liable. There23 is no suggestion anywhere in the record, Your Honor,24 anywhere in the legislative history or in the text of25 Hatch-Waxman or in FDA regulations that that distinction42￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425was ever contemplated by Congress, that it was ever sanctioned by the FDA.I would like to make one final point, Your Honor. In Bates -- and I apologize; we didn't address this specifically in our briefs, because I didn't notice it until later -- the statutory scheme at issue in Bates, under FIFRA, was almost identical to the -- I'm sorry. I see my time has expired. May I finish my point, Your Honor?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish yoursentence.JUSTICE SCALIA: Make it a long sentence, with a lot of "ands."(Laughter.)MR. BOGRAD: There was no CBE equivalent in Bates in the -- under the FIFRA statutory scheme, and yet this Court upheld against a motion to dismiss on preemption grounds a failure to warn claim, admittedly under an express preemption provision. This Court upheld a claim against a pesticide manufacturer even though the pesticide manufacturer could not have changed its warning without prior EPA approval, exactly the same situation that confronts the generics here.Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.43Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mr. Kneedler.ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTSMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were designed to facilitate the entry of generic drugs onto the market. They do not absolve a manufacturer of his responsibilities after entry onto the market to maintain the safety of the drug and the adequacy of -- of the label.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, supposethat I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug manufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I do think that there's an opportunity for that manufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a label. If that's the way I read the law, does your result follow? Do you think, then, that State law claims should be able to go forward?MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, we do, because the ultimate question in the preemption case is whether there's a conflict. And if the -- if the manufacturer has an opportunity to come to FDA, even if -- even if44Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the Court were to conclude it didn't have an obligation2 to do so, if it had the opportunity to do so and did3 nothing when -- when dramatic evidence, you know, by4 hypothesis, came to its attention, it wasn't prohibited5 from doing so. There was no -­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the7 patient's physician has the same opportunity. Anybody8 could go to the FDA and say this label ought to be9 changed, right? So the -- the physician taking care of10 this plaintiff didn't -- had the opportunity to go to11 the FDA and didn't. Is there a cause of action against12 him?13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the FDCA does14 not regulate the responsibilities of physicians in those15 situations. The whole point of the labeling -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what17 the -- the FDCA regulation. We're talking about what18 State law would allow, and State law would allow a suit19 against the physician because he did not take advantage20 of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label21 change.22 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think State law23 would -- would impose an obligation on the physician to24 adequately advise the patient, but what's so different25 is, the physician relies upon the labeling. If the45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 physician has the information, the physician, on his own2 initiative, could tell the patient or warn the patient3 about what's going on without -- without having to go to4 FDA at all.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if your theory of6 the case is accepted, this is what will happen: Every7 time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident8 report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will9 be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We10 think you should consider revising the labels because of11 this, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is12 completely protected from State suits?13 MR. KNEEDLER: Several things. The14 manufacturer does, of course, have the obligation to15 furnish the adverse event information that it receives.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.17 MR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if the standard in18 regulation 57(e) is met, where there's evidence,19 reasonable evidence, of a serious hazard, it has an20 obligation -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not22 going to take a chance. They're going to say, if you're23 the FDA, you look at it. We're just telling you what we24 know, and we think you ought to consider revising the25 label.46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KNEEDLER: But they are -- they are to2 propose -- in our view, are to propose a labeling3 change, which means that the -­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. We think you5 should revise the label; if you agree, this is what it6 should look like.7 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and we don't -- we don't8 think it will lead to a flood of such requirements in9 the wake of 1011 preemption? 121314 preemption? 15this -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead toMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it lead to￼MR. KNEEDLER: If the -- if FDA rejected the16 request, there would -- there would be preemption,17 because FDA -- it would have been submitted to the18 expert agency, as we think is required.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Wouldn't20 you -- if you were the generic company's lawyer, you21 would advise them to do that in every case, right?22 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think I -- I don't23 think in every case. I think it's -- if -- but here,24 here we have a situation where, at least according to25 the allegations, there were published studies of47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 long-term use of this product.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that's3 what this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic4 manufacturer would be worried about every case, and it5 would just add this boilerplate language at the end of6 every letter, and as I understand your theory, they7 would be protected.89 evidence at10 What the --11 manufacturer to do was to -- was to submit the proposal12 to FDA with supporting information. In other words,13 suppose it's the sort of submission that would -- that14 would be like -­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be the -- the16 prologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the17 rule was never submitted for notice and comment. Is18 that what you're relying on, that prologue?19 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think, to put it20 in context, these were the regulations actually21 implementing the Hatch-Waxman statute, and there was a22 proposal to allow the manufacturers to deviate from23 the -- from the NDA holders' label and put their own on24 it. And the -- and FDA said, no, you can't do that, but25 what you should do is bring it to FDA, and FDA will48MR. KNEEDLER: It's not just boilerplate the bottom of the -- as part of a letter. what the Federal Register notice told the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 decide whether to change the labels for everyone.2 And so this was part and parcel of the3 notice and comment rulemaking: How should -- how should4 a generic manufacturer deal with a situation where it5 has information that may deviate from the NDA6 holder's -- how should it -­7 JUSTICE ALITO: Has the FDA made any8 calculation of the economic consequences of imposing9 this duty on generic drug manufacturers? I don't know10 whether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem to11 me that it may significantly increase the costs for12 generic drug manufacturers, and therefore counteract one13 of the objectives of the statute, which was to provide14 generic drugs at a low cost.15 MR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, FDA has not16 done an analysis. But it's important to understand the17 duty here derives from the misbranding provisions. A18 generic drug manufacturer is not exempt from the19 misbranding requirements of the act, which prohibit20 distributing a drug that does not have adequate -­21 adequate warnings, and rule 57(e) requiring a22 manufacturer to propose a warning or to make a warning￼23 change if there is evidence24 implements that misbranding25 an imposition by FDA. This49of a serious hazard requirement. So this is not is an underlying requirementAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the act.I would -­Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I -- am I to understand -- and I think I am understanding you. There is a legal obligation in the statute to report adverse events.

KNEEDLER: State -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if reasonable evidence, whether directly in their possession or in the marketplace -­MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the FDA regulations do not explicitly require monitoring of literature, but -­ but there's no conflict in State law imposing a duty to do that.If I -- if I may just discuss Buckman for a minute, because -­JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you decide whether a generic manufacturer ought to have proposed a -- a labeling change?MR. KNEEDLER: If the standard -­JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a generic manufacturer. He doesn't know anything about -- about50￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 science. He knows how to replicate this pill exactly.2 That's all -- that's all he really knows.3 Now, what is the test you're going to impose4 to -- to a jury to decide whether this generic5 manufacturer ought to have -- ought to have proposed a6 labeling change?7 MR. KNEEDLER: It's the -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it, well, you9 know, if he had been as well armed scientifically as the10 original manufacturer of the labeled drug, he should11 have known or, you know, does this guy who graduated12 from high school and can replicate a pill, should he13 have known? What -- what's the -­14 MR. KNEEDLER: It's the standard in 57(e) if15 there's evidence of a serious hazard, we think State law16 can impose on a generic manufacturer which is putting a17 potentially dangerous product on the market the18 obligation to -- to investigate.19 I would -- I would like to talk about20 Buckman for just a minute, please, because it's -- it's21 come up. Buckman is fundamentally different. There was22 no independent State law duty to warn at issue in23 Buckman. It was solely a tort based on lying to the24 FDA. It is a tort that depended entirely on the25 existence of the FDA.51￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in the brief -­2 and in the brief that you filed you said one of the3 concerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with4 all these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would5 interfere with the FDA's ability. Now you're telling6 me -- you -- you said when you started out that you7 think it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely. In8 your brief it said SG language you said we're not9 prepared to predict that a ruling would do this.10 So, why is that a difference between those11 two cases?12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, Buckman was a situation13 of a collateral attack on a decision that had actually14 been made by FDA. There was no independent duty --15 State law or duty to warn, no relationship between the16 person submitting information to FDA. It was just a17 State making the tort to lie to the FDA, and you would18 have had the State regulating nothing but the19 relationship between the manufacturer and FDA.20 Here State law is regulating the21 relationship between the manufacturer and -- and the22 patient through the doctor, and that's a traditional23 area of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice24 Kagan, I think you're right, the question then is25 whether there is an affirmative defense of -- of52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 preemption, and the preemption comes in. It's very2 different from Buckman in that situation.3 It's up to the defendant to prove, it's not4 an element of the cause of action as in Buckman. It's5 part of the defense for the defendant to prove that -­6 that it is -- that the cause of action is preempted.7 And in our view it's not preempted if the8 standard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change9 that is an obligation that extends to all manufacturers10 generic or not.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's12 not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling13 change. It says labeling shall be revised, and the one14 thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't15 revise the labeling from the branded one.16 MR. KNEEDLER: It can't revise the labeling,17 but that doesn't mean it can do nothing. Impossibility18 preemption kicks in only when it's genuinely impossible,19 and if the manufacturer could go to FDA and propose a20 labeling change, it is not impossible for to it do that.21 At that point it's up to FDA and preemption would kick22 in.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,24 Mr. Kneedler.25 Mr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 remaining.2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you.5 Mr. Kneedler has basically postulated a6 situation where we're going to have jury trials about7 whether a Federal duty to the FDA was breached. And8 it's interesting, he says that this isn't Buckman, but9 of course, Buckman involved the same duty not to sell a10 dangerous product, and the same issue of lack of11 disclosure to the FDA.12 Now, he says it was a collateral attack, but13 actually that was the premise of Justice Stevens'14 concurrence, where Justice Stevens said I get to the￼15 same result16 was nothing1718 as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure19 to tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure tofor a different reason. What the Court said about a collateral attack.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the difference,20 tell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and21 saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no22 obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is23 accurate.24 And what the government is saying, as I25 understand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you54Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public2 health.3 So what's wrong with that argument?4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor,5 respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're6 claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of7 impossibility preemption. We couldn't warn, and the8 government's brief makes clear we had no ability to9 warn.10 What the government is now doing is it's11 taking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word12 "ask" in it. It actually says "revise." And it says13 revise because it's a regulation written for brand14 manufacturers that have the CBE option available to15 them, and they are then trying to incorporate the words16 "duty to ask" through this brief without, as Justice17 Alito says, taking into any account through notice and18 comment rulemaking the effect of this.19 Well, we know that there are over 1,60020 requests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now,21 650 of them are pending for more than 6 months. And at22 the relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only23 would we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would24 have had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to25 the FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to55￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 change, so we would have had to make the request, the2 FDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and3 then we would have had to follow.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you5 had asked, you would be in a different situation. If6 you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was7 negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we8 can right now. But you're not in that situation. You,9 in fact, have not done all you can right now to change10 the label because you never wrote that letter.11 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, and again just12 to pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and13 Justice Scalia said, we have done everything we are14 required to do, which is to provide all of the15 information about adverse reports that we have and all16 of the results of our investigations to the government.17 And if the government wants to impose a new duty through18 notice and comment rulemaking saying, and now we have a19 duty to ask for a label change, in addition -­20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is taking21 the position that there's no clash between the22 government, the State, and Federal law. It's not saying23 that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you24 don't file this law. The government is saying, the25 question is preemption. Is there a clash between56￼Alderson Reporting Company7 obligations8 limits, and9to the Federal Government is simply offin fact -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the -- Buckman wasOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you2 have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if3 either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not4 going to change the label?5 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Buckman makes6 very clear that a State trying to regulate disclosure10 about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought11 under State law for fraud on a Federal agency.MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, it was a case13 brought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the14 company had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the15 FDA. It's the same thing here, and I just want to16 point -­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree18 with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the19 government's position? I thought the government was12￼20 saying that21 generics to2223 saying -­ 24there was an obligation on the part of the propose changes.JUSTICE SCALIA: 25 would be saying you have anMR. LEFKOWITZ:Absolutely. What they areOtherwise, the government obligation to lobby, and I57Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 don't think they're saying that.2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, in a sense the3 government is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose4 changes is a -- is a very fine distinction. Clearly,5 what the government is now saying is they are reading a6 regulation that they've always interpreted as being only7 applicable to brand companies and saying now it's8 applicable to their companies and it incorporates new9 language that says not just revise but ask.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,11 Mr. Lefkowitz.
