Stewart.Mr. Galanter.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GALANTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The Virginia Office for Protection andAdvocacy, known as "VOPA," seeks to enforce its Federal statutory right to inspect and copy records that are in the possession of State officials who run State-operated hospitals.Respondents acknowledged below that if Petitioner were a private entity, Ex parte Young would permit this suit. VOPA's status as a State entity does not change the Ex parte Young analysis because it imposed neither a greater burden on the treasury nor the dignity of the State. The only issue to be resolved by the Federal court is who has the correct reading of Federal law about the records access issue. It -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if this were a private suit, let's say Ford Motor Company hasOfficial - Subject to Final Review3￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review41 two subsidiaries, Ford East and Ford West. They get2 into a dispute. Ford West sues Ford East. No Federal3 court would entertain that action, would it?4 MR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, if I could5 clarify. First of all, there would have to be a6 question of Federal law.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. They think --8 Ford West thinks Ford East is discriminating on the9 basis of race.10 MR. GALANTER: It would have to -­11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That adversely12 affects their reputation, too, so they sue them.1314 goes to the15 Article III16 that because VOPA is independent of the entity that it's17 trying to -­1819 independent2021 executive branch. It's independent from the RespondentsMR. GALANTER: I -- I think that inquiry question of adversity and standing, the question. And this case doesn't involve￼22 it's trying 232425to sue.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes -­MR. GALANTER: And it is -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but is itCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. It's-- right -- it's independent from what? MR. GALANTER: It's independent from theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review51 independent from the State? Is that what the statute2 says?3 MR. GALANTER: The -- the statute requires4 independence. The Federal statute requires that VOPA be5 independent. But it's independent here because its6 commission -- only a third of it is appointed by the7 governor, and none of the members of the commission that8 run VOPA can be removed except for cause.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say on10 of your brief, the blue brief, that there's no11 here with respect to State sovereignty because12 ultimately the sovereign retains the authority13 dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State14 believes the litigation is too onerous.15 MR. GALANTER: That -- that's correct. That16 is, the sovereign, the Commonwealth, could repeal the17 law that enacted VOPA, just as in this Court's cases,18 ICC v. United States, Congress could have removed -­page 27 big dealto￼19 eliminated the ICC.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a good -- a21 good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those22 cases, the ICC is really not the real party in interest.23 The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC24 ruling.25MR. GALANTER: Well, I believe this CourtAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review61 has continually held that independent agencies and other2 Federal agencies can litigate, the cases involving the3 Federal Labor Relations Board. And this Court has4 allowed, for example, suits about licenses for Federal5 dams where one agency wants to build a Federal dam and6 another is -­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To get -- to get8 back to my question, you -- no court would entertain9 Ford West against Ford East?10 MR. GALANTER: If -- if that's right, and I11 think it is if they're part of the same -- if they're12 subsidiaries of one corporation and aren't separate.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why is that true?14 If they're separate corporate entities, what legal rule15 would stop a separate corporate entity from suing16 another? Is there a -- if they're part of the same17 company, I think that's a different issue. If they are18 the same company, that's a different issue, and just a19 different branch or a different office.20 MR. GALANTER: I -- I had understood that to21 be the Chief Justice's hypothetical. They were -- they22 were divisions of a single legal entity.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not divisions;24 separate corporate entities that happened to be wholly25 owned by the same parent.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review71 MR. GALANTER: I do believe then that there2 could be litigation between them, but ultimately there3 wouldn't be.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have5 thought that would become an advisory opinion. Ford has6 an internal dispute, basically, and your -- in that7 hypothetical, one of the entities would be asking the8 Federal court to resolve it. Ford can decide at the end9 of the day how it wants to resolve it. If Ford West10 wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this11 is how we're going to do it regardless of what the12 Federal court says.13 MR. GALANTER: Well, that's true that after14 the litigation is over, one of the parties may, you15 know, be able to work around the law. That's true, in16 fact, in every Federal Spending Clause statute where17 you're dealing with prospective relief. The State is18 always free to say, okay, if this is what we have to do,19 we -- we opt out of the program.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the State here21 is free to dissolve one of the -- one of the parties to22 the case. That's -- that's a little different.23 MR. GALANTER: Well, it's the Commonwealth24 that's free to dissolve one of the parties to the case.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, State,￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Commonwealth.2 MR. GALANTER: But I know. I meant, as3 opposed to the -- I wasn't making -­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.5 MR. GALANTER: But the Respondents here are6 State officials, and even the Respondents' agency has no7 power over IPAS. And on the day-to-day basis, even the8 governor and the attorney general have no control over9 what IPAS -- excuse me -- VOPA does. IPAS is a similar10 case out of Indiana.11 But what's critical here is that, as we12 stand here today, the Commonwealth has vested a Federal13 right in VOPA, and neither the attorney general nor the14 governor of Virginia can stop VOPA from exercising that15 right.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I'm not17 quite sure what the premise of your argument is. You18 seem to be arguing that the independence of the State19 agency is what makes this particular entity capable of20 suing. Yet, in your brief, you rely on Verizon's simple21 test, which says if you're asserting a Federal claim,22 you can sue and you're not -- and you're looking for23 prospective injunctive relief, you can sue the State.24 That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing. That25 was part of your argument. Yet, now you're arguing the8￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review91 independence of the agency. Which is your position?2 MR. GALANTER: I -­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if it is the one4 about the State's independence, how do you articulate5 why that becomes important or not? What's the legal6 significance of7 moving forward?8 MR.9 there are threethat vis-à-vis this case and any onesGALANTER: If I may, I -- there are -­issues that are intertwined here.10 First, the issue that I was talking about with the Chief11 Justice regarding the Article III adversity that you12 need for standing. That's where the independence is13 relevant.14 The second question is the one that we15 petitioned on, which is the Eleventh Amendment issue,16 and there we would suggest that the simple17 straightforward inquiry of Verizon is relevant.18 And then there's a third portion which the19 court of appeals seemed to rely on, which is that -­20 that the notion that the State has a Federal right at21 all was -- against another part of the State and its22 officials was incongruous. That, if anything, would be23 a Tenth Amendment concern and is resolved here because24 it was the Commonwealth itself that made the voluntary25 decision to vest these Federal rights in independent￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review101 State agencies.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume -- and3 -- and I'm not sure what the situation is in -- in the4 Commonwealth. We have held that the States don't have5 to have the same notion of separation of powers that the6 Federal Government does. In the Federal Government, we7 allow independent regulatory agencies separate from the8 President. Let's assume that Virginia has a system in9 which the governor is indeed in charge of the entire -­10 the entire executive branch. Do you know whether that's11 the case? I don't know.1213 Virginia or 1415 if Congress16 the State could get it would be to abandon its system of17 separation of powers and to allow an agency of the State18 which would normally be under the direction of the19 governor to go riding off on its own and -- and sue the20 governor, do you think there wouldn't be any -- any21 problem about -- about the Federal Government doing22 that?23 MR. GALANTER: I -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Requiring the State to in25 effect alter its -- its governmental structure in orderMR. GALANTER: It -- it is not the case in in 49 of the 50 States.JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Well, if it were and offered money to the State and the only way￼Alderson Reporting Company1 to obtain the Federal money?2 MR. GALANTER: I3 problem, first requiring it.4 even be a problem if it weredo think there might be a And I think there might a Spending Clause statuteOfficial - Subject to Final Review5 alone. But6 an Eleventh7 whether -­8910 because -- the only question addressed below and the11 only question -- this is all on an interlocutory appeal12 just on the Eleventh Amendment -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Got you.14 MR. GALANTER: -- is whether we can sue15 other officials in the State to bring them into16 prospective compliance with the Federal law. And as -­17 as I said, though -- and this statute authorizes the18 State, if it takes the money, to designate either a19 public or a private entity as its protection and20 advocacy system; that is, they could have vested these21 Federal rights in a nonprofit corporation -­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but23 that makes all the difference in the world because they24 made the choice of saying this is going to be one of us,25 the State. And as far as what issue is before theif -- I realize that's the -- but that's not Amendment problem. That's a question aboutJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.MR. GALANTER: And here the only question,11￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review121 Court, I would suppose the Article III question is a2 jurisdictional one that we have to address before3 reaching the Eleventh Amendment question.4 MR. GALANTER: I -- I think that they're5 both sufficiently jurisdictional that you could reach6 them in -- in -- you wouldn't have to reach Article III7 before the Eleventh Amendment. But I do think that the8 Article III question -- I mean, this Court in its FOIA9 decisions such as, you know, Public Citizen v.10 Department of Justice, has said that Congress can create11 a right to access to information -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Galanter, if we can13 go back to get what this -- this entity was. The14 Federal legislation gives the States a choice. They can15 do it either in a State agency or a private entity. The16 specification that the State agency has to be17 independent is in the Federal statute, isn't it?18 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not -- it's not up20 to the State to want to put it into an independent21 regulatory agency. And is it -- and this VOPA -- is22 that an entity that was created just to carry out this23 Federal program or was it a pre-existing agency?24 MR. GALANTER: It -- it and its predecessors25 were created just to implement this program.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review131 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does it do anything2 else other than administer the Federal program?3 MR. GALANTER: It has a few responsibilities4 that the State has given it under State law in addition,5 but its primary function -- and at this point all its6 budget comes from the Federal Government, and it serves7 primarily this Federal function to go into public and8 private institutions to observe and9 and neglect is not occurring there.10 And that is, obviously,11 were requested, because the statute12 and advocacy service a right to access records of people13 in the institutions to make sure that they are not being14 mistreated and that the investigations and the15 oversights by the State are taking place and are being16 done correctly.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, following up on18 Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact19 is in part what happened here. Virginia at some point20 did require every State agency to seek the permission of21 its attorney general, is it, to sue? And the government22 said that's not independent enough, and if you want the23 money, you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without24 that permission; is that correct?25 MR. GALANTER: That -- that is correct. Andmake sure that abusewhy these records gives the protection￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review141 then the legislature of the Commonwealth went in and2 gave VOPA independent litigating authority, independent3 of the attorney general.4 On the Eleventh Amendment point, which is,5 again -­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- I know7 you're anxious to get to that, but -­8 (Laughter.)9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you know -- do10 you know of any other situation where one party to a11 Federal court action can dissolve the other one in the12 middle of the case? I mean, if VOPA files a discovery13 request with the State and they think it is, as you put14 it in your brief, too onerous, the State can say: Guess15 what, the case is over, you're dissolved.16 MR. GALANTER: Well, I -- again, I would go17 back to the Federal analogy, that in all this litigation18 with the ICC or -- well, with the Federal labor19 relations authorities, with the licensing authority of20 the Department of Interior for dams that -- that, you21 know, the TVA might want to build, that Congress can22 always eliminate these agencies, but while they are23 still in existence -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess, in Nixon v. United25 States, the President could have dismissed the attorney￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review151 general, but we allowed the suit to go forward. I never2 did understand that.3 (Laughter.)4 MR. GALANTER: Well, I think -- I think it's5 because you look at standing in terms of the current6 reality, and in Nixon, for example, the attorney general7 had promulgated a regulation saying he couldn't dismiss8 the special prosecutor except for cause.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there are a number of10 instances in the States where constitutional officers11 have their separate autonomy, their separate12 responsibilities. And it seems to me to follow13 inevitably from your position that the attorney general14 of State A could sue the governor of State A saying the15 governor is being sued in an Ex parte Young capacity16 because the governor is not following Federal law. I17 think that's just inevitable from your -- from you18 position, and that seems to me a vast extension of Ex19 parte Young. It's true, I think, that we've never said20 that the identity of -- or the permissibility of an Ex21 parte Young suit depends on the identity of the22 plaintiff, but don't we have to say that here if we're23 going to allow the States to structure their -- their24 own governments as they choose?25 MR. GALANTER: Well, I would say that --￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review161 well, I would say two things. First, the idea that -­2 you have to accept, as I think Respondents do in this3 case, that the Virginia Office of Protection and4 Advocacy legitimately holds a Federal right. I can't --5 I am hard pressed, and -- and Respondents and their6 amici were hard pressed, to come up with any example7 where an attorney general would hold a Federal right8 against another part of the State. And particularly9 here -­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he would tell the11 governor that the governor is not giving adequate12 protection to prison inmates or State employees, that13 the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are14 incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young.15 MR. GALANTER: If the Commonwealth -­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are all kinds of17 Federal rights.18 MR. GALANTER: Well, but they're generally19 not the -­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the question is: Can21 one State entity enforce it against another State entity22 in a Federal court?23 MR. GALANTER: The -- there aren't a lot of24 Federal rights that State officials have against other25 officials. Here, this is a right --￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review171 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's -- but2 under -- under your theory there would be, because under3 Ex parte Young, the whole point of it is that a -- a4 person can allege that this fictional private individual5 who's really a governmental individual is violating a6 Federal right. That's the whole point of it.7 MR. GALANTER: Violating the plaintiff's8 Federal right. That was the only point I was making.9 But, yes, if there are Federal disputes at issue, a10 Federal forum is appropriate, but -­11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All State attorney12 generals have the -- have the obligation to enforce13 Federal rights for all of the citizens of their States.14 MR. GALANTER: And if they have that right15 under -- power under State law, then -- and they16 exercise that power and elect to be in Federal court to17 litigate Federal issues, that is not barred by the18 Eleventh Amendment, we would submit.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that20 issue -- I know your white line is on.21 You -- you indicated that there are certain22 cases in which dams can be authorized by the Federal23 Government, I think, contrary to State laws, with24 municipalities. Do you know what those are? There's an25 Iowa case; there's also a Washington case you were￼Alderson Reporting Company1 talking about.23 thinking of 456 --78 Okay.9MR. GALANTER: I believe the case here I'm comes out of Seattle. But -- but I think -­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have the citation? MR. GALANTER: I don't have it with me. IJUSTICE KENNEDY: I've been looking for it.Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. GALANTER: But -- but the point I was 10 making is that sometimes one Federal agency needs11 permission from another Federal agency to build12 something, and there would be a litigable controversy13 under Article III, and that's the only point I was14 trying to make.18￼If I may, if there are no more questions, reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders.1516 I'd like to 17181920 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,21 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER22 MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it23 please the Court:24 VOPA has properly invoked Ex parte Young to25 enforce Respondents' obligations under the DD and PAIMIORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERSAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review191 Acts here, because VOPA's complaint satisfies the2 straightforward inquiries set forth in Verizon.3 We don't think that it's necessary to go4 into State sovereignty interests to determine whether Ex5 parte Young should be allowed here, but even if the6 Court were to do that, I think it's unquestionable that7 there are no State sovereignty interests here.8 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think -- do you think9 the Spending Clause allows the Federal Government to10 condition the receipt of Federal funds on a State's11 agreement to change the structure of State government?12 MS. ANDERS: I think it does, so long as -­13 as that requirement is reasonably related to the14 government's interest in the funds and in -- in the15 objective of its regulation. Now, there's -­16 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the government said17 if you want Medicaid funds, the State agency that18 administers the Medicaid program must be headed by a19 person who has a 20-year term of office and is removable20 only for gross dereliction of duty. Would -- can they21 do that? Can the Federal Government do that? Can22 Congress do it?23 MS. ANDERS: I think it could do that, so24 long as that's not independently unconstitutional. I25 think the State always has the opportunity to decide not￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review201 to opt into the scheme, and I think that's very2 important here because the sole aspect of this suit that3 Virginia challenges, which is the fact that VOPA is a4 State agency, is the result of two sovereign choices5 that the State made here.6 The first choice was to opt into the DD and7 PAIMI Act programs, to take the Federal funds, to create8 a P and A system that has Federal rights of access to9 which both State and private facilities are subject.10 And the second choice that Virginia made was to11 establish a State agency P and A system here. It could12 have established a private agency if it were concerned13 about -­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, I understand15 that most States that -- that are taking advantage of16 this program do it through a private entity, not a17 State; is that -- is that right?18 MS. ANDERS: That's correct. There are19 eight public P and A systems.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can EPA sue the Army21 Corps of Engineers for violating the Clean Water Act?22 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think you would have an23 Article III problem if there isn't sufficient adversity.24 If the -­25￼CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, very adverse.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review211 EPA wants clean water, and the Army Corps of Engineers2 wants to, you know, dredge the water in a way that3 contributes to pollution.4 MS. ANDERS: Well, they're both -- the heads5 of both agencies are, in that situation, I think,6 subject to removal by the same people, and so in that7 situation, you would have an Article III problem. But8 we don't have that problem here, because VOPA is9 independent under State law, and -­10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with11 the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it12 finds the litigation too onerous?13 MS. ANDERS: I think that that would not14 happen in practice, because if Virginia were to dissolve15 VOPA, it would be out of compliance with the Federal16 scheme, and so it would lose its -- it would lose its17 Federal funding at that point. And so I don't think18 that's a situation that's going to arise, but -­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if it happened20 to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree21 with the Petitioners that they can do it?22 MS. ANDERS: I think they -- I think they23 could do it, but I think this -- this Court has24 previously adjudicated cases where, in theory, the25 government could have changed the case midstream.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review221 U.S. v. Nixon is an example of that; the ICC case as2 well. And I think also in the Lassen case, this Court3 said that it could adjudicate a suit between two State4 agencies because the agencies were sufficiently5 independent from each other. They weren't subject to6 removal by the same head of government.7 So I think, while you might have an Article8 III problem in some situations, you don't have that9 problem here because of VOPA's independence.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you be a little11 bit more specific for me on what you mean about an12 Article III problem? Justice Kennedy was concerned13 about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or14 not willy-nilly -- suing governors to comply with15 Federal law.16 Why do you think it won't happen, and what17 are the legal impediments to that occurring?18 MS. ANDERS: I think there are several. I19 think, first, you would have to have a Federal right20 that the AG would be able to enforce. He would have to21 have a way to get into Federal court. He would have to22 have a theory of standing, and I think this is not a23 situation that has arisen at this point. There are no24 examples of this. And so I think -­25 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought -- this I'm￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review231 confused about. I would think you would have to have a2 State which has a law that permits the attorney general3 to sue the governor. Wouldn't you?4 MS. ANDERS: If the -­5 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if the State law is6 the attorney general can't sue the governor, that's the7 endofit,isn'tit?Orisit-­8 MS. ANDERS: If that were sufficient to get9 into Federal court for Article III purposes. I think10 there might be some situations in which the attorney11 general -­12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Suppose the State law13 is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit14 against the attorney general, and vice versa. Okay?15 That's the State law. Now, under those circumstances,16 can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in Federal17 court?18 MS. ANDERS: There may be some circumstances19 like that one, in which the State AG's use of Ex parte20 Young would raise special sovereignty interests that21 would counsel against -­22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I want just a yes23 or no answer. In your opinion, can an attorney general,24 where the State law says, black letter law, attorney25 general can never sue the governor; he's fired instantly￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if he tries. That's the law in this State, okay? Now, can that individual come into Federal court and sue on an Ex parte Young theory suing the governor?MS. ANDERS: I think he could -­JUSTICE BREYER: He could?MS. ANDERS: -- under this Court's decisionin Verizon. I think that if -- there might be certain extreme circumstances where -­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't -- I think that is a problem, and is that -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I -­JUSTICE BREYER: -- what we're saying here? JUSTICE SCALIA: That can't be. How canthat be? He has no power as attorney general to do that. It has nothing to do with -- with Ex parte Young. It has to do with his power as attorney general.MS.

If it wants to have an attorney general that can never bring a lawsuit, that's up to the State, unless it's a due process problem.Now, suppose I believe that. Now, do you lose this case?MS. ANDERS: No, I don't think so, because the same special sovereignty interests are not present here, because under the Spending Clause, Virginia had the choice to opt into this scheme.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't -- doesn't the Federal statute say, Virginia, if you want to do this through a State agency, that State agency has to be an independent agency and have the authority to sue?MS. ANDERS: That's correct, and -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you sure that the governor cannot remove the members of VOPA? I know it says VOPA has to be independent of any State agency,Official - Subject to Final Review25￼and the governor appoints one-third. Can the remove the members of this Virginia agency?MS. ANDERS: As a matter of State don't think he can. And if he were to try to that would be a compliance problem from HHS'sgovernorlaw, I do that,perspective. And so Virginia might at that point -­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would it not -­what would it not comply with? I just don't know. I'mAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review261 just looking at the provision where you say it's2 independent, and it says independent of any State3 agency. You said the governor may not appoint more than4 one-third. I just wonder if there's a prohibition on5 him removing.6 MS. ANDERS: Well, there's definitely a7 prohibition on him removing board members of VOPA or8 officials of VOPA as a result of VOPA's actions in9 litigation. I think -­10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that?11 MS. ANDERS: Well, the provision -- well,12 the requirement that VOPA have full authority to pursue13 legal remedies to ensure the protection of individuals.14 This is on page 52a of the petition appendix. That's15 the PAIMI law. And I think that actually did happen in16 Virginia, that HHS came in -­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the VOPA18 officials are engaged in corruption or illegal conduct19 or, you know, extracurricular activity that brings20 discredit upon the -- the governor has no power to say21 that, you're a Virginia official and you're -- you know,22 whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example? And -­23 MS. ANDERS: Well, under Virginia law, I24 think that VOPA's officials are subject to for-cause25 removal provisions. So they can actually be removed￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425judicially through for-cause proceedings. And from our perspective, that's consistent with VOPA's independence and its full authority to pursue remedies because that type of for-cause removal wouldn't be on the basis of VOPA's actions in litigation.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to your exchange with Justice Breyer, I assume that you could stand by your answer and say the attorney general could sue the governor, because he's not suing the governor in his official capacity. He has a Federal right under Ex parte Young to sue the governor as an individual. It's a fiction; we all know that. But that's the way it works, and this is a Federal right.MS. ANDERS: Well -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's yourposition.MS. ANDERS: I think that's right, that under Verizon no more is required.

GETCHELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The dignity interest of a sovereign is impaired if it is pitted against itself in the courts of another sovereign without its consent. And I wouldtake -­JUSTICE SCALIA: A dignified sovereign should not agree to the deal.(Laughter.)MR. GETCHELL: Well, let's -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, theCommonwealth had the choice. It had two choices, as -­ as counsel for the Government said. It could either turn down the money or, if it's not dignified enough to do that, it could take the money and establish a private organization to do this work instead of a State agency. So, what -- you know, what complaint do you have here?MR. GETCHELL: Well, let me -- let me first say that the choice issue raises some interesting questions because of the procedural posture of this case being an interlocutory appeal. Because remember, on the issue of waiver and abrogation, that was litigated below, and no waiver was found, and that wasn't appealedOfficial - Subject to Final Review29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review301 against. So if we're going to say it makes a difference2 under a spending statute that the State has taken the3 money in analyzing the sovereign interest, then we are4 creating a waiver on the cheap and disheveling the5 established doctrine.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a waiver; it's7 -- the Federal statute is clear. It says:8 can do this in one of two ways. If you go9 government agency, then that agency has toState, you with ahave10 independence and it has to be able to sue.11 So if the State is given a choice, it has -­12 it can do it through private entity; it can do it13 through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for14 this very purpose and no other, right?15 MR. GETCHELL: I would have thought two16 things about that. One is when Congress gave the State17 the choice of making it a State agency, it understood18 that any issues that arise from that would come with the19 territory. The second thing is what the State consented20 to is it waived its sovereign immunity to be sued, but21 it did not specify suit in Federal court, and under22 ordinary doctrine, that's a consent to be sued in its￼23 own courts, 2425 which lovesnot in Federal court.JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you have a State litigation.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: Forty-eight percent of the population are retired lawyers.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: Nothing pleases them more than to have everybody suing everybody else. So they pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in this State, every department can sue every other department.Now, if you have such a State, what in the Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules, looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then, if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing another, say, well, if it complies with those first set, the fact that A sues B and they're both State agencies, that's the State's decision. What in the Constitution can prevent the State from deciding to organize what we'll call the legal heaven way?(Laughter.)MR. GETCHELL: I would say two things about that. The first is that that's not what Congress did. Congress -- Congress said they had to have a right to sue, and they didn't specify it was Federal court.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That's A. We can goOfficial - Subject to Final Review31￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242532 into A later because I agree that would be an answer, ifit's correct -- I mean, if that is what happened. That's a different question, whether Congress could restructure the State. That's a serious question. But my question was on the first. Can Congress stop the State from restructuring itself?MR. GETCHELL: Well, I -- I don't think the State by restructuring itself would then ordinarily expect its agencies to sue each other in Federal court. In-­JUSTICE BREYER: If they wrote it down specifically in the law and said we'd love to have our agencies sue each other. They don't say Federal court. They just say we love to have our agencies sue each other. They don't mention the court.MR. GETCHELL: I would think that, under ordinary rules of waiver of sovereign immunity, that would limit the suits to the suits of the sovereign, the State.JUSTICE BREYER: Why? What's undignified about allowing the State -­Official - Subject to Final Review￼it made?MR. GETCHELL: I just -­JUSTICE BREYER: -- to live with the choiceMR. GETCHELL: I think the existing doctrineAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review331 is an unspecified waiver of sovereign immunity does not2 consent to the Federal court.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I -- I think4 there are concepts being confused. There's no question5 that it hasn't waived sovereign immunity. VOPA doesn't6 claim that. And this is not a direct suit against the7 State; it's a suit against a State official. And the8 entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't9 offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek10 enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right.11 So I don't know why it really matters who12 the plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that13 we've recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one14 that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and15 we're not going to interfere with any of them, but we16 are going to ensure that, because of the pre-emptive17 effect of the Constitution and our laws, that Federal18 laws are respected. So what's in this case the19 intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and20 consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records21 when it needed to?22 MR. GETCHELL: In referring to sovereign23 immunity, I was trying to answer the hypothetical with24 respect to why Ex parte Young doesn't apply. The second25 part of the question was Congress could expect Ex parte￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review341 Young to apply. There's -- there's no indication in the2 legislative record that I could find of that.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State should have4 expected that.5 MR. GETCHELL: Excuse me. That Congress6 should have expected. In the hypothetical, Congress was7 posited as having thought that Ex parte Young -­8 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The hypothetical was9 just -- Justice Sotomayor is totally right. I'm talking10 about Ex parte Young.11 MR. GETCHELL: Okay.12 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm imagining -- I'm13 imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG,14 this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the15 City of San Francisco -- they want to permit such16 entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the17 State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte18 Young requirements are met. What in the Constitution of19 the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?20 MR. GETCHELL: Because Ex parte Young is an21 exception to the default position. The default position22 is that the States at the founding retained all of their23 natural law-of-nations sovereign immunity. We know that24 it was -- that it was limited. A State can sue another25 State; the Federal Government can sue another State; and￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review351 -- can sue a State; and there is the Ex parte Young2 exception, but it is the exception.3 It is being extended here. We know it's4 being extended here because it's never been done before.5 And if you're going to extend it, then we ought to ask6 the question of whether or not -- asking the Hans7 question.89 extension?JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is it anI mean, I have sort of a bit of a problem Why is it somehow a -- a greater10 with that.11 infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to12 be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who13 doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake -­14 he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa. And15 yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -­16 when you allow a State agency to sue a State?17 I don't -- I don't see why that's so18 horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it19 somehow destroys the State system of separation of20 powers. But that's a different question, and -- and the21 answer to that is simply you did it yourself.22 MR. GETCHELL: Well, what I -- what I would23 say is that Ex parte Young is intended to deal with the24 situation where a citizen of a dual sovereign is able to25 vindicate his superior Federal rights against the State.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review361 That interest is not served one bit by having a State2 agency sue another State agency in Federal court, even3 though that State agency could have sued in State court.4 And I would ask the Hans question. The Hans5 question is, would the -- you know, the Constitution is6 presumed not to raise up causes of action against the7 States that would have been considered as anomalous and8 unheard-of at the time of the founding. And I think if9 you posited whether or not at the founding, if you had10 asked, can a part of a State -- well, can the Federal11 Congress authorize part of a State to sue the other part12 of the State in Federal court, I think it would have13 been regarded as anomalous generally.14 JUSTICE ALITO: When Virginia agreed to15 participate in this program, did Virginia understand16 that it could be sued by VOPA not only in -- in the17 State courts but also in Federal court?18 MR. GETCHELL: I would assert not. I mean,19 that was the point of the waiver argument below, and the20 court said there had not been a specific enough21 declaration of the consequences of taking the money to22 raise a traditional waiver.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the choice is, if it's24 not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has25 taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review371 it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute2 requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit3 somewhere. We know if it were a private entity4 administering this program, it would be suable in -- in5 Federal court. So this State agency is doing the exact6 same thing, because Virginia chose to do it that way.7 Where is it -- where -- a very simple thing, the Federal8 statute says turn over records to the agency, and the9 State hospital says no, we're not going to turn over the10 records. Where does the agency, whether private or11 public, that's administering the Federal program go to12 enforce the Federal right?13 MR. GETCHELL: The program would go to State14 court. Virginia has waived its sovereign immunity, and15 there is a remedy through mandamus.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- is that -- I17 mean, I want to make sure I understood what your18 position is on that. It's not that you go into the19 court that you ordinarily go to when you want to get20 documentary discovery; you go to the State's supreme21 court, and you -- you apply for the extraordinary writ22 of mandamus? That's it?23 MR. GETCHELL: If you have a -- if you have24 a clear right to these documents as a surrogate -- and,25 you know, that's a merits question that has never been￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review381 reached, whether this is a rights-conferring statute.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you what is3 the forum? We have a simple problem. An agency,4 whether private or public, wants records. A Federal5 statute says you're entitled to the records. And I6 would like to know now, Virginia having chosen to give7 this newly created independent State agency the8 authority, rather than picking a 501(c)(3) organization9 todoit-- simple, we want records of these three10 people, the hospital has them, the hospital doesn't give11 them to us. The only way under Virginia law is to12 petition the highest court of the State for a writ of13 mandamus?￼1415 believe you16 this office17 had to go to the supreme court, and I don't want to18 withdraw any concession that had been made there, but I19 personally read the statute differently.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But which office has said21 it has to go to -- to the State supreme court on22 mandamus? You said that the office has taken that23 position previously.24 MR. GETCHELL: The statute, the mandamus25 statute, has a fairly broad catch-all provision at theMR. GETCHELL: I would -- I personally could also do it in circuit court. I know has previously taken the position that itAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review391 end which I think would allow suit in -- in circuit2 court, but I don't think where it can sue really informs3 the doctrine here, because I think the doctrine here is4 if you're going to let, under the analysis argued5 here -- which is not modest; it's very, very broad. If6 VOPA can sue in Federal court under Ex parte Young, so7 can any agency of -- of the -- of any State that8 receives Federal funds upon which it makes the claim at9 the Ex parte Young stage, which is before you reach the10 merits -- any agency receiving Federal money that can11 dream up a Federal claim under Ex parte Young could sue12 the State.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and that has14 independent litigating authority.15 MR. GETCHELL: Yes, and -- and -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I mean, that's the17 difference here.18 MR. GETCHELL: And I believe -­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: This agency was given20 independent litigating authority.21 MR. GETCHELL: I think -- I think Virginia22 happens to be unusual, as long as we're talking about23 the policy results that will come from this. I think24 Virginia is unusual in having as much control in the25 attorney general over who can sue than -- than a lot of￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review401 States do, because I think a lot of States have their2 own independent agencies that proliferate and have suit3 authority.4 But I will tell you, even in Virginia, there5 is a mechanism by which, if you had the governor in one6 party's hands and the attorney general in the other, the7 governor can declare a conflict of interest and order8 private counsel hired.9 And so, if -- if the University of Virginia10 wanted to sue the governor, or rather sue the attorney11 general, and the governor said, well, if you want to,12 and the attorney general won't authorize it, then that's13 a conflict of interest. I -­14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It hasn't happened. Why15 do you think? Don't you think it hasn't happened16 because there are so many practical political restraints17 on that kind of activity?18 What would happen, I think, in that State19 where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody20 would win; the governor would win by getting a21 legislative act that says it can't be done, or the22 attorney general will win because the political23 sentiments are so strong in his or her favor that the24 suit is actually welcomed by the population.25 So where's the intrusion on sovereignty?￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review411 States do what they want. The only issue is how do we2 protect Federal rights.3 MR. GETCHELL: I would -- I would say that4 it's never happened before because nobody's ever claimed5 before that Ex parte Young permits a part of the State6 to sue the other part of the State. And I would say if7 the word were declared from this Court that you can do8 that, that there would be a lot of political motivation9 to file suits.10 JUSTICE BREYER: It isn't that Ex parte11 Young, if I understand this right, which is why I12 mention it -- it isn't that Ex parte Young permits one13 part of a State to sue another part; it is a State14 permits one part of a State to sue another part, that15 that's common in the State, that the law requires it.16 And the question is, in that circumstance, should the Ex17 parte Young situation be treated differently?18 MR. GETCHELL: And -­19 JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right about the20 statement of the question in the case?21 MR. GETCHELL: I -- I think -- I think22 whether or not the State has given independent authority23 to sue without specifying that it can be in Federal24 court, without waiving its immunity in Federal court, is25 not the issue in the case. I think the issue in the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review421 case -- I think that the issue in the case is whether or2 not Ex parte Young should be extended to do something3 that's never been done before. I think that's the issue4 in the case. And I don't think Ex parte Young, which is5 a necessary fiction -- but it is a fiction; it's a6 necessary fiction to allow the citizens of a dual7 sovereign to vindicate his or her Federal rights in8 Federal court -- is implicated in the least when it's a9 State agency that could sue another State agency by the10 State's consent in State court.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know -- do you12 know of any other statute in which there is an13 independent State agency that exists for the sole14 purpose of administering a Federal program?15 MR. GETCHELL: I -- I'm not an expert in16 that area of the law. I would have thought it's quite17 common. But I don't -- I don't know. That's just my18 supposition. I think that -- that -­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You couldn't give any20 example of a Federal program that says: State, you can21 do it through a private agency; you can do it through a22 public agency -- public agency created to implement this23 Federal program, that is its sole business. I don't24 really know of any such.25 MR. GETCHELL: I -- I personally don't know￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 of one as I stand here, but my supposition is that2 because the Federal spending power has been so3 dramatically exercised over the years, that there4 probably is one, and I had not thought to look for it.5 JUSTICE BREYER: In your experience -- this6 would be helpful -- would you characterize as common or7 uncommon situations where State agencies are given8 authority to sue other parts of the State? As I think9 it to myself, I think, well, City of Glendale v. State10 Water Authority, or Middlesex County Sheriff v. The11 Bureau of Prisons. That doesn't sound weird to me. It12 sounds as if there probably are a lot of such13 circumstances, but I don't know. What -- what do you14 think?15 MR. GETCHELL: There -- I think two -- there16 are two things to look at: lower subdivisions of the17 States, which in many States are -­18 JUSTICE BREYER: Cities -- cities against -­19 they must do that a lot.20 MR. GETCHELL: Yes, but they're just21 corporations in -- in Virginia and in most States.22 There are a few States where they are treated as23 something different, but they are not generally regarded24 as even units of -- subordinate units of government for25 purposes of sovereign immunity.43￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review441 However, the State itself and its agencies2 are, and that's the issue that's implicated by Ex parte3 Young. I would -- I would say that -­4 JUSTICE BREYER: University of5 Massachusetts v. State Environmental Organization. Does6 that -- does that kind of suit sound familiar to you or7 -- or not?8 MR. GETCHELL: I think that -- that the9 States vary as to how tolerant they are of -- of being10 sued by -- having their parts sue each other in State11 court. I think I have seen titles like that, but I12 don't think that, as a principle of Federal jurisdiction13 -- because, ultimately, whether sovereign immunity14 exists, if it's not waived, does deprive this Court -­￼15 or deprives 1617 the fiction18 citizens to19 court is just something that's totally anomalous. I --20 I just don't see how this Court would want to do that,21 even -- even if it thought otherwise that it was, you22 know, something that could be done under the logic of Ex23 parte Young. I don't know why you'd want to extend that24 and create -- and create the Federal courts as a venue25 for political grandstanding, which is what I think --a Federal court of the right to proceed.I think that deciding we're going to extend of Ex parte Young beyond the rights of allow the State to sue itself in FederalAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242545JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure that -­ what you're forgetting is that Virginia took a lot of money to set up and get the benefits of Federal funds by creating an independent agency. It had expressed its desire to control the agency more, and it was told very directly: You can't. You have to let that agency sue.What I don't understand is why you think that it's a greater affront to sovereignty that the suit is here as opposed to State court. The State has already said: We're going to take your money, and this is what we're going to permit -­MR. GETCHELL: I think it has -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a suit.MR. GETCHELL: I think it has long beenrecognized that the dignity of the State is not offended at all by a suit against -- against it in its own courts that it has authorized. I think that it is well understood that if you bring a State against its will into a Federal court, even if you're using the fiction of Ex parte -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we use -- we don't bring the State in; we bring a State official who is violating a Federal law.MR. GETCHELL: But this Court has always recognized that there is a large sense in which that's aOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review46 it's just something that we have to tolerate1 fiction and2 in order to34 -- really is a sovereign immunity argument. You're5 saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it6 explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal7 courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that8 that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex9 parte Young to a suit in Federal court where the suit is10 by another State agency.11 MR. GETCHELL: That is precisely my view.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So sovereign immunity is13 part of your argument, but -­14 MR. GETCHELL: It -- well, it's -- I think15 it's all that's really appropriately before this Court,16 because, again, we're up here on an interlocutory appeal17 where the decision below in the Fourth Circuit by Judge18 Wilkinson is premised entirely on sovereign immunity.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Now, explain -­20 this is good because that's very helpful to me -- the21 exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said22 yes, that's exactly right.23 And then it is the case that a citizen of24 the State could come into Federal court and sue the25 State official under Ex parte Young, but you say -- buthave a dual system of -- of sovereignty. JUSTICE SCALIA: So your argument is really￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review471 the agency of the State can't do it, even though they2 have State litigating authority. And the reason that3 the latter is more injurious of the dignity interests of4 the State than the former is -­5 MR. GETCHELL: One, the State is being6 pitted against itself. If you look at the very caption7 in this case, VOPA sued the State officials in the name8 of the Commonwealth.9 Secondly, there's a -- to the extent there's10 any authority, we have Ex parte Young here that gives11 rights to citizens, and we have a lot of cases that12 resulted most recently in Ysursa, in which it was13 recognized that the general rule is that subordinate14 parts of States, subordinate State authorities, have no15 constitutional privileges and immunities that they can16 assert against their creator.17 And if you wanted to know whether or not Ex18 parte Young should be extended into this area, it seems19 to me that the previous expectation would have been that20 the Ysursa tradition would have said, no, we don't want21 to extend this into this area.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other areas -­23 and I can't come up with the name of the case. It was24 suggested by counsel, your friend, in the -- in his25 opening argument.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review481 I thought there were cases in which a2 subdivision is not -- a political subdivision of a State3 is not allowed to build a dam by State law, and yet it4 can go to the Federal Government, get a license, and5 build the dam anyway and just bypass the restrictions6 put upon its parent. The agent has more powers than the7 principal gives it because it relies on Federal law.8 MR. GETCHELL: I don't know the case. And I9 don't believe anybody has cited as a principal case a10 decision of 1112 to in terms 13this Court that would say that.Now, a State can do anything it -- it wanted of waiving its sovereign immunity.JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in this case, could￼14 Virginia sue VOPA in Federal court?15 MR. GETCHELL: I don't think -- I don't16 think it appropriately could.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think it could or18 could not?19 MR. GETCHELL: I do not think it20 appropriately could. I don't think parts of the State21 can sue other parts of the State in Federal court.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would be the23 parent suing the -- the subsidiary, and -- and VOPA is24 not the State.25 MR. GETCHELL: VOPA is -- is part of theAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review491 State for purposes of sovereign immunity analysis, I2 would have thought.3 But if somebody tried to get a personal4 recovery -- I mean, VOPA employees are ordinary State5 employees. I presume they're subject to the Tort Claims6 Act, so it is -- it is a State agency. But I don't know7 why the involuntary suing of the State in Federal court,8 which I think raises these traditional sovereignty9 dignity interests, would be reciprocal.10 I mean, if for some strange reason the State11 wanted to sue VOPA, I don't know what the answer would12 be, because it may be they waived all their interests if13 they tried to do that.14 But I think that the -- that the practical15 problem for this Court is that there's no limit.16 There's no practical principle limit to what's being17 argued here. And so we set up this intramural political18 contest in Federal court as a matter of course. And I19 think, doctrinally, that it is clear that this is an20 extension of Ex parte Young, beyond dispute, and I don't21 think it ought to be extended without doing a federalism22 inquiry. And I think if you do a federalism inquiry,23 you ask the Hans question: Is -- would this have been24 regarded as anomalous and unheard-of at the founding?25 And I don't think there's --￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review501 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The bottom line, then, is2 to -- to restrict Congress's choice. Congress wants to3 have an entity superintend this program for disabled4 people. So the instruction we would like to give5 Congress is: Congress, if you want Federal courts to be6 able to enforce the Federal right, then you have to set7 it up as an agency, as a private agency. You can't8 give -- Congress, you can't give the States a choice9 whether they'd rather do it through private or10 public organizations.11 MR. GETCHELL: I don't think so, for two12 reasons. One is -­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I don't14 think so -- what? You don't think Congress -­15 MR. GETCHELL: I don't think that -- I think16 Congress could have, under traditional waiver authority,17 under the spending power, have said: If you want to18 take the money, we're making a clear statement, you have19 to waive your sovereign immunity and be sued in State --20 I mean, Federal court. That didn't happen.21 Also, let's not overlook the fact that the22 Secretary has an administrative remedy in withholding23 the funds, and when this Court was faced with the24 question of whether or not to extend Ex parte Young in25 the Seminole Tribe, the answer was: No, we're not going￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 to do it, because there is an alternative remedy.23 acknowledge4 that it was5 administer the program, that it was letting itself open6 to suit in Federal court under an Ex parte Young theory,7 then everything would be okay?8 MR. GETCHELL: Well, no, because I don't9 think it ever -- it would ever.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that would be a11 waiver of -­12 MR. GETCHELL: No, but I would -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whatever sovereignty14 immunity interest it had, wouldn't it?15 MR. GETCHELL: If Congress -- Congress16 conditioned receiving the money on waiver, then I17 suppose it -­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Congress could, but19 if they knew it in this instance when they accepted the20 money, you wouldn't have a case, would you?JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you wouldthat if a State knew when it took the money -- and when it created a State agency to51￼2122 traditional23 we wouldn't24 case in this interlocutory appeal is that there was no25 waiver. That waiver was -- was determined below and notMR. GETCHELL: The law -- if -- if under waiver doctrine, it had been done right, no, have a case. But remember, the law of theAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425appealed.Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good point.MR. GETCHELL: And -- and so under -- under the circumstances here, we have a fairly peculiar specialized situation, but -- but deciding in favor of the Petitioners I think is fraught with peril and is doctrinally unprecedented and improper, and we would ask that the decision of the Fourth Circuit be affirmed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Galanter, have you 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GALANTER: I have three points for those3 minutes. First, we don't think that a State AG or a State agency could sue a governor if State law prohibited it. The question of capacity to sue, the power to sue, is one of State law. What we're saying here is that if a suit could go forward between two State agencies -- excuse me -- between a State agency and State officials in State court, that if that case involved a Federal issue, it can be heard in Federal court if the other requirements of Article III and Ex parte Young are being met.Second, there was some suggestion that Ex parte Young is only about citizens. But this Court's52￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425applied Ex parte Young to Indian tribes, allowing them to sue State officials. It's allowed foreign countries to use Ex parte Young to sue State officials. The only -- and the Respondents concede that political subdivisions, which can also be eliminated at will by the State, could use Ex parte Young.JUSTICE BREYER: Have you found any case -­ are there a lot, a few, none -- where one State agency at a State level sues another in Federal court, period? Say they have "arising under" jurisdiction.MR. GALANTER: No. There aren't a lot of them because -­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, are there any?MR. GALANTER: Other than in this protection advocacy system -­JUSTICE BREYER: None?MR. GALANTER: None.JUSTICE BREYER: See, nagging at me is somekind of Article III problem.MR. GALANTER: Well, but -­JUSTICE BREYER: And maybe there is none. I don't know. It's -- there are none, though? None?MR. GALANTER: Well, but that's becauseCongress doesn't usually vest rights in -­JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It wouldn't haveOfficial - Subject to Final Review53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review541 to. All -- they could get into all kinds of arguments2 about EPA and all kinds of Federal rights with each3 other. I would think.4 MR. GALANTER: I -- I don't think that's5 correct.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.7 MR. GALANTER: I think that most of the8 time, when a State is involved in a dispute with another9 State, it's about State law. This is rather unique in10 that respect.11 And that brings me to the third point, which12 is this notion of waiver. Now, we're not arguing here13 that they've waived their sovereign immunity. What14 we're claiming is that they don't have sovereign15 immunity to these injunctive suits against the State16 officials. We're not seeking damages, and we haven't17 named the State in its own name. But what we are18 suggesting is that -- that they -- it was the natural19 consequence, as this Court decided in Frew, that when20 you, you know, accept the Federal money and you are21 bound by Federal duties and that the -- the entity that22 you give the Federal right to has a Federal -- has a23 right to sue, that the Federal issues will be litigated24 in Federal court.25 And I would say particularly that here￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425just -- of course, Virginia renews every year to take the Federal money, but when it last amended the Federal statute -- or the State statute to create VOPA in its current structure, there were existing Ex parte Young suits against State officials.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. I have one question of curiosity. You said in your opening argument that 49 of 50 States limit in some way the executive's power in this area.MR. GALANTER: I -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the oneState?MR. GALANTER: I'm drawing that from the -­ Indiana's amicus brief, and I believe they identified New Jersey as the State that has a unitary executive.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)Official -
