North Carolina.          Mr. Phillips.         ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS             ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS          MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice, and may it please the Court:101112   Compact in this case.  Whether you examine it from13   the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by14   the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the15   perspective of the repeated statements by the16   executives of the Commission that there had been a17   material breach and a repudiation, or whether you18   examine it from the perspective of the undisputed19   record that was collected by the Special Master, the20   conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what21   North Carolina did here by taking no action between22   December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not23   fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that24   North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only25   issue should be:  What is the appropriate remedy for3Official￼North Carolina breached the SoutheastAlderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4   of his report:  "The parties do not dispute that 5   North Carolina did not take additional steps to 6   pursue a license for a waste facility during that 7   period."  Our undisputed statement of facts is that 8   North Carolina took no further steps to license 9   between 1997 and 1999.10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Phillips, the point11   that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing12   away the taxpayers' money to no purpose.  That is,13   what is the point of continuing to pursue a license14   when North Carolina does not have the funding to15   continue the process and to open the disposal16 facility?17             So North Carolina's point of view is:  What18   does it mean to continue to seek the license when19   they are not going to have the money to get to the20   end of the line?21             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, North Carolina22   assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior23   to that time to take all appropriate steps in order24   to provide for licensing and for construction of a25   facility.  "Appropriate steps" in that context has to4this extraordinary breach?          To go to the specific record, just to beOfficialclear about this, the Special Master says at page 10￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   mean something more than simply doing nothing, 2   declaring categorically that you are going to 3   repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort 4   from the compact and its Commission additional monies 5   that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has 6   no responsibility to North Carolina to pay. 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But how much -- how much 9   did the Commission give before this?  It just did10   that out of the goodness of its heart?11             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, it did it with -- with12   the approval of the other States in the compact, for13   the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of14   the -- of the contract --15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and I think that16   one of the best indications of what -- what a17   contract means is the manner in which the parties act18   under the contract, and that suggests to me that it19   was never contemplated that North Carolina alone20   would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this21 license.22             MR. PHILLIPS:  The language of the -- of23   the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain.24   It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility25   to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of5Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   this facility.  That was clear from day one.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9111213141516171819202122232425          North Carolina, not only in its legislationauthorizing its authority, but also its governorrepeatedly saying, we understand that we have aresponsibility to create this facility, that --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  At what cost?          MR. PHILLIPS:  At whatever cost --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What the Special MasterOfficial￼     said was, I believe, that there was never an10   obligation to do it at all costs.  They didn't haveto bankrupt their treasury to do this; is thatcorrect?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you accept that as aworking proposition?          MR. PHILLIPS:  I would say that the -- thatthe State of North Carolina would have -- have adefense of impossibility if they could argue thatgoing down this path would have bankrupted NorthCarolina.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I think there wascertainly a significant amount of evidence that thecost of completing this project was way above anyreasonable expectation of the parties at the time ofcontracting, correct?6Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, but the -- but thepayment of $80 million by the Commission was wayabove what any of the parties expected at thebeginning of the process as well.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what do youbelieve the evidence shows with respect to thereasonable cost of completing this project?          MR. PHILLIPS:  I think it was reasonable toassume that the construction of the facility itselfwould have cost an additional $75 million.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And about a -- anadditional 34,000 to get the license?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Probably 34 million tocomplete the license.10111213141516   misspoke.  So over $100 million?171819202122232425          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but the -- the --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  An amount equal to whatthey had already -- everybody had already put in?          MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, but the -- butthe --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And about how manytimes greater than the initial estimates?          MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know that there wereany initial estimates, at least that I recall.7Official￼JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- I'm sorry.  IAlderson Reporting Company123456789   impossibility?  You are saying that --Official          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought it was about20 or 30 million dollars was initially estimated to ­- to do this project.          MR. PHILLIPS:  I doubt that that would haveincluded the full construction.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm only goingthrough these to try to get a sense from you of atwhat point did North Carolina have a right to claim￼10111213141516   complete this project.  It imposed upon us and17   unilaterally imposed upon the other States to the18   compact the obligation to fund, an obligation none of19   them had -- had assumed under the contract.20             To be sure, they had provided moneys to21   North Carolina with the expectation that North22   Carolina would use those moneys ultimately to build a23   project.  But the reality is in 1997, in December,24   North Carolina unilaterally declared that they were25   not going to complete the project and that they were8          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  I mean, I think NorthCarolina -- first of all, North Carolina never didassert a right of impossibility.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it did by saying,we can't complete this project.MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it said it wouldn'tAlderson Reporting Company 1   going to take no actions further -- in furtherance -- 2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your argument is then 3   that they acted 2 years too late.  When they gave 4   notice that they were not able to go forward, but 5   they were going to keep this thing going, so if the 6   funds should somehow become available, they would 7   have the -- they would have things still in place. 8   They wouldn't have terminated the effort. 9             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Yes, Justice10   Ginsburg.  Our argument is that -- you know, whether-- you know --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if they had doneeverything the same --          MR. PHILLIPS:  I think there's an openOfficial￼111213141516   been in good faith or not.  That would be a separate17   issue.  But there is no question that the one thing18   that a contracting party does not have the right to19   do is to unilaterally decide to repudiate the20   agreement, get the benefit of the agreement --21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they told you what ­22   -  it was totally up-front.  They said:  Look, we23   can't go forward with this.  We haven't got the24   money.  We’ll let everything sit, to see if someone25   will come up with the money.9question of whether the withdrawal in '97 would haveAlderson Reporting Company 1             That's -- it's -- you paint a picture of 2   repudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave 3   notice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't 4   get the money. 5             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, and -- and the 6   question then, obviously, that -- the legal issue 7   that that presents is whether or not a party to a 8   contract who is not entitled to expect the other 9   participants to the agreement to pay any more money10   or in fact any money whatsoever has the authority11   essentially to attempt to extort that money while12   continuing to gain the benefits of the contract for13   an additional year and a half; at that point, then14   they -- then they withdraw.15             We can debate about whether the withdrawal16   was in good faith or not.  But the bottom line is17   there is no substantial difference between the18   repudiation and the complete disregard of the19   contractual obligations.20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What were the benefits21   that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it22   was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going23   for another 2 years?24             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the benefits of being25   a part of the compact is all of the powers that the10Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   Commission had to deal with other compacts in terms2   of how to license -- not how to license, but how to3   dispose of waste.  They got all of the benefits of4   being a part of a compact during the entirety of that5   period.  So, you know, it was not in their interest6 7 8 9Officialto repudiate this agreement or to withdraw from ituntil they got to the point where they were -- wherethey recognized that they were about to be sanctionedfor their failure to comply with theirresponsibilities.￼1011121314151617181920   Southeast Compact.  So North Carolina had -- had21   ample access to that South Carolina facility that, if22   it had never joined the compact, it never would have23   had available to it.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Were there any benefits tothe contract at all until -- unless and until therewas a waste facility constructed?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there were hugebenefits, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA:  What?          MR. PHILLIPS:  The Barnwell facility inSouth Carolina was disposing of waste and was onlygoing to take wastes from the compact States in the24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At what point did South25   Carolina withdraw?11Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   hypothetical.  And I find it difficult to believe12   that there is an obligation to commit money and a13   liability for failure to do so in a compact which14   says that the State can withdraw at any time.  You15   talk about good faith withdrawal.  What would be bad16   faith withdrawal?  North Carolina simply says:  It'sOfficial          MR. PHILLIPS:  In 1995, Justice Ginsburg.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so they -- by 1997,they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but they still hadthe benefit of the compact's -- the Commission'sauthority to negotiate on behalf of the member Statesdeals with other compacts for the disposal in thosefacilities which you otherwise don't have the benefitof.￼171819202122232425no longer worth our trouble.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, this would be badfaith withdrawal.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Where the State assumes --accepts $80 million, goes down a path, is notentitled to any of that money or to any other money,and then unilaterally withdraws --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did it misspend that12JUSTICE SCALIA:  It sounds to me prettyAlderson Reporting Company 1   money?  Are you saying the money was misspent? 2             MR. PHILLIPS:  That's an open issue at this 3   point.  We haven't analyzed that.  That's part of 4   what I think what would be involved with the last 5   three counts of the -- of the complaint.  We don't 6   know exactly whether that money was properly spent or7 not. 8             But -- but either way, I think it is 9   important to recognize that, even if it were not,10   quote "misspent", at the end of the day which entity11   has the benefit of the $80 million?  Is it the six12   members of the compact today?  No.  It's North13 Carolina.14             If the -- if the Federal Government were to15   declare tomorrow, in response to some terrorist16   problem, that on-site storage of low-level nuclear17   waste is no longer permissible and that those wastes18   have got to be disposed of somewhere other -- in some19   other kind of a facility, the State that is -- other20   than Texas, which is about to start one up, but the21   State that’s clearly in the best position to do that22   today is North Carolina.  Why?  Because they have got23   a $134 million jump on everybody, $80 million the24   benefit of which was conferred by the Commission and25   the compact and the sister States that were a part of13Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   -- 2             JUSTICE STEVENS:  But, Mr. Phillips, I 3   really don't quite understand a part of your 4   argument.  I'm not sure what happened to the $80 5   million, and I guess you aren't, either.  And if in 6   fact -- and maybe it was -- they had in good faith 7   used that money to try and complete the facility and 8   then decided it's just not worth it, would you still 9   be entitled to get the 80 million back?10             MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I think if -- it would11   be a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million12   and come to the conclusion of this and there was a13   finding by the State authorities that this facility14   simply cannot be built consistent with health and15   safety.  I think that would be an argument that we16   are not entitled to the money back.17             But what I think you are not entitled to18   do, as North Carolina, is to decide unilaterally that19   more money should be paid, which is not provided for20   under the agreement, and insist on that as a21   condition of fulfilling any of its responsibilities22   under the agreement.23             JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your position --24   what do you say that the States contemplated25   regarding the financing of these -- of these14Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   projects?  That the State that was unfortunate enough 2   to be selected as the second State would have to pay 3   the full cost, even if it was $200 million, and then 4   would -- how long would it take for that State to get 5   that money back?  Would it have to wait until, you 6   know, 80, 100 years later to get the benefit of some 7   other State having to finance a project? 8             MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  I mean, well, the 9   working assumption is that the facilities would be in10   operation for 20 years.  And the reality, Justice11   Alito, is that once you have one of these facilities12   built, given that there are not very many of them and13   they are and would be a monopoly within the compact14   region, you have virtually limited -- unlimited15   authority to dictate whatever price you want to16   require for taking on the disposal.  And if you look17   at the sites that exist -- it was true in Barnwell;18   it's certainly true in Utah and in Washington -- I19   mean, those are licenses to print money, essentially,20   at this point.  And the expectation --Official￼21 22 23 24 25          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in -- but in the --          MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- case of this compactand the other ones, as I -- do I understandcorrectly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none15Alderson Reporting Company 1   of these compacts that were negotiated around the 2   same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an 3   operative disposal facility? 4             MR. PHILLIPS:  None so far.  Texas I think 5   is as -- is as far along in its process as -- as 6   anyone, and it's -- and it’s part of a compact.  But 7   you know, obviously there is a "not in my backyard" 8   mentality here.  But the -- at the end of the day, 9   the fundamental question remains, you know, what --10   who bears the responsibility?11             North Carolina -- it wasn't as though North12   Carolina was the unfortunate recipient of this13   particular decision and then said, you know, we don't14   want to do this, we can't pay for this, there’s no15   way we can accomplish this.  North Carolina, after16   having been designated as the host State,17   affirmatively passed legislation accepting that18   responsibility and committing the State to actually19   providing for a facility.20             Now, Justice Stevens, I agree, if it had21   turned out that as a matter of public health and22   safety -- that's the big bugaboo here -- if that had23   been an obstacle, or maybe, Justice Sotomayor, if the24   expense had been so far out of the range of what's25   conceivable, maybe there’s an impossibility element16Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   to it.  But the --23456   hadn't taken the 80 million.  Let's assume they hadOfficial          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I interrupt justa moment?MR. PHILLIPS:  Of course.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume they7 8 911   complete this; we just can't.  What in the compact12   stopped them from withdrawing?  Because the onlysunk all of that money themselves --          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.￼               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and they looked and10   said:  It's going to take us another 120 million to1314151617181920   compact, that would prevent them from doing that.  I21   do think there is an implied duty of good faith.  But22   in the situation you pose, Your Honor, I don't think23   there’s any question that they acted in good faith.24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right, okay.  So25   assuming they are acting in good faith, I still don't17provision I see in the contract about withdrawing isthe one that says once the facility is completed --MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- you have to keep --you have to give notice, four-year notice.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  The only thing --there is nothing express in the contract, in theAlderson Reporting Company 1   quite understand what the difference is except the 2   fact that they took what you’ve described in other 3   counts as an unjust enrichment.  You got us to give 4   you some money to help you along in this project. 5   But the situation hasn't changed.  We can't spend 6   more money.  We certainly can't spend the amount of 7   money it will take to complete this project.  I'm not 8   sure what turns that into bad faith, other than your 9   claim that they --10             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, other than -- other11   than the fact that to say "We can't" strikes me as12   utterly implausible.  To say "We don't want to"13141516   faith:  Just too much money.171819202122232425strikes me as much more arguable.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but thehypothetical I gave you before you described as good          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But the problem was          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What turns it into badfaith?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the problem --what turns it into bad faith is taking the 80million, consistently committing to going forwardwith it, and then walking away right before you aregoing to get sanctioned for failure to comply with18--Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   the -- with the agreement.  I think those are the234567   decision of this Court.  I do have an opinion by the8   D.C. Circuit some years ago that says that every 9   contract carries with it an implied duty of good10   faith and fair dealing.  You may remember that11   opinion.12               JUSTICE BREYER:  Then how do you -- what is13   -- is that absolutely necessary?  Any party State may14   withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing15   the compact.  That sentence seems to me your toughest16   point because that's what they did.  They simply171819202122   in.  And so how do you deal with that sentence, which23 24 25is one that Justice Scalia brought up in his --          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the only -- the onlyargument we have with respect to that -- and it's19withdrew.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.Officialelements that make it --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any precedentfrom this Court for reading into a contract betweenStates an obligation of good faith?MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't have any -- any￼          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, where in the contractis it something that says -- I mean, maybe that wasfoolish, to put that in there, but they did put itAlderson Reporting Company12345678   still is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999?  Before9   they withdraw, they have repudiated the agreement.Officialimportant to recognize, we don't have to win thisissue in order to win the breach of contract claim inthis particular case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well -- all right.  Well,go ahead, explain.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because there’smassive repudiation long before the -- the question￼10   They have breached it totally.  The very essence of111213141516171819202122232425the agreement was lost once North Carolina refused totake any steps, much less appropriate steps.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there in this implicitthat the State of North Carolina, prior to theirwithdrawal, while they are still acting, willappropriate reasonable amounts of money for this?          MR. PHILLIPS:  And take -- well, what theyare supposed to do is take appropriate steps tolicense, which means --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Do appropriate stepsinclude --          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- continue to do what'snecessary to get a license.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- do they -- does this --if we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a20Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that ifCongress decides not to lend and won't appropriatethe money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And I assume if there is asimilar agreement here and North Carolina'slegislature doesn't appropriate any money forwhatever internal reasons, North Carolina is inbreach of the treaty.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Do I understand thiscorrectly?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, that's absolutelyright, Justice Breyer.Official￼10111213141516171819202122   specific authority for that proposition.  But,23   Justice Breyer, it seems to me what you describe24   there is exquisitely close to what this -- what this25   Court resolved in Mobil Oil Exploration, where21MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any authority forthe proposition that when a legislature does notappropriate the money that the executive of a Statehas committed to another State, that State is inbreach, irrespective of whose fault it is within theState?MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know that there isAlderson Reporting Company1   Congress passed a statute saying that the2   administrative side would not be permitted to go3   forward, and this Court said that action constituted4   a repudiation of the underlying obligation, even5   though it was far from clear that there would ever be6   any exploration or production of oil on this -- on7   the outer continental shelf sites that were in there.8             This Court said that when -- that if an9   obligor will commit a breach that would of itselfOfficial￼10   give the obligee a claim for damages for total11   breach, so that it so substantially impairs the value12   of the contract, and the government said it would13   break or did break an important contractual promise,14   impairing the value of the contract, then the15   government must give the companies back the money.16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So this case then17   boils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to18   their withdrawal, did they take the steps,19   appropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to20 make?2122 - 23242522MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, I think that's a fair ­JUSTICE BREYER:  And you say they did not?          MR. PHILLIPS:  But we have other arguments,obviously, but then -- but on the breach --Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's -- but if youwin on that one, you win.          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- we should win.  In myjudgment, that's -- the conduct of North Carolinabetween 1997 and 1999 is exactly the same conductthat the United States entered into in MobilExploration.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And the state of thefinding of the Commission in respect to that precise13141516171819202122232425          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, it’s a --          JUSTICE BREYER:  They have -- they are theones who are the judge, it says.          MR. PHILLIPS:  I believe that they are thesole judge, yes.says.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That's what itMR. PHILLIPS:  Article 7(C).Official￼10   point, and it's called -- what is it called?  The11   "Impact Commission"?  Do we have the same thing in12   mind, the Commission?  Is that what it's called?          JUSTICE BREYER:  The findings in respect tothat specific 2-year point are what, and where arethey in the record?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Okay.  That’s in the -- thatwill be in the sanctions order that's in the23Alderson Reporting Company1   appendix, so that -- in the record.  I think it's2   around page 400.  I will get that for you, Justice3456   completely.  It repudiated.7             In addition to that, when North Carolina8   announced that it was shutting down the project and9   that it was not going forward, that it was just goingOfficialBreyer.Carolina had a duty to go forward and -- and stoppedBut the specific finding is that North￼10   to run out and wait and hope, frankly, that11   additional funding would come forward, the -- the12   compact -- the director of the compact specifically13   wrote to the governor twice, saying:  These are acts141516171819202122232425in repudiation and in violation of the agreement; itis your responsibility.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they also -- yousaid -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997,the Commission came forward with some kind ofadditional funding proposal, which North Carolinacame down -- turned down.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Refused, right.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what was that?          MR. PHILLIPS:  The basic proposal -- thedraft memorandum of understanding would have -- wouldhave led to the Commission providing, I think, about24Alderson Reporting Company1   $21 million, and the generators in the Southeast2   States providing a loan to North Carolina of an3   additional -- I think it was $13 million.  And that4   gets you the $34 million -- comes from -- for the --5   for the finalized elements of getting a license put6   in place.  So we had -- you know, we thought we had7   in place an offer to fund.  I mean, that's what makes89 10 11North Carolina --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why did -- why did NorthCarolina turn it down?          MR. PHILLIPS:  You might want to ask Mr.Official￼12   Dellinger that question.  They didn't -- they didn't13141516171819202122232425provide us with any explanation for why they didn't ­- why they turned that down.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you say there was apackage, that there was a -- an offer in place wherethe Commission would pay X and the generators wouldkick in an additional amount as well.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And that would havebeen a loan for the future.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that was -- that --everybody had signed -- everybody who was part ofthat offer had signed onto it?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Everybody on ourside had agreed to that, including the -- the other25Alderson Reporting Company89 10          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you know, when you --when you've got the power to extort, you know, thetemptation to go down that path, Justice Scalia, isOfficialmembers of the compact.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why did they agree to it?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Because the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Once again, they are just12345   tender-hearted?  I mean, even though North Carolina6   had an obligation to fund all of it?  They just come7   forward and say:  Yes, extort us.  I mean, I --￼11   obviously pretty strong.  And the reason they did it12   was --1314   power to extort; it's the power to withdraw.  And15   that power to withdraw suggests that there is no16   absolute obligation to come up with the funding.  TheJUSTICE SCALIA:  I suggest it's not the171819202122232425   investment to get this site up and running.  So we've26two seem to me so -- so inconsistent with -- with oneanother.MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the difficulty --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So long as you canwithdraw at any time --          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But remember, youare talking now also about the Commission and theother compact States having sunk $80 million in theAlderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   Commission contributed?  In other words, it doesn't 8   have to be enough to trigger an obligation on the 9   part of North Carolina to move forward.  I assume10   there is some level where you would say, you know,11   they took their chances, and it didn't work out -- as12   opposed to they obviously committed in light of the13   money they accepted.14             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the answer to15   your question is -- you know, of course, is:  What's16   the appropriate remedy for the particular breach in17   any given case?  In this context, if we were talking18   about a couple thousand dollars --19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I don't think20   so.  I think it's a question of whether there's a21   breach.  I would say that if you gave them $122   million, you should not view that as:  Well, we've23   supported your efforts; you are committed to do this,24   no matter how much it costs, because we have given25   you $1 million.27Official-- I mean, we've already got $80 million in the hole.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would your positionbe the -- be the same if it were $20 million?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, our position would beexactly the same.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So whatever the￼Alderson Reporting Company12345   ultimate question is still:  What is the obligation?6   And Justice Breyer identified it, I think, quite89 101213141516171819202122232425count 2 in that breach claim.          But our argument there is that they had a          It seems to me at some point the amountbecomes pertinent in assessing whether you have aclaim.OfficialMR. PHILLIPS:  But I -- well, I think the7   precisely.  And again, this is only with respect to￼     responsibility from December 1997 until July of 199911   to take appropriate steps.  And they massivelyrepudiated that obligation and repudiated theentirety of --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My -- my problemremains --          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- of the contract.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- with that answer, isthat you earlier said that they could -- forgettingif they didn't take any money -- under the terms ofthis compact -- and Justice Scalia has been notingthis repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time becausethey didn't want to sink any more money into thisproject; is that correct?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Subject to what Iwould think was a duty of good faith, they could have28Alderson Reporting Company1   done that.  But they didn't do that.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's put asidethat duty of good faith --          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.Official          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because with thatduty of good faith, you're suggesting that merelybecause they took a million -- that's what the ChiefJustice is asking you -- or 80 million, that thatsomehow converted or changed the express terms of thecontract and bound them in some way to find funding￼1011   that they chose not to.  That -- that's really the12   argument I'm hearing you make.13             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I think it's more subtle14   than that, Justice Sotomayor.  I mean, my point is15   they always had an obligation to take appropriate16   steps to get licensed.  That was an obligation that17   lasted until they withdrew.  And from -- from18   December 1997 on, they refused to take any steps19   toward getting a license.  And we don't know today20   whether something could have happened in that year21   and a half that might have changed the entire dynamic22   of this and allowed it to in fact be completed in a23   way that all of the parties would have been satisfied24 with.25JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask you just one29Alderson Reporting Company123456   presented?  And I see the legal questions as whether7 8 9or not, in fact, the claim belongs to the Commissionor to the States for the $80 million and the $10million in lost revenue.question on the sovereign immunity issue?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Of course.Official          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any factualdevelopment that needs to occur before the SpecialMaster to address the legal questions that have been￼10111213141516   argument.  I think we have put forward everything17   before the Special Master that we think is relevant18   for the -- for a disposition of that --19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is there in the20   record that shows that the claims of the States are21   identical to the claim the Commission is asserting,22   which was the -- which was the instance in the23   Arizona-California case?24             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  The bill of25   complaint itself doesn't distinguish between claims30MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any factualdevelopment that needs to occur, or is that a purelegal question based on the arguments that arecontained in the briefs before us?MR. PHILLIPS:  I think it's a pure legalAlderson Reporting Company 1   based on any particular party.  They list the parties 2   and they list the claims, and there is no effort to 3   mix and match as between them.  In terms -- 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that it's 5   the obligation of the Commission to show that there 6   is an absolute parallel between the claims.  And I 7   just don't see where I can infer from the record or 8   conclude that that is the case.  And if -- and if 9   that is not so, then the Commission is not like the10   Indian tribes in the Arizona case.11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I would think at a12   minimum we are very much like the private oil13   companies in the Maryland v. Louisiana case, in any14   event, where, you know, the claims were out there; it15   was far from clear exactly how those claims were16   going to play out in one way or another.  And this17   Court didn't sit down and say:  We have to sort that18   out ahead of going forward with the litigation.  What19   the Court said was:  These all look to be pretty20   close and there’s no basis on which to assume that21   they are doing more -- that they are asking for more,22   and therefore there’s no Eleventh Amendment problem.23             And, of course, remember the Special Master24   has held open the possibility that if for some reason25   the claims of the Commission were to deviate from the31Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   claims of -- of any of the compact States, which as 2   far as I can tell to this point they have -- they 3   have not deviated one iota, then the Special Master 4   would allow North Carolina to revisit -- to renew its 5   motion at that point. 6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't there an 7   obligation before we exercise original jurisdiction 8   to ensure that there is at least a potential viable 9   claim by the States that they have a cause of action?10   I mean, that then becomes a legal question.  Is the11   compact -- is the Commission an agent?12             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do the States own these14 revenues?15             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are suggesting that17 --18             MR. PHILLIPS:  But that -- it seems to me,19   Justice Sotomayor, what you are doing there is20   collapsing the question on the merits into the21   jurisdictional issue of --22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But we do that all the23   time, for example, with -- with sovereign immunity.24   We --25             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.32Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We tell district courtswhen there is a sovereign immunity issue, do the --whatever discovery you need on the question, butaddress it, because it's jurisdictional.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Although --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There has to be a basisfor the claim.Official          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Although this --this Court has also recognized in Georgia v. UnitedStates, for instance, that if -- if there are clearlyclaims that exist, that are legitimately litigable,notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, and there maybe some question about others, that the Courtnevertheless should go forward and figure out --￼10111213141516171819   the States may have some legitimate claims.  The20   question is do they have legitimate claims to what21   the Commission is seeking.  I think that's theJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not -- I'm not --          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- which ones work and whichones don't.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't question that22 question.23             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And I think the24   answer to that is -- just as the Special Master said,25   it's premature to try to judge that until we get to a33Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9point in the litigation where it becomes clear thatthere is some departure between what the States aredoing and what the Commission is doing.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I am conscious ofyour white light, but it does seem to me --          MR. PHILLIPS:  I get --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that the Commission is-- is asking for the money for itself.Official￼          MR. PHILLIPS:  No, the Commission is askingfor the money on behalf of the -- of the compactStates, and the compact States are asking for the101112   money on their own behalf.  I do think it's an easier13   vehicle for the Court to be able to provide a remedy14   by giving money under these circumstances.15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.16 Phillips.17             Mr. Kneedler.18             ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER19               ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES20                     AS AMICUS CURIAE,21                IN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY22             MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may23   it please the Court:24             The United States has participated in this25   case both, at the Court's invitation, at the motion34Alderson Reporting Company 1   for leave to file stage and then before the Special 2   Master, primarily on the issues that were addressed 3   in the Special Master's preliminary report, which go 4   to questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment 5   immunity in original actions as well as the structure 6   of the compact and the compact's power to assess 7   monetary sanctions itself. 8             Today we make two principal arguments: 9   one, that the Court should deny North Carolina's10   motion to dismiss the Commission as a party,11   rejecting at this time or for the time being the12   assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second,13   that the Court should deny the claim that the14   Commission has the power itself to impose monetary15   sanctions under article 7(F).16             That’s not to say that the States party may17   not seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary18   relief, themselves in an original action in this19   Court.  It's only to say that the compact Commission20   is not a forum established by the compact itself,21   which is not only a compact between the States, but22   an Act of Congress, to do that.23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask you, what is24   the policy advantage of the rule you are proposing25   with respect to the first question, the joinder of35Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   the Commission in this original action, of us 2   proceeding to answer substantive questions about the 3   interpretation of the compact, et cetera, without 4   addressing initially the right of the Commission to 5   bring this action as an original action at all? 6             It seems to be putting the cart before the 7   horse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be 8   reaching the merits, deciding the merits, before 9   identifying which are the parties and what claims10   they have before us.11             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I, think, as Mr.12   Phillips suggested, this Court's decision in -- in13   the United States v. Georgia establishes the Court is14   not required to, and in some circumstances it -- it15   may be possible to dispose of the case on -- on the16   merits because the plaintiff States in this case I17   think undoubtedly have a cause --18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But this one won't.19             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the plaintiff States20   undoubtedly have a cause of action for breach of the21   compact.  They are parties to the compact, and as22   parties to the compact, they can bring an action23   whether or not the Commission is properly before --24   before the Court.  And the question of whether the --25   North Carolina violated the compact therefore can be36Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   adjudicated solely on the basis of -- of the 2   plaintiff States' claim, without having to reach the 3   question of -- of whether the Commission could 4   properly be made a party. 5             If this Court were to agree with the 6   Special Master that there was no violation of the 7   compact, then the question of whether the Commission 8   could be -- could also bring that claim and what -- 9   what remedy there might be for that, either to the10   States or to the Commission, would never have to be ­11   - to be reached.  So there is, I think, someOfficial￼1213141516171819   commission to sue a State in its own right?  Or this20   is a novel question?efficiency with -- with respect to that.          But on the Eleventh Amendment question --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we have -- Mr.Kneedler --          MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, do we haveany decision that deals with the standing of a21             MR. KNEEDLER:  This is -- this is a novel22   question as -- as far as I -- as far as I am aware.23   And -- and that may be one reason why the Court would24   prefer not to specifically address the question.  But25   I -- but I do think on the -- on the basic principles37Alderson Reporting Company 1   of Eleventh Amendment immunity, that this Court's 2   decision in Arizona v. California, at least at this 3   stage of the case, is dispositive.  Because there the 4   Court concluded that the States -- because the United 5   States had intervened, they had no assertion of 6   Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to the 7   subject matter of the dispute.  As the Court put it, 8   the tribes are not bringing any new claims or issues 9   before the Court, and therefore the judicial power of10   this Court would not be enlarged and the State's11   sovereign immunity would not be compromised by the12   Indian tribes' participation in the case.13             We think that’s an important principle, at14   least with respect to Indian tribes, who this Court15   recognized in Arizona --16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But here the Commission17   is seeking sums for itself.  What assurance do we18   have that the Commission, if it received the money,19   would give it back to the States exactly in the ratio20   the States demand it?21             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I don't think the22 Court --23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I think it's their24   obligation to show the complete parallel between --25   between the claims, and that that has not been done.38Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, two things about that. 2   In Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by 3   a number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax 4   on Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on 5   the suit of the -- of those States, but the natural 6   gas companies who paid the tax were permitted to 7   intervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding 8   the Eleventh Amendment.  Surely, the claim of the 9   States parens patriae was not identical to the claims10   of the individual natural gas companies to get a11   refund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless12   allowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment13   in this case awarded -- required the State of14   Louisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers.15             So I -- I don't think -- especially in an16   original action where the State has a certain parens17   patriae responsibility, I don't think that the claims18   have to be identical in the precise way that they19   were in -- in Arizona v. California.20             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Kneedler, can I ask21   you sort of a basic question about the Eleventh22   Amendment argument?  You -- you framed it entirely in23   terms of the Eleventh Amendment, but is there not24   also a common law immunity that the States can plead25   against non-sovereigns?39Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, although I -- I think ­ 2   - I think -- I don't know whether this falls within 3   the precise terms of the Eleventh Amendment.  It 4   would depend on whether the compact Commission is 5   regarded as a citizen of another State, which I think 6   it would not be.  But, yes, it would be the -- the 7   principle recognized in Alden.  But I -- the 8   principles that I am describing here I think would 9   apply equally to that immunity, as they would to the10 other --11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is it -- to go back to12   the word "sanctions," when I read the word13   "sanctions" in the law, the thing that comes to my14   mind first and foremost is the money, like a fine;15   and sort of second, imprisonment.  But paying a fine,16   that -- that seems to me the most primitive and basic17   sanction of anything.  And -- and why -- and18   particularly, if you say the fine was limited to19   giving back money you previously took.20             So, why wouldn't you read this clause here21   which says "including" -- and then it doesn't mention22   money, but it includes some other things, and you say23   well, sure, they include the other things because the24   word "sanction" doesn't automatically call to mind25   those other things, but it does automatically call to40Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1234   with this.  I think this Court has always recognized5   that monetary liability on the part of a State is 6   distinct from prospective relief, and I think the 7   Court should not lightly assume that States have 8   agreed to have a nonjudicial forum, like a -- 9             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, are we supposed to --10   are we supposed to treat compacts among States as if11   we are dealing with those who want to impose12   obligations on the States?13             MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but --14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Here, aren't we trying to15   say what obligations did the States themselves want16   to impose on themselves?17              MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and as we point out in18   pages 26 and 27 of our -- of our brief, there wereOfficialmind a fine.          MR. KNEEDLER:  There -- there are severalpoints that I think are important to bear in mind￼19   three -- it’s actually four compacts that were20   adopted or approved in the very same Act of Congress21   which specifically provide for monetary sanctions --22   or monetary -- monetary remedies, which shows that23   the compacting parties knew how to do it when they24 wanted to.2541But beyond that, I think it's important toAlderson Reporting Company 1   look at the overall structure of article 7, where the 2   sanctions power appears.  First of all, article 7(F), 3   which is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any 4   party State which fails to comply, et cetera, "may be 5   subject to sanctions, including suspension of rights 6   under the compact and revocation." 7             Those are all forward-looking sanctions. 8   But -- but I think what really reinforces that is if 9   you look at the title of article 7, which is on page10   17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties,11   withdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and12   termination.  Article 7 is all about membership in13   the -- in the Commission.  The Commission's powers,14   by contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of15   the compact.  There are enumerated powers there and,16   for example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the17   only enumerated power with respect to sanctions18   there, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the19   membership of a party State in accordance with20   article 7(F).21             One would think, if there -- if there was22   an extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions,23   that it would have appeared in the enumerated powers,24   and in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same25   time that provides for imposition of fines, it42Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   actually appears in the enumerated powers portion of 2   the relevant compact, not in the membership. 3             And, Justice Breyer, you asked about 4   section -- article 7(C), with respect to the power of 5   the Commission to be the judge of -- of certain 6   matters.  I think it's pretty clear that what that's 7   driving at is the Commission being the judge of the 8   qualifications of the -- of the States and the 9   members of the Commission appointed by the States to10   participate.11             It's like the power of any legislative12   body, the power of Congress to determine the13   qualifications of someone who’s about -- who has been14   voted in, should that person be seated.  I think15   article 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power16   of --17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it adds -- it adds ­18   - it starts "Qualifications."  It says it's the judgeOfficial￼19202122232425of qualification and it's the judge of theircompliance with the conditions and requirements ofthis compact.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But if you continue -- “Andthe laws” --          JUSTICE BREYER:  "And the laws of theStates relating to the enactment of the compact."43Alderson Reporting Company 1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, but -- but -- the -- 2   the laws of the parties -- if I may finish? 3             "The laws of the parties State," the final 4   phrase relating to the enactment of the compact, I 5   think would modify the qualifications -- compliance 6   with the conditions and requirements of the compact 7   with respect to membership. 8             Again, I think that comes from the first 9   part of article 7(C), but I think it's -- it's the10   overall thrust of article 7 that it deals with11   membership.12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.13 Kneedler.14             Mr. Dellinger.15             ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER16                 ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT17             MR. DELLINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may18   it please the Court:19             I think I should begin with a simple20   question that my grandson asked me, which is why did21   North Carolina quit?  Which I think sheds light onOfficial￼22232425   coercive model.  You could have one, where States --what its obligations were and what the understandingwas.This is a compact.  It is not based upon a44Alderson Reporting Company 1   all the States are required to remain in the compact, 2   withdrawal is a nullity, the Commission can enforce 3   financial sanctions, and the compact members waive 4   sovereign immunity and can be sued in Federal court. 5             This compact is based on a consensual 6   model, where it -- each -- each State can withdraw, 7   and therefore the compact has to be in the rough 8   financial interest of each of the States at any point 9   in time, which is what --10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You took -- you11   took $80 million, and they got nothing for it.  Thatwould be a question your grandson might ask.          (Laughter.)          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What did you dowith the $80 million?Official￼1213141516171819202122   States.  They contributed $25,000 apiece.  It came23   from charges on generators from all over the country.24   The funds went to the authority established under25   North Carolina law and could only be used for the45          MR. DELLINGER:  The $80 million came from ­- not the State -- the statement that the States gaveNorth Carolina $80 million and North Carolina haskept it and didn't give it back is a shorthand thatis misleading in every single respect.The funds, of course, didn't come from theAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9purposes of the Low-Level Waste Authority, and indeedthey all were used for the purposes of the Low-LevelWaste Authority.          The master assumes that -- that all --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How did that help theother compacting States, giving them the $80 millionand North Carolina walking away?Official          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, noone was helped by this process or the process of theother compacts, none of which resulted in a -- in a￼1011   facility.  But what North Carolina did was to carry12   out its responsibilities to take appropriate steps13   and, as I will show in a moment, fully in accord with14   the understanding of the Commission and North15   Carolina, that they would be -- it would be jointly16   financed, even though the Commission had no legal17   obligation.  But the key reason --18             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm hard-pressed to19   understand where that comes from.  Under the terms of20   the contract -- the compact, the compact expressly21   says that none of the contracting States have any22   liabilities with respect to this --23             MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct, and it24   says that the Commission does not have any legal25   obligation --46Alderson Reporting Company 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 2             MR. DELLINGER:  -- under the compact to 3   fund it, either.  But it was because this is a 4   consensual compact and because of the right to 5   withdrawal, as the master noted, it would have been 6   surprising if a facility were constructed without 7   significant assistance from the States that were not 8   the host State because of the right to withdraw, and 9   that indeed was recognized from the very beginning.10             For example, in 1996, when the -- the11   chairman of the Commission was hoping to speed up the12   completion, the chairman noted that the opening of a13   new regional facility in North Carolina would ensure14   a source of revenues for site development in the15   third host State.16             Indeed, it's not surprising that, from the17   beginning of the compact, the Commission provided a18   substantial amount of the funding because North19   Carolina could have withdrawn at any point.  And the20   Commission repeatedly recognized that it was, quote,21   "necessary and appropriate and reasonable and22   equitable" for the Commission to contribute to this.23             Mr. Phillips cites the North Carolina24   legislation -- the North Carolina legislation, which25   notes that, among the Commission's -- the authority's47Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1   corporate powers, when it sets up the authority or2   the financing -- but the North Carolina legislation,3   as the Commission expressly recognized and cited in4   providing the money, provides that North Carolina may5   accept funds from its general assembly.  The North6   Carolina authority may accept funds from the North7   Carolina general assembly, from the Commission8   compact, from other States, from the Federal9   Government, or from generators.  And they begin to10   say it's necessary and appropriate.11             At every step, they -- the Commission says12   that in -- in February of '88, October of '89,13   September of '92, November of '92, "reasonable and14   equitable to provide this funding," and of course it15   makes sense, given the consensual nature of the16 compact.1718   quit?  What happened was, because of the right to19   withdraw, South Carolina withdrew in 1995.  When20   South Carolina withdrew, this of course deprived the21   Commission of a ready source of funding from the fees22   that were being paid to the facility in Barnwell,23   South Carolina.24             But much -- or of equal significance is the25   fact that South Carolina, having withdrawn, no longer48Official￼So, what happened?  Why did North CarolinaAlderson Reporting Company1   had to comply with the compact requirement, that2   South Carolina ceased operating a facility on3   December 31, 1992.4             Why was that important?  Because the5   compact creates, as Mr. Phillips noted, something6   like a monopoly within the region, and when you are7   financing the facility you know, if you are the8   financing authority, that you will have a captive9 market --Official￼101112   withdraw.1314   is:  What we have are a group of States, each of whom15   feels it's necessary to build a cholera plant.  And16   they know that the cholera plant will be hated by17   everybody in their State, but it's necessary.  So18   they each say:  We’ll undertake it, okay?  But the19   deal is you do, too.  Now, that's their basic deal.JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I see.  So --MR. DELLINGER:  Unless -- unless States canJUSTICE BREYER:  So I was thinking of this,20212223   when it's State A's turn, they run away.  Well,24   that's the deal.  They can run away.  But in          I don't know that they ever would haveentered into this as part of the basic deal thatState A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but25   addition, take $80 million?  Okay.  That's where we49Alderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4   the 80 million as well as running away.  But it seems 5   to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to 6   decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they 7   said it was an appropriate step.  They foresaw you 8   would take the 80 million, never give it back, at9 least.10             But the Commission thinks it isn't.  And11   the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the12   Commission.  And what the Commission says in the13   language that I quoted is that the Commission is the14   judge of the members' compliance with the15   requirements of this contract.  So when I read that,16   I think:  Surely, he should have paid some attention17   to the fact that the Commission thought that what was18   keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step.19             Now, there we are.  That's my question.20   And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read21   the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of22   States relating to the enactment of this contract --23   compact.  And I don't know that you read "enactment"24   so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how25   you adopt it.  There might be a whole lot of laws.  I50are back with the Chief's question.          Now, I don't know whether it is anOfficialappropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   guess you pay attention to all of them.  So I don't 2   see what the last phrase has to do with it.  But 3   anyway, that's my basic question in the case. 4             MR. DELLINGER:  All right.  I’ll -- I’ll 5   answer them in reverse order:  The keeping the 80 6   million and the Commission's judgment about that. 7   Their argument is either that, you know, the 8   Commission is somehow the sole judge of these issues 9   or that there's some -- that you should treat a State10   as something like a regulated industry under an11   agency model.  And they -- and they point to 7(C), or12   at least the part of 7(C) that they leave in their13   quote, as establishing that.  And what I think Mr.14   Kneedler was attempting to say when his time ran out15   is that, if you just read 7(C), it's about16   membership.17             7(C) is in a five-provision sequence:  (A),18   (B), (C), (D), and (E).  (A) lists the initial State19   members; (B) says how other States can become20   members; (D) provides that the first three States21   which enact and pay their fees will bring the compact22   into existence.  And (E) states that members of otherOfficial￼23 24 25compacts are not eligible for membership.          Then (C), in the middle, says that eachState shall be declared a party State upon payment of51Alderson Reporting Company 1   the fees and enactment, and the Commission is the 2   judge of the qualifications of the party States and 3   of its members and their compliance with the 4   conditions and requirements of the compact -- and if 5   I may go "dot, dot, dot" -- relating to the enactment 6   of this compact. 7             Now, that phrase “relating to the 8   enactment” might refer just to the preceding phrase 9   about laws of the party States.  But Mr. Kneedler and10   I both read it more naturally in the context of the11   Commission as judge, that this is about how you judge12   who's a member.  It is, in that sense, like the HouseOfficial￼13141516171819202122232425of Representatives provision they quote, except itdoesn't say "sole judge."          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, in your opinion, theCommission is not the judge of anything other thanmembership?          MR. DELLINGER:  Not with --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, therefore, the sixpages or so of this compact that has to do with a lotof detailed issues that might appear before theCommission -- it is not the judge of whether there iscompliance with those issues --          MR. DELLINGER:  With respect to -- withrespect to --52Alderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4 5 6   authority.  If it's going to sanction a State that is 7   blocking the transmit of other States, it has to 8   interpret what it is applying. 9             I think what the -- counsel is arguing that10   it was entitled to some special deference, and what11   the master is saying is:  Given the right to12   withdraw, why should North Carolina -- why should it13   be allowed any deference over a determination by the14   State that's not a party to the compact?  It was not15   required to -- not a party to -- at that point, to16   the compact.17             Now, I do want to answer your question18   about North Carolina keeping the money, because this19   is important.  Where --202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Before you get to that --          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  While we are on 7(C), I'mnot clear on how you are reading that last section.Is the last phrase -- "relating to the enactment ofthis compact" -- is it your position that that phrase53          JUSTICE BREYER: -- because this concernsonly membership?Official          MR. DELLINGER:  With respect to parties tothe compact, the Commission, of course, has tointerpret the compact when it engages in its sanction￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9is joined not only with the immediately precedingwords -- "the laws of the party States" relating tothe enactment of this compact -- but that it alsorefers back to compliance with the conditions andrequirements of this compact relating to theenactment of this compact?          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, I am.  And that’s notgrammatically compelled; it is permitted.1011121314151617   Commission judging who becomes a member.  In (A),18   (B), (C), (D), and (E), and as Mr. Kneedler noted, in19   the other compacts that were based on a model, this ­20   - the seventh article is all about eligibility for21   membership.  The powers and sanctions and parts are22   elsewhere in the compact.23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you relying on the24   caption to article 7 -- “Eligible Parties;25   Withdrawal; Revocation; Entry into Force;54MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, it does.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Conditions andrequirements relating to the enactment of thecompact?Official￼          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It certainly isn'tgrammatically compelled, but does it make any sense?          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  This is about -- it'snot very beautifully done, but it's about theAlderson Reporting Company1   Termination”?  The caption to article 7?2345   who's got the money:  The $80 million coming from6   fees generated by users around the country wentOfficial          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  And it's -- it's alsocaptions about that subject.But if I may return to the question of 7   through the Commission to the authority.  It was set 8   up in a special separate account just for the 9   purposes of the authority.  All of the funds were10   expended over this process of a massive amount of11   studies that were done.  Not a penny of it could ever12   be spent by the North Carolina General Assembly for13   any purposes whatsoever.14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dellinger, what of ­15   - what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $8016   million gave North Carolina a leg up, should there17   ever be any revival of the development of a disposal18   facility; North Carolina is much better situated than19   anyone else to do this, because they have already20   sunk $80,000 into pursuing a license?21             MR. DELLINGER:  Well, it has been 10 or 1222   years since this occurred, Justice Ginsburg, and23   there has been no effort and no plan in North24   Carolina to build a facility, and to begin the25   licensing process anew.  Some of the information they55￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   -- the authority retained, which would be of use to 2   the Commission anywhere, whether there is any site­ 3   specific information that would still be good 15 or 4   20 years out, I think is just pure speculation. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Take a hypothetical case 6   where North Carolina did have a real advantage and 7   they used the money to create a facility, would that 8   bear on the unjust enrichment claim or even the 9   sanctions claim?10             MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  It might well bear on11   the unjust enrichment, if there was, you know, an12   enrichment.  What happened here is that the North13   Carolina General Assembly appropriated money that14   went to the authority.  Properly considered, North15   Carolina -- the Commission provided money to the16   authority.  The North Carolina General Assembly17   provided money for the authority.  All the funds were18   spent.  The only State that contributed money to thisprocess was North Carolina, and North Carolinacontributed $34 million.          Now, why did they -- I think one of themost useful documents we have is in the --Official￼19202122232425   Commission was North Carolina?  I just want to make56          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want -- you saidthe only State that contributed money to theAlderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the North Carolina authority,  the -- the waste10   disposal authority.  They were the only State to do11 so.12             So 80 million had come from the fees13   generated at Barnwell, 34 million from North14   Carolina, and the -- what happened was -- once South15   Carolina withdrew from the compact, was liberated16   from this obligation to close, was announcing that it17   was now going to continue and is open to the world,18   they had a cost advantage and a location advantage19   over North Carolina.20             So in -- in 1996, the joint supplemental21   fact brief at -- appendix at page 143, is where the22   head of the North Carolina authority writes to the23   head of the Commission and notes that, with the24   withdrawal of South Carolina and their decision to25   continue the operation at Barnwell, the financing57sure I heard that right.          MR. DELLINGER:  Every State contributed$25,000 --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That’s it?OfficialMR. DELLINGER:  -- to sign up.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.MR. DELLINGER:  But aside from that, NorthCarolina General Assembly appropriated $34 million to￼Alderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4   operational.  With an available alternative disposal 5   facility now in South Carolina, there is no assurance 6   to potential bondholders or financiers that there 7   will be a revenue stream from which to repay any 8   indebtedness.  Therefore, the authority is in a 9   position where the intended vehicles for financing10   are no longer possible.11             One possibility is to modify the compact to12   preclude withdrawal from the compact, once the13   license is issued for the North Carolina facility,14   and that would -- such an amendment would allow --15   future use of the facility would be assured, and16   revenue financing could be considered.17             It was not practical to submit that to all18   seven of the other -- all seven legislatures and to19   Congress, but the other problem is it would not have20   -- its -- its passage would, by no means, have been21   assured.  The States, at that moment, could either22   stay in or go.23             So North Carolina is faced, after South24   Carolina's withdrawal, with the prospect of advancing25   -- trying to advance bonds for another, at minimum,58options have been substantially changed.          Under the current compact, any State canOfficialwithdraw up until the North Carolina facility becomes￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   $75 million for construction costs, which would bring 2   the whole project up to 223 million, close to a 3   quarter of a billion dollars, and with now a South 4   Carolina facility that is closer to every State in 5   the compact, except Virginia, and where, because it 6   was built in 1981, it has a competitive cost7 advantage. 8             So why is Georgia going to stay in the 9   compact, when it has what may be a -- a less costly10   and less distant alternative in going to Barnwell,11   South Carolina?12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why -- why would13   anyone stay in the contract?  I take it that your14   point, which is an awfully good one, is that this15   compact was designed, like others, to solve a16   political problem.17             It's necessary for the country to store18   low-level radioactive waste, necessary for health and19   safety, but because of the politics and people's20   understanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so,21   now, the States have formed a series of compacts.22             And we are told, in an amicus brief, that,23   if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to24   take advantage of another State's having done so for25   years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot,59Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   it will be impossible for many other States to resist 2   that same route. 3             And that will be the end of compacts 4   through the United States, and what we will have is 5   low-level waste without storage.  That's argument, 6   roughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case, 7   and I would like to know your opinion. 8             MR. DELLINGER:  My response to that is that 9   the amicus’ suggestion that a decision for North10   Carolina would impair the very useful mechanism of11   interstate compacts has it exactly backwards.12             States establishing compacts remain13   entirely free to include or add provisions limiting14   the right to withdraw; permitting the imposition of15   sanctions, including financial sanctions; imposing16   those on States that are no longer members; defining17   whether the limits will be a million dollars or a18   hundred million for what they will impose -- or no19   limits at all; and, as the Central Compact did,20   requiring a waiver of sovereign immunity so that21   these judgments can be enforced in Federal court.22   All that's possible.23             But a decision in -- whether or not you24   decide for North Carolina, if that's what you want in25   a compact, you can have that compact, and nothing in60Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   a decision for North Carolina would change that. 2             A decision in favor of North Carolina 3   would, in fact, benefit the compacting process 4   because it would provide assurances to State 5   legislators that you can pick up a copy of the 6   proposed compact and read it and know that that is 7   the extent of the liabilities to which you are 8   imposing your -- exposing your State, and that is the 9   limit of the obligations you are taking on to --10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In this case -- in this11   case, how did it come about that the right to12   withdraw any time until the second plant was13   operable, was that -- that was North Carolina's14   proposal after it was designated to be the site?15             MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Ginsburg, the16   original compact had no limits whatsoever on17   withdrawal, and when North Carolina was chosen as the18   site, it proposed, as a necessary condition to its19   not -- not withdrawing, that the compact be admitted20   to add a provision, 7(H), which would say that after21   -- 30 days after the second facility becomes22   operational, no State may withdraw without the23   consent of all the other States.24             So North -- North Carolina added a25   limitation on the -- at their behest, a limitation on61Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   the right to withdraw.  When South Carolina pulled 2   out, it was clear that that limitation on the right 3   to withdrawal wasn't good enough because it meant 4   that States could withdraw at any time up until the 5   new facility became operational, in which case it was 6   going to be too late. 7             If they pulled out then and went to -- to 8   Barnwell, that made it unbondable because there’s no 9   guarantee -- what made it possible to contemplate10   financing this by bonds and by other financing11   mechanisms was the insurance of a market and the12   right to withdraw --13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why didn't you14   withdraw?  I mean, all this is very good.  You had15   that absolute right to withdraw, but you didn't16   withdraw in -- when was it -- '97.  You went on for 217   years, still as a member of the compact and still18   subject to obligations under the compact.  How could19   it be said that you were taking all appropriate20   steps?  What is the language -- all --Official￼21 22 23 24 25          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  Appropriate steps --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MR. DELLINGER:  -- to ensure that a licenseis held and obtained.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You took no steps at all.62Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9You took zero steps.          MR. DELLINGER:  North --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why didn't you withdraw?Official          MR. DELLINGER:  Because North Carolinahoped that -- and no longer spending 2 million ayear, it spent half a million to get -- to keep theauthority going, North Carolina kept open thepossibility that there would be some possiblefinancing that might allow this project to becompleted.￼1011121314   Carolina.  South Carolina was -- would close that to          They did not, as Mr. Phillips suggested, Ithink in error -- they did not have access by stayingin the compact to the facility at Barnwell, South151617181920   the steps that were appropriate.  Because they did21   not have an obligation to fund this at whatever cost22   and because they were willing -- North Carolina's23   willingness to continue the same ratio of funding24   that had been a part of the process for the preceding25   8 years was not going to provide the sums necessary63North Carolina, so -- so --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  They had no benefit fromthe compact for those 2 years?          MR. DELLINGER:  But the steps NorthCarolina took for those last 19 months were exactlyAlderson Reporting Company1234567   impossibility, though.  I mean, the other side --8             MR. DELLINGER:  No, Justice Scalia.  I'm9   not arguing that it's impossible.  What -- what I'mOfficialto complete it, it would have been a waste and asquandering of the money of North Carolina'staxpayers and the Commission to take any steps thatrequired the expenditure --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you are not arguing￼10   arguing is that, if North Carolina had continued the11   level of funding, about $3 million a year, on -- on12   average, North Carolina had been contributing; the13   Commission, an average of $7 million had been -- if14   North Carolina had contributed that and some -- it15   would not have come close -- after the withdrawal of16   South Carolina, it would not have come close to17   providing the funds needed to complete the facility.18             Therefore, any funds expended would have19   been wasteful and inappropriate.20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dellinger, your21   brief makes -- I think the reply brief made some22   reference to North Carolina's attempting to get23   funding from another source after Barnwell -- the24   revenues from Barnwell were no longer available to25 it.64Alderson Reporting Company123456   proposals.  One proposal, for example, was to ask7   generators -- major generators to take an equity8   position in the authority, that the North Carolina9   General Assembly would continue its funding at theOfficial          I think, in -- in your reply brief, youmake some reference to an effort on North Carolina'spart to get -- what -- what was that effort?          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, the document I cited,December 13, '96, begins to set out some of the￼10   same rate it had.  Till the last day, North Carolina11   was willing to spend at that rate.12             JUSTICE BREYER:  But what -- what -- you13   just said -- I may not have misunderstood, but I14   thought you said, in response to Justice Scalia,15   that, during 1997 and '98, when he said why didn't16   you take appropriate steps, that you said you didn't17   do anything, and that was the appropriate step; is18   that right?  If you -- if you said that --19             MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.20             JUSTICE BREYER:  If I heard you correctly.21   All right.  But then it shows in the -- in the22   Special Master's report that, during that time, you23   received from the Commission funds over $7 million.24   So you may not have done anything, but you did take25   $7 million at that time from other people.  And so65Alderson Reporting Company 1   they are saying, fine, if you didn't take any 2   anything, didn't do anything, and that was the 3   appropriate step, why isn't it the appropriate step 4   now to give us the 7 million back? 5             MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Breyer, there is a 6   -- I -- there is a disconnect between when funds are 7   expended and when they are paid into.  There is some 8   deficit financing, so that the Commission's payment 9   in 1998 would have been to provide for expenditures10   that occurred earlier.  So there was no -- there was11   -- and there’s no suggestion that there is any money12   left over.  And -- and, how can I put it?  North13   Carolina doesn't -- never had that money.  It went toOfficial￼141516171819202122232425the authority in a separate and dedicated fund thatcould only be used for the authority’s purposes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did North Carolinacontinue to fund the authority during this interimperiod?          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, North Carolina spenthalf a million dollars a year to fund the authorityfor the remaining 19 months.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it didn't do nothingduring this period?          MR. DELLINGER:  That's correct.  And let meread you --66Alderson Reporting Company1             JUSTICE BREYER:  You say -- well -- in2   other words, North Carolina's money in '97 and '98,3   which was $4 million, went to pay for current4   expenditures during North -- during that year,5   '97/'98, but the Commission's money, which amounted6   to $7 million in that time, was not spent on current7   things?  It was rather a payment for things done in89 10 11 12 13the past?          This sounds not -- I'm not -- I mean,that's possible, but I just don't recall anythingthat suggests that.          MR. DELLINGER:  North Carolina's 2 millionalso would have been paid for past -- there was not14   $2 million spent on activities in 1998.  That's --15   that's the payment of prior bills.  There's -- these16171819202122232425--Official￼JUSTICE BREYER:  So the whole formula --          MR. DELLINGER:  These funds are coming intothe -- coming into the authority.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and the whole --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have the authoritystill in existence, right?          MR. DELLINGER:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't they have anyemployees?67Alderson Reporting Company1             MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, they do.  That's --2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So somebody has to be3   keeping the authority alive, right?  Who did that?4567   Assembly.  Here's the actual --89 10 11 12 13          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- wait, wait, wait.You said all the Commission funds were for priorexpenditures.          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, not necessarily.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.          MR. DELLINGER:  That is to say -- there wasOfficial          MR. DELLINGER:  The admission of -- theauthority with funds from -- that had come from theCommission and from the North Carolina General￼14   not $6 million expended during that period.  There’s15   not an exact match-up between that list of when16   payments were made and when expenditures were made.17   But the record showed that North Carolina spent about18   -- I believe about -- the authority spent about half19   a million dollars those last 19 months.20             Now, here's the -- here's the actual21   admission that North Carolina, quote, "did nothing."22   Paragraph -- this is at the Plaintiffs’ appendix 460.23   The admission request was:  Admit that North Carolina24   took no further steps after December 19th to ensure25   that an application for a license was filed.68Alderson Reporting Company 1             Response:  It is admitted that the 2   authority was deprived of funding upon notification 3   from the Commission in or around 1997 that the 4   Commission was terminating its transmittal to the 5   authority of portions of funds derived from fees and 6   surcharges imposed on generators.  It is further 7   admitted that the authority had justifiably relied -- 8   the North Carolina authority -- on the continued 9   provision of these funds in light of the Commission's10   previous words and actions.  For this reason, the11   authority did not thereafter take -- thereafter take12   additional steps to site --13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the offer --14   what about the offer that Mr. Phillips brought up,15   said Commission was ready to pay another $21 million,16   and there was going to be loans from the generators?17             MR. DELLINGER:  That proposal, first of18   all, left a significant shortfall, as the master19   found.  Even with that proposal, which North Carolina20   thought there were some legal problems with whether21   it would be -- that loans from private generators22   would allow bonding of the remaining financing -- the23   master says it was still a substantial gap left, even24   if North Carolina continued to pay the same amount of25 money.69Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1             So, with North Carolina willing to continue 2   to pay at the same rate it had for the previous 8 3   years, and the Commission unwilling or unable to do 4   so, it meant that that level of expenditure by North 5   Carolina would be a worthless expenditure of its 6   taxpayers' money and the Commission's money. 7             The Commission's position seems to be that 8   they should have taken steps just for the sake of 9   taking steps, like building half a bridge to nowhere,10   when you know that there’s no financing in sight.11   They could have withdrawn on December 19th, and they12   took exactly the steps that were appropriate, which13   is not to spend money that is futile and wasteful.14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you a15   question?  Is all of this money that has been spent16   or was spent up until 1999 -- has it been washed17   away?  Meaning -- and this may be what remains forOfficial￼18192021   Justice Sotomayor.  I would not assume there is any ­the unjust enrichment claims, but is there any valueleft to what occurred?MR. DELLINGER:  I don't know that there is,22232425   know, there’s no value to North Carolina.  There's no- any value.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There’s no facility --          MR. DELLINGER:  There’s no -- as far as I70Alderson Reporting Company1   -- in that sense.  The -- of the quasi-contractclaims.234567   simple question.  States, either at common law or8   constitutionally -- for these purposes, it doesn't9   matter which side of the fence you are on in Alden.          Could I turn, if I could, to theparticipation of the Commission, which we thinkraises a -- a substantial constitutional question?OfficialThis is actually, and should be, a very￼10   States have a right not to be subject to suit by11   parties that aren't the United States or a sister12   State, absent a valid abrogation.13             The Commission is neither.  It’s not a14   State, and that should be pure and simply the answer15   to the question.  The issues are whether somehow16   there should be an exception for a compact.  It17   should be treated like a State and allowed to sue;18   or, even if it's treated like any other private19   litigant, there is some kind of same-claims exception20   -- in fact, there is one case, Arizona, only, which21   really addresses this point -- there should be a22   same-claims exception.23             First of all, with respect to whether the24   compact ought to be able to sue as if it were a25   State, I think that’s resolved -- and this Court,71Alderson Reporting Company 1   when it rejected a compact suit in number 131 -- of ­ 2   - the Commission suit, might have thought the same -- 3   by the Hess case.  It says that compacts cannot claim 4   sovereign immunity.  If they don't have the dignity 5   or status to claim sovereign immunity, they surely 6   ought not be able to affirmatively pierce the 7   sovereign immunity of something that is undoubtedly a 8   State.  They are not -- 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was in -- Hess10   came up in a different posture.  It wasn't -- I think11121314   they are at all comparable.  This is a case of does15   the -- does the authority have standing or -- toOfficial￼-- it was an attempt to sue the authority, wasn't it?          MR. DELLINGER:  That is -- that is correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So I don't think that16   bring the claim.17             MR. DELLINGER:  You could distinguish them18   -- but -- distinguish the two situations.  But that19   would cut in favor of this situation.  You might20   think that a compact has the right to sue as if it21   were a State, another State, a State, and still think22   that -- you might think it had sovereign immunity,23   but not that it could bring a suit against a State.24   But you certainly wouldn't think that if it's not25   even entitled to invoke sovereign immunity on its own72Alderson Reporting Company1234   treating a compact as if it were a State.  That is a5 6 7 8 9slippery road --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why not?  I mean,if it’s totally a creature of States -- that’s allit’s -- there’s no other shareholders, nobody in thepicture, just -- they are all States that create it?10111213141516   State, who vote individually and are not bound.  For17   example, the representatives from Georgia and18   Mississippi on the Commission voted to bring this19   litigation against North Carolina.  The States of20   Georgia and Mississippi did not decide to join.  They21   -- they voted differently from where their States22 are.23             And -- and one of the things about the --24   the Commission doesn't have the same constraints that25   a State has.  The attorney general of Alabama might73Officialbehalf, that it ought to be able to bring it.          But no matter.  There’s no good argument.With or without Hess, there is no good argument for￼          MR. DELLINGER:  The States do not controlthis private -- this separate entity.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They create it, though.They -- the States create the --          MR. DELLINGER:  The States created it.  Itis run by a group of commissioners, two from eachAlderson Reporting Company 1   think long and hard before submitting an onerous 2   document discovery request on a sister State and 3   making that kind of scorched-earth litigation a 4   practice.  Something that’s not a State doesn't have 5   those constraints. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose we 7   think that the same State -- or the same-claim rule 8   applies, and that if the Commission is asserting the 9   same claim as the State, that then it can sue.10   Suppose that's the rule.  Are these the same claims?11             MR. DELLINGER:  They are -- first of all,12   they are not the same claims.  The States who gave13   $25,000 are trying to claim that the Commission14   either is their agent or that they can bring a suit15   that restitution ought to be made to the Commission,16   that is a -- the short answer is those are different17   routes.  They are not the same claims, but --18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can -- how could19   they not be, Mr. Dellinger?  There’s only one20   complaint, and that complaint is on behalf of all the21   Plaintiffs, not --22             MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  But you would have23   the same last line of a complaint if 1 million people24   joined the State who brought an antitrust suit25   against another State.  It is simply that -- award74Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the Plaintiffs such damages as this Court deems justand proper.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there’s no discreteclaim made by the Commission as distinguished fromSouth Carolina.          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, the Commission ismaking a straight-up restitution claim, which, as the-- the entity that provided the funds, it does not.101112131415   the case that they will wind up being identical.  Mr.16   Phillips says -- counsel for the Plaintiffs said they17   would not concede that they would not, at the end of18   the day, forgo any claim on behalf of the -- of the19   States that the Commission didn't have.Official￼          But let me say why I think the separate and-- even if the claims were identical, we don't know,at this point, that they will wind up beingidentical, and States shouldn't have to litigateuntil we find out.The master just says it's not necessarily20             But, most importantly, there is Alden.21   Alden makes this a civil case because Alden says that22   private suits against non-consenting States present23   the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive24   processes of judicial tribunals.25             If you allow another party in that's not a75Alderson Reporting Company 1   State, you are subjecting a State to all of the 2   discovery, all of the different theories, all of the 3   depositions, all of the document requests.  A sister 4   State may, in its attorney general's office, think 5   twice about doing that. A private litigant will not. 6             So I think this case is that -- I believe 7   if you didn't want to overrule Arizona, you could say 8   it's a case where the United States brought a case in 9   its role as trustee for the Indian tribes and the10   tribes themselves were allowed to intervene, and they11   were, therefore, virtually one and the same party.12   And you wouldn't need to overrule it.  I don't think,13   if it stands for any broader principle, it can14   survive Alden v. Maine.15             Now, if the Commission is out, then we16   think there is -- and if you agree that there was no17   breach of contract, then I think the Court should18   direct the dismissal of the quasi-contract claims19   because only the States will be left as a party.20             And those claims -- quasi-contract claims21   of restitution, it’s -- they are claims that are22   governed by the subject matter of the compact between23   the States, and as to parties to the compact, there24   can’t be any such claims, and I think that should be25   the end of it.76Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911   fundamental one that Mr. Dellinger relies upon is the12   notion that this $80 million was not the money of the13   compact States, and he -- he keeps saying that14   repeatedly -- you know, based solely on the fact that15   the money doesn't come through the treasury of the16 States.17             But he ignores, on 12A, article 4(H)(2)(b),18   which says, with respect to the levying of the19   special fees or surcharges, which was the basis upon20   which the entirety of the $80 million comes, that21   this must represent the financial commitments of all22   party States to the Commission.23             It was the understanding that, in24   exercising the authority to levy these amounts of25   money in order to generate this, that that was the77Thank you.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.     Dellinger.               Mr. Phillips, have you 10 minutes.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS                  ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS               MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice.               I would like to respond to a number of the10   points that have been made.  It seems to me the mostOfficial￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   States' money, all of the States' money, and 2   ultimately, if this Court would have determined that3 the money -- 4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That provision just 5   says the States don't have to give anything more than 6   that, that that's what satisfies whatever obligations 7   they may or may have.  But where does it say that 8   money belongs to them? 9             MR. PHILLIPS:  It says each State hosting ­10   - you know, "shall annually levy surcharges."  The11   total of those surcharges represent the financial12   commitments of all of the party States to the13   Commission.  That seems to me to say that it is the21 22 23 24 25used to ask North Carolina to go forward to site afacility.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  I don't -- I don'tunderstand that.          MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.78Official￼14151617   not the money of the generators.  It's the money of18   the compact States that's being used for whatever19   purpose is necessary in order to fulfill the overall20   objectives of the compact.  In this context, it wascommitment of the party States that's -- that's beingprovided for in that context.It's not the money of the Commission.  It'sAlderson Reporting Company1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It never passes through2   the States, and this provision just waves a magic3   wand and says that it represents the financial4   commitments of all party States to the Commission.5   What proportion from each State?  Do we know?6 7 8 9          MR. PHILLIPS:  We don't know, and wewouldn't -- and the truth is, at the end --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think all this means isthat that is the only financial commitment that theStates are obliged to -- to make.          MR. PHILLIPS:  I think there’s no questionthat it -- that it can be read as -- as saying that,which, of course, then tells you, if it's not theCommission's responsibility and it's not the States’responsibility, then it was clearly, from the outsetand has always been, North Carolina's.101112131415161718   Scalia.  I think it actually tells you, as an19202122232425agreement among all of the party States to thiscompact, that this is the money of the States, andultimately --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can't be the money ofthe States if you can't say how much of it belongs toeach State.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, no.  You --79Official￼But I think it goes beyond that, JusticeAlderson Reporting Company1234   to allocate it.  It seems to me that maybe -- that5   either the Commission, based on the vote of thesense. 6   parties -- the party States, could either allocate it 7   back on a pro rata basis, or they can do it on the 8   basis of the percentage of the -- of the waste that 9   was used in any particular fund.10             There’s no specific provision on that, but11   it seems to me that doesn't detract, Justice Scalia,12   from the fundamental point that what the compact13   members agreed upon was that this money would be the14   money of all of the States.  And, therefore, we can'tOfficialJUSTICE SCALIA:  That just doesn't make anyMR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there would be a way￼15161718192021   this particular context.  The -- immediately, it22   would be South Carolina, and ultimately, then --23   assuming North Carolina or another State were to site24   a facility, then, from there on, that money would25   continue to be their commitment.80keep it as a Commission.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the money that’s --but the money that is talked about in that section,as I read it, that’s money that would be generatedafter the facility was completed.MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, South Carolina, inAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you’re saying themoney generated by the South Carolina facility wasthe money of the compact members?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And that was the moneythat was given to North Carolina?Official          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, because the compactagreed among themselves, as part of this agreement,that the -- that they would have authority to imposethose surcharges on the generators, as they broughtthe money in.￼10111213   those States couldn't take the money.  They couldn'tCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But then -- but14151617181920   their membership, they certainly did.  If the States21   agreed to disband the compact and the -- the22   Commission disappears and there’s $80 million in the23   pot, that money's going somewhere.  It's not staying24   in -- it may get paid for legal fees, but other than25 that --81say, I want my share?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think they couldhave, actually.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You are saying itwas their money, but they had no access to it.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no, but I -- throughAlderson Reporting Company1             JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it work?  I mean,2   how does it work?  The-- there's a -- there’s a plant34567   and now they are charged something.  And is the fee89 10 11and special surcharge, which this refers to, thetotal charge?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.Officialin South Carolina, and a truck comes up filled withradioactive waste out of Georgia.MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.JUSTICE BREYER:  And they go to a booth,￼               JUSTICE BREYER:  Total charge.  And what12   does that amount to, primarily?  Do we have any idea1314151617   how they did it.  But, anyway, there’s a charge.  Say1819202122232425it's $1,000, or maybe it's $10,000.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, that would be a bithigh.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so the truck companyhas to pay $10,000 to the authority.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, the generator does.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And they are saying herethat that $10,000 represents --82on a typical --          MR. PHILLIPS:  You mean, in terms as apercentage off the -- off the normal charges?          JUSTICE BREYER:  No -- well, I don't knowAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. PHILLIPS:  Represents the commitment ofthe States.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the financialcommitment of all party States to the Commission.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And all that'ssaying is that that money, even though that -- Imean, the alternative way to do it, obviously --          JUSTICE BREYER:  That money might -- seemsto come from a private company.13141516171819   used it in this context.  But that's the basic point,20   Justice Breyer.  If they didn't have this provision,21   you would -- you might assume it was the generators’22   money or somebody else's money.23             The whole point of this provision was to24   say these moneys, which can only be levied because of25   the compact and the Commission's authority, remain83Official￼101112   company.  It goes to the -- it goes to the CommissionMR. PHILLIPS:  Right.JUSTICE BREYER:  It comes from a private-- it goes to South Carolina --          MR.

PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's nothing elsethat would make it --          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I’m relying on thisprovision of the compact that says it is the --Officialthe responsibility of the States and, ultimately, tomy mind at least, would clearly go back to them.Justice Breyer, I wanted to answer your￼10111213141516171819202122232425   have to address that.  Is there any other theory that          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I just understand-- and I don't know if I am missing something -- yourtheory that this belongs to the States reliesexclusively on either an agency or an ownershiptheory as alternatives?          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- that's -- ifwe disagree with that --          MR. PHILLIPS:  Then we have an agencytheory as well.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And then we84Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9would give the States the right to make the claimsthe Commission is making?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, yes --          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For the return of the$80 million.          MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I think that the Court-- yes, I think the Court would still have theauthority, even in dealing with what is theappropriate rule of restitution, because we are too10   far away from that at this stage.  We're not -- we're11121314151617181920   you do do that.  I mean, when the Court in Kansas v.21   Colorado was trying --Carolina breached the compact, it ought to try tofind a reasonable way to remedy that particularproblem, even if the technical standards didn'tapply.          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we don't do that,what are you left with?Official￼not there.          But I think, if the Court finds that NorthMR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no, Justice Sotomayor,22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I already posed a23   hypothetical.  Don't -- if we don't, what is left of24   this case?2585MR. PHILLIPS:  It seems to me the CourtAlderson Reporting Company 1   still has the authority, in deciding what is the 2   appropriate standard of restitution in a problem as 3   unique as this one, to do what it did in Kansas v. 4   Colorado, which is to say:  How do we measure the 5   damages to this party?  Let's look at what the injury 6   was to the farmers who were completely unrelated to 7   it.  They clearly wouldn't -- they weren't parties to 8   that litigation, and the Court said that's a 9   perfectly legitimate way to figure out the right10   damages.  So I think we would still have an argument11   that you -- that the Court would have the authority12   to grant that form of restitution under these13   circumstances.14             Mr. Dellinger spent a lot of time on what15   strikes me as sort of a complete fantasy with respect16   to the funding situation that North Carolina faced.17   You know, once South Carolina left, to be sure, we18   lost the ability to take money and help North19   Carolina.  But the notion that North Carolina, if it20   had completed this facility, was not going to have a21   license to print money in the -- in going forward and22   that funding wouldn't have been available back in23   those days is not in the record.  And, frankly, it's24   completely counterintuitive, because they have a25   monopoly.  That's what the compact specifically86Official￼Alderson Reporting Company 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   the -- the facility's completed.  It's clear they are 9   going to have to -- they are going to be charging10   more than South Carolina, which is a lower cost11   facility, having been in existence for longer.  Why12   wouldn't everybody get out?13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Because the risk that South14   Carolina is going to pull up stakes and stop because15   it's been making that noise from the beginning --16   that was the reason for the crisis.  Washington and17   South Carolina said:  We're not going to take every18   other -- every other State's waste, and we are19   getting out of this business.  So the risk you would20   take in jumping out in the six months is that you21   then find out at the back end you have no place to22   dispose of your waste.23             So the reality is, they had -- all of the24   incentives to go forward existed as much in 1997 as25   they did in 1995, as they did in 1999.  The only87          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The ability to withdrawterminates upon completion of the facility?Officialprovides for them, is the monopoly to be able tocontrol the fees that -- on these particular wastes.Yes, Your Honor?MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Six months afterwards.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Six months afterwards.  So￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   thing that's fundamental here is they had a 2   responsibility not just to do what was appropriate; 3   it was to do what was appropriate to get a license, 4   and that's what they never did.  They walked away. 5   They took no action.  Trying to negotiate funding in 6   the abstract doesn't have anything to do with moving 7   forward to get a license.  On that score, the 8   authority shut down and closed. 9             Justice Sotomayor, you asked:  Is there any10   benefit that remains?  Well, the reality is, geology11   studies and hydrology studies that get done, those12   things don't change for a billion years.  So everyOfficial￼13141516171819202122232425one of those studies that was done is going to bejust as valid today 12 years later, although I dothink the right way to analyze this is not in termsof 12 years later, but what would have happened atthe time.          I thank Your Honors.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.The case is submitted.          (Whereupon,
