United States.Mr. Heft.ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR.,ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. HEFT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:William Freeman's plea agreement, hispresentence report, and the sentencing record all show that his term of imprisonment was based on a crack cocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. This case asked the Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing court accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule 11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). We submit thatMr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2) sentence reduction for several reasons.First, under the ordinary definition of "based upon" and in the context of this particular statute, since the subsequently lowered guideline was used to determine Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment,3Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently2 lowered guideline.3 Second, the categorical ban on eligibility4 adopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the5 Government frustrates the purpose underlying section6 (c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the7 statute, of the rule, and under the terms of8 Mr. Freeman's plea agreement.9 Third, a record-based analysis that reviews10 the plea agreement, the presentence report, and the11 sentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence12 is -- is best suited to correctly implement section13 (c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports14 the conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed15 based on a retroactively lowered guideline. The -- the16 Sixth Circuit -­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we issue an18 opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the19 statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative20 history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on21 each of those or -- or not? In other words, does22 everything that goes into the final determination, would23 you say that determination is based on each of those24 factors individually?25 MR. HEFT: Yes. Certainly, it is based -­4￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the determination certainly would be based on the2 statute, Your Honor, but, as we've -- we've argued in3 our brief, we've asked the Court to take what we believe4 to be a record-based analysis and look at -- look at the5 record in this case, look at the terms of the plea6 agreement, look at the -­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. My -­8 MR. HEFT: I'm sorry.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think my question10 goes in a different direction. This plea agreement, I11 think, could be said to be based on the sentencing12 guidelines, but it is also based on the agreement. In13 other words, the combination of the two of them is what14 gives you the -- the sentence. So how can you say it's15 based on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not16 have been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement?17 Probably wouldn't have been.18 MR. HEFT: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't19 believe that that's mutually exclusive. A sentence can20 be a guideline -- a sentence based on the guidelines,21 and it can be a sentence based on a C plea agreement.22 JUSTICE ALITO: You quote one definition23 of -- the noun "base" in your brief uses a point from24 which something can develop, but you omit another25 standard definition of the term, the principal element5￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its2 fundamental part. Why do you do that?3 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think4 the dictionary definition that we've given encompasses5 the definition that Your Honor has just -- just6 described. The -- and our position -­7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's two -- there8 are two different definitions. One is something that9 provides a starting point for analysis. The other is10 the fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests.11 MR. HEFT: Well -- well, our contention12 is-­13 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if you use the latter14 definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental15 here, the agreement between the parties or the16 sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the17 starting point for the analysis of the sentence by18 the -- by the district court.19 MR. HEFT: Justice Alito, that's correct.20 The guidelines certainly were the starting point, but21 they were also the principal foundation of this22 agreement because what the agreement is -­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it enough for you24 to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based25 on, something could be based on several things, and one6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 of them is the guidelines that then existed?2 MR. HEFT: Certainly. Certainly. And this3 -- this plea agreement reflects that it was based on the4 guidelines. If you -­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then are you6 saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he7 was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns?8 Would you be willing to say that? In other words,9 everything -- your position, it seems to me, could be10 criticized for saying everything that contributes to the11 final 106 months, that that sentence is based on every12 one of those things -­13 MR. HEFT: Well -­￼14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which makes the15 -- which makes the statutory language largely mute on16 this.17MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, the -- the based on a number of guidelines. Each -- no based on just one guideline, as this plea18 sentence is19 sentence is20 agreement reflects. It's based on a compilation of21 guidelines. It's -- it's based on the crack guideline,22 and as prior -­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also24 based on things that are not reflected in the25 guidelines. You've got a particular U.S. attorney who7Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes2 than another one. The fact that you got the minimum3 under the guidelines might be based on that. It's based4 on the fact that this person felt he could handle 1065 months in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever6 the top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline7 calculation?8 MR. HEFT: It would have been 117 months.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he figures it's10 better for me to get -- it's based on his decision that11 I -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117.12 MR. HEFT: Well, certainly there are a13 number of factors that go into plea bargaining and14 negotiation, but what -- I think what the court has to15 look at is what is said in that plea agreement. And I16 think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out a minute ago, the17 definition of "based on" -- if a guideline sentence18 is -- if a sentence is based in part on the guidelines,19 that would be adequate under the -- under section -­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What sentence would21 he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the22 guidelines, no plea agreement?23 MR. HEFT: He would have got the -- he would24 have received the same sentence, Your Honor.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, how do8￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425we know that?MR. HEFT: Well -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The guidelines give you a range. The judge might have given him 117 months.MR. HEFT: But -- but the plea agreement here was for the bottom of the guidelines. The parties calculated -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. I'm putting aside the plea agreement. What would he have gotten under the sentencing guidelines? We --we don't know, right?MR. HEFT: It would have been left -­left -- well, assume it depends upon the nature of the plea, Your Honor. You're talking -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no plea. He is convicted at trial.MR. HEFT: It would be somewhere within that guideline range. That's correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how can you say that this is based on the guideline range when the guideline range would not have been determinative?MR. HEFT: Well -- well, we're looking -­ we're looking at the content of the plea agreement, Your Honor. The -- the plea agreement says -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know, but my9Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425hypothetical is in a different context.MR. HEFT: But even -- even at that, YourHonor, if -- that sentence ultimately is going to be based on a guideline range, and if that guideline range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, then the -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could you -­ maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the situations you don't think would be based on the guidelines.The Solicitor General claims that since every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline calculation as a starting point for departure and/or consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea agreement would be considered based on. Are you taking that position?MR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. Absolutely not.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I'll give you a couple of examples, but you give me more. Would a plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -­ is that based on the guideline?MR. HEFT: Possibly, Your Honor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And how about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the10Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425range, whichever word you want to use?MR. HEFT: Your Honor, the -- the SentencingCommission, in 1B1.10 note 3, says that a below-guideline sentence can be based on the guidelines.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there -- the Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any situation that you're claiming is not based on?MR. HEFT: Oh -- oh, no, Your Honor. There are -- there are C pleas.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me the examples.MR. HEFT: All right. Well, first of all, we've cited cases in our brief where circuit courts have determined that a C plea was not based on the guidelines. But let me give you another example.Let's just assume the guideline range is something like 151 to 188 months, and then -- but the parties agree to a sentence of 60 months, and they do that for several reasons. First of all, maybe the defendant is elderly. Maybe the defendant has serious medical conditions. Maybe the defendant has -- was sexually abused as a child. If those are the factors, if that's the reason why the defendant got that -­ received that 60-month sentence, that sentence is not based on the guideline range.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't the11Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting2 point for analysis? Isn't the district court obligated,3 and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to4 go through the guidelines calculation before the5 sentence is imposed? So you start out with the -- the6 guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you7 mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you8 depart downward.9 MR. HEFT: That -- that's true. The -- the10 guidelines would be the starting point of any11 negotiation, but -­12 JUSTICE ALITO: So why wouldn't that be13 based on the guidelines? Just because there's such a14 big downward departure?15 MR. HEFT: It -- Your Honor, it would not be16 based on the guidelines if those other factors were the17 motivating reason for the imposition of the sentence.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, I don't understand19 that. Don't the guidelines provide for departures?20 MR. HEFT: They do, Your Honor.21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- and aren't you22 giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as23 is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and24 you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special25 case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence? Just12￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to accept a C type agreement.MR. HEFT: If the parties can show that the sentence is tied to the guidelines.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could it not be? Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to apply the guideline? If he doesn't say that, isn't he applying the guideline?MR. HEFT: In that instance, he would be -­ he would be applying it.JUSTICE BREYER: Whether he gives the specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or whether he says, I have a special case and I depart under section 5 of the guidelines. Both of those are guideline sentences, aren't they?MR. HEFT: If the -- if the judge were to take -- were to actually apply those guidelines and say, based on that guideline, I am going to depart, that sentence is based on the guidelines.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So from what base does a judge depart downward? From the crack cocaine range or from the downward departure range?MR. HEFT: I think it would depend on the nature of the agreement, Your Honor. It may very well13Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 depend on -- the judge may depart from the crack2 cocaine.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So aren't you just4 asking us to permit district court judges to make up5 their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would6 have done in the absence of a higher range? And don't7 we fall prey to sort of just asking district court8 judges to create their own agreements?9 MR. HEFT: No -- no, Your Honor. I don't10 believe that's -- that's not what we are asking the11 Court to do at all.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heft, are you relying13 on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said,14 specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence15 determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the16 judge says that he was adopting the probation report and17 the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so18 both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a19 determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge20 says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you21 your sentence.22 So the hypotheticals we're talking about are23 quite far afield from where you have a specific24 statement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that25 the guidelines are being applied.14￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. HEFT: That is correct, Your Honor, and2 that's why we've asked the Court not to take a3 categorical approach to this issue, but to take either a4 case-by-case approach or a record-based analysis, to5 allow the district judge to determine, as Justice6 Ginsburg pointed out, what our -- you know, what is the7 --89 those kindsJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Heft, would you require of statements in the agreement or in the order to satisfy the standard? Suppose10 colloquy in11 those statements just didn't exist.12 MR. HEFT: That's certainly problematic,13 Justice Kagan. If those -- if there was nothing in that14 plea agreement to tie the sentence to the -- the15 sentence -- the agreed sentence to the guidelines, that16 certainly would be problematic.17 But that doesn't resolve the issue one way18 or the other, because the judge would have to consider19 the presentence report to see if there's a connection or20 correlation between the agreed sentence and the21 guidelines, and also the judge could look at the guilty22 plea colloquy and sentencing transcript to see if the23 attorneys actually expressed their intent about where24 this sentence came from.25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Heft, that seems very15￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 complicated. You have to look at everything and you're2 not giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when3 you -- when you see these things. I mean, this sort of4 case-by-case, all-things-considered approach just seems5 as though you're going to get a lot of inconsistent6 decisions.7 MR. HEFT: Respectfully, Your Honor, I8 disagree. I think this is what district judges do all9 the time, not just in the context of a C plea, but a B10 plea as well. They have to look at the nature of the11 plea agreement. They have to look at the PSR. They12 have to look at the sentencing transcript to -- to13 determine whether or not the defendant is -- is eligible14 for that sentence reduction.15 So judges are doing this routinely. They're16 doing this -­17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in every case, they18 have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the19 parties have the opportunity to object to the20 calculation, right?21 MR. HEFT: Yes, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE ALITO: So what does paragraph 12 of23 the plea agreement contribute here, other than with24 respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that25 we're talking about? It doesn't seem to me to add16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 anything substantively.2 MR. HEFT: I -- well, Your Honor, I think it3 does, Justice Alito. I think it does add -- it adds4 substance, and it adds meaning to that plea agreement5 because in paragraph 11 where the parties very6 meticulously go through the offense level, tie that to7 the guidelines, and then -- then they state in paragraph8 12, the -- the defendant agrees to be sentenced pursuant9 to the -- to the guidelines. That's very clear that the10 review in the guideline calculation is what the sentence11 is based on. And -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can a -- can a sentencing13 judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in14 approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides15 for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives16 no -- no particular reason for that? Would that be17 appealed as an invalid sentence?18 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, under -- under19 section 3742, the government could -- could appeal an20 incorrect application of the guidelines if that's what21 Your Honor is referring to.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now you're talking24 about a plea agreement, which the government has25 consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -­17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if2 you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll3 charge a small amount -- value of the drug. Was there4 any of that in -- in this plea?5 MR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. Mr. Freeman6 pleaded guilty to all charges in the indictment. The7 parties stipulated the amount of -- of drugs that were8 found on his person when he was arrested. So there were9 no dismissed charges, no amended charges in this plea10 agreement.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let -- let me ask my12 question a different way. In deciding whether to13 approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to14 consider whether it is an application of the guidelines,15 whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines,16 whether it does not take into account valid reasons for17 departure from the guidelines?18 MR. HEFT: Yes. The judge would have to19 consider the guidelines. Right.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then, if that's the case,21 then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines,22 every single one, because the judge always has to23 consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea24 agreement.2518￼MR. HEFT: Well, Justice Scalia,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 consideration of the guidelines alone is not enough to2 determine whether or not that sentence is actually based3 on them.4 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand why you5 resist that. I mean, that's precisely what the6 guidelines say. The only ones that aren't guideline7 sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an8 agreement to dismiss. But a type B, type C -- the9 guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what10 you do. Judge, you look and see if the guidelines11 sentence is12 is, you can1314 So -- so why do you resist that conclusion?15 MR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, the judge17 now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, "vary,"18 whatever that word -- technical word, is -- "vary." He19 can say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all.20 But if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that21 what they tell him to do? I've always thought that.22 You may tell me I'm mistaken.23 MR. HEFT: They -- they do; obviously they24 do consider the guidelines, but then the other question25 is whether or not the sentence is based on those19there. Is it a guideline sentence? If it approve it. If it isn't, you can't.I mean, that's my reading of what it says.￼Alderson Reporting Company21 explain why 222324 point that Justice Sotomayor made -­25 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.Official - Subject to Final Review1 guidelines -­2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could it not be,3 since the judge has no power if he is to apply the4 guideline -­5 MR. HEFT: Well -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: -- to accept any agreement7 other than agreement that corresponds with the8 guideline? That's what it says. It says the court9 should accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the10 specific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied11 either that it is within the applicable guideline range12 or if it's based on a departure under the guidelines.13 That seems to me what it says. Isn't that what it says?14 MR. HEFT: That is what it says, Your Honor,15 but -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then if that's so,17 every sentence is -- you're going to say no?18 MR. HEFT: No.19 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I thought that was20 helping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and￼that is.(Laughter.)MR. HEFT: Your Honor, to go back to the20Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HEFT: -- with the hypotheticals, there still can be C pleas that are not based on theguidelines.JUSTICE BREYER: How?MR. HEFT: Well, the example -­JUSTICE BREYER: Give me an example.MR. HEFT: Well, the example that I gave --I gave previously.JUSTICE BREYER: What?MR. HEFT: There's a guideline range. JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. HEFT: But the judge bases his decision,his or her decision, solely on other -- factors other than the guidelines. As I mentioned earlier -­ JUSTICE BREYER: Are we supposed topsychoanalyze the judge? The judge says on his writing, checks the box: This is a guideline sentence. It is robbery. It is precisely within the robbery range. But I--Iamgoingtogiveitthelowendoftherange because I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and family and so forth.Okay? You're saying that isn't based on the guideline. No? Okay. Is that the point?MR. HEFT: Well, it depends what the judge does at sentencing, Your Honor.21Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: What he does is he applies the guideline sentence. He has to do that. Now, within that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he got the information. He says, I am satisfied itapplies -- done.Now are we supposed to look further and say what his true reason is? Is that what you're saying?MR. HEFT: It would -- Your Honor, I would submit it would depend on the nature of the -- the plea agreement, whether or not that sentence is -- is actually based -- going to be based on the guidelines.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Incidentally, and it sort of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea agreement? In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply to the application of the guidelines when a judge is -­ is approving a plea agreement? Do you think the guidelines are mandatory in that situation?MR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. They're -­JUSTICE BREYER: You were -- you were just at the very point when we decided Booker, is that right? It was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July 2005 and we came out with Booker in -­MR. HEFT: I believe it was March of 2005.22Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company3 agree; it's4 know how to5 6much more complicated after Booker. I don't treat yours.MR. HEFT: That's true.JUSTICE BREYER: It's on the cusp.7Official - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's quite2 possible the judge wasn't totally -- but I mean -- IJUSTICE ALITO: What if there had been8 evidence here of that? What if the government in9 connection with this plea agreement had dropped counts10 or had decided not to seek a superseding indictment11 adding counts? Would -- would the situation be the12 same?13 MR. HEFT: Yes. Your Honor, I think it14 would; it would be the same. Because the court would15 have to look at, again, what the terms of the plea -­16 plea agreement was and what the parties determined.17 Now, the -- I think what I should emphasize is that18 we're only talking about eligibility here; and if -- if19 those -- if those concessions that the government has20 made would -- would perhaps result or at least in the21 government's view, result in an unjustified windfall,22 that -- that's -- that is not a critical factor in￼23 determining24 determining25eligibility. That's not factor at all in eligibility.That could come into play after eligibility23Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is determined and the judge -- district judge determines whether or how much.JUSTICE ALITO: How would that possibly work? Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65 months; drops count 2, which would have increased the guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65 months and we're going to drop count 2. All right?MR. HEFT: Yes.JUSTICE ALITO: And then the guideline for that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove count 2?MR. HEFT: No. No. No. No. It would -­ JUSTICE ALITO: How would it work?MR. HEFT: It would work -- assuming thatthe defendant is eligible, the case is remanded to district court.JUSTICE ALITO: Right.MR. HEFT: As in this case, there would be a recalculation of the guidelines to determine if the -­JUSTICE ALITO: Right.MR. HEFT -- guideline range would be24Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 reduced, and then, as the judge said in this case said,2 if you have objections, let me know; file your3 objections. That's where the government could file -­4 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. The government files5 its objections and says, well, we dropped count 2. And6 the defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2.7 MR. HEFT: That's -- that's up to the8 district judge's discretion, whether or not to -- to9 reduce that -- that amended guideline sentence.10 JUSTICE ALITO: How is the judge going to11 decide that?12 MR. HEFT: Well, the -- I think that's13 something that district judges decide every day, whether14 or not -- because the judge presumably has -- has15 been -- is familiar with the case, with the presentence16 report, with the terms of the original plea agreement,17 with the facts of the case; and the -- and the judge can18 make an assessment based on those factors whether or not19 the sentence reduction should be granted and, if so, how20 much of a reduction should be granted.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But Justice Alito's22 hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even23 though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may24 do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the25 judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's25￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 no reason to believe that the government is interested2 in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in3 putting this person away for a certain amount of time,4 especially when another count is dropped and the5 government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it6 if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years. But if7 the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he8 is only going for a year and a half or a year, the9 agreement might not have been concluded. So it10 really -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both11 parties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed,12 the agreement changes.13 MR. HEFT: Well -- well, the agreement14 certainly has been -- was modified by the amended15 guideline, and that's where the district judge has to16 exercise his or her discretion whether or not to grant17 that reduction.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in that event, the19 sweet part would be open to reconsideration too. I20 mean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered21 guideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts22 are dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was23 agreed upon. You would have to reopen the whole thing.24 MR. HEFT: No, Your -- no, Justice Ginsburg.25 I don't think you'd have to reopen the case. Again, I26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 think the judge could look at the presentence report,2 the government could make its objections saying here's3 why we gave that particular sentence, and the judge4 could exercise his or her discretion to say whether or5 not the defendant is going to get that sentence6 reduction.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.8 MR. HEFT: Thank you, Your Honor.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon.10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON11 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT12 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it13 please the Court:14 When a criminal defendant and the government15 agree to a specific sentence and that agreement is16 binding on the sentencing judge by virtue of Rule17 11(c)(1)(C), the resulting sentence is based on the18 parties' agreement. It is not based on the advisory19 guideline range that would otherwise have been used at20 sentencing, even if the sentence corresponds to that21 range.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, here the agreement24 at various points says that the parties agree on the25 calculation of the guideline. I think it's paragraph 1127￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 and 12. They say that the sentence is according to the2 guidelines. So there's reference to the guidelines3 throughout, and the court made the guidelines4 calculation.5 MR. GANNON: The court certainly made the -­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me fair7 under the statute to say that it is based on the8 guidelines.9 MR. GANNON: Well, the question -­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there are other11 provisions in the agreement you might argue about.12 MR. GANNON: Well, I think the statutory13 question here isn't just whether the sentence is based14 on the guidelines. The language under 3582(c)(2) is15 whether the defendant was sentenced to a term of16 imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has17 subsequently been lowered by the Commission. So it's18 not just whether the guidelines played a role; it's19 whether this particular sentencing range was what was20 driving the sentence.21 And, Justice Kennedy, you point out pages22 25, 26 of the plea agreement in the Joint Appendix. And23 I think it's instructive that the agreement deals24 differently with the fine component, as Justice Alito25 referred to earlier, than it does with the term of28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 imprisonment. At the bottom of page 25, the agreement2 says that a fine will be at the lowest end of the3 applicable guideline range. And then if you go over to4 pages 27 and 28 in paragraph 11, that's where the5 guideline calculation occurs. And notice it is an6 incomplete calculation. The parties don't actually come7 up with a final calculation because they don't come up8 with a criminal history. They don't -­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they do come up with10 a recommendation, which is three levels below the11 otherwise applicable guideline.12 MR. GANNON: They -- they come up with a13 recommendation for purposes of determining the offense14 level, the base offense level of 22 and then reduced to15 19.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but that's all based17 on the guidelines.18 MR. GANNON: Well, that aspect is based on19 the guidelines, but then the guideline application20 computation is incomplete because the next paragraph,21 paragraph B, says we aren't agreed on what the criminal22 history is going to be. And to the next paragraph,23 paragraph C specifically says that the foregoing24 statements of applicability of sections of the25 sentencing guidelines are not binding upon the court.29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 The defendant understands the court will independently2 calculate the guidelines at sentencing; that is -­3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that doesn't mean that4 the court can't base its conclusion on his5 independent -- on its independent judgment on the6 guideline.7 MR. GANNON: Well, I think what I'm trying8 to say, Justice Kennedy, is the agreement expressly9 contemplates that the judge needs to determine the10 applicable guideline range for purposes of determining11 what the fine will be. And that's different from the12 way the plea agreement deals with the term of13 imprisonment because if we go back to page 26, it does14 not tie the -- the term of imprisonment to a guideline15 range. That's completely different from the way it16 deals with a fine. It specifically says there's an17 agreement that the sentence of 106 months of18 incarceration is the appropriate amount. And so that19 happens to have been at the bottom end of the guideline20 range that would have been applicable if the parties'21 agreement -- if the parties' prediction about the likely22 criminal history calculation turned out to be the right23 one.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're talking about25 what "based on" means, and that's an important part of30￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425your argument. If I could just, while I've got you, jump to this question of what happens on remand if you lose the case. On remand, I take it, you're not bound by the agreement because of the last -­MR. GANNON: Well, I -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the last of section 24 says the defendant argues for any sentence other than the one to which he has agreed to and breached the agreement.MR. GANNON: Well, at that point the remedy for the breach would be that the United States is relieved of its obligations under the agreement.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- what wouldthat mean?MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's -- that's part of the problem in a case like this where there was a specific sentence agreement, that it's impossible for government to get back the things that it gave up at the time, that were agreed to under -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's got guilty pleas on all of the counts. We know that.MR. GANNON: Well, but it also -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your position, in your view, would the government be able to take the position that the guilty pleas stay in place, but it now wants31Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425maximum? would -­MR. GANNON: Well, I think that -- thatJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maximum guidelines.Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. GANNON: I don't think that the 3582(c)(2) contemplates that the sentence will be increased. The only thing, as the court -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, except that the agreement does. The agreement relieves you.MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's if -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of any obligation. I see what you mean.MR. GANNON: Now that the sentence has become final, I think 3582(c)(2) has opened a narrow window for ways in which the otherwise final sentence could be modified. It only contemplates that the judge will have the discretion to reduce the sentence if it is, first, a sentence that was based on the relevant guideline range that's subsequently been amended and made retroactively applicable. But also, second, then the judge would need to comply with a policy statement that appears in 1B1.10 of the -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say the judgment's final, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a breach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 point?2 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the remedy3 that the agreement contemplates of the government being4 released from its other obligations in the plea doesn't5 really leave us much of an option at this point. We're6 not going to be able to go back and argue that he should7 have been sentenced at the upper end of the range that8 we're talking about. We're not going to be arguing that9 the criminal history should have been a higher or that10 the criminal history substantially underrepresented the11 seriousness of his history where he had 10 years of12 offenses preceding this one. There may have even been a13 potential career adjustment that -- that went by the14 boards. That's mentioned on page 162 of the Joint15 Appendix.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gannon, you assert that17 the -- within the language of the statutory provision,18 the sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but19 it's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably20 is based on the guidelines.21 MR. GANNON: I think the agreement is22 arguably -- I mean, I don't think the face of this23 agreement proves that it's based on the guidelines, but24 I -- it is obvious that the parties negotiated in the25 shadow of the guidelines.33￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you take that2 position, that "based on" means determined by3 absolutely,4 be based on5 6then I don't think any sentence would ever the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan.MR. GANNON: Well -­JUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines form part of7 the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision8 is not based on the guidelines. Just as here, the -­9 the agreement -- the guidelines form part of what10 produces the agreement, so also they form part of what11 produces the judge's decision. And it seems to me, if12 that's going to be enough for the judge's determination,13 it ought to be the same for the agreement.14 MR. GANNON: Well, I think it's not clear15 that the judge needed to be considering the guidelines16 in the course of deciding whether to accept the plea17 agreement. And Justice Breyer earlier had a colloquy18 with Mr. Heft about guideline 6B1.2, which, even before19 Booker, was a nonbinding policy statement. And so, to20 be sure, when 3582 was enacted, the guidelines were21 binding, and, therefore, it -- they would have been22 expected to have played a larger role in most sentences.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but let's -- let's24 assume there is no plea agreement.25 MR. GANNON: Yes. And -­34￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- sentences post-Booker/Fanfan. Now, based on the guidelines any more -­ MR. GANNON: I think -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: -- anyyou have a judge who his sentence is notOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewmore than this agreement is based on the guidelines. The guidelinesare one of the things that he must take into account and does take into account in determining the sentence.Now, if that is enough for purposes of determining whether this statute -- statutory provision applies to a sentence imposed directly by a judge, it seems to me the same analysis ought to apply to a sentence imposed through a plea agreement.MR. GANNON: Well, I think that there's a different purpose that's being served by asking the 3582(c)(2) inquiry, which is asking the judge to -- to go back and redo the aspects of his analysis that would have been different had the -- the relevant guideline range been changed at the time he engaged in his analysis, and -­JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you acknowledge that "based on" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by the judge?MR. GANNON: Outside of the context of a specific C -­35￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes. Yes.MR. GANNON -- a specific sentence rendered under type C that -- on page 28 of our brief, weacknowledge that in most contexts, it's -- it's open to -- to contend that the sentence was based on the relevant guidelines -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though -- even though the guidelines are just one of the things that have to be taken into account?MR. GANNON: It is -- the test that we state in the subheading of that section of our brief is whether they're of legal consequence in the determination.JUSTICE KAGAN: Defining "legal consequence" is your test, Mr. Gannon -­MR. GANNON: Well, our -- the.JUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a binding legal consequence post-Booker.MR. GANNON: The test that we have for -­ the overarching test is whether it is of legalconsequence, and the phrase that you're talking about on page 27 of our brief, Justice Kagan, is when we know that there is something that was of binding legal consequence and was controlling, we know that that is the thing that the sentence was based on.36Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE KAGAN: So that's not your test.2 What is your test instead?3 MR. GANNON: Well, that is -- in -- when4 something literally is controlling the analysis -- the5 parties' agreement here binds the district judge -- we6 know that that is what the sentence is based on. There7 isn't any -- any -­8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but is -- is there some9 other instances in which you would say that something is10 based on, even though it's not of binding legal11 consequence?12 MR. GANNON: Well, it would be of legal13 consequence even if it weren't controlling. This Court14 has -- has made clear even after Booker that under15 3553(a), courts still need to go through the relevant16 guidelines analysis. They apply the guidelines. It may17 turn out that the sentence turns out not to be based on18 the relevant guideline range because the judge -­19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then I'm back with20 Justice Scalia, because if it's only of legal21 consequence, not of binding legal consequence, if it's22 something that somebody considers rather than something23 that is determinative, it seems to me the same in the24 non-plea context and in the plea context.25 MR. GANNON: Well, I don't think that's true37￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 in the context of a specific sentence agreement under a2 type C plea because of -- and this is reinforced by the3 language in the policy statement, 1B1.10, which the4 Court last term in Dillon held is binding and controls5 what needs to be done during the sentence reduction6 proceeding. And it specifically refers to the guideline7 provisions that were applied when the defendant was8 sentenced. And that's something that happens in the9 process of the 3553(a) factors applicability.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't this line of11 questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no12 sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the13 guidelines? Because, today, a sentencing judge can14 engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing15 Commission may engage in when it decides that a16 guideline range should be lowered and that that should17 be retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when18 the sentence is imposed.19 We roll the clock back on the crack -- on20 the crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that21 judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could22 say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine23 guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all24 the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the25 range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range.38￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 So it seems to lead logically to the2 conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the3 Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old4 pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that5 that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the6 whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.7 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I understand the8 point that the analysis has certainly changed since9 Booker, but it is still the case that the defendant can10 appeal an error in application of the guidelines after11 Booker.12 If the judge were to -- to misapply the13 guidelines before he engages in the analysis that you're14 talking about, Justice Alito, that would be grounds for15 an appeal. In retrospect, if the judge is asked whether16 the sentence was based on the guidelines, he -- he may17 say that particular sentence wasn't, because I ended up18 disregarding the guidelines under 3553(a). I did the19 analysis. I was exercising my sentencing discretion the20 first time around under 3553(a), and the guidelines21 ended up not being the basis of the sentence.22 And that is not something that is an option23 in a type C plea agreement, because there, the defendant24 cannot appeal when the judge agrees to the sentences in25 the agreement.39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I find it hard to -- I2 find it hard to understand the analysis that would3 require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea4 agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not5 based on the guidelines. Maybe they are all based on6 the guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the7 government to put a provision in a standard plea8 agreement requiring the defendant to give up the9 opportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the10 guideline range is subsequently lowered.11 Or maybe none of them are based on the12 guidelines because -- for the reasons I just mentioned:13 This whole mechanism is now needed no longer as a result14 of Booker and Fanfan.15 MR. GANNON: Well, I think in the context of16 an actual specific sentence plea agreement, that is the17 one that we think is off the table, because that is what18 is going to control the sentence. And some type C plea19 agreements affirmatively contemplate application of the20 guidelines, as this one does with respect to the fine.21 And so when you have a plea agreement that22 tells the district judge, you are bound to apply a23 guideline provision once you've accepted this agreement,24 we haven't taken the position that the resulting25 sentence there is not based on the relevant guideline40￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 range, but that is not what is going on here.2 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You want us to3 decide this case. I completely agree with what Justice4 Alito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world5 after Booker is different. And I have not thought that6 one through.7 I am thinking this case is a pre-Booker8 case. It is not real. I am thinking it is on the cusp,9 so how am I to treat this case? If it is a case where10 the guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I11 think maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it12 was. Am I right about that? Were you saying this is a13 case where the guidelines do not apply, where they are14 not binding? I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count?￼15 MR. GANNON: Well, I16 JUSTICE BREYER: How17 this, pre-Booker or post-Booker?18 MR. GANNON: Well, I19 is, it's different. But this is--I-­do you want us to takethink that the answer a -- this is a20 post-Booker 2122 think it is23 avoid that controversy at the moment, and you tell me24 whether you want me to take it pre-Booker or25 post-Booker.case.JUSTICE BREYER: I know, you think the -- I completely different regardless. So let's41Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. GANNON: The sentencing proceeding2 occurred six months -­345 came out.67 -- you want 89JUSTICE BREYER: I want you -­MR. GANNON: -- after the Booker opinionJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you want to to set aside this post-Booker?MR. GANNON: Yes, but.JUSTICE BREYER: Then perhaps we should have10 the pre-argument. If we are taking this pre-Booker, I11 would have throughout it is QED.12 MR. GANNON: I disagree, Justice Breyer.13 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, imagine that the14 that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine. It is not15 true, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had16 written the following words: "Plea bargaining over17 sentences is above," as many argued they should. They18 write those words. Then they write the next word,19 "exception." There is an exception, however; you are20 permitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as21 you argue about the range, where, within the range, it22 applies. And of course when you apply the guidelines,23 as when you always apply the guidelines, here or24 elsewhere, departure is an unusual case.25 Now, suppose those were the words that the42￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Commission had written. Could -- how -- is it possible2 under those circumstances you would still be arguing3 this sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished4 except over where within the range -- is it possible you5 would be arguing that this is not based on the6 guidelines?7 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that had the8 Sentencing Commission adopted such a position, and if it9 were binding on the sentencing judge -­JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it is, because of used to be -­MR. GANNON: Which is -- well, because -­ JUSTICE BREYER: -- because it says in the1011 (a)(4). It 121314 sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the15 guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission16 did not adequately take into account and in respect to17 that, you may and must consult policy statements, but18 guidelines and other materials. That is what it says.19 Okay?20 So take I am right on that. Assume I am21 right. You can disagree with me, and I will look into22 it.23 MR. GANNON: Before Booker was decided,24 it -- several of the circuits had already concluded that25 a judge could accept a type C plea agreement that had a￼43Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sentence outside the range, and that that wasn't a guidelines-based sentence.JUSTICE BREYER: I want an answer to my hypothetical, because I am trying to figure out how to think about it, and you will help me if you answer my hypothetical.MR. GANNON: I think in those circumstances, the Commission effectively would have repealed type C plea agreements, because -­JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right. That's what they wanted to do. Okay? Now, that is correct. But you can still have them.MR. GANNON: In your hypothetical, that is what they wanted to do.JUSTICE BREYER: You could still have them, but they allow them only for the purpose of where within the range the sentence will lie. Okay?MR. GANNON: In those circumstances I think that it would be fair to say that the sentence was based on the guideline range -­JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.MR. GANNON: -- because the agreement hadn't given any reason for the judge to -- to leave the guidelines.JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Now I would like44Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 -- because if they wrote those words, C agreements are2 abolished, but for where within the range -- okay? You3 agree it would be based on the guidelines. Now what I'd4 like you to5 is.6 789 the-­ 1012 MR. GANNON: Well, I think it differs in two13 key ways. First of all -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You were about to tell us15 where it is?16 MR. GANNON: It is on the last page of the17 government's appendix which is the 16A of our brief.18 And I think that it differs in two regards. First of19 all, it -- it was a policy statement that even before20 Booker was not binding on the sentencing judge. The21 Commission determined that -- that this particular22 guideline was not binding on judges the same way other23 provisions in the guidelines where.24 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought you just told25 me that -- binding -- was not a part of the test45do is to look at section 6B, whatever thatMR. GANNON: 6B1.2 -­ JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. MR. GANNON: -- is on thelast page ofme how thisJUSTICE BREYER: You tell 11 differs from what I just said.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 anymore.2 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- but the question is3 whether the judge even had to apply it at all, and the4 judge did not need to. And -- the second point that I5 was going to get to is that, unlike the colloquy that6 Justice Breyer had with Mr. Heft earlier on, it doesn't7 say the court may accept the agreement only if the court8 is satisfied that it is within the guideline range. It9 gives the court permission to accept the agreement.10 This is a policy statement that gives the court11 permission to accept the agreement when it is within the12 guideline range or when there is a justifiable13 departure, but it does not then say that everything else14 is prohibited.15 JUSTICE BREYER: It's only if. The words16 there are "only if." It said should accept the17 recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring18 imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is19 satisfied either that such sentence is appropriate20 within the guidelines, or departure.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're reading a different22 --23 JUSTICE BREYER: I am? I'm reading 6B1.3, I24 am reading commentary on the policy statement.25 MR. GANNON: This is for 6B1.3?46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I am reading the2 commentary on the -­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: He is reading the4 commentary.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.6 MR. GANNON: I've been looking at a text of7 6B1.2 itself, which leaves out the word only. But I8 think that here, even if you go back to the pre-Booker9 practice, I think it was clear that judges were able to10 depart from the guidelines to accept type C plea11 agreements that imposed the sentence that was outside12 the guideline range, and they -- and it wasn't13 considered an abuse of discretion.14 JUSTICE BREYER: I think you're right. You15 see that is why I am having such a hard time. I am16 having a hard time because first I put myself back in17 the Commission days, and there the Commission did want18 to abolish C.￼MR. GANNON: Well-­JUSTICE BREYER: And then that is what itdo and that is what it said it did, but for talking about. Now, you first raised the did they have the authority to do that and I19 2021 intended to22 what we are23 question of24 agree with you that that is a legitimate question. I25 made you assume it away, but I think it is a legitimate47Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 question.2 Now we have the additional question of how3 Booker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when. Do4 you see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather5 harshly to start with my hypothetical?6 MR. GANNON: I -- I do think that -- that7 this gets puzzling as -- as you get further down, but I8 think that this is the simplest case. It is a narrow9 category of cases. We are dealing with a subset of one10 particular type of plea agreement. It is distinct from11 every other aspect of Federal sentencing. It's unlike12 what happens when somebody goes to trial; in those13 circumstances the judge clearly has the discretion to14 apply the sentencing guidelines at the time of15 sentencing.16 It is different from regular type B plea17 agreements where the parties have come up with an18 agreement and the judge notwithstanding the agreement is19 still free to determine the sentence that he or she20 wants to determine.21 This is a unique -- this uniquely gives a22 high level of certainty to the parties about the23 specific sentence that they negotiated.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't -- I am not in25 disagreement with the point you're making, but I think48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and2 Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not3 mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on4 the agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be5 approved by the judge.6 The legal consequence is not the agreement.7 That doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's8 decision as to what the sentence should be which he9 denotes in accepting the agreement that binds.10 And I think -- I may be making Justice11 Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement12 and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge13 feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a14 sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the15 guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not16 the guideline sentence?17 MR. GANNON: Well, because I think that the18 relevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and19 the policy statements that the court said in Dillon20 controls the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2),21 is what did the judge do at the time of imposing the22 sentence? And so although it is true that the judge23 generally will consider how the type C specific sentence24 that the parties have agreed upon corresponds to a25 guidelines analysis at the time of deciding whether to49￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 accept the plea agreement, the relevant phrase in2 1B1.10(b)1 which is -- which is on page 8A of the3 government's appendix is that the judge is supposed to4 go back and look at what -- to only make substitutions5 for the corresponding guideline provisions that were6 applied when the defendant was sentenced.7 And so when you have a type C plea agreement8 that has a specific sentence even under the terms of9 this agreement, the only thing that the judge considered10 when he decided the sentence was going to be 106 months11 with respect to the term of imprisonment was the binding12 plea agreement. That is what rule 11(c)(1)(C) required.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- no. Because you're14 assuming that the agreement was automatically binding on15 the judge.16 MR. GANNON: It was -­17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The judge was always18 capable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept19 the 106. If he had calculated the guidelines and if it20 turned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he21 could have said easily no, that is so far outside of the22 guideline range with no justification that I am not23 going to accept -- impose the sentence. You could24 withdraw your agreement and do whatever you're going to25 do.50￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. GANNON: And had he not done that the2 proceeding would have occurred differently and it may3 not even have right occurred then, and -- and I think4 because under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea5 agreement and -- and the 106 months that the parties had6 agreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right7 to withdraw the plea at that point. So the government8 would have been released from its obligations; the9 parties -- the defendant could have gone to trial. He10 could have -- he could have continued to plead guilty.11 The parties could have come up with a type plea -- B12 plea agreement. The parties may have asked for time to13 renegotiate a different type C agreement. We do not14 know what would have happened in those circumstances.15 And as you pointed out before, Justice16 Sotomayor, this is not about asking the judge to step17 into the shoes of the parties and renegotiate what the18 agreement would have been had the judge decided to19 reject it the first time around. Instead 3582(c)(2)20 contemplates a limited process by which the judge will21 reapply those provisions of the guidelines that he22 applied the first time around and -- and make the23 substitution that is now called for by the retroactively24 applicable change. But here because the judge didn't25 actually make that application at the time of51￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 sentencing, the judge did not actually have to apply the2 drug quantity table.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I am not following that4 argument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask5 what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the6 original sentence, well, it has got to be the7 guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it;8 then he says I am going to wait for the probation report9 so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree10 with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is11 precisely within the guidelines.12 So if you asked me to describe what that13 sentence was -- of what was it,14 that was a guideline sentence.15 within the brackets that -- the16 wasn't it a guideline sentence?17 MR. GANNON: Because for purposes of the18 term of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying19 the guidelines at that point. He did so for purposes of20 the fine. He ended up actually waiving the relevant21 fine, but those type C plea agreement here called for22 the judge to apply the guidelines with respect to the23 fine and did not call for the judge to apply the24 guidelines with respect to the term of imprisonment. He25 knew that it was within what the PSR had calculated as5246to106days--Isay It was right there guidelines. So why￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the guideline range and he concluded that that was the2 applicable guideline range which he needed to do for3 purposes of calculating the fine and other things, but4 it wasn't actually the basis for the sentence.5 The basis for the sentence was the plea6 agreement that he accepted, and there it was the7 parties' agreement. And there are all sorts of things8 that went into the parties' agreement that the judge9 does not have the wherewithal to reconsider in10 retrospect.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought one of the12 things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the13 judge would have the right to himself calculate the14 guideline range.15 MR. GANNON: Yes. And that specifically16 contemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that17 the judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement18 until after the presentence report is prepared. And the19 judge did do that here. So he was aware of what the PSR20 recommended, but once, and had he decided that he did21 not like the 106 month sentence and he wanted to22 preserve his sentencing discretion, the option at that23 point was to have rejected the plea agreement, at which24 point the parties would have been free to do different25 things. And among other things, the Government could53￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 then have then argued for a higher sentence within the2 range. Could have argued that the criminal history3 failed to represent the seriousness of the defendant's4 criminal past. Could have argued for an upward5 departure even, but the Defendant got the benefit of the6 106 month agreement of not having the Government raise7 any of those other arguments at that time. And now he8 is asking for essentially another bite of the apple and9 we think that because the basis for the sentence was10 indeed the negotiation and the agreement between the11 parties, that the court of appeals decision was correct.12 If there are no further questions.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,14 Mr. Gannon.15 Mr. Heft, you have three minutes remaining.16 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR.,17 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER18 MR. HEFT: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a19 couple of points. First of all, the record here leaves20 no doubt that the judge based his sentence on the21 guidelines. The sentencing transcript specifically22 states that the judge and I'd like to quote this, this23 is at page 47 of the joint appendix and I quote, "the24 court will adopt the findings of the probation officer25 disclosed in the probation report and application of the54￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 guidelines as set out therein." On page 48 of the joint2 appendix the judge says, having considered the advisory3 guidelines, he went on to impose that sentence. So it4 is quite clear that the judge and even in his statements5 of reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again6 reaffirmed that this sentence was based on the7 guidelines.8 Now, the other point that I'd like to make9 is that the Government acknowledges that it has carved10 out a very small exception to its argument that C pleas11 regarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are12 not eligible for (c)(2) relief. But it seems to me that13 reading, taking the Government position into account, if14 this plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then15 Mr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in16 the Government's view and under the Government's17 argument of what exception exists under the C pleas for18 purposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the19 relief that was granted. And we would simply urge the20 Court in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude21 specific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582.22 Thank you.￼23 24 25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
