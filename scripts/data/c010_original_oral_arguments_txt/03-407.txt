Kowalski v. John C. Tesmer.Mr. Casey.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:In this facial challenge to the Michiganstatute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have third party standing and that their potential clients have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in discretionary appeals are both wrong.First, with respect to the standing argument, in our brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not meet any of the criteria for standing. This morning I'd like to focus on the element of prudential standing that considers whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a third party to protect his own -- to protect his own interest.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there is an injury in fact. These lawyers claim that if the State were compensating for this service and they're on the list to be appointed, they would have more money in their pockets.3Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 You're not -- you're not challenging that there is an2 injury in fact.3 MR. CASEY: Yes. In our -- in our brief we have4 challenged that. The -- the requirement is that there be5 an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or6 imminent injury in fact.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you said now you8 were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked9 were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and10 you said no. And -- and why not? Because it seems so11 obvious that they would get appointments if the system12 were --13 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I take it you're14 reserving it for -- in your -- in your brief.15 MR. CASEY: I -- I am not waiving the argument.16 I -- I would like to rest on the brief.17 But I -- in answer to your question, we believe18 yes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list19 for appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the20 list and a case comes up in that county, there is a21 likelihood that there will be a case. We submit, however,22 that on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't23 know how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in24 Saginaw County. We don't know how many appeals of this25 nature come up. So it may be many years before the4Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 situation arises. This is not a concrete and2 particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and3 we've argued that in the brief.4 At -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and5 if there is -- another factor is the close relationship to6 the third party. We believe those are weak at best, and7 we've argued in our brief that they don't exist. I think8 it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning9 the hindrance to the third party does not exist here.10 This is a facial challenge bought by -- brought11 by lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not12 that the statute violates their own constitutional rights,13 but that it violates the rights of potential future14 clients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I clarify something about16 this case? Are any of the indigent defendants whose17 rights the respondent attorneys want to advance -- do any18 of those people themselves have standing to bring their19 claims in Federal court now?20 MR. CASEY: Yes. We argue that there are -­21 there are three ways that an indigent defendant can bring22 this claim themselves without having to rely on an23 attorney in this type of case. First, they can bring the24 challenge directly through the State courts.25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm asking if there are any5Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425individuals now before this Court in this case -­MR. CASEY: No. None of these -- none of thesedefendants --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- who would be available andwho would have remedies or standing to bring their claims. Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?MR. CASEY: In this facial challenge, we're talking about pure hypotheticals. The -- the three named indigent defendants --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: There were three named indigents.MR. CASEY: Correct.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: They were?MR. CASEY: They were denied counsel.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Denied counsel, and they werealso dismissed at some point down the line?MR. CASEY: Yes. The -- the Sixth Circuit heldthat the Federal court should abstain from deciding their claims because they could have brought their claims in their direct State appeals. They raised claims about the practice of denying counsel before the statute took effect.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Casey, was it a Younger abstention -­MR. CASEY: Yes.6Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect to the -­MR. CASEY: The -- the Sixth Circuit en banc held that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court should abstain from deciding the claims of the three indigent defendants.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means that the defendants could never bring this 1983 suit. Only the lawyers arguably could.MR. CASEY: No. Younger v. Harris is only -­ only defers the time when a proper Federal civil rightsactionactiontwo ofall.not -­can be brought. There were -- at the time this was brought, there were pending State appeals in the cases. One of the defendants never appealed atThe Sixth Circuit recently issued an opinion￼JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't these lawyers instead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why didn't they just offer their services to -- to these defendants through the State courts?MR. CASEY: Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel could answer that better than I. We say that is the --JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what I don't understand about -- about the fact that they won't -­ won't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as7Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 easy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which2 indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their3 own lawsuit.4 MR. CASEY: That is our point on the standing5 issue precisely, Your Honor.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- didn't the Michigan7 Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the8 statute was constitutional, that there was no right to9 counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel,10 paid counsel?11 MR. CASEY: That's correct. In -- in 2000, the12 -- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan13 Supreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision14 that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice15 of denying appointed counsel was constitutional. The16 statute was not in effect at that time. The statute took17 effect, and in a case just decided in June of this year,18 People v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court relied on19 Bulger and said this statute is constitutional. It does20 not violate any rights.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So going through the State22 system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the23 defendants could successfully assert a right to paid24 counsel --25 MR. CASEY: That is correct.8Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because that's already2 been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.3 MR. CASEY: As -- as a matter of jurisprudence4 by the State supreme court, yes. Both State and Federal5 constitutional --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's an appeal from7 -- they could request certiorari from the State supreme8 court to this Court, I assume.9 MR. CASEY: There are, in fact, two cases10 pending, the Harris case that I just mentioned. A11 petition for certiorari was filed about 2 weeks ago12 raising this precise claim. There is another case Halbert13 v. Michigan. It's docket -­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- was there a cert15 petition in Bulger itself?16 MR. CASEY: There was a petition in Bulger.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was denied.18 MR. CASEY: It was denied.19 In -- in addition -­20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there -- there is a cert21 petition filed in what case? In the June case?22 MR. CASEY: In the -- the case is pending in23 this Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan. It was filed24 about 2 weeks ago. I have not been able to find out the25 docket number.9Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425There was another case, Halbert v. Michigan, which is a pro se defendant who was denied counsel. His applications, pro se applications, were denied in the State appellate courts. A pro se petition was filed. I filed a response to that about a month ago. That's docket number 03-10198. It's on this Court's conference for Friday, October 8th.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So your point is that there are petitions filed here that would enable this Court to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in holding the statute constitutional.MR. CASEY: That's correct. There are at least those two petitions pending that I'm aware of in this Court now.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you acknowledge there is a good Federal question there at least?MR. CASEY: Oh, yes. It's -- it's an important question.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.MR. CASEY: We -- we -- in the Bulger case, I opposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important question, but it was correctly decided. At that time, there was no conflict. Then when the Sixth Circuit opinion came up, we filed the petition saying it's an important question and now there's a conflict between the10Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 State supreme court and the Federal court of appeals.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the position you've3 taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should4 take the case?5 MR. CASEY: What I said in the Halbert case is6 that the Court need not grant this petition now because,7 although it's an important question, the issue is pending8 in -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v.9 Tesmer. If this Court rules in our favor on standing and10 then does not reach the constitutional question, then it11 would be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the12 Halbert case or the Harris case because the -- the13 determination of the constitutionality of this statute is14 important to the State of Michigan.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have lawyers in those16 cases?17 MR. CASEY: Now, the Halbert petition is pro se.18 The Harris petition has either retained or pro bono19 counsel. But the -- the constitutionality of the statute20 is -- excuse me -- is directly challenged in both of those21 petitions.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if in exercising23 prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential24 standing, because I guess there's article III standing25 here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one11Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's2 now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore3 that aspect of the case?4 MR. CASEY: As a matter of judicial economy,5 there is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been6 briefed and argued. So perhaps it should be decided.7 Just last term in Elk Grove v. Newdow, the Court faced a8 similar situation. They disposed of the case on9 standing -­10 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in that case there was11 a conflict between the interests of the third party and12 the interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here13 there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.14 MR. CASEY: That's true. That's true.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, also bearing upon16 our prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in17 order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert18 to be an end run around the Younger abstention. And -­19 MR. CASEY: That's -- that's correct. In my20 view, the -- the most logical, most appropriate21 disposition would be to say that these attorneys do not22 have standing. Therefore, reverse the Sixth Circuit's23 judgment.24 There are these other vehicles pending now to25 reach the constitutional issue.12Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but why isn't the2 Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem3 in Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants4 unavailable but then allowed the third party to have5 standing. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here6 just like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?7 MR. CASEY: Well, in determining prudential8 standing, there are several criteria that should be9 examined in deciding whether there's an exception to the10 general rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of11 third parties. In Craig v. Boren, the statute directly12 affected the vendor in that case. It was a statute13 against sale of certain alcoholic beverages. And in this14 case we don't have that.15 Also, in Craig v. Boren, nobody argued16 prudential standing considerations until the case reached17 the Supreme Court apparently.18 But in our case, we have a situation where we19 have lawyers who do not have any present clients who are20 not directly affected by the statute. They're not21 claiming rights -­22 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they have the same23 interest that the bartenders had because they won't make24 some -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't25 sell the booze. I don't see the difference.13Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼12 -- if the3 they'd be4 attorneys5 67 wasn't true in the Pierce v. Society of Sisters case and8 it wasn't true in the Singleton case. Both of those cases9 recognized third party standing, although the prohibitionMR. CASEY: Well, in -- in Craig v. Boren, the bartenders did not comply with the statute, subject to criminal penalties. Here, the will not be subject to any criminal penalties. JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't true -- that10 was not on the plaintiff who was seeking to raise the11 rights of another person.12 MR. CASEY: That's -- that's true. The parties13 have discussed many cases. Almost all of them have some14 factors similar to the circumstances here, and as we've15 argued, all of them have distinguishing factors too.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the biggest17 distinguishing factor the one that you raised in response18 to Justice Scalia's question? These -- these lawyers can19 represent somebody on a direct appeal, the same way and20 raise exactly the same issue that they're trying to raise21 on third party standing now. Isn't -- isn't that true?22 MR. CASEY: That -- precisely. Just normal23 principles of litigation counsel that it is appropriate to24 have a real party in interest. The criminal defendants25 whose rights are at stake in the statute litigate that14Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 case. If you take the step and allow standing for an2 attorney, based on speculative claims about future clients3 and economic harm to the attorney, as the dissent in the4 Sixth Circuit says, that opens up the possibility of5 vastly expanding the doctrine of standing beyond what this6 Court has ever said.7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it correct as a8 factual matter that these particular lawyers do have9 clients that they could be representing -­10 MR. CASEY: That is not in --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- on direct appeal?12 MR. CASEY: -- that is not in the record. In13 their response brief, they said that they currently do14 have clients, but in the complaint -- this case was,15 again, a facial challenge. It was decided on summary16 disposition or it was a motion to dismiss. It was filed17 and decided within about a month. And there was no18 factual development here.19 If they had actual clients, there would be20 clearly a closer relationship, but again, those clients21 would not be hindered from making the claims themselves.22 There is no reason -­23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the claim that -­24 I'm sorry.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it just would seem to me15Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may2 not be representing individuals who want to make the same3 claim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to4 make these claims who don't have any clients, and the5 question is whether they have standing. And are they to6 be defeated standing because there are a lot of other7 lawyers who might also sue?8 MR. CASEY: In our view, as a general9 proposition, lawyers should not be given independent10 standing to raise claims of their clients. When the11 clients can present their own issues themselves, as they12 can in this case or in this situation under the statute,13 there's no need -­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that different from Caplin15 & Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of16 the client and --17 MR. CASEY: Again, there was an actual client in18 that case and there was significant money at stake. The19 lawyers had been paid money from drug forfeiture. They20 had been paid $25,000, and they wanted another 107 -­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the actual22 client, you moved to dismiss. So that's why there's no -­23 was no back-development. You moved to dismiss.24 Therefore, you have to assume whatever facts -­25 MR. CASEY: That -- that's correct.16Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in favor of the opponent2 of the motion.3 MR. CASEY: That's correct. But my response on4 that was to the question of, you know, do they in fact now5 have clients. There is no allegation in the complaint and6 no proof that they now have clients. They may -­7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if you assume -- you8 assume the correctness of the allegations, which you -­9 you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they10 would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to11 payment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in12 terms of their claim,13 have clients and they14 behalf of the client.15 MR. CASEY:16 of injury in fact and17 party. We still have18 discuss this morning about hindrance to the right -- to19 the ability of the third party to litigate for themselves.20 Excuse me.21 In our view, there is no need to expand the22 doctrine of standing to permit lawyers to have independent23 standing to make these claims because the clients, who are24 directly affected by the statute, can make them25 themselves. There are the two pending habeas -- or two17Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005you've got to assume that they will can bring this -- this issue on￼Correct. That goes to the criteria close relationship with the third the criteria that I wanted to1 pending petitions for certiorari that we've mentioned.2 There is another case, the Bulger case. Mr.3 Bulger himself, after he lost in the Michigan courts, he4 filed a petition for -- for habeas corpus. And the5 district court granted the writ of habeas corpus. We6 appealed. That case is now pending in the Sixth Circuit.7 So that's another vehicle.8 It is also possible that an indigent inmate9 himself could bring a section 1983 case. It's simply not10 necessary to expand the doctrine of standing to give11 lawyers -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could an indigent bring a13 1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred14 by Younger.15 MR. CASEY: If they had a pending prosecution,16 it would be barred by Younger. Once that pending17 prosecution is over, they could bring a 1983 action.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they? Because I19 thought this Court had held that -- that you can't bring a20 1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the21 conviction.22 MR. CASEY: Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the23 outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the24 conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the25 1983 case. Here, the allegation is simply that they were18Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 entitled to counsel. That's not the substantive merits of2 whether the claim -- whether they are properly convicted3 or properly sentenced.45 31st -­ 67 that's --8 could not910 the State11 abstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action. But after12 they go through the State court and lose, in addition to13 filing a writ of certiorari with this Court --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably up to this15 Court, if they want to come that far.16 MR. CASEY: Oh, certainly. After -- after they17 go through the State court, they could file a writ of cert18 in this Court, as the two pending petitions have. They19 could file a complaint for habeas corpus. They could20 bring a facial challenge under 1983.21 In a case called Howard v. Whitbeck from the22 Sixth Circuit, just decided about a month ago, that was23 the very question that was decided. An inmate -- a prison24 inmate, challenging another statute, litigated and lost in25 the State court, then filed a 1983 action. We argued in a19Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005The Sixth Circuit, in a case decided AugustJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if that -- that -­ you're saying that the defendants themselves sue now under 1983?MR. CASEY: A -- a defendant who is currently in system on direct appeal is barred by the￼1 Federal case under Rooker v. Feldman, he was actually2 trying to seek review of the State court judgment. The3 district court agreed. But the Sixth Circuit just said4 Rooker v. Feldman bars the as-applied challenge, but they5 remanded for a trial on the merits of the facial6 challenge, which is not barred by Rooker v. Feldman. So7 an inmate who has been unsuccessful in the State court,8 under Sixth Circuit law in my jurisdiction, can bring a9 1983 action.10 So there are at least three vehicles that an11 inmate can bring -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you -- do you agree13 that that's right? And you said that that's their theory,14 that they could bring a 1983 action.15 MR. CASEY: We are not filing a petition for16 certiorari from that decision. We are abiding by that17 decision. We're going back and we're going to try that18 case on the merits of the facial challenge to the statute.19 That -- that case is Howard v. Whitbeck, docket number20 03-1396.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, what the other side22 says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but23 in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they24 -- what they -­25 MR. CASEY: That's true. That -- that gets into20Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the -- the merits of the constitutional claim. And in our2 view, talking about the merits, all that is required in3 the Michigan application for leave to appeal process is4 that a defendant identify the issues and ask the appellate5 court to review it. Unlike Douglas, this is not a review6 on the merits. An order denying an application for leave7 is not an affirmance. It's not an adjudication of the8 merits of any legal issue.910 order to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the11 Michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time?12 And if so, what's the standard that they use?13 MR. CASEY: The court rules concerning14 applications for leave do not set out specific standards.15 What -- what the court of appeals can do on an application16 for leave is grant the application, deny it, or issue17 peremptory relief.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do we look to in￼1819 they use?20 standards2122 are no published standards in court rule or statute on23 that. The court is free to exercise its discretion to -­24 to deny leave for any reason that it chooses.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an example of21Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what are the standards Where -- where do I look to find out whatthey use, if I get there?MR. CASEY: To the best of my knowledge, there1 where they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's2 not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as3 incorrect -­4 MR. CASEY: If -- if --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- such as incorrect6 sentencing?7 MR. CASEY: Well, if -- under the statute, if8 the court of appeals grants leave, counsel is9 automatically appointed.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. What are the instances11 in which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some12 other statutory -­13 MR. CASEY: They're -- most often they are14 sentencing issues. The statistics we put in our brief, in15 footnote 25 of our brief, indicated that out of the -- in16 2001, there were 38,000 guilty plea convictions. The17 court of appeals that year disposed of 7,600 cases. 1418 percent of them were guilty plea appeals. Most of them19 were disposed of by order. There were somewhere in the20 neighborhood of about 50 decisions -- opinions issued in21 guilty plea cases. I have not canvased all of them. I22 suspect that the vast majority of them are sentencing23 issues.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we -- do we know whether25 any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four22Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 categories where you a -- a right to?2 MR. CASEY: In every case where there was an3 opinion, counsel was appointed. The statute requires it.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the problems, I5 thought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct6 -- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's7 an objection. There's no written record that the indigent8 could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to -­9 to determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.10 MR. CASEY: I believe you're incorrect on that,11 Your Honor. The -- what an indigent inmate will -- or12 defendant will have available to him to prepare an13 application for leave to appeal is a transcript of the14 proceedings. He's entitled to that for free. He will15 have whatever written motions and written decisions the16 trial judge may have issued. He will have -- in the17 transcript, he will have the oral motions and the18 decisions of the judge, and then in addition to whatever19 pro se materials, as in the Ross v. Moffitt case, the20 inmate can muster.21 In -- in these cases, there are other pro se22 materials available. The district court's opinion in this23 case noted that there is a -- a form brief, 38-page brief24 that was circulating among inmates on the precise question25 of entitlement to counsel, which two of the defendants23Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 used in their State court appeals.2 But in determining whether counsel is3 constitutionally required under Ross v. Moffitt, this4 Court has said you look to two things. Are the merits5 decided? What is the nature of the appellate process?6 And if the merits are not being decided, as in the7 Michigan case, we say that falls within the Ross v.8 Moffitt line of cases, unlike the Douglas case. In -- in9 addition to the nature of the appellate proceedings, he -­10 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, now, your -­11 your opponents quote some language from the -- one of the12 Michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason13 that an appeal was denied was it had no merit.14 MR. CASEY: A -- a typical order that the court15 of appeals issues when it denies an application for leave16 to appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds17 presented. But there is published, controlling Michigan18 authority, which we cited in our brief, that says that19 language does not mean that the court of appeals looked at20 the merits of the underlying legal issue. What -- what21 the court is looking at is the question of whether to22 grant leave or deny leave. If they grant leave, counsel23 will be appointed. In a very real sense --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what are they getting25 at when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede24Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited on page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the reference to merit supposed to mean?MR. CASEY: I -- I do not know why the court of appeals uses that language. What I do know is that the -­JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the reasonable thing to assume that they use it as we would normally expect it to--MR. CASEY: Well, the -­JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to mean by the words theyuse?MR. CASEY: On its face, that would be the first impression that is given from those words. However, the published opinions of the court of appeals we've cited in our brief reject that, and they say that in an application for leave to appeal, the court of appeals is not adjudicating the merits.My opposing counsel in this case was counsel of record in the Bulger case in the Michigan Supreme Court. He made exactly that same argument. He persuaded the dissent in that opinion, but he did not persuade the majority. They didn't decide the issue precisely, but he has been arguing that ever since.But the -- all the precedent that Michigan has on that point we've cited in our brief. Those are not25Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decisions on the merits.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it true that Michigan isthe only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?MR. CASEY: I believe that is incorrect. The plaintiffs have cited a 1987 habeas corpus case that purports to make a national survey. In the Michigan v. Bulger Michigan Supreme Court opinion in footnote 3, they cited a 1992 Arizona study which reached almost an opposite conclusion. They said there were only seven States which give unrestricted right of appeal, and there were 21 States that prohibited appeals -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not the right of appeal.

CASEY: It's my understanding that Michigan may be the only State that has a specific statute prohibiting it with exceptions like this, but it's also my understanding that the practice in many other States is that counsel is routinely denied in appeals from guilty pleas.I'd like to reserve my remaining time.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Casey. Mr. Moran, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN26Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:In fact, in the 41 years since this Court'sdecision in Douglas, no State, not one, not even a -- a territorial jurisdiction, except for Michigan, has even attempted to deny counsel to any indigents appealing any type of first tier appeal.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Moran, this is a very important question, whether the Michigan law cansurvive. to decide represent think.But I think before we can address that, we have whether there is standing for the lawyers you here today, and that's a much tougher question I￼Is it possible that this Court could grant certiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the underlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's unusual law?MR. MORAN: It is, of course, possible, Justice O'Connor, that this Court could do that.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if we were to grant you standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our existing holdings on who has standing?MR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice O'Connor. This case fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client27Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 standing cases, the Triplett case in which this Court2 unanimously found standing for a -- for a lawyer3 representing black lung claimants, and the Caplin &4 Drysdale case in which this Court found standing for a5 third party assertion by a firm representing a criminal6 defendant.7 And what those three cases have in common and8 what makes them unique is that this can only arise in a9 case in which the statute or law being challenged10 disentitles the client either through loss of funding or11 through, like Michigan's law, a statute -- disentitles the12 client to representation. Any other change in the law,13 tort reform brought up by my -­14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, it doesn't15 really disentitle the client to representation. It says16 counsel won't be appointed for him. But presumably these17 lawyers could have offered their services.18 MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be19 practical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter20 also raised in the argument. It wouldn't be practical for21 Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Vogler to offer their services pro22 bono to some indigent in this position because to do so23 would probably -- probably be unethical or malpractice.24 First of all, they can't be appointed. What the statute25 prohibits is the appointment of counsel like Mr.28Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler. So they -- they cannot form an attorney-client relationship by operation of law.JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the answer that all they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but I am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the end of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says, I'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the court, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and there's nothing unethical about it.MR. MORAN: But Justice Souter, that's impractical and unethical in this case because if Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler were to do that, they would have to represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea and sentencing issues -­JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.MR. MORAN: -- or those would be lost forever -­ JUSTICE SOUTER: Absolutely.MR. MORAN: -- because the time would fly. Andso if they also represented him on the underlying plea and sentencing issues, then this person would not -- then the underlying defendant would not be a person with standing to raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have counsel.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, which -- which indigent defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on29Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 behalf of here? Is it past defendants?2 MR. MORAN: This was -- this was -- for Mr.3 Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the4 prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges.5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You're talking about the two6 individuals, but they've been dismissed.7 MR. MORAN: No. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler,8 Justice O'Connor, are the attorneys. They were -- they -­9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I'm trying to find out10 what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys11 attempting to represent here.12 MR. MORAN: They routinely take appointments.13 Theyareonalistof--14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Future defendants?15 MR. MORAN: Presently and future defendants.16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Past defendants?17 MR. MORAN: Past defendants. They -- they -­18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's past defendants19 who were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it20 consistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here,21 these attorneys?22 MR. MORAN: I think I -- I think I misspoke. At23 the time the statute was passed, it had not gone into24 effect. This challenge was filed in order to prevent the25 statute from going into effect, to prevent approximately30Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2,000 Michigan indigents a year being denied the right to2 counsel.3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you asserting then4 that these attorney respondents are here trying to5 represent future defendants?6 MR. MORAN: Present and future defendants.7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if it's present8 defendants, how is that consistent with Younger? How can9 they do that?10 MR. MORAN: Well, they're not representing any11 named defendants. The -- the problem is that as the12 statute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive13 any further funding for -­14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's future people,15 how is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons? I mean, I16 just don't see how these attorney representatives get17 here.18 MR. MORAN: Well, they're in exactly the same19 position as the bartender in -- or the beer vendor in -­20 in Craig v. Boren. They're representing prospective21 clients, prospective patients as in Singleton v. Wulff22 again. This Court has over and over again -- in fact, in23 Triplett itself, this Court recognized that -­24 specifically said that in Triplett that it applied to25 prospective clients, that the -- and it said that in31Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Triplett that -- it quoted the three factors. And it said2 that -- excuse me. I'm looking at the wrong page. It3 said in Triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer4 may charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a5 due process right to obtain legal representation falls6 squarely within this principle. And that was the7 principle of third party standing that this Court cited -­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, in Triplett,9 the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They10 were raising third party rights in order to defend a11 proceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me12 that's distinguishable.13 MR. MORAN: That's -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the same thing in the bar15 case. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of16 liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking17 to raise the third party right. But here, there's no18 restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking19 to raise the third party right.20 MR. MORAN: But Justice Scalia, this Court has21 never held that such a restriction is a condition22 precedent or required in order for a person to assert23 third party rights.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's so, but we've never held25 what you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law32Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to2 raise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held3 that either.4 MR. MORAN: Well, in -- Singleton is a case in5 which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who6 provided Medicaid abortions.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just as -- as to8 Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say9 those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held10 it.11 MR. MORAN: I'm sorry. I didn't follow that12 question, Justice Kennedy.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we've said that Triplett14 and -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said,15 well, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then16 Triplett and Boren aren't controlling.17 MR. MORAN: Well, I think you have ruled on this18 Court -- point by many times recognizing that even persons19 against whom the statute or law would not directly affect20 -- for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v.21 Society of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against22 the school. The legal prohibition was against the23 students not going to public school. So 80 years ago this24 Court recognized that. In a situation analogous to this,25 the school -­33Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- a prohibition was on the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in that case -­MR. MORAN: That's right.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- only the schools.MR. MORAN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.It was the school that was -- was held to have standing to assert the rights of future and current students, and the same is true of the Singleton case where, again, there was no particular restriction against the doctors. It was simply that they would not get funding.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a problem, wasn't there, in Singleton that -- that the part that said that the doctors could raise the patients' right as opposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever, that that was only a plurality?MR. MORAN: That was a plurality portion of theopinion.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it shouldn't be cited then. You're citing it for something that the Court didn't hold.MR. MORAN: Well, actually we've cited it in our brief only for the article III proposition which this Court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III standing because there was an economic energy -­34Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- I thought you were2 citing it here for the quite different proposition that -­3 that you can raise third party rights.4 MR. MORAN: But ultimately this Court in5 Singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the6 patients to proceed. I understand that it was a plurality7 opinion on the -- on the jus tertii standing.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I could accept -- I guess9 I probably would accept your position if I did not think10 there -- there was another equally workable alternative11 here. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier12 question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it13 would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a14 future client, subject to a claim to be paid and on behalf15 both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but16 essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right17 to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them.18 It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the19 lawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand20 the reason for your answer.21 MR. MORAN: I think I might have misunderstood22 your question, Justice Souter. The question I understood23 was why don't they represent people and raise only the24 entitlement to right to counsel. In the Bulger case, for25 example, the Michigan Supreme Court -­35Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, no. I'm assuming they -­2 they represent the client for all purposes and one of the3 client's claims is, pay my lawyer. I don't have any4 money. Your statute is unconstitutional. Why cannot the5 lawyer pursue that claim on behalf of the client and -­6 and raise exactly the issue that is being raised in7 substance here?8 MR. MORAN: If that attempt -- if that method9 were attempted, Mr. Casey would undoubtedly argue that the10 attorney would not be entitled to any funding because the11 attorney was never appointed. You can't just go out and12 find indigents that you would like to represent. You have13 to be formally appointed.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except that that's a very15 formalistic answer. The -- the claim, in effect, would be16 I have a right to be appointed whatever your statute says17 because -- or my -- the -- the client would say my lawyer18 -- I have a right to appointed counsel, whatever your19 statute says, with the consequence of payment. So to say,20 well, they're not appointed, that's the question. Should21 they be appointed? I don't see why they cannot raise that22 issue.23 MR. MORAN: The problem is is that the way the24 Michigan system works, it works on a strict rotation25 system, and so there's no -- there's no line-jumping here.36Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 There's no right for a -- a client to -- to request a2 certain attorney, for a certain attorney to go the head of3 the queue and say I would like to represent that fellow4 and be -­5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but these -- these6 lawyers are in the rotation. Are you suggesting that the7 rotation is so enormous that it will be 20 years before8 they get another client?9 10 11 12MR. MORAN: No, not at all. They --JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.MR. MORAN: They routinely -­JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, your -- your claim is are going to get clients in the future and they13 that they14 -- they ought to have a right to be paid when the time15 comes. So why doesn't, number one, a lawyer representing16 the next client, whoever he may be, have a right to raise17 this, and why doesn't each one of these lawyers have a18 right to raise it presumably within a reasonable time when19 they next come up in the rotation?20 MR. MORAN: I think it's clear that the Michigan21 courts would unquestionably hold that a lawyer who simply22 inserts himself into a relationship without formal court23 appointment is not entitled to be paid.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure they would, and that's25 what will get brought to this Court. That's what we're￼37Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425here for.MR. MORAN: But the problem is, Justice Souter,we would then have an issue of Michigan law inserted as to whether -­JUSTICE SOUTER: No, because the claim is that they have a right under Federal law to an effective procedure whereby paid counsel can be supplied to them. That's a Federal issue, not a State issue.MR. MORAN: That part is a Federal issue, but what Michigan -­here.JUSTICE SOUTER: That's all you've got to get upJUSTICE SCALIA: It's at least an argument. JUSTICE SOUTER: It's an argument.JUSTICE SCALIA: And even if they lose on it,￼they still will have -- would have raised the issue that you are most concerned about getting raised. They're not -- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars for this particular representation. Even if they lose on what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have raised the question you're trying to raise today.MR. MORAN: And they will have to do so without any prospect of being paid, and that's -- that's the problem.JUSTICE SCALIA: Who's paying them for this38Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425lawsuit? lawsuit.MR.

MORAN: In -- in this lawsuit, if we win onthe merits, they will then get far more appointments on the rotation system and then they will get paid for those appointments.JUSTICE SOUTER: Why will they get more appointments?MR. MORAN: Because --JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said there's a strict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get an appointment. How is that going to change regardless of how this comes out?MR. MORAN: Because the statute, which is now in effect -- and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of prudential standing -­JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, you're just saying there -­ there's going to be a further class of clients to be represented on the rotation.MR.

MORAN: Because there -- there was no person10 in position at the time. The problem was we had to file11 this litigation before the statute went into effect12 because once the statute went into effect, thousands of13 Michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel14 every year and would suffer probably irreparable15 their right to appeal -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: I see -- I see that.17 good answer.damage toThat's anow,this￼18 And the -- the question I have is if I19 since we have real indigents, believe that there20 absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise21 claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus22 brief.

Now, if it doesn't disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people? Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?MR. MORAN: Your -­JUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I'd like answered.MR. MORAN: Your Honor, the only kind of case to which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the underlying change in the law or the underlying law disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the criminal defendant or the defendant to representation.JUSTICE BREYER: Because?MR. MORAN: Because, first of all, if the indigent or the client still has representation, then there is no hindrance to the third party raising it themselves.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? Why would a change in substantive law --42Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I assumed there's --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the same result?3 Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -­4 and the person says this change -- this change has the -­5 the effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the6 law. That's the claim that the -- that the client would7 have. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this8 change will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust9 suits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty,10 antitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why11 wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection12 claim of the prospective client?13 MR. MORAN: Because the client could raise it14 directly, represented by the attorney. And so the third15 prong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in16 that case.17 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm sorry. I -- I -­18 Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I19 assume that there's no problem with the real person, the20 indigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on21 that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide22 in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I23 wanted to keep firmly closed?24 MR. MORAN: But this Court's precedents25 indicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a43Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. No. I agree with3 you. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a4 real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we5 have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I6 would begin to think you were right. So then what I was7 trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to8 whether I accept that premise. And of course, that's9 what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at10 the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can11 bring it themselves, and indeed they have.12 MR. MORAN: But I think -­13 JUSTICE BREYER: But everything comes down to14 that. Right?15 MR. MORAN: I think an answer I need to give to16 -- to cut through all of this is that third party standing17 is never predicated on the impossible. Third party18 standing is never predicated on the idea that third party19 standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some20 indigent to make it into court or some third party or the21 person whose rights are being violated to make it into22 court. All that must be shown from this Court's23 precedents is a hindrance. So this Court did not require24 in Craig v. Boren that it was impossible that some young25 man could get his claim in front of the court.44Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was altogether possible2 there had been a young man. The problem was he turned 21.3 So the case would -- from his point of view was moot.4 MR. MORAN: Right, but this Court never5 suggested that it was -- showing that it was impossible6 for someone to quickly get his claim before the court7 was--8 JUSTICE BREYER: I think I agree with you on9 that. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is10 because we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And11 all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want12 a lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write13 those words. And at that point, you and the others come14 in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.15 MR. MORAN: Well, the problem is is that in the16 meantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be17 denied counsel.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a practical19 question about what is currently before the Court? Mr.20 Casey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the21 October 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either22 of those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court -­23 Michigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always24 leave before then. If we should grant in either of those25 cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case45Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 till those are decided?2 MR. MORAN: That may well be a wise course of3 action -- action, Justice Ginsburg.4 I should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed5 the response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this6 Court's attention to the fact that this underlying7 litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called8 Tesmer v. Granholm. And so he brought to this Court's9 attention that we had already prevailed in Federal10 district court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to11 why this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger12 case, and so this Court did not grant cert. I don't know,13 of course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant14 cert in Bulger.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he said now he's not16 taking that position in the Halbert case.17 MR. MORAN: But I can be confident that if there18 are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of19 jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will20 alert this Court of them. And there may well be. For21 example, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme22 Court remanded for further -- remanded for her to then23 file an application for leave to appeal on her underlying24 plea and sentencing issues without the assistance of25 counsel. Was the Michigan Supreme Court's order a final46Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 order? I don't know. This Court would obviously have to2 resolve that. But I can be confident that Mr. Casey will3 certainly bring up any procedural hurdles.4 And of course, this Court cannot exercise5 jurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it6 would be more convenient to do so. This Court does have7 jurisdiction in this case.8 The petitioners never challenged prudential9 standing at any point in this litigation -- they -- they10 challenged only article III standing, injury in fact -­11 until this Court. And so part of the reason we don't have12 a better record is because this came on a motion to13 dismiss. This Court recognized in Lujan that a motion to14 dismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a15 -- a different procedural posture. It requires the16 assumption of facts being true.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but no facts -- no18 additional facts would -- would affect the central point19 that -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion20 to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to -­21 to the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients22 are asserting raising their own rights. No additional23 facts bear upon that it seems to me.24 MR. MORAN: I agree with you on that, Justice25 Scalia.47Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE STEVENS: Then what case holds that there must be an impediment for the third party? I keep coming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed another class action and say that they filed a class action and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided we won't decide the merits even though it's been argued and both sides have had their day in court?MR. MORAN: I agree with you, Justice Stevens.JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the source of the requirement there must be an impediment to the third party suit?MR. MORAN: Well, this Court has said so many times, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the impediment to the -­JUSTICE STEVENS: That -- where they granted standing.MR. MORAN: That's right.JUSTICE STEVENS: Have they ever denied standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the third party suit? I don't think we have.MR. MORAN: I don't believe in all of the cases that both parties cited that there are any cases in which this Court has said that there was no impediment to the third party. It is -- it is certainly not the standard -­CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, do you think48Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that was just idle observation then?2 MR. MORAN: Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice. I3 didn't mean to be light about that.4 JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't have to be idle to5 be dicta, though, does it?6 MR. MORAN: There -- we -- we fully concede7 there need to be an impediment, but what it does not8 require is the showing that it is impossible for someone9 to get here. What is a showing is that for most -- for10 the average person in the class, just like the average11 grand juror in Campbell v. Louisiana, or the average12 venire person in Powers v. Ohio, there are impediments to13 getting here.14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you fully concede there15 must be an impediment even though the Court has never so16 held?17 MR. MORAN: I'm willing to concede that because18 it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an19 impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying20 to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal21 district court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is22 very likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally23 illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his24 rights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles25 of the Michigan system to get all the way through the49Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Michigan system and then into Federal court, that is a2 daunting hurdle. And that's Evitts v. Lucey. This Court3 has recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases,4 Roe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega. This Court has recognized5 time and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a6 typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or7 her case held -- heard, especially if you have to go8 through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for9 the first tier. And that is the problem here.10 On the merits, I certainly would like to correct11 Mr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the12 Michigan system. The -- a properly filed application for13 leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in14 the grounds presented. I certainly urge this Court to15 look at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has16 cited for the proposition that that is not a determination17 on the merits because not one of them says that. Not one18 of them specifically says that a order denying leave for19 lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision20 on the merits.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you give me an22 example, just from your experience in practice, where23 there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that24 requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory25 exceptions?50Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

MORAN: -- and for -- and then if the indigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting -­ that's after the indigent has had to file an application identifying his or her own issues without any assistance of counsel.Double jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues arise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should be consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a breach of the plea bargain. All of these issues arise in Michigan courts every day, and while we are --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there instances where Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims51Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 are raised?2 MR. MORAN: The problem, Your Honor, is that an3 indigent can't raise -- a typical indigent would be4 completely incapable of identifying this -- these sorts of5 issues.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: His counsel will have raised7 them. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have8 been raised by counsel.9 MR. MORAN: Your Honor, Michigan requires that10 ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on11 direct appeal. So if counsel has not raised the issue,12 then the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by13 himself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective14 assistance of counsel, on direct appeal.15 Further, even if counsel has recognized it, what16 we typically would have would be an oral objection at a17 sentencing hearing. For example, Your Honor, I think18 these sentences should be concurrent, and the judge says,19 no, I'm going to make them consecutive. That's an oral20 objection. The indigent will have to be able to get the21 transcripts, get the register of actions, get all the22 necessary documents, realize that that's a winning issue,23 that it does not put him at additional risk. That's24 another factor. One of the -- one of the points that a25 counsel can help with is tell an indigent, you don't want52Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to take this appeal because success may result in2 revocation of the plea bargain and an additional risk -­3 will have to realize that this is in my best interest to4 go ahead with this appeal. This is my issue. Find the5 cases, find the controlling authority.6 And even issues as complex as a Blakely issue,7 which this Court, of course, will be dealing with this8 afternoon, that is an open issue of Michigan law right9 now. Is -- are the Michigan sentencing guidelines10 unconstitutional or at least the application of them as a11 result of this Court's decision in Blakely? Right now, as12 a result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan13 indigent will have to raise that complex issue of Sixth14 Amendment law by herself or by himself, and that's simply15 an impossible burden, or the issue will be lost forever.16 And that is -- that is a burden that no indigent can meet.17 And so I would hope that this Court would not18 get hung up on the standing issue because this issue is so19 important right now, as a result of the Michigan Supreme20 Court's order. Right now these issues are happening and21 right now Michigan indigents are being denied the22 assistance of counsel. Unique in the Nation. And so this23 case has been adversely argued. That's the point of24 prudential standing. The petitioners waived the25 prudential standing issues below. They challenged only53Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 article III standing. And so there is every reason for2 this Court not to wait for a perfect case that may never3 come.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you familiar with the5 Halbert case? You mentioned that there might be a6 finality problem in Harris.7 MR. MORAN: I'm not familiar with that case,8 Your Honor. I just became aware of it by letter a few9 days ago and I have not had a chance to find out anything10 more about it. I have not seen the cert petition in that11 case. I'm not aware of the underlying -- excuse me -- the12 underlying order from the Michigan courts in that case.13 But there may never be a perfect case, but this14 case is adverse and that meets all the -- all the15 requirements for prudential standing. Article III16 standing is clearly met in this case, and I hope this17 Court will affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit.18 If this Court has no further questions.19 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moran.20 Mr. Casey, you have 3 minutes left.21 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY22 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you waive the objection to24 prudential standing -­25 MR. CASEY: We did not waive any of the standing54Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 claims in this case. We've discussed that in our reply2 brief. I've cited pages of the briefs where these issues3 were discussed. And the overriding fact is that the4 district court, the three-judge panel in the court of5 appeals, and the en banc Sixth Circuit all decided these6 issues. They have been properly raised and preserved and7 they're before the Court.89 opposition 1011 month ago. 1213 procedural 1415 individual16 citing the17 case. It was denied. He filed a pro se application for18 leave to appeal challenging the denial of counsel and19 raising his sentencing issues --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what was the basis for21 your opposition to cert?22 MR. CASEY: That the Court need not grant cert23 in that case because the issue is pending in this case.24 If -- if this case goes away, then I suspect we will agree25 that that would be an appropriate vehicle to decide the55Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you file a brief in in Halbert?MR. CASEY: Yes, I did. I filed that about aJUSTICE GINSBURG: And does that have any impediments?MR. CASEY: Not to my knowledge. Thatwas convicted in pleas, asked for counsel Federal litigation in this Kowalski v. Tesmer￼1 constitutional issue. As long as this case is pending in2 which the issue is raised, I suggested that the Court need3 not grant cert in that case to decide the issue. If the4 issue is not going to be decided in this case, then that5 would be an appropriate vehicle to raise and decide the6 issue.7 On the standing point, if the plaintiffs here8 are given standing, it would be a significant expansion of9 this Court's standing doctrine. This Court has never10 found third party standing when a litigant is not directly11 affected by a statute and there is no close existing12 relationship with the third party and there is no13 hindrance. We've discussed many cases in which some of14 these factors are present and others are distinguishing15 factors. This -- this case is, in some respects, unlike16 all of them. There would be a significant expansion of17 the doctrine.18 On the merits of the issue, a constitutional19 right to appointed counsel, under the Michigan system,20 please read the cases I've cited in my brief, particularly21 the Bobenal decision, which I've cited in my principal22 brief. In a footnote in my brief, I quote the orders that23 the court of appeals was considering. They have the same24 language that is at issue here. Controlling Michigan25 precedent says that applications for leave to appeal are56Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not decisions on the merits. All an inmate has to do is identify the issues. That can be done. It has been done, as seen by the two pending petitions for cert.If the Court has no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Casey.
