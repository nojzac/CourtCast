Mr. Dunham.        ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.               ON BEHALF OF PEITIONERS           MR. DUNHAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:           Petitioner Hamdi is a citizen who has beenheld over two years in the United States with noopportunity to be heard as to the facts on which hisdetention is based.  Mr. Hamdi makes two claims.First, the Fourth Circuit wrongly prevented Hamdi inthis habeas proceeding from being heard as to thefacts of the case on grounds that allowing him to beheard would interfere with executive power.           Second, that the Fourth Circuit erred infinding even on the one-sided record that's beforethis Court that his detention is authorized by law.The historical core of habeas corpus is to challengeextrajudicial executive detention.  It cannot be aviolation of the separation of powers for an ArticleIII court to perform its judicial function of inquiryinto long-term, indefinite detention of a citizen ina habeas corpus proceeding.3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 9101112131415           Quoting from INS v. St. Cyr, at itshistorical core, the writ of habeas corpus has servedas a means of reviewing the legality of executivedetention and it is in that context that itsprotections have been strongest.           QUESTION:  Do we have precedents forapplying the writ in wartime situations to enemy           MR. DUNHAM:  For aliens, yes.  And inQuirin --           QUESTION:  But for a citizen who turns outto be an enemy combatant?           MR. DUNHAM:  There are two --           QUESTION:  What precedents do we look to?           MR. DUNHAM:  There are only two precedents12345678   combatants?16   that I'm aware of, Justice O'Connor.  The first is17   the treatment of the American citizen saboteur spy in18   Ex parte Quirin, and the other is Mr. Territo, in In19   re Territo, which was a Ninth Circuit case.  It is20   not a case coming out of this Court.21              In our view, first off, in Territo, the ,22   -- he was not an enemy combatant.  He was called a23   prisoner of war in that case, but in Territo, there24   was a full hearing by the district judge.  Territo25   was claiming that he was not a prisoner of war, that4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9he was forced to serve.  That he was an Americancitizen.  That he had a right to have it determinedthat he was not a voluntary combatant.           QUESTION:  That's not the complaint, orthe allegation here, is it?           MR. DUNHAM:  The allegation here is that,as I understand it, is that Mr. Hamdi is an enemycombatant, whatever that means.  We don't find itdefined in any case.  We don't find it defined in anystatute, and it hasn't been defined by regulation orby anything that's been filed in this case.1011121314151617   the United States.  Isn't that -- really, do we have18   to quibble about that word?           QUESTION:  Well, it's an English word.  Itmeans somebody who is combatting.MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.           QUESTION:  I assume it means someone whois -- has taken up arms against the armed forces of19              MR. DUNHAM:  No.  I mean, in its ordinary20   sense, Your Honor, you're absolutely right.  And21   that's what we would take it to mean.  We would give22   it --23 24 25           QUESTION:  Well, if the Government'sright, he is an unlawful belligerent, I take it, ifthe Government's right.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1              MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the Government hasn't 2   claimed in this, on the record in this case, which is 3   limited to the Mobbs Declaration, it doesn't say 4   anywhere in the Mobbs Declaration that Mr. Hamdi is 5   an unlawful combatant.  The Fourth Circuit in this 6   case limited the district court's consideration to 7   that, to that affidavit, and said he could consider 8   nothing else. 9              Now, there is nothing in that declaration10   that says that Mr. Hamdi was an unlawful combatant.11   And getting back to Justice Scalia's point, we do12   accord the words enemy combatant their ordinary13   English meaning because we have nothing else to tie14   ourselves to, and those words mean an enemy is -- an15   enemy is a member of a hostile power or force.  And a16   combatant is one taking part in combat.17              QUESTION:  Well, it certainly is possible18   that a U.S. citizen could end up fighting for the19   enemy in a war against our country.  That's possible.20              MR. DUNHAM:  That's happened.21              QUESTION:  Yes.22              QUESTION:  Happening.23              QUESTION:  And so when that individual is24   captured then, by our country, the question is, to25   what extent does the habeas statute apply, and if it6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   does, are the proceedings limited in some way? 2   Because of that status of being an enemy combatant? 3              MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, I believe 4   that the -- his status is the thing that is the 5   subject of the habeas proceeding.  I mean, if you 6   start from the premise that he is fighting against 7   our country, that's one thing.  But what we are 8   saying here is that that fact is in dispute, and that 9   we ought to --10              QUESTION:  But you could say the same11   thing about, about noncitizen combatants.  I mean,12   anyone captured in a war could say, you got the wrong13   man.  I, in fact, was not taking up arms against the14   United States, and I insist upon a judicial15   proceeding to let me make that point.16              Now, you surely wouldn't allow every17   captured enemy in a war to go through a habeas18   proceeding because he wants to challenge the fact,19 would you?20              MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor --21              QUESTION:  Or would you?  I don't know.22              MR. DUNHAM:  No.  I wouldn't allow every23   person captured to go through a habeas proceeding,24   but there is a different legal status of a U.S.25   citizen from an enemy alien captured on a7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   battlefield.  They have a different status. 2              QUESTION:  Well, I'm still not clear what 3   you do with Justice O'Connor's question and it's 4   basically the Quirin case.  You are a citizen but you 5   are an enemy combatant and you are captured.  Are 6   your rights any different from that of a noncitizen 7   in the same status?  You haven't answered that. 8              MR. DUNHAM:  Well, yes.  First off, in 9   Quirin, we have to start with the premise that the10   Quirin proceeding was authorized by Congress.  They11   were proceeding --12              QUESTION:  I'm asking you to distinguish13   between citizen and noncitizen in the hypothetical14   case where each are combatants against the United15   States and are captured.  Any difference?16              MR. DUNHAM:  Not in the Quirin case.  No,17   Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  Any difference in your view and19   under your theory of the case that you're presenting20 here?21              MR. DUNHAM:  Yes.22              QUESTION:  And what is that difference?23              MR. DUNHAM:  That difference is that24   Mr. Hamdi is a citizen.  He is not entitled to25   belligerent immunity.  He is subject to prosecution8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   under our laws if he was, in fact, participating in 2   taking up arms against our forces.  But that begs the3 question. 4              QUESTION:  You mentioned, you mentioned in 5   connection with Quirin that there was a statute, and 6   I think one -- one of the defendants was alleged to 7   be a U.S. citizen.  So I thought you were making what 8   -- were there regimes in prior wars for entertaining 9   the claims of people who said, I was an innocent10   bystander, I was indeed captured by the enemy.  In11   Vietnam and World War II, were there means to12   entertain the claims of people who said, I wasn't an13 enemy?14              MR. DUNHAM:  There were regimes then and15   there are regimes now, but they haven't been used by16   the military here.  There are outstanding military17   regulations that provide for a hearing for someone18   captured on the battlefield to determine their status19   if there is any doubt as to their status.20              QUESTION:  Would those military21   proceedings satisfy your claim?  Your point is that22   Hamdi has not had a chance to be heard on his claim23   that this was a dreadful mistake, I wasn't an enemy.24              MR. DUNHAM:  Those proceedings would go a25   long way towards satisfying the process part of our9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   claim, Your Honor, but they don't really address the 2   authorization part of our claim, which we have two 3   claims here really. 4              The first is that he has never been -- had 5   an opportunity to give, to assert a claim of 6   innocence.  And those regulations, if they had been 7   followed in this case, would certainly have given him 8   that opportunity.  And then if he filed a habeas 9   corpus petition which would be his right, the10   district judge would have had a record of a hearing11   like he does on a -- on reviewing a state criminal12   conviction.13              QUESTION:  But I don't think any14   proceeding, Mr. Dunham, conducted by the military at15   this stage, is going to reveal much that's factual.16   How are you going to get people, you know, if he was17   seized on the battlefield, what evidence are you18   going to get now from the, from those people who19   probably don't even remember it?  If the military20   accorded some process at that time, as I understand21   they said they did, surely that is more reliable than22   anything that would come up now two years later.23              MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, they did not24   provide any process as contemplated by their25   regulations.  In fact, the district judge offered to10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425let the military take this man and give him one ofthose hearings.  The very hearings their ownregulations specify.           QUESTION:  What would you expect themilitary to do?  As I understand it, he wasn't evencaptured by our own forces.  He was captured byallied forces and turned over to our forces.           MR. DUNHAM:  Well, that's certainly,certainly part of the problem, Your Honor.  We have astrong --           QUESTION:  Well, you want them to run downthe members of the Afghan allies who captured thisman and get them to testify in a proceeding?  It'sjust putting unreasonable demands upon, upon a warsituation.  I just --           MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, I don't -- myview is that it can never be an unreasonable demandto comply with habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment.           QUESTION:  That is the question --           QUESTION:  Are you claiming --           QUESTION:  -- is what it means.  And theChief Justice and Justice Scalia both indicated andit concerns me, too.  What do you want to happen atthis hearing?  You get your hearing.  Are we supposedto send a Gulfstream over with 10 people who11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425witnessed the capture?  How does this work?           MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the military's ownregulations provide a good guide for how this hearingwould work.  They allow testimony by affidavit whenit can't, when it's not convenient to obtain it inany other way.  And we are living in an age where wehave -- we are not living in the World War II age.We have fax machines.  We have phones that havepictures.  You can get depositions.           QUESTION:  What if they get a depositionfrom an American colonel who says this prisoner wasturned over to me by allied forces, our Afghan alliesin this combat, and I was assured by them that theyhad captured him in a firefight?  Now, is that goingto satisfy our habeas corpus review?           MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, that would be alot more than what we have now.           QUESTION:  Oh, it certainly would, but youwouldn't accept that, would you?           MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I wouldn't accept itwithout Mr. Hamdi --           QUESTION:  Of course you wouldn't.           MR. DUNHAM:  -- having an opportunity to beheard.  Fundamental to --           QUESTION:  So your objection is not the12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   hearsay rule, your objection is the right to make 2   some kind of response.  That's your basic process3 claim? 4              MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct, Your Honor. 5   That we have, we have never authorized detention of a 6   citizen in this country without giving him an 7   opportunity to be heard, to say, hey, I am an 8   innocent person.  We don't -- he hasn't even been 9   able to say that yet.  He hasn't been able to look at10   the facts that have been alleged against him and give11   any kind of an explanation as to his side of the12   story, which may well turn out to be true and may13   well clear up some of the deficiencies in the Mobbs14   Declaration.15              QUESTION:  But if this -- I'm sorry.  Go16   on.171819202122232425           QUESTION:  At this stage of the game, Itake it, you have no per se objection to some form ofmilitary process, so long as he could be heard?           MR. DUNHAM:  The only problem I would havewith that, Your Honor, and it's a small one, is thatthe military has refused to give this process to him.           QUESTION: No, I realize that.  Butthat's what you're -- you're asking us for something.And my suggestion is, if I understand your argument,13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼10111213141516171819202122232425           MR. DUNHAM:  The military procedurerequires the military to call witnesses and allowsthe detainee an opportunity to give his own side ofthe story and call his own witnesses.           QUESTION:  Do you still think that habeasis necessary in order to determine that that processhas been afforded him?           MR. DUNHAM:  Well, right now, habeas isnecessary to even get him that process.           QUESTION:  Let's assume the regime thatJustice Souter suggested, it's in place.  You areentitled to habeas in order to ensure that that hastaken place and have, have the Article III courtsupervise that, or would affidavits that this, fromthe Government that this procedure has been affordedbe satisfactory?           MR. DUNHAM:  That would be a separate14Alderson Reporting Company1   that if ultimately you were found, your client was2   found to be entitled to some process, it might be,3   consistently with your position, that military4   process with an opportunity to be heard in response5   would satisfy your demand.67 Honor. 89MR. DUNHAM:  Yes.  That's correct, YourQUESTION:  All right.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   habeas proceeding, Your Honor, which might be filed 2   after the hearing was held by the military, and -- 3              QUESTION:  I'm asking if you are entitled 4   to file that as a matter of right. 5              MR. DUNHAM:  I believe that any U.S. 6   citizen has a right to file a habeas corpus petition 7   at any time he is detained by the government.  But I 8   don't know that the Article III court would need to 9   supervise the military hearing if that's what he got.10   He would certainly have the right, when that hearing11   was over, just like anybody does, to file a habeas12   petition saying that I'm detained by the government.13              And then the district judge could look at14   the hearing, if there was a hearing by the military,15   he could review it for fundamental fairness, if16   that's what the detainee decided to do at that point.17   But it wouldn't be --18              QUESTION:  But it is reviewable on habeas?19   You are not saying that it would be an adequate20   defense in a subsequent habeas position simply to say21   there was a hearing of the kind prescribed in the22   military regulations, and after that hearing, he was23   found to be an enemy combatant.  That would not24   satisfy you?  You would allow the habeas court to25   re-examine the facts brought up in that hearing?15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. DUNHAM:  I believe that the habeas court could always review the process to see that it was fair.  That's a habeas court's function.            QUESTION:  Right.            MR. DUNHAM:  But it wouldn't be anything extensive.  If there was a record from the military proceeding, the district judge would simply --            QUESTION:  Well, it depends on what you mean by fair, of course, and what, you know, what common law courts usually mean by fair, for example, is no hearsay testimony.  And you apply that rule to a wartime situation and everybody will get off.            MR. DUNHAM:  Well, Your Honor, the regulations, the military's own regulations say how the hearing is to be held.  The district judge would be basically looking to see whether those regulationswere complied with.            QUESTION:  Oh, that's different.  I thought you said that he would look to see whether those regulations were fair.            MR. DUNHAM:  Oh, no, not the regulation -- whether the proceeding was fair, whether it complied with fundamental due process.  And that would --            QUESTION:  That's something quite different from saying they followed the regulations.16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1    The regulations might be something that a common law2    judge thinks does not comply with due process.  In3    that case, you would override the military judgment,4 right?5 6 7 8 9           MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I believe the districtcourt has that power, Your Honor.  The Article IIIcourt has that power in a habeas proceeding.           QUESTION:  But I didn't understand yourbasic answer.  The basic question is, in the ordinarycase, not some unusual case, but in the ordinarycase, if they set up an ordinary military tribunalaccording to Article I(6) and it worked and so forth,then isn't that due process?  I thought JusticeScalia -- in response to Justice Scalia's question,you said that wouldn't satisfy you, but my impressionwas you were saying in the ordinary case, that wouldsatisfy you.           MR. DUNHAM:  That's correct.           QUESTION:  All right, it would satisfy1011121314151617181920    you.  Fine.21 22 23 24 25           MR. DUNHAM:  All I wanted to say was thatyou haven't had that hearing.           QUESTION:  No, I understand that.  That'sthe second half of my question.  They could satisfyyou, I take it, in one of two ways.  A, that they17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    have the military tribunal that they've given in 2    every war and so forth, the ordinary procedure there, 3    a neutral decision maker and an opportunity to 4    present proofs and arguments, or B, they don't do5 that. 6               Now, if they refuse to do that, then what, 7    in your opinion, should the habeas court do? 8               MR. DUNHAM:  Then the habeas court should 9    hold a hearing that would be very similar to what the10    military should have done.  Judge Doumar here tried11    to send the case back to the military to have them12    hold the very hearing we're talking about, using13    their own officers to do it just as the military14    regulations require it.15               QUESTION:  But that would be a different16    approach.  I mean, it might be not that the habeas17    court has to hold the hearing that the military would18    have held, but that the habeas court has to say to19    the military, hold the hearing or let him go.  You20    would be satisfied, I take it, if the habeas court,21    on Justice Breyer's hypothesis, said, hold the24 2522    hearing.23           MR. DUNHAM:  That would be satisfactory,Your Honor, but the question is what interferes withthe military more, for the district judge to hold a18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1    hearing that the military has previously refused to2    do, or to order the military to follow their own3 rules? 45 6 7 8 9           QUESTION:  Was there a reason given --when the district judge suggested that solution, whydid the Government say, we don't want to use theprocedure that we used, say, in Vietnam?           MR. DUNHAM:  As I recall, the answer waswe're not required to and we don't choose to do so.           QUESTION:  Is that procedure -- does thathave -- did Congress have a part in that, themilitary regulations that provided for how you treatpeople in wartime situations who say, I'm innocent1011121314    essentially?           MR. DUNHAM: No, Congress has not passedthese rules.           QUESTION:  Well, Congress did passsomething called the Authorization for Use ofMilitary Force, did it not?           MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, it did, Your Honor.           QUESTION:  And it affects this very           MR. DUNHAM:  Yes, it does, Your Honor.           QUESTION:  Now, what application does thathave here?  It appears to allow detention of people19Alderson Reporting Company1516171819202122    conflict.2324 251111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 captured. 2               MR. DUNHAM:  The Authorization for Use of 3    Military Force does not have the word detention 4    anywhere in it.  It talks about use of force and it 5    is the equivalent, in our view, of a declaration of 6    war.  Although it is not a formal declaration of war, 7    it would have that same operative effect.  And in our 8    history, we have never had any substantive rights 9    conveyed to the commander-in-chief by the mere act of10    a declaration of war.1112   certainly,QUESTION: He has them inherently.  I mean,131415161718192021222324    Lindh.25               QUESTION:  You're saying that AMUF isyou know, when there is a declaration of war or aresolution such as this, surely the President has theright to kill foreign combatants, no?           MR. DUNHAM:  He certainly has the right tokill them and if they're aliens --           QUESTION:  Now, is it conceivable that hehas to kill them but not to detain them?           MR. DUNHAM:  He has the right to detainalien combatants, no question about it.  But when itcomes to U.S. citizens, you don't simply detain them.You prosecute them, like they did with John Walker1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000520Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1    insufficient in this case to detain, because 2    declarations of war and the AMUF historically have 3    simply authorized the President to use his judgment 4    and his force and his capacities and his power 5    without having an extensive list of the different 6    things that he can do.  And you're asking for 7    something quite different, it seems to me. 8               MR. DUNHAM:  Well, in the War of 1812, 9    there was a general declaration of war but Congress10    still passed a list of specific things the President11    could do.  Obviously a declaration of war doesn't12    give the President the power to appropriate funds to13    fight the war.14               QUESTION:  No, but look, it does say in15    this authorization, the President is authorized to16    use all necessary and appropriate force against17    persons he determines planned, authorized, committed18    or aided the terrorist attacks.19               MR. DUNHAM:  If that is interpreted to20    mean that he can impose indefinite executive21    detention on anybody that he thinks is necessary in22    order to fulfill that command, we could have people23    locked up all over the country tomorrow without any24    due process, without any opportunity to be heard,25    because we know that this war that we're talking21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    about here is going on worldwide and it's going on 2    within our own borders. 3               Congress didn't intend to -- when it 4    passed this Authorization for Use of Military Force 5    to authorize widespread detentions of people with no 6    opportunity to be heard, indefinite, solitary 7    confinement for as long as they might live.  Congress 8    -- there is no indication that Congress intended any9 such thing.10               QUESTION:  Did Congress intend that the11    President has the authority and the right to use12    whatever powers are necessary to suppress the13    terrorists and to prevent future attacks, consistent14    with the traditions and the powers of that office?15               MR. DUNHAM:  I believe they authorize it16    consistent with our laws.  I don't think Congress17    repealed any laws when they wrote the Authorization18    for Use of Military Force.19               QUESTION:  Mr. Dunham, can I ask you sort20    of a preliminary question.  We're talking about way21    down the road now, but do you contest any of the22    facts in the Mobbs Declaration?23               MR. DUNHAM:  Well, I've only recently been24    allowed to talk to my client, Your Honor, and25    everything he has told me they tell me is classified,22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    so I'm not allowed to convey it to the Court this 2    morning.  But the best I can say is in an overall 3    general way, there is a substantial dispute. 4               QUESTION:  There is a substantial dispute, 5    and have you had an opportunity, on behalf of the 6    client, to supplement or to contradict or supplement 7    the information in the Mobbs Declaration? 8               MR. DUNHAM:  No, because it's -- it's 9    while the matter has been pending before this Court10    and there is no way to go before the Court at this11    point, absent a remand, in order to do that.  If the12    Court remanded, I would be able to do that provided13    that we had appropriate protective orders in place so14    that I could convey classified information to the15 Court.16               QUESTION:  Mr. Dunham, one of the judges17    on the Fourth Circuit in the en banc denial, Judge18    Motz, had a proposal that was similar to the one that19    Judge Mukasey proposed in New York.  And that is,20    initially, the Mobbs affidavit is taken as true but21    that you have an opportunity to rebut it.  Would that22    be a satisfactory -- would that comport with due23    process?  In your view?24               MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, that is the way25    the statutory habeas proceeding is supposed to23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    unfold.  The Government doesn't deny that we have a 2    right to have a habeas proceeding.  They've conceded 3    it at three different points in their brief.  So once 4    we're before the court on a petition for habeas 5    corpus, the question is what does that proceeding 6    look like.  And I suggest it's spelled out in the7 U.S. code. 8               When Congress passed the Authorization for 9    Use of Military Force, it did not say we suspend10    habeas.  Habeas corpus statutes are still on the11    books and exactly what Your Honor is talking about is12    what should happen.13               QUESTION:  So every United States citizen,14    even if captured on the field of combat, is15    entitled to a habeas hearing?16               MR. DUNHAM:  That of course assumes he's17    captured on the field of combat, Your Honor, which we18    don't concede.19               QUESTION:  Well, that's right.  He's20    entitled to a habeas hearing to determine whether in21    fact he was captured on the field of combat opposing22    the United States, right?23               MR. DUNHAM:  Well, if he files a petition24    for habeas corpus, yes.25               QUESTION:  And I presume that anybody who24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    claims to be an American citizen would be entitled to 2    a habeas hearing on the question of whether he is in 3    fact an American citizen, and then the subsequent 4    question of whether he was captured on the field of 5    combat while taking up arms against the 6    United States, right? 7               MR. DUNHAM:  Well, the military -- 8               QUESTION:  So every foreigner captured, if 9    he claims to be an American citizen, would be10    entitled to the kind of habeas hearing you're talking11 about?12               MR. DUNHAM:  Not necessarily on a mere13    claim, Your Honor.  The military is required to take14    a long list of biographical data from anybody they15    capture.  And in this particular case, there is no16    dispute about the man's citizenship.  There is a17    birth certificate in the record.  The military has18    not -- they're the ones that determined he was a19 citizen.20               QUESTION:  I'm not talking about this21    case.  I'm talking about the principle that you're22    asking us to adopt and how it would apply.  I mean,23    if there is a habeas corpus right for an American24    citizen, there has to be, it seems to me, a habeas25    corpus right for everyone who claims he is an25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    American citizen. 2               MR. DUNHAM:  Your Honor, that may be the 3    case but that doesn't justify taking away the habeas 4    corpus right from a citizen.  That is a right that 5    has been there since this country was founded and it 6    doesn't justify taking away a citizen's right because 7    some sham claim might be made. 8               QUESTION:  Whether it's been there since 9    the country was founded when he is captured on the10    field of battle is the very controverted question11    that's up here.  You can't say that with that12    assurance.  I mean, that's why we have a case here.13               MR. DUNHAM:  If it please the Court, I14    would like to save the balance of my time for15    rebuttal.16171819202122232425           QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dunham.Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL D. CLEMENT               ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS           MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:           Petitioners contend that the Governmentcategorically lacks the authority to hold Hamdi as anenemy combatant.  But it has been well establishedand long established that the Government has the26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    authority to hold both unlawful enemy combatants and 2    lawful prisoners of war captured on the battlefield 3    in order to prevent them from returning to the4 battle. 5               Over 10,000 United States troops remain on 6    the field of battle in Afghanistan.  No principle of 7    law or logic requires the United States to release an 8    individual from detention so that he can rejoin the 9    battle against the United States.10               QUESTION:  But the question of whether11    it's a criminal procedure or this detention without12    -- does the Government have any rhyme or rationale as13    to why some of these people -- I think Mr. Dunham14    mentioned Lindh, there is also Moussaoui, there is15    this John -- they are also being kept away from16    returning any place because there are criminal17    charges against them.18               And then there is Hamdi and Padilla and19    al-Marri who are in this detention state with no20    charges.  What does the Government -- how does the21    Government justify some going through the criminal22    process and others just being held indefinitely?23               MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsburg, I think24    that reflects a sound exercise of prosecutorial and25    executive discretion.  There are some individuals who27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    may be captured in a situation where they do not 2    have any particular intelligence value, they have 3    been handled in a way where there are no difficult 4    evidentiary questions that would be raised in a 5    criminal prosecution and those individuals can be 6    dealt with in the Article III system. 7               But there are plenty of individuals who 8    either have a paramount intelligence value that 9    putting them into the Article III system immediately10    and providing them with counsel whose first advice11    would certainly be to not talk to the Government is a12    counterproductive way to proceed in these cases.13               QUESTION:  At the moment, nobody --14               QUESTION:  I'm trying to find whether15    there is any literature or commentary on how long the16    detention is required before the intelligence value,17    the interrogation value of the custody serves no18    further purpose.  Can you give me any ideas of the19    outer bounds of how long the detention would take in20    order to get the value from the interrogation that21 you want?22               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm23    not sure I can give you the outer bounds, but what I24    can say is that the case here before you today in25    Hamdi, and the case in Padilla, suggests that the28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1    amount of time that is necessary to allow for2    interrogation without access to counsel in order to3    get intelligence is not an indefinite period of time.4               Both these individuals now have access to5 counsel because the military intelligence experts who6    make these judgments have made the judgment that7    access to counsel at this point does not interfere8    with the intelligence gathering process.9               QUESTION:  Would it be --10               QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, how can you11 assume --12               QUESTION:  Would it be a helpful line of13    inquiry for a district court, assuming that there is14    some jurisdiction in the district court, which you15    would contest, to have testimony as to how effective16    interrogations are and how long it takes.  And then17    we could begin to get some understanding of this18    process?1920212223242529Alderson Reporting Company           MR. CLEMENT:  I suppose you could.  Onething I would point you to, Justice Kennedy, is thedeclaration of Vice Admiral Jacoby, who is the directorof the Defense Intelligence Agency.  That's at page 75 ofthe Joint Appendix in the Padilla case.           And I think that -- there obviously are1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    various ways the courts could approach this.  A court 2    in one proceeding could take evidence of the question 3    generally.  I suppose if there were a situation in 4    which there was a habeas petition filed and there was 5    an initial period where there was no access to 6    counsel, if a judge for some reason thought that that 7    had taken too long, I suppose that judge could make 8    an inquiry of the Government, and in an ex parte 9    proceeding, they could make some kind of filing10    explaining to the judge why it is that further11    interrogation without counsel is necessary.12               I think the important thing is twofold.13    One, to recognize that there is a unique interest,14    especially in the course of this conflict, where15    intelligence is at unprecedented value, to have some16    ability with some detainees to deal with them in a17    way that allows us to get intelligence to prevent18    future terrorist attacks, and not be limited just to19    going after them retrospectively for past terrorist20 attacks.21               QUESTION:  We can accept that, but what do22    you, what do you make of Section 4001.  I take it23    it's the Government's position that it has absolutely24    no application to the situation.  That it simply25    refers to the normal circumstances of the criminal30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    law.  Is that right? 2               MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice 3    Souter, but I would be quick to add that we -- I 4    mean, all 4001(a) says is that an individual must be 5    detained pursuant to an act of Congress. 6               QUESTION:  Right. 7               MR. DUNHAM:  If one needs an act of 8    Congress, and we question whether this really has 9    anything to do with the detention of enemy combatants10    by the military, but to the extent an act of Congress11    is necessary, as I think Justice O'Connor's questions12    indicated, the Authorization of Force provides more13    than ample statutory --14               QUESTION:  It certainly did -- may I just15    ask one more question?  I will concede certainly at16    least for the sake of argument that it did in the, in17    the early stages of the period starting with18    September 11th.  I will assume for the sake of19    argument that it did when it was passed.20               It doesn't follow, however, that it is21    adequate for all time.  The fact is, I will assume22    that on September 12th, without any authorization23    from Congress at all, the President could have taken24    action in relation to this individual, I mean, if he25    had been fighting on a battlefield that the President31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 took. 2               But it doesn't follow that the President's 3    authority to do that is indefinite for all time.  And 4    I guess the question I would be interested in and 5    your response to is this.  Is it reasonable to think 6    that the, that the authorization was sufficient at 7    the time that it was passed, but that at some point, 8    it is a Congressional responsibility, and ultimately 9    a constitutional right on this person's part, for10    Congress to assess the situation and either pass a11    more specific continuing authorization or at least to12    come up with the conclusion that its prior13    authorization was good enough.  Doesn't Congress at14    some point have a responsibility to do more than pass15    that resolution?16               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Souter, I17    would say a couple of things.  One is there may be18    some difficult questions down the road, but if there19    is emphasis that 10,000 United States troops remain20    on the battlefield in Afghanistan --21               QUESTION:  Well, there are 10,000 troops22    there, but it's two and a half years later.  And it23    may very well be that the, that the constitutional24    obligation and the constitutional demand that his25    client can make is that the political branch take32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    a -- make a further assessment and a more specific 2    one.  I'm not denying that there is a lot going on, 3    but there has also been time. 4               MR. CLEMENT:  I realize that, Justice 5    Souter.  Let me say one other thing.  And then if I 6    have time, I'd come back to the 10,000 troops still 7    on the ground.  What I would say is Congress has been 8    open with whatever appropriate recesses every day 9    since September 18th, 2001 when they passed the joint10    resolution.11               If they were to pass some specific statute12    that either provided for more finely reticulated13    procedures for dealing with enemy combatants or tried14    to preclude the detention of certain individuals,15    then I think one of two things would happen, either16    the executive branch would follow those more17    reticulated provisions, or I suppose if there was a18    judgment by Congress that this authority was denied19    all together and the President thought that that20    authority was absolutely necessary to the fighting of21    the battle in Afghanistan, then you might have a22    situation where we came to this Court in a situation23    that Justice Jackson would say the executive's power24    is at its lowest ebb.25               But here we come to the Court with that33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1    authorization that the President relied on.2               QUESTION:  You come with an authorization3    that the President relied on and which I will assume4    he quite rightly relied on at the time it was passed.5    But my question is a timing question.  Is it not6    reasonable to at least consider whether that7    resolution needs, at this point, to be supplemented8    and made more specific to authorize what you are9 doing?1011121314151617   the18    executive has the power.  And it may very well be19    that the executive has power in the early exigencies20    of an emergency.  But that at some point in the           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, again, Justice Souter,I can't imagine that the rule is that the executivesomehow suffers if Congress doesn't fill the breach.Because the last word from Congress is that -- thatall necessary and appropriate force is authorized.QUESTION: Yes, but when you say the executive suffers, I think your response is assuming that21    indefinite future, the other political branch has got22    to act if that, if power is to continue.23               MR. CLEMENT:  But Justice Souter, they24    have authorized the use of force.  They recognize, if25 you took --34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9           QUESTION:  Without any specific referenceto this situation, without any specific reference tokeeping American citizens detained indefinitely.  Imean, that's the problem.           QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, this Section 4001doesn't relate to a hearing, it relates to thePresident's power to detain, doesn't it?           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, absolutely.           QUESTION:  So if it expires after two anda half years, it would just not mean you have to givethem counsel after two and a half years or give thema hearing after two and a half years.  It means youwould have to let them go back to Afghanistan aftertwo and a half years, wouldn't it?1011121314151617181920    Afghanistan.21               QUESTION:  Wait.  You're also -- the words22    are necessary and appropriate.  And also the words in23    the Constitution are due process of law.  And also24    the words in the Magna Carta were according to law.25    And whatever form of words in any of those documents1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. CLEMENT:  It would, Justice Scalia --QUESTION:  It would, but it uses --MR. CLEMENT:  And that's why I find it soremarkable that we have to confront this questionwhen our troops are still on the ground in35Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1    there are, it seemed to refer to one basic idea 2    that's minimum.  That a person who contests something 3    of importance is entitled to a neutral decision maker 4    and an opportunity to present proofs and arguments. 5               You have heard, in the last hour, people 6    talking about the military itself recognizing that 7    basic principle with tribunals in what is called Army 8    Reg 190.8.  Now, is there any reason why, when a 9    person says I am not a combatant, I was a relief10    worker, I wasn't even there, I was sold into this by11    people who wanted a bounty, is there any reason why12    you could not have that kind of proceeding, the kind13    of proceeding that was given in the Gulf War on the14    battlefield in hundreds of instances, that was given15    in Iraq in hundreds of instances, the kind of16    proceeding that the military itself has given over17    and over and over.18               Now, is there any reason why that isn't19    necessary and appropriate, or why that isn't in20    accordance with law or due process of law?21               MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Breyer, let me say22    several things.  One is that the regulations that are23    being bandied about are the regulations that the Army24    uses to comply with their obligations under Article V25    of the Geneva Convention.36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1               Now, Article V of the Geneva Convention 2    does not apply here, and let me address why in a 3    minute, but let me say very clearly that these 4    individuals have gotten military process.  It might 5    not have been the exact process -- 6               QUESTION:  That wasn't the question I 7    asked.  The question I asked, is there any reason why 8    the Army itself could not give a comparable basic 9    proceeding where you have a neutral decision maker,10    and a practical, but fair opportunity to present11    proofs and arguments?  Not some kind of thing on the12    battlefield, something two years later, not some kind13    of thing where you haul in witnesses, but something14    that's practical insofar as you get evidence that's15    reasonably available.16               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer --17               QUESTION:  I want a practical answer.  I18    don't want a -- yes.19               MR. CLEMENT:  I understand that.  But the20    practical answer that you are looking for assumes a21    process that's never been provided.  There has never22    been a process that's removed from the battlefield.23    What Article V provides and what the military24    regulations provide is immediately adjunct to the25    battlefield, you have three military officers who do37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1    a very quick hearing, the purpose of which primarily2    is to figure out not whether somebody is completely3    innocent, but to figure out whether they are properly4    classified as a prisoner of war, as opposed to an5    unlawful enemy combatant.6               QUESTION:  So you say the regulations in7    place provide for that battlefield type review?8               MR. CLEMENT:  They do, Justice O'Connor --9               QUESTION:  Did this Petitioner have that10    type of review?11               MR. CLEMENT:  This Petitioner, Justice12    O'Connor, did not get that precise type of review,13    and the reason is because, based on a Presidential14    determination, the military officers understood that15    Article V of the Geneva Convention has no application16    here.  Again, that provision, and I think it's worth17    --181920212223242538Alderson Reporting Company           QUESTION:  Well, perhaps not, but we arehere on habeas.  Do you agree that, that he isentitled to bring a habeas action?           MR. CLEMENT:  We do agree that he isentitled to bring a --1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Okay.MR. CLEMENT:  -- habeas action.QUESTION:  So then we have to decide then￼ 1    to what is he entitled, and even that minimal review 2    by the military, you think, is not required? 3               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think it's 4    required, especially in a situation like this, where 5    although Hamdi did not receive an Article V hearing 6    because it was inapplicable, he did receive military 7    process.  When he was originally turned over to the 8    United States forces by the Northern Alliance, our 9    military allies, there was a screening process on the10    ground in Afghanistan.  Now, that process screened11    out 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody.  So he12    received that process.13               Now, to be sure, it's a military process,14    but it is the kind of process that prisoners of war15    and enemy combatants have always gotten.  Now,16    because of the nature of this war, Hamdi got17    additional process.  And it's important to point out18    that this Article V process that other prisoners of19    war traditionally get is a one-shot deal.  It's done20    off the battlefield and that's it.  You are under21    detention for the remainder of the battle.  And22    there's no reason for Congress to have to go in with23    a new resolution.  You are there for the remainder of24 the war.2539Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005Now, in this context, because we recognize￼ 1    that there are some unusual aspects of this war, and 2    also because the United States military has no 3    interest in detaining any individual who is not an 4    enemy combatant or who does not present a continuing 5    threat, when Hamdi got to Guantanamo, he was given 6    additional screening processes.  That screened him in 7    as well.  Did not screen him out. 8               Then it may not seem what you think of as 9    traditional due process in an Article III sense, but10    the interrogation process itself provides an11    opportunity for an individual to explain that this12    has all been a mistake.  And as the affidavit that's13    in the record here shows --14               QUESTION:  Do you say he had that15    opportunity?16171819202122232425           MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, JusticeO'Connor.  And the affidavit that's filed hererepresents, by Mr. Mobbs, that the interrogationprocess, in that process, his story confirmed that hewas on the battlefield and surrendered with theTaliban military unit while armed.           QUESTION:  Do you concede that you havethe obligation to make the representation that youhave just made to the habeas court?           MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Kennedy, I'm not40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1    positive what the ultimate minimum that the habeas2    statutes would require in this context, but we do3    think that an appropriate balance of individual4    rights, the traditional role of habeas, that the5    overwhelming military imperatives of this situation6    are that the habeas corpus writ is available, first7    to make legal challenges to the detention along the8    lines of 4001(a) categorically precludes this, and9    those challenges have been open.10               We also think it appropriate for the11    United States to come in with a declaration that12    explains the basis for the military's decision.  And13    particularly, I think what it does is it provides an14    explanation that if believed, provides a basis for a15    court to police the line that separates Quirin on the16    one hand from Milligan on the other.17               And obviously, a situation like this with18    a battlefield detainee who surrendered while armed on19    the battlefield is a classic case of an enemy20    combatant.212223242541Alderson Reporting CompanyQUESTION:  Is there any --           QUESTION:  In Quirin, in Quirin, thedefendants were heard, and that's -- the Mobbsaffidavit is, I take it your position is, yes,habeas, and yes, the Government has to come forward1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 9101112131415161718192021           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, Imean, there actually is, I mean, it would besomething like double hearsay, but there is astatement in the Mobbs declaration itself where Mobbsis summarizing that Hamdi himself --           QUESTION:  Yes, but that certainly isdouble hearsay.           MR. CLEMENT:  It certainly is, but thisis --           QUESTION:  The person who is locked up,doesn't he have a right to bring before some tribunalhimself his own words, rather than have a Governmentagent say what was told to him that somebody else1    with something.  And the something they came forward2    with is the Mobbs affidavit, which is hearsay,3    because Mobbs doesn't know what happened on the4    battlefield either.  And that there is no statement5    at any point from Hamdi, although the claim before us6    is that he would dispute what's in the Mobbs7    affidavit, but he doesn't have an opportunity to do8 that.22 said. 2324 25           MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, JusticeGinsburg, he has an opportunity to explain it in hisown words.  Now, it may not --42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1               QUESTION:  During interrogation? 2               MR. CLEMENT:  During interrogation. 3               QUESTION:  I mean, is that your point? 4               MR. CLEMENT:  During interrogation. 5    During the initial screening.  During the screening 6    in Guantanamo. 7               QUESTION:  How about to a neutral decision 8    maker of some kind, perhaps in the military?  Is that 9    so extreme that it should not be required?10               MR. CLEMENT:  No, Justice O'Connor.  And11    let me say two things.  One is when the initial12    screening criteria are applied in the field, for all13    intents and purposes, that is a neutral decision14 maker.15               I mean, as I said before, the Army is not16    interested in holding people as enemy combatants that17    don't qualify for that and don't pose a threat.  The18    second thing I would say, though, is that as I19    understand it, the plan on a going-forward basis20    reflecting the unique situation of this battle is to21    provide individuals like Hamdi, like Padilla, with22    the equivalent of the annual review process that's23    laid out in the briefs --24               QUESTION:  Well, let's talk about that for25    just a moment.  What is it that the Government is43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617    detention?18               MR. CLEMENT:  Not at the preliminary19    stages if the Government has made a determination20    that access to counsel would interfere with the21    intelligence gathering process.22               QUESTION:  Are there any cases -- it23    sounds from your argument that the principle24    interests that the Government wants to advance is the25    ability to interrogate the person for a sufficient44Alderson Reporting Companysaying will be provided?           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice O'Connor,those regulations are still in draft form.           QUESTION:  So we don't know?           MR. CLEMENT:  We don't know for sure.  Ithink what's envisioned is an opportunity to gobefore a neutral tribunal, some opportunity topresent --           QUESTION:  Yes, but Mr. Clement, you'reassuming he has no right to counsel, aren't you?           MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Stevens, what we'reassuming is that he has no right to counsel that isautomatic and as of right --           QUESTION:  If he could get his owncounsel, would he be entitled to consult with hiscounsel during the preliminary stages of his1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    length of time to determine whether they get valuable 2    information out of them or not. 3               And to deny him counsel during that 4    period, because he may not be as willing to talk. 5    Now, it seems to me there are two things about that I 6    wanted to ask you about.  One, have you considered 7    the possibility that perhaps a lawyer would have 8    explained to this man that if you do give some 9    information, you won't have to stay here10    incommunicado for two or three years?  That might be11    a motivation to talk.  That's one possibility.12               And the second thing I want to ask you13    about, are there any cases in the international field14    or the law anywhere, explaining that the interest in15    detaining a person incommunicado for a long period of16    time for the purpose of obtaining information from17    them is a legitimate justification?18               I understand for arresting on the19    battlefield, that's perfectly clear.  But is this20    prolonged detention for that purpose the subject of21    judicial writing anywhere that you know about?22               MR. CLEMENT:  Let me answer both parts of23    your question, Justice Stevens.  Certainly it has24    occurred to us and we have considered the possibility25    that in some circumstances with some individuals, the45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    best way to get them to cooperate and provide 2    information is to give them a lawyer who will tell 3    them, boy, you know, it's in your best interest to 4    plead to this relatively minor material support 5    charge or whatever and provide the Government with 6    everything that you have. 7               And that is part of the answer to 8    Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, is why is it 9    that there is this pattern that you look at and some10    people are used in the Article III system and other11    people are prosecuted or dealt with in preventative12    detention in the military system.13               And it reflects a judgment by people whose14    job it is to make these judgments that certain15    people, the best way to get them to cooperate, or16    maybe with certain individuals after you've gotten a17    certain amount of information from them, but you feel18    there is one other area you're not going to get19    unless the dynamic fundamentally changes, those20    people may be best dealt with in the way that you21    envisioned.  Whereas other individuals, the only way22    that the judgment of the intelligence experts had to23    deal with them is to provide them without counsel and24    to use an interrogation.25               I think to get to your second part of the46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    question, I don't know that there are any authorities 2    that I'm aware of that address exactly what you're 3    talking about, but I think there are two types of 4    authority that we would point to as being very 5    important.  First of all, it's long been recognized 6    that one of the major justifications for the 7    detention of enemy combatants or prisoners of war is 8    to gather intelligence.  And we cite some sources to 9    that effect in the brief.10               The second thing, and I think this is11    important, is that it has never been the case that12    prisoners of war are entitled to counsel to challenge13    their capture or their detention.  What has happened14    historically, and what the Geneva Convention15    provides, is that if one of those enemy combatants is16    charged with a specific war crime, then at that point17    they're entitled to counsel.  But if they are just18    being held in a preventative detention, then in that19    circumstance, they are not entitled to counsel.20               QUESTION:  But have we ever had a21    situation like this where presumably this status --22    war-like status could last for 25 years, 50 years,23    whatever it is.24               MR. CLEMENT:  A couple of responses,25    Justice O'Connor.  First of all, in the midst of any47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    war, the detention may seem like it's indefinite 2    because if you talk about a detainee in 1942, they're 3    not going to know how long World War II is going to 4    last.  And their detention may seem indefinite but 5    those detentions have always been approved under the6 law of war. 7               Second, with respect to Al Qaeda and 8    individuals who are hard core Al Qaeda operatives, 9    the end of the war is a very difficult thing to10    perceive.  But with respect to somebody who is11    captured on the battlefield with the Taliban, this12    war may eventually -- the executive may make the13    judgment or Congress may help us make the judgment14    that the war in Afghanistan is effectively over.15               And individuals who only really posed a16    danger of rejoining the battle in Afghanistan would17    be released.  Now, there may be a few individuals18    who, as I say, are hard core Al Qaeda operatives and19    they're going to join the battle against the20    United States wherever it's waged.  They're just in21    Afghanistan because that's where the action is.22               QUESTION:  May I ask just one other23    question, I think it's just relevant.  But do you24    think there is anything in the law that curtails the25    method of interrogation that may be employed?48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think there is,Justice Stevens.  I mean --           QUESTION:  And what is that?           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, just to give oneexample, I think that the United States is signatoryto conventions that prohibit torture and that sort ofthing.  And the United States is going to honor itstreaty obligations.  The other thing that's worthmentioning of course --           QUESTION:  But you said something aboutself-executing.  In connection with the GenevaConvention, you said, well, it's not self-executing.Would you say the same thing about the torture1011121314    convention?15               MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsburg, I actually16    have the sense that the torture victims -- you have17    the Torture Victim Protection Act, of course, which I18    think doesn't actually apply to the United States.19    So I'm not sure that there would be any other basis20    for bringing a private cause of action against the21    United States.22               But as this Court noted in footnote 14 of23    the Eisentrager opinion, the idea that a treaty is24    going to be enforced through means other than a25    private cause of action doesn't mean that it's not a49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    binding treaty, doesn't mean that it's not going to 2    constrain the actions of the executive branch. 3               Just to finish up my answer to Justice 4    Stevens' question, I wouldn't want there to be any 5    misunderstanding about this.  It's also the judgment 6    of those involved in this process that the last thing 7    you want to do is torture somebody or try to do 8    something along those lines. 9               I mean, if there were an artificial -- if10    you did that, you might get information more quickly,11    but you would really wonder about the reliability of12    the information you were getting.  So the judgment of13    the people who do this as their responsibility is14    that the way you would get the best information from15    individuals is that you interrogate them, you try to16    develop a relationship of trust.17               QUESTION:  But doesn't the Court have some18    business intervening at some point, if it's the19    Hundred Years War or something?20               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer, I21    mean, there may be a point where, depending on the22    nature of the war -- I mean, I'm not quite sure what23    you have in mind that they would intervene on.24               QUESTION:  At some point, if you're25    holding people without a lawyer, with the only50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    neutral decision maker being an interrogator, with no 2    opportunity to present proofs and evidence, with no 3    opportunity to hear the other side, in your opinion, 4    if that goes on and on, let's say it's the Hundred 5    Years War, is there no opportunity for a court, in 6    your view, to say that this violates, for an American 7    citizen, the elementary due process that the 8    Constitution guarantees? 9               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, as I indicated10    earlier, Justice Breyer, the courts remain open.  We11    recognize the viability of the writ of habeas corpus.12    There certainly is a challenge that can be brought to13    the length of the detention at some point.  And the14    courts would be open to hear claims --15               QUESTION:  But your answer to Justice16    O'Connor, I thought, was, we don't have to worry or a17    court should not be worrying about the indefiniteness18    of the time because it may well be that the President19    or Congress will at some point say the war in20    Afghanistan is no longer a matter of concern and,21    therefore, we don't have to hold the Hamdis.22               I think that's the only answer that you23    have given so far to Justice Breyer's question and24    Justice O'Connor's question.  Am I wrong?25               MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Souter, a couple of51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    points.  One is, I don't think there is any 2    contradiction with that and my answer to Justice 3    Breyer's question.  I mean, you can imagine a 4    situation where the evidence in the Government's own 5    affidavit shows that somebody is only detained with 6    regard to war in Afghanistan.  And then you can 7    imagine that that has been signed, sealed and 8    delivered, it's over, the President says so, Congress 9    says so and there is an effort to continue to detain10    that individual.11               QUESTION:  I can imagine it and I can also12    imagine that the concern about Afghanistan will go on13    as long as there is concern about Al Qaeda, and there14    is no endpoint that we can see at this point to that.15    So that it seems to me your answer boils down to16    saying, don't worry about the timing question, we'll17    tell you when it's over.18               MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice19    Souter, I continue to think that there may be a role20    for the courts in dealing with the timing question at21    some point.  I think that would be --22               QUESTION:  I'm taking away from the23    argument the impression, and please correct me if I'm24    wrong, that you think there is a continuing role for25    the courts to examine the reasonableness of the52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    period of detention. 2               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I wouldn't take that 3    away, Justice Kennedy.  What I'm saying is there is a 4    continuing but modest role for the courts.  The 5    habeas courts will remain open.  I mean, the import 6    of one of Justice Souter's questions is that it's 7    already too long and if somebody raised that claim, 8    if there is another petition filed, a direct petition 9    now that Hamdi has counsel that's filed in this10    claim, and that claim is raised, we would be in court11    vehemently saying there is no role for the habeas12    court there.  There are troops still on the ground in13    Afghanistan.  It makes no sense whatsoever to release14    an individual detained as an enemy combatant in15    Afghanistan while the troops are still on the ground16    in Afghanistan.17               QUESTION:  But it may make every bit of18    sense to have an opportunity on the part of that19    individual, before someone other than an20    interrogator, to say, I am not the kind of person21    that they claim I am on the basis of which they are22    holding me.23               MR. CLEMENT:  Well, again --24               QUESTION:  The alternative is not give him25    some kind of a hearing or release him.53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1               MR. CLEMENT:  No, but the alternative is 2    to provide a means of allowing for a military process 3    to go forward.  It's not just the interrogator.  It's 4     the original screening team on the ground in 5     Afghanistan that, as I said before, released 10,000 6     individuals out of U.S. custody.  It's the screening 7     team in Guantanamo and then it is this annual review 8     process that will go forward.  Now that is a 9     tremendous amount of process that the executive10     branch is providing.11                QUESTION:  That we don't have yet.  It's12     still on the drawing board, the annual review.13                MR. CLEMENT:  That's quite correct,14     Justice Ginsburg, but I would say that for the time15     being, everything provided to date is more than16     sufficient.17181920212223   here and make the unreasonable sound reasonable.  But24   when you take his argument at core, it is, "Trust25   us."  And who is saying trust us?  The executive54Alderson Reporting Company           QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clement.Mr. Dunham, you have four minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS     MR. DUNHAM:  May it please the Court.Mr. Clement is a worthy advocate and he can stand up1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   branch.  And why do we have the great writ?  We have2   the great writ because we didn't trust the executive3   branch when we founded this Government.  That's why4   the Government is saying trust us is no excuse for5   taking away and driving a truck through the right of6   habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment that no man7   shall be deprived of liberty except upon due process8 of law. 910   citizen.  We're not talking about thousands.  One11   citizen caught up in a problem in Afghanistan.  Is it12   better to give him rights or is it better to start a13   new dawn of saying there are circumstances where you14   can't file a writ of habeas corpus and there are15   circumstances where you can't get due process.  Ithink not.We have a small problem here.  One16171819   can only be detained by law.  And here there is no20   law.  If there is any law at all, it is the           I would urge the Court not to go down thatroad.  I would urge the Court to find that citizens21   executive's own secret definition of whatever enemy22   combatant is.  And don't fool yourselves into23   thinking that that means somebody coming off a24   battlefield because they've used it in Chicago,25   they've used it in New York and they've used it in55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 Indiana. 2              The Congress needs to act here.  Justice 3   Souter was on point when he was talking about the 4    fact that we're two years into this thing and 5    Congress leaves all the laws on the books that relate 6    to habeas corpus and how a habeas corpus proceeding 7    is supposed to go.  They leave the 4001(a) on the 8    books that says no executive detention.  But we 9    ignore those laws, we don't enforce them.  We don't10    require Congress to fill a gap.11               Congress tomorrow could take these12    military regs and they could say, this is the law, we13    authorize the executive to detain people and to give14    them hearings the way the military says, and then it15    would be lawful.16               But Congress hasn't done that and I17    respectfully submit, Your Honors, that until Congress18    does act, these detentions are not lawful.  And I19    would respectfully ask this Court to step up to the20    plate and say so.21               QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dunham.
