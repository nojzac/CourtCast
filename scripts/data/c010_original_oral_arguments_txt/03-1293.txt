SAMEK               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MS. SAMEK:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) for the solepurpose of increasing the penalties for money launderingconspiracies.          Congress did not intend to abandon the overt actrequirement from money laundering conspiracies and forgood reason.  The list of specified unlawful activitiesunder 1956 is vast.          Anytime two or more people conspire or reach anagreement to commit a crime that generates economicproceeds, invariably the discussion will lead to whatthey're going to do with the money get -- that getsgenerated, how they're going to spend the money, which isa potential 1957 offense, or how they're going to hide themoney, a potential 1956 offense.  The Government wouldcharge these agreements as money laundering conspiracies31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425without there even being a single overt act to demonstratethat criminal intent had crystallized, that a moneylaundering conspiracy was really afoot, and that stepswere being taken to launder money, oftentimes triggeringsubstantially higher penalties for the underlying offense,and subverting -- subverting the overt act requirement forconspiracy to commit the underlying offense.JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just clarify one thing for me? Did they have to prove an overt act in order to establish venue?MS. SAMEK: Excuse me?JUSTICE STEVENS: Does the Government have to prove an overt act in order to establish venue?MS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue provision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies requires that they establish an overt act and that venue would lie --JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, your -- you say the -- the statute requires. I'm just asking if it independently of the conspiracy statute -- of the -- the substantive statute itself, how do they establish venue. Do they have to prove an overt act just for the purpose of getting a venue established --MS. SAMEK: Yes.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as they do --41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the only basis for2 venue? I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just3 one of the bases for venue.45 provision6 provision78 it say? 9MS. SAMEK:  Our position is that the venuein 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venuefor money laundering.JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but read it.  What doesJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Are we talking about section10 1956(i)? 1112 provision.13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And doesn't it allow it to be14 brought where venue would lie if the completed money15 laundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has16 been accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed?17 Isn't it an either/or?18 MS. SAMEK: Yes. Our position is that when you19 read the venue --20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So you don't have to read it21 as requiring venue. It's just requiring an overt act. If22 there is an overt act, then venue will lie, but it also23 will lie where the completed offense would have occurred.24 MS. SAMEK: Certainly, but where the completed25 offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts. You51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOMS. SAMEK:  Section 1956(i) is the venue￼1 know, it's inherent in completing the money laundering2 transaction that there would be overt acts as part of3 the financial transaction.4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would they state it in5 the alternative if -- why would they state it in the6 alternative if the overt act were always required? That's7 the --8 MS. SAMEK: I agree that it's -- it's somewhat9 confusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the10 Government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if11 two people conspired in -- if two people in Florida12 conspired to commit a money laundering offense in13 California, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy14 would lay in California.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't respond to16 the venue question. Venue, as written in this statute and17 in most statutes, is permissive. It gives you a choice of18 forum. It doesn't limit. In -- in the times when venue19 is exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that,20 but ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or,21 is permissive. It would be extraordinary to make a venue22 provision exclusive.23 MS. SAMEK: Well, this Court has made venue24 provisions exclusive in the patent infringement context25 and in the Banking Act precisely using the --61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this Court has no2 authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or3 permissive. Congress decides that.4 MS. SAMEK: And our position is that Congress5 made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I mean, one can understand7 that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may8 be brought in any -- in -- let's see -- may be brought in9 the district where venue would lie for the completed -- if10 it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act11 in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place,12 then we could13 venue or not.argue about whether that is the exclusive1415 that it's16 provision17 the district where the -- where venue would lie for the18 completed offense or in any other district where an act in19 furtherance took place. How can you possibly read that to20 say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in21 furtherance took place?22 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that those are the23 two alternatives for where venue would lie for a24 conspiracy case.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay, but -- but then --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOButthewhich says that a prosecution may be brought inI don't see how there is even an argumentexclusive venue when you're dealing with a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425then you acknowledge that the place where an overt acttook place is not the exclusive venue.          MS. SAMEK:  Our argument is that the firstclause of that provision contemplates the existence of anovert act.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the rule provisionfor venue, which has not been excluded by the statute?The ordinary provision for venue.          MS. SAMEK:  The ordinary provision for venuewould be that venue lies in the district where the crimeoccurs.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.          MS. SAMEK:  That would be -- in the moneylaundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h),that would be where the overt act occurs.  So it would beconsistent with it.  Our --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the crime is theconspiracy.  The overt act may be an additionalrequirement.          MS. SAMEK:  The overt act is part of -- it's ourposition that the overt act is required, and there needsto be an agreement --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you will -- you willconcede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracycrimes, in which an overt act is not required.  The81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Shabani case requires you to recognize that.2 MS. SAMEK: Correct. And in those cases where3 all that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie4 where the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the5 -- the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act,6 it's our position that that's where venue would lie.7 As a practical matter, if there is -- if -- if8 this Court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a9 practical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a10 money laundering conspiracy in one district and commit11 overt acts in another district in furtherance of that, it12 would be highly unlikely that there would not be some13 overt act in the district where they agreed to commit the14 offense.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that it16 doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be17 hard to prove.18 MS. SAMEK: As a --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are -- I mean, the20 difference between statutes that say overt act is required21 and those that just say conspiracy -- there are many, many22 such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani. But of23 all the statutes that include no express overt act24 requirement, have any of them been read to implicitly25 include one, which is the argument you're making that we91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 should adopt here?2 MS. SAMEK: That's correct. And no. There --3 we have not found any cases where the Court has heretofore4 read an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision.5 But this statute is unique. The money6 laundering statute is unique. If you look at the statute7 and we lay it out -- the statute in total -- in our reply8 brief, starting at 1a -- the structure of 1956 strongly9 supports our position that all Congress was doing, when10 they enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money11 laundering conspiracies. As this Court is well aware,12 when Congress typically writes a complex statute, the13 statute begins by setting forth all of the offense14 elements. Here, that would be set forth in (a)(1),15 (a)(2), and (a)(3). The statute then goes on in16 subsection (b) to set forth the civil penalty provisions.17 Subsection (c) then defines the various terms used in the18 act. Subsection (d) then talks about relationships with19 other laws. Subsection (e) identifies those Federal20 agencies that can investigate money laundering offenses.21 Subsection (f) talks about circumstances under which there22 would be extraterritorial jurisdiction. Subsection (g)23 then talks about recording -- reporting requirements, and24 then you get to subsection (h), which we say, when you25 read the statute as a whole, clearly intends simply that101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the penalty for money laundering conspiracies would beincreased to the same penalties as those prescribed forthe offense provision.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that there are otherstatutes that -- that read this way, which we have held to-- to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose thepenalty for it.          MS. SAMEK:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it -- it could do that.Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined inthis section shall be subject to the same penalties asthose prescribed for the offense.  And that could bedeemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe thepenalty for it.          MS. SAMEK:  It could be construed as afreestanding offense provision --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there are other suchprovisions, aren't there?          MS. SAMEK:  There are not any other offense --conspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted thathad the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, Shabani comes prettyclose, doesn't it?          MS.statute.  846SAMEK:  Shabani is a separate, distinctwas a separate, distinct, discrete offense11Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425statute.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- like this it seems to mecontains no express requirement of an overt act, and we'vesaid, indeed, none is required and that at common law itwasn't required.          MS.

SAMEK: It's9 incorporating the overt act requirement, the act in10 furtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the11 legislative history.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so -- if that's so,13 then why does the venue provision which you were just14 alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph15 (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. An16 offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought17 in -- and then it says -- (2) a prosecution for an attempt18 or a conspiracy offense under this section. Not under19 section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a20 conspiracy offense under this section.21 MS. SAMEK: And it would be an offense under22 this section because certainly the jury would need to find23 that the object of the conspiracy was money laundering.24 So it would be an offense in that respect.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I think that language131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOLet's get -- And they were making itgeneral conspiracy statute inour position that they're￼1 really cuts very hard against you. A conspiracy offense2 under this section. It -- it is reading as though that's3 the section that defines the offense, not just the section4 that 56 way, 78 man.9 1011 195612 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).13 In 1988 -- when the statute was originally14 enacted, (a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth the offense15 provisions. When the statute was amended in 1988 and16 Congress intended to create another offense provision,17 they set forth (a)(1) -- the third sting provision which18 is (a)(1)(iii). If Congress intended to create an offense19 provision when they enacted 1956(h), they would have set20 it forth as (a)(1)(iv), or alternatively, they would have21 added or conspires to each of the predecessor offenses.22 Notably, the offense provision at issue here23 does not include attempts, which 846 did, and which the24 overwhelming majority of conspiracy subsections include --25 attempts are included with offenses. The fact that141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOprovides the penalty.     MS. SAMEK:  I can see how you would read it thatYourHonor, but the offense --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Only because I'm a reasonable(Laughter.)     MS. SAMEK:  The offense provisions set forth inare clearly set out and enumerated in subsection￼1 Congress did not include attempts in this provision again2 reflects the fact that they were solely focused on 371, a3 conspiracy offense, and all they were trying to do was4 increase the penalty.5 The placement of the --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you would expect at7 least a cross reference to 371 for defining the8 conspiracy, but there's nothing here.9 MS. SAMEK: That's true, and it clearly would --10 it certainly would be clearer had they done so. But if11 you take the language originally, this provision was12 proposed by Representative Annunzio to be an amendment to13 371, and we lay out in our -- in the blue brief at page 1214 what that15 identical1617 you take the identical language and put it in section 371,18 there wouldn't be much of an argument, we would submit,19 that Congress surely intended to include the overt act,20 act in furtherance language and they were just talking22 makes our23 depending24 different25point that you look at the language, andon where it's placed in a statute, it can havemeanings.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You have given a few examples15amendment would have looked like, virtuallylanguage to 1956(h).Certainly if you read it in subsection 371 -- if21 about increasing the penalty for money laundering. That1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 of a word may mean different things in different contexts,2 but you haven't given any example -- and I don't know that3 there is one -- where the entire string of words is4 identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies,5 and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the6 other. I mean, you have a much harder argument to make7 when you're talking about an entire provision where the8 wording is almost identical than when you're talking about9 one word used in different contexts.10 MS. SAMEK: That's true, Your Honor, but as this11 Court said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the12 Court will presume that Congress intends to incorporate13 the common law concept of the terms that it uses. In14 Shabani, the defendant did not argue any contrary15 indications. They argued that at common law conspiracy16 required the commission of an overt act. That is not our17 position.18 But our position is that here there are contrary19 indications, and because the statute is ambiguous based on20 the placement and structure of 1956(h), you have to look21 to see if there are other indications. And clearly in the22 legislative history --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there's nothing in24 the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?25 MS. SAMEK: No, but that is not dispositive161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 because the placement the Congress has said -- I mean,2 this Court has said on multiple occasions that you need to3 read a statute as a whole, and when you look at the --45 you can't 67 Honor.89JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if you read it as a whole,find any ambiguity.MS. SAMEK:  I think you can find ambiguity, YourJUSTICE STEVENS:  In the text of the statute?MS. SAMEK:  In the --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Reading the whole text.MS. SAMEK:  Reading the whole text of the10 1112 statute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set13 off -- set forth at the beginning, followed by the civil14 penalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty15 provision for increasing conspiracies.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: None of which mentions an17 overt act.18 MS. SAMEK: No, it doesn't mention an overt act,19 but --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: So I don't find anything21 ambiguous in what you describe.22 MS. SAMEK: Well, we believe that 1956(h)23 clearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the24 penalty.25JUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps that's all they 171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they2 thought they were doing.3 MS. SAMEK: Well, if Congress inadvertently4 omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior5 occasions read into congressional silence terms,6 definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out.7 So in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question8 was whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the9 common law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals10 Amendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment11 Act had language that talked about a generic burglary,12 breaking and entering into a dwelling. In 1986, when they13 amended the act, they removed that language.14 The question before the Court then came up what15 does -- you know, what does burglary mean. Congress had16 omitted those words, but the Court found that that wasn't17 Congress' intent. They clearly didn't intend to revert18 back to the common law, and it was probably an error of19 drafting and this Court found that generic burglary was20 the standard. So this Court has done that before.21 In the -- in the Perrin case, United States v.22 Perrin, the same thing. There -- words were missing from23 the statute and the Court did not find that in Perrin --24 it was a bribery case, and what was at issue was whether25 or not the -- the statute covered bribery of private181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 persons or only the common law definition where it would2 only incorporate bribery of public -- public persons,3 public officials. And the Court said even though there4 are other statutes that have private person language in5 it, similar to this case, even though there are other6 statutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are7 not going to assume that Congress intended to revert back8 to the common law and interpret bribery as only applying9 to public officials.10 So this Court can look at the legislative11 history. The purpose is clear. The Government admits12 that the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty.13 Prior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were14 prosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission15 of an overt act. Congress clearly intended to increase16 the penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years,17 based on what the object of the conspiracy was. The18 legislative history all reflects that fact, and the19 Government admits that.20 The -- as contrasted with 846, which -- in which21 the public law described 846 in a section labeled offenses22 and provision in the money laundering context, the public23 law described 1956(h) as a penalty to increase the -- as a24 money laundering conspiracy for increasing the penalty.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- can I ask what you191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 make of subsection (d) of -- of this provision which says2 that violations of this section may be investigated by3 such components of the Department of Justice as the4 Attorney General may direct and by such components of the5 Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the6 Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to7 offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction,8 by the Postal Service?9 Apparently there was some turf war going on as10 to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and -- and11 this was meant to -- to solve the turf war, but it reads12 violations of this section.13 Now, does that allocation of authority among14 Justice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to15 the conspiracy offenses under section 371? Because that's16 not a violation of this section.17 MS. SAMEK: I'm not sure I understand your18 point. I would think that if it's a conspiracy to commit19 -- if the specified unlawful activity is one of the postal20 offenses or one of the customs offenses, both of which21 carry --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The offense is never completed.23 there's nothing -- nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and24 you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this25 section. This section sets forth the penalty -- that's201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 your argument -- but it does not establish the offense.2 The offense is established by 371. If that's the case,3 this allocation of responsibility among the various4 divisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy5 prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.6 MS. SAMEK: It's our position that when Congress7 enacted this, they were trying to enact a penalty-8 enhancing statute. 1956(h) then incorporates or impliedly9 recognizes the overt act requirement from 371. Congress10 was not intending to change the way money laundering11 conspiracies were prosecuted. They would have done so12 under 371, requiring the act in furtherance, and a jury or13 a judge would find that money laundering was the object of14 the conspiracy. That's how Congress envisioned this act15 as -- as being applied, and so I would assume Congress16 would envision that if it was a conspiracy to violate one17 of the postal offenses, that the postal authority would18 have had authority to investigate that offense.19 Interesting --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- excuse me. What21 -- what do you make of -- of this argument? Let's start22 with the premise that Congress wasn't thinking about overt23 acts at all. Start with the premise that you argue from24 that what Congress was concerned with here was primarily25 penalty. However, Congress did this in a context in which211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 there are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized2 kinds of -- of conspiracy formulations. And if one has3 the magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got4 to prove an overt act. In the other variety, there's no5 reference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't6 have to prove overt acts.7 Why isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to8 say, look, when there are recognized models and Congress,9 in fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going10 to get into the question of did Congress really mean to11 make a change when it picked one model rather than the12 other? It simply picked one model, and the -- the13 clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law14 is to apply the model. If it didn't talk about overt act,15 there's no overt act requirement. Why isn't that a16 sensible way to -- to work our way through these thickets?17 MS. SAMEK: I -- I think that would be a18 sensible way to work your way through thickets of statutes19 that were enacted after Shabani when this Court created20 that formulary.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But Shabani rested on -- on the22 existence of these prior models. Shabani didn't create23 them.24 MS. SAMEK: That's correct, but there is nothing25 in the legislative history to suggest that Nash and221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Singer, the cases that Shabani relied on, were ever2 discussed or contemplated by Congress. If Congress was3 going to make such a fundamental change in how they were4 going to prosecute money laundering conspiracies, they5 would have said so. We're not talking about a backdrop of6 not requiring an overt act and should Congress read an7 overt act into Congress' silence.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are about -- there are9 over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions10 with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act11 requirement. The -- the argument you're making, I12 suppose, would require this Court to go by -- one by one13 through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests14 of every one because the absence of those words is not15 dispositive, as you see it. So you would be generating a16 controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that17 just wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's18 approach.19 MS. SAMEK: Well, we don't -- we don't believe20 that's the case because if you look at all of those21 subsections in title 18, none of them have the structural22 ambiguity23 provision2425 think --that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue--JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Have you looked at all 59, I231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MS. SAMEK: The --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and assured yourself on3 that?4 MS. SAMEK: I've -- I've looked through the5 entire statute, and I have not found -- title 18. I have6 not found any that have both an anomaly, a structural7 anomaly, and a venue provision that turns on the existence8 of an overt act.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we've already dealt10 with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak11 since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a12 requirement.13 MS. SAMEK: Well, first of all, we would submit,14 just briefly on -- on the venue point, if Congress wanted15 this to be a permissive venue provision, they could have16 said venue would lie where and in the circumstances or as17 otherwise required by statute, in which case they could18 have shown that they were applying to other statutory19 bases for venue, as well as what Congress was establishing20 here. They didn't do that.21 The venue provision was enacted in response to22 this Court's decision in Cabrales, which dealt with the23 money laundering -- the substantive offense of money24 laundering, and this Court's suggestion that money25 laundering could be considered a continuing violation for241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425purposes of 18 U.S.C. 3237, the continuing offense venueprovision.  If all Congress was doing was codifying thatprinciple and trying to address the issue in Cabrales,they would have just dealt with substantive moneylaundering in the venue provision.  They would not havealso included a provision in the venue section dealingwith conspiracy.  The fact that they did and the fact thatthey used language that this Court has previously foundto --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It gave -- it gave theprosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.          MS.

I'm sorry.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Marcus.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. MARCUS:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          The money laundering conspiracy statute does notrequire proof of an overt act for three reasons.  First,the text of the statute contains no such requirement.Second, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 statute which this Court unanimously held in the Shabani2 case does not require proof of an overt act. Third, the3 statute was enacted against the background rule of4 statutory construction that -- that a conspiracy5 provision, whose text conditions liability on the act of6 conspiring only, will be construed to follow the common7 law, where proof of an overt act was not required for8 conviction.9 This Court should adhere to its bright line rule10 in this case because it provides clear guidance to11 Congress and to the lower courts.12 Petitioners seek to avoid application of the13 bright line rule on a variety of grounds, none of which14 has -- none of which has merit. I will address a few of15 those grounds here.16 First, the money laundering conspiracy statute,17 section 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the18 general conspiracy statute, section 371. Section 1956(h)19 does not contain any reference to section 371, and20 petitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United21 States Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined22 elsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is23 defined. Under petitioners' theory, if section 371 were24 repealed tomorrow, section 1956(h) would also no longer be25 valid. But there is --261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if 371 were repealed,2 would it affect the actual practice in the Justice3 Department? I -- I think I recall reading in the briefs4 for the other side that -- that the -- the United States5 has continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering6 cases under 371. Is that correct?7 MR. MARCUS: Well, my understanding is on -- on8 occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case.9 Where there are several objects to the conspiracy10 sometimes for purpose of simplification, the Government11 will just -- will charge a 371 --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But not in exclusively13 laundering cases.14 MR. MARCUS: Generally, no. There might be --15 there might be an occasional example where it may have16 been an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked17 section 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but18 generally speaking no. The money laundering conspiracy19 prosecutions were done under 1956(h).20 JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when you say when there21 are multiple objects, you're not getting the money --22 money laundering just under 371. You'd surely charge both23 under 371 and under -- under -- what is it? 1956.24 MR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.25 You could. You could prosecute -- you could prosecute271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 them as -- as separate offenses, but sometimes the2 Government for -- just for purpose of simplification will3 just charge one -- one agreement with multiple objects,4 and one of those objects might be a money laundering5 object.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were just money7 laundering, could you charge under 371?8 MR. MARCUS: Yes, you could charge under 371.9 There's nothing that prevents the Government from doing10 so. This Court has -- has held before, for example, in11 the Batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions12 that essentially cover the same conduct, and the13 Government has discretion to choose which one to use.14 Generally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy15 statute contains higher penalties. So the practice today16 is -- is to prosecute those offenses under section17 1956(h).18 Another -- another reading there -- another19 reason they're reading that it's a penalty provision20 should be rejected is that Congress modeled section21 1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually22 identically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes23 that the drug conspiracy statute establishes a24 freestanding criminal offense.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is 846.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 23 enactment4 prosecute5 section 371, that this Court should presume that Congress6 intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of7 section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense.8 But this Court looks, first, to the text of the9 statute to discern Congress' intent, and had CongressMR. MARCUS:  846, yes, in title 21.Petitioners also argue that because prior toof section 1956(h), the Government had tomoney laundering conspiracies for 6 years under10 wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement,11 it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h)12 on the language from 371 or on the language from any of13 the other14 contained1516 conspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court17 held in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement.18 By choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not19 to require proof of an overt act because at the time it --20 because at the time it acted, the background rule of21 statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute22 that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring23 would be construed to follow the common law.24 Petitioners point to silence in the legislative25 history, but the silence in the legislative history on the291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOnumerous conspiracy provisions in the code thatexpress overt act requirements.Congress chose a different model, the drug￼1 overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling2 evidence of -- of contrary intent that would justify3 departing from the text of the statute and this Court's4 bright line rule.56 for money7 enacted 98 statute at issue here. That venue provision reflects9 Congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in10 which money laundering cases can be brought. It does not11 reflect an intent to redefine the -- the elements of the12 substantive money laundering conspiracy offense.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the -- the14 argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that --15 the reference to any other district where an act in16 furtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the17 clause preceding, they were referring to a district in18 which an act in furtherance took place?19 MR. MARCUS: Justice Souter, I think what --20 what that terminology was -- was referring to was21 district. The other is meant to modify district. In22 other words, the first -- the first clause there provides23 a venue where the case can be brought. And if it's not24 brought in that -- if it doesn't fall within that venue,25 then you can bring it in -- in a different district, an301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOFinally, petitioners rely on a venue provisionlaundering cases, section 1956(i), which wasyears after the money laundering conspiracy￼1 other district. I think that's the -- the best way to2 read the -- the statute. I mean, otherwise, it could have3 -- as it was pointed out during petitioners' argument,4 otherwise they could have just had one. They wouldn't5 need separate clauses. They could have just had one6 clause that said, and the case -- the conspiracy case can7 be brought in any district where an overt act was8 committed.9 Petitioners seize on the fact that the venue10 provision permits venue to be laid in any district in11 which an overt act was committed. But the rule in12 conspiracy cases has always been that an overt -- that13 venue can be laid where an overt act was committed14 regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the15 offense. At common law, as I said before, conspiracies --16 a conspiracy conviction did not rely -- depend on proof of17 an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common18 law where an overt act was committed.19 The common law venue rule has been applied20 consistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such21 as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not22 require proof of an overt act as an element of the23 offense.24 Congress' codification in the money laundering25 statute of -- of this -- of this venue principle cannot be311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 read to presuppose an overt act element when the very2 venue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one.3 If this Court -- if this Court has no further4 questions --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: I had just one other question,6 just out of curiosity, about how important this case is.7 How many prosecutions under this statute does the8 Government bring without proving an overt act?9 MR. MARCUS: I'm -- I'm not aware of -- I'm not10 aware of a number, Justice Stevens.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any?12 MR. MARCUS: I -- I don't know. I mean, it's --13 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me quite unlikely.14 MR. MARCUS: Well --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering. It seems16 to me sort of a tempest in a teapot, this whole case to17 me.18 MR. MARCUS: Yes. I think it's true in the vast19 majority of cases, the Government does have proof of an20 overt act. And, of course, overt acts help establish the21 -- establish the agreement and -- and to convince the jury22 beyond a reasonable doubt there was an agreement.23 If the Court has no further questions --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I do have one and it's25 not on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 particular case, would it be consistent with the position2 that the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold3 the final disposition of this case pending Booker and4 Fanfan? Wasn't there a sentencing question?5 MR. MARCUS: Well, it's our position that it6 wasn't -- they didn't raise that issue in -- in the court7 of appeals. They didn't raise the Sixth Amendment issue8 in the court of appeals. They didn't raise that issue in9 their cert petition here, and so it's -- it's not covered10 by the -- by the question presented. So it is the11 position that we've -- that we've set out in the brief12 that it should not be -- it should not be held pending13 that -- that disposition in Booker and Fanfan.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's consistent with15 the position that the Government has been taking routinely16 in cases where Booker -- where the sentencing guidelines17 are an issue?18 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think in the -- I think19 that that position is based on petitions that have raised20 the question, I believe.21 If -- if the Court has no further questions, it22 should reaffirm the conspiracy statutes that do not23 contain an overt act requirement should not be read to24 include one. Thank you.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Marcus.331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 Ms. Samek, you have about 3 and a half minutes2 left.3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS5 MS. SAMEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please6 the Court:7 Justice Ginsburg, you had inquired about the8 number of subsection -- conspiracy subsections, and I9 didn't get a chance to answer your question. Even if you10 don't find the statute is unique because of the venue11 provision, as my review of the conspiracy subsections in12 title 18, there were only about two others out of the 50-13 some-odd cases that have the same structural anomaly that14 1956(h) does. So this would not be opening up a can of15 worms to say that in this case an overt act clearly was16 intended by Congress and that we need to look at17 congressional intent. So it wouldn't be -- require -- a18 holding in this case consistent with congressional purpose19 would not require the Court to then have to review every20 single title 18 conspiracy subsection.21 As the Government pointed out, money laundering22 cases are not typically prosecuted without the commission23 of an overt act because overt acts are relatively simple24 to prove. There's no reason why Congress would have25 intentionally eliminated the overt act requirement from341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 money laundering conspiracies when, on the one hand, it's2 easy to prove, but on the other hand, it placed such a3 critical value in money laundering conspiracies because4 it's not just that it shows that criminal intent has5 crystallized and that money laundering is actually afoot,6 but you're talking about taking offenses, like we say in7 our brief, where someone pledges a -- a cow for collateral8 for a loan and then they talk with a friend about whether9 or not they should sell the cow, and they decide not to10 sell the cow. Under the Government's theory, they11 couldn't be prosecuted for defrauding the Government12 because, in fact, they never sold the cow. They couldn't13 be prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud the Government14 because they didn't commit an overt act in furtherance of15 defrauding the Government. They couldn't be convicted or16 prosecuted for money laundering because they never sold17 the cow, so there were never any proceeds to generate.18 But they could be convicted, under the Government's19 theory, of conspiracy to commit money laundering based on20 the sale of a cow and their sentence would increase from a21 potential 5 years to a potential 20 years. There's22 absolutely no23 Congress ever24 substantially25 an overt act,1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400indication in the Congressional Record thatintended such dramatic triggering ofhigher penalties without the commission ofwhich is not difficult to prove.35Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Government has said that2 -- that you have essentially waived their sentencing3 guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your4 brief to consider.5 MS. SAMEK: In the district court, there were6 issues raised as to all defendants as far as various7 sentencing enhancements. In front of the Eleventh8 Circuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was9 rejected. As to Mr. Hall, one of the sentencing10 enhancements were argued and was reversed on that11 sentencing enhancement. But there is still a sentencing12 enhancement that was raised in the Eleventh Circuit, but13 it was not raised in this petition. It was not the issue14 that this Court granted cert on, but we would argue that15 it's still a valid -- a valid claim and that this Court16 should hold this decision in abeyance until its decision17 in Booker and Fanfan.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the argument below that --19 -- that imposing the sentencing enhancement was20 unconstitutional, or was the argument just that21 didn't support it?22 MS. SAMEK: The argument was that the23 didn't support it.24 Finally, Your Honor, we would -- Your25 would just again say that Congress did not intend to cause361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOthe factsfactsHonors, we￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a dramatic change in the way money laundering conspiracieswere prosecuted.
