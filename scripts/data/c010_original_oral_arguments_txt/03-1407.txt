KARLAN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MS. KARLAN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and mayit please the Court:          Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, thisCourt emphasized once again that statutory interpretationis a holistic process based on common sense, that thereading of the statute should look at all the words toavoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when thetext does not dictate it and the statutory historysuggests otherwise.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That was a case I dissented in,wasn't it?          MS. KARLAN:  Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia,I think even you will find our case more appealing.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, but -- but it is true youhave a strong textual --          MS. KARLAN:  We have an excellent textualargument.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was a little bit surprised 31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425at your opening because it seems to me you have a strongtextual argument you're now defending.          MS. KARLAN:  We do.  A holistic reading of thetext shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the BankruptcyCode --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What does a holistic readingmean?  Can you stay within the --          MS. KARLAN:  Absolutely.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- text and still be holistic?          MS. KARLAN:  I'm not going to look outside thetext at all.          A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) ofthe Bankruptcy Code, which is on -- in the petitioners'brief at pages 1 through 2 --mean?JUSTICE STEVENS:  What does the word holistic(Laughter.)          MS. KARLAN:  I think it means read all the wordsin the sense that makes the most sense to you rather thanplucking words at random or rather than looking at a wordartificially.  For example, when you look at a phrase likeon account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did inNorth LaSalle, account means a lot of different things,but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in thisstatute.41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the antonym would beparsimonious or something like that?          MS. KARLAN:  I think it'd be partial, but I'mnot sure.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let -- let me ask --          MS. KARLAN:  Sure.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- ask you this.  The -- thestatute does say that the right to receive a payment is onaccount of age, and that seems to me to be an argumentsomewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the paymenthas to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way,and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.          MS. KARLAN:  Yes, and I think payments aretriggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is astatute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy ofretirement payments.  For individuals --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, the problem for thecourt below was that the person covered can ask for it ina lump sum and pay a penalty.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right, and that's not --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And -- and that isn't then onthe basis of age.  Am I right?  Is that -- that was theproblem the court had below.          MS.had below.  IKARLAN:  Yes, that's the problem the courtthink it's an illusory problem for the5Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 following reason.2 It's clear that the right to receive full3 enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until4 one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events5 are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the6 estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking7 about here, and that's why --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say full9 enjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on10 something, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it? The11 only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the12 only thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax13 benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you14 can withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent15 tax.16 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, but the 10 percent17 tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a18 deterrent and a penalty.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm sure it does, but --20 but it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply21 because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm22 receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't23 make any sense to me.24 MS. KARLAN: Well, Justice Scalia, the way that25 I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because2 the holistic sense, the full reading of section3 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement4 savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled,5 or ill people, once they get to the point where those6 triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur.7 Those are the same triggering events --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as9 this money was in the plan, it was shielded from10 bankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited11 access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One12 thing that I don't know and may be of some significance,13 did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their14 employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would15 be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it16 over?17 MS. KARLAN: Northrop Grumman's policy is to18 require individuals who leave the company's employment to19 roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried20 to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they21 gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they22 were unable to do because of their health, they could have23 rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely24 exemptible.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Another employer's plan.71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they could not have keptit in this employer's plan?          MS. KARLAN:  No.  This employer did not permitindividuals to keep the money in the plan.  They were toldthey had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was a term of the planthat it -- you can remain in it only so long as you'reemployed?          MS. KARLAN:  Apparently so.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there any other plans thatare -- are entities clearly covered by the statute inwhich thetax?only effect of age is to enable you to avoid aMS. KARLAN:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  Well, then --MS. KARLAN:  Let me give you a couple --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- then you might persuade me.MS. KARLAN:  Let me give you a couple ofexamples --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.          MS. KARLAN:  -- that I think will be quitefamiliar.  A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to moneybefore you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, andyou pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so.81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          The Federal Government's thrift savings plan forFederal employees allows you to take a loan out of theplan and to pay the interest back into your own accountbefore you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially givingyou free use of the money.  If you don't pay the loanback, it's then treated as a -- as a distribution, and youpay the 10 percent tax penalty on it.          So that if you read this statute to -- not toinclude IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read thisstatute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modernforms of defined contribution pension plans or savingsplans.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.  That was what I wasgoing -- aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stockbonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in termsof allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?          MS. KARLAN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  I thought they were allin the same boat.  So what the effect of this rule is --of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail toqualify --          MS. KARLAN:  Yes, that's correct.  You wouldrender section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit.Excuse me.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MS. KARLAN: Yes. I -- I can see why you might2 have thought it was the Ninth Circuit.3 (Laughter.)4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it might be wrong anyway.5 (Laughter.)6 MS. KARLAN: Yes, yes.7 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the percentage amount8 of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before9 people are 59 and a half?10 MS. KARLAN: Well, in the Cilek case from the11 Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court12 there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.213 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under14 the penalty process.15 JUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the payment here --16 it says -- the statute uses the word payment. So suppose17 you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out18 of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?19 MS. KARLAN: It would be because it's the right20 to the future payments and not just the present payments,21 Justice Breyer.22 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so -- but I'm trying --23 what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take24 -- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person25 were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would2 not be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took3 out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty4 would be.5 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, Justice Breyer.6 But in order to protect the ability to take money out7 after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of8 the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a9 half, there won't be any money there for him to take out.10 And that's why the exemption extends not just to present11 payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also12 to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the13 debtor. And I can't emphasize --14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Karlan, let me ask15 something about that very point because the statute says16 that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of17 the debtor it's allowable.18 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Justice O'Connor.19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you aware of cases where20 the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all21 that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that.22 We'll just let you deduct X amount.23 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We24 cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the25 yellow brief on pages 19 through -- to 20, I think is111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 where we -- where we talk about --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we take this concrete3 case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something4 over $42,000.5 MS. KARLAN: Yes.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the claim here as to7 -- was part or all of that -- it would be some $54,000.8 MS. KARLAN: The claim was all that all of that9 was necessary. If I could give an example that I think10 Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a11 debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally12 require turnover of the entire IRA because people have13 time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has14 other retirement savings, for example, in a case from15 Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a16 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire17 IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is18 in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of19 at -- will also require turnover of at least part of the20 IRA. In this case --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what do the courts do22 if they say, well, my client might be ill or something23 like that? It seems to me --24 MS. KARLAN: Well, if the client is ill now,25 they get to keep it --121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. They -- they say my2 client is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something3 because -- I don't know -- there's a history of family4 illness or something.5 MS. KARLAN: There isn't a reported case that6 talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason7 of exempting the money.8 JUSTICE BREYER: It's -- I'm trying to figure9 out how -- how -- what the theory is. Is -- you say I10 have a right to receive payments because of age. And you11 say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent12 comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out13 before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus14 there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to15 have a right to receive because of age because the16 practical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the17 -- the younger person getting the money.18 So does the case then turn on that? I mean,19 suppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 4020 percent of the people took out the money before they were21 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then22 should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think23 of how does this analysis work. What's the right24 analysis? 25MS. KARLAN: I would say at the 1 percent and 80 131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425percent of the people are taking the money out, itwouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore.          But if I can give another statistic that mightbe helpful in thinking about this.  18 percent of theparticipants in large 401(k) plans who are under the ageof 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What percent?          MS. KARLAN:  18 percent in one of the surveys.And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exemptunder the bankruptcy --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they're taking out loansagainst it.  They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.          MS. KARLAN:  Well, but the loans because -- forexample, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interestis being paid back into your own account, it's essentiallyas close to taking out the money as you can get.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I still don't have your answerto the problem that bothered me at the first.  How -- howdo you reconcile your positions with on account oflanguage?  If the -- if your clients can take the money --just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then whyis it on account of age?          MS. KARLAN:  It -- it's not the -- if you lookat the statute -- and let me just work my way through itwith you.  It's the right to a payment under a stock141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on accountof illness.  And the question is what does on account ofmodify there.  I think the most natural and sensiblereading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, aplan that is because of disability, and the like.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you say that paymentdoesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.          MS. KARLAN:  I don't -- I don't think you needto read it that way, and I think the most sensible readinghere, especially given that the statute --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I think the logicalreading is that it -- it modifies payment.          MS. KARLAN:  Well, I -- I'm not sure that itdoes, but even if it did, Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Holistic for me.  What-- what does it -- what does it modify?  I mean, if youhad to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?          MS. KARLAN:  Well, this is again -- I know youdissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulouslycrafted statute.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I thought I was beingholistic yesterday, to tell you the truth.          (Laughter.)          MS. KARLAN:  Okay.  Okay.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But --151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. KARLAN:  Well --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but what does on account ofmodify?          MS. KARLAN:  I think what on account of modifieshere is the kind of plan out of which the payment iscoming.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where is that noun?          MS. KARLAN:  There are a variety of plans, stockbonus, pension --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The right to receive a paymentunder a stock bonus, pension --          MS. KARLAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- profit sharing, annuity, orsimilar plan or -- or contract.  It's a plan on account ofillness, an annuity?          MS. KARLAN:  Plans --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why -- why isn't it a right onaccount of?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's the right on account of.          MS. KARLAN:  Well, I think you can read iteither way and you'll get to exactly the same result.  Solet me read it the way that you've been reading it, whichis if you want to protect the ability of people who haveIRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have toprotect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425them to exercise their right to withdraw on account ofage.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, but -- but there still isa right to take payments at any time.          MS. KARLAN:  Justice -- Justice Kennedy, wedon't believe --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so then you're --you're --          MS. KARLAN:  -- that that's actually a right.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under that, you're giving the-- the language that follows it no meaning.          MS. KARLAN:  No, Justice Kennedy, I don't thinkthat's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't thinkthat's what I'm doing is because this statute clearlyrefers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that'sentitled to exemption.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But as purely English -- aspurely English, I read it as saying it's a right.  What isthat right?  The right is a right to receive a payment onaccount of age.  That's the -- a plan.  That's the right.          Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is thatyes, it's true you also have a right under certainconditions to take it without respect to age.  So what wehave here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.MS. KARLAN: That's correct. 171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a kind that gives you aright to take it with a penalty and a right to take itbecause of age without a penalty.  And thus, the questionis, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind ofrights covered?  And the language doesn't answer it.So --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But under Justice Breyer'shypothetical, that's just like a savings account.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MS. KARLAN:  No.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, because the savings accountdoesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't havethe -- the penalty.  Isn't your argument that you've gotto read the right as meaning a right without penalty,because if you don't read it that way, then every one ofthese other retirement instruments is likewise going tofail?  Isn't that your -- your strong point?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's your strong point.          MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.  That's -- that'sour strong point and we're sticking with it.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Right -- it's not aright if you have to pay a penalty for it.          MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.  It's not a right,as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.3 MS. KARLAN: And I think no matter how --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good argument. I like5 that.6 MS. KARLAN: Thank you.7 (Laughter.)8 MS. KARLAN: No matter how you read the statute,9 it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the10 statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not11 cover many of the other --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't Congress just put13 in IRA's along with the other things?14 MS. KARLAN: They did, Justice Ginsburg. They15 did in the last line of the statute.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's sort of an17 oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put18 it together with the other string of plans?19 MS. KARLAN: Well, my best guess as to why they20 didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions21 statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they22 stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: What --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What your -- what your25 opponents say is that the -- the thing at the end doesn't191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that2 some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw3 until -- until you reach a certain age. And if they're4 structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to5 mention 408 in the -- in the exceptions. What's wrong6 with that argument?7 MS. KARLAN: Well, what's wrong with that,8 Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're9 administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service10 sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early11 withdrawal. So under their theory, there has -- there is12 not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in13 the United States --14 1516 the money17 half.1819 couldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very20 plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a21 technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or22 brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want23 the IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust24 in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific25 conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SOUTER:  Well --MS. KARLAN:  -- that had that inability to takeout subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and aJUSTICE SOUTER:  Do -- do we know that?  I mean,￼1 mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create2 an IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit3 suggested it might be?4 MS. KARLAN: I don't necessarily think so for5 the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products.6 They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people7 buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms.8 If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's9 the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form10 that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also11 gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to12 penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held13 to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax14 code. You then lose the ability to deduct the15 contributions going in. You then lose the ability to16 defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the17 account.18 Now, to answer the last part of your question,19 one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 520 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that21 essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a22 matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors.23 Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's24 are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And some don't. And the --211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and the State systems vary.          MS. KARLAN:  That's correct, but only fourStates offer no protection to IRA's from creditors asopposed to --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As opposed to how many whodo?          MS. KARLAN:  46 States offer some kind ofprotection.  23 States protect them without limit inbankruptcy and out.  6 of them protect them inside ofbankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as theamount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor'ssupport.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that's what -- with thepurpose that we're talking about now --          MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- if it's only 6 that, facedwith a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.          MS. KARLAN:  No.  No.  23 of them would protectall IRA's.  6 would protect all IRA's if the money in themis necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6.  6more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as itwas deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before thedebtor filed for bankruptcy.  3 of them will protect allIRA's up to a dollar amount.  In Nevada, the dollar amountis $500,000.  8 States use, as their State exemption law,221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 an IRA that -- a statute that has exactly the same2 language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State3 statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to4 protect IRA's.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here there was no choice6 of picking up on the State?7 MS. KARLAN: There's a -- there's a weird8 anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law9 does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy10 courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to11 protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the12 Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means13 that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person14 in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his -- in his15 IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than16 electing the State exemptions.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And one train that we didn't18 finish before. You were explaining that in this case the19 entire $55,000 -- that entire sum would be needed -- would20 be necessary for the support of the debtors.21 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. The bankruptcy22 court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably23 necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't24 come within the meaning of section 522.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- that was your231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425claim, and I --          MS. KARLAN:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How did you come to thatconclusion, that the entire amount?          MS. KARLAN:  Well, if you take, say, $55,000 andyou ask what sort of annuity could you purchase whenhit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be anannuity that, I would guess -- you know, I -- I hatemath in my head like this.  I'd guess it would throwcouple of hundred dollars a month in additional income.          And so if you ask will the Rouseys need thatmoney for their support, I think the answer is yes becausetheir only other support --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well.  Oh, yes.          MS. KARLAN:  -- is Social Security and a $2,000a month defined benefit plan that will never go up andagainst which their Social Security will be offset.  Sowhen they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is aboutto be, for Social Security, that defined benefit planreduces their benefits.  So if the Rouseys are to have anold age in which they can afford to live in any kind ofreasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I go back and just naildown one lose end in -- in an answer that you -- you gaveto my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable?

We don't have an     amicus brief here from the Government, do we?               MS.

KARLAN:  Well, I -- I don't think they've     taken a position here.  I will say that in Patterson     against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in     their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section     408.               JUSTICE SCALIA:  There -- they never go     bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against     any exemption from the --(Laughter.)251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS.

TheUnited States trustee may have wanted them to -- I'd liketo reserve the remainder of my time.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. McKiever.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF COLLI C. McKIEVER                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MS. McKIEVER:  Justice Stevens, may it pleasethe Court:          Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of theBankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment isnot exempt unless two requirements are met.  First, theright to receive the payment must be on account ofillness, disability, death, age or length of service, andthe right must come from a specified similar plan orcontract.  Because neither of those elements is satisfiedin this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it -- is it the case thatother plans that are clearly covered by the text of thisstatute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?          MS. McKIEVER:  Yes and no, and let me explainthat.  Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certainfactors.  Those are enumerated based -- based upon eachindividual plan.  However, they do not permit withdrawalsfor any reason at any time for any purpose.JUSTICE SCALIA: Not a single one of them. 261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. McKIEVER:  Not a single one of them.  Now,of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but noneof the plans that I have ever seen, as the specifiedplans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any ofthose, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you'd say that if one ofthem did, it would also not be covered.          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.  It -- it isthought --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I take it -- in -- in answeringJustice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say thatnone of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigmexample plans are, however, as -- as restricted as thelanguage in this -- this statute would suggest that it hadto be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.          MS. McKIEVER:  There are --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, they're all alittle bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinfulas -- as you say the -- the 401 -- the -- the IRA is.          MS. McKIEVER:  That -- that is correct.  The --there probably are plans out there -- once again, thereare so many plans.  And those are created by financialinstitutions, by employers, by different entities.  Sotherefore there are thousands of variations of those.271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, why? Okay. Once you're2 down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a3 plan that says you get the money because of age but you4 also can get the money without respect to age in certain5 circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now,6 that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you.7 So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the8 language as the other that you want to say even though9 that is literally true, this plan is very different from10 the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's11 what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved12 by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of13 holistic.14 So -- so the -- the point that I would like to15 know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as16 pensions -- I do. I think of it that way. I don't know17 much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help18 when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing19 in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is20 this different from the others?21 MS. McKIEVER: This is different because this is22 the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at23 any time for any purpose. It is also --24 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but -- but -- and25 you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct.2 JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know why that3 difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or4 less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're5 60, 59 and a half.6 MS. McKIEVER: Because the right to -- to7 receive the payment, the right to access the money at any8 time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it9 does not meet the language of the statute. The statute10 very specifically --1112 point and13 following14 1516 that there can be plans where you can get the money not17 having to do with age, and they fall within the language18 of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But19 this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the20 purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.21 MS. McKIEVER: Because there is no causal22 connection between any of the factors that are enumerated23 in the statute and the right to receive the money. And24 that is --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I --291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I -- you've missed myI'm sorry.  I put you on the wrong track with myup.  I shouldn't have.MS. McKIEVER:  I'm sorry.  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is we all agree￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was anabsolute prohibition, would you agree -- on gettingmoney before you're 59 and a half, would then thatqualify?          MS. McKIEVER:  Absolutely, yes, it would.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Now, what if there werepercent penalty?thea 50          MS. McKIEVER:  Clearly, there's a point at whichit would qualify as a prohibition more than just --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And what is it that makes it aprohibition?  Is it -- is it because the purpose is todeter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economicallyunacceptable?  What -- what is the reason for drawing theline somewhere above 10 percent?          MS. McKIEVER:  The reason for drawing the lineis because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has statedin -- in the Huebner case, it -- it said that it's aminimal penalty.  However, there is still the unfetteredaccess that's available.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what is the purpose ofimposing any penalty at all?          MS. McKIEVER:  I would assume as a disincentiveto -- to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition,such as the -- the parking --301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But 50 percent would not be aprohibition and neither would 90 percent.          MS. McKIEVER:  It would not be a prohibition,but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10percent.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it's a matter of degreerather than a difference in kind.          MS. McKIEVER:  Clearly that -- it's a verydifficult line to draw.  I -- I can't make that call atthis moment, but --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seems to me the easiestblack letter rule is no tax or some tax.  I mean, if itwas totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'dbe dead right.  But the fact that for a -- an importantpurpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to meputs it into the category of things that are -- you're notsupposed to have an absolute right to get.          MS. McKIEVER:  But the -- the hallmarkdifference here is that it -- it is the only type ofaccount that you can access paying the penalty for anyreason --reason.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume --MS. McKIEVER:  -- regardless of the specifiedJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that your answer to 311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference withregard to the purpose of the statute is that the purposeof the statute is to make sure that people have money fortheir retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for anyreason whatever, there is no security that that money willbe there for their retirement; whereas if you limit thereasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number ofemergency reasons, the chances the money will be there forthe retirement are much higher.          MS. McKIEVER:  Well, that -- that's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that the answer?          JUSTICE BREYER:  But if that's the answer,excellent.  So now we have --          (Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- let's say --          MS. McKIEVER:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's try -- let's try amillion percent tax and nobody in history has everwithdrawn the money.  Now, would -- that you would saywould fall within this.          MS. McKIEVER:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine, yes.          MS. McKIEVER:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, if that would fallwithin this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that 321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice2 Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar3 that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from4 withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old5 age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent6 tax in a world that is imperfect?7 MS. McKIEVER: Because clearly the -- the access8 of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement,9 just as -- as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the14 JUSTICE SCALIA: All15 Say -- say retirement, not old16 -- it's not that bad --17 (Laughter.)18 JUSTICE BREYER: 93.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if that is going to be20 your criterion, the -- the total freedom for any purpose,21 then why, if we accept your argument, why -- why don't we22 face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of23 daunting future? Because the -- the question then is24 going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to25 old age to -- to allow for a continued exemption and how331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO10 -- the debtors to -- to access freely for any purpose,11 clearly not showing that -- that it would be for12 retirement purposes.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Butattachment of the --right, but it's acquired.age.  I mean, you know, 60￼1 free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA2 category. You told us a few moments ago -- and I'm sure3 you -- you were right -- that the kind of the paradigm4 example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in5 which employers set them up. So if -- if we say that the6 -- the dividing line is going to be between plans under7 which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in8 which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then9 we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans.10 Aren't we?11 MS. McKIEVER: Not necessarily. The -- the line12 that we're really looking to is that there has to be a13 direct causation factor between one of the five specified14 factors such as on -- on account of factors, age,15 disability, death, length of service, and the right to16 receive the payment.17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but typically these18 plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and19 other plans that are mentioned in the act allow20 withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or21 something like that. I mean, you -- we would just have22 endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what23 doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to24 draw here.25 MS. McKIEVER: Well --341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And every plan that I know ofallows withdrawal if you terminate employment.          MS. McKIEVER:  And that's typically --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  In fact, that's what happenedto these people.          So I just don't see how your argument is goingto --          MS. McKIEVER:  Well, the -- the ability toaccess the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to dowith the length of service, the years in service becausethey accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the fullpercentage.  They're not fully vested until that time.          Also, with the -- when there are multiplefactors existing in the right to receive the payments,each multiple factor can be a cause of the -- of theability to reach the money.  When there are no meaningfulfactors imposed, though --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Isn't it simpler to justrecognize that these plans are covered despite the rightto withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statutethat only permits the deduction to the extent reasonablynecessary for the support?  I mean, that -- that seems tome a fall-back position that's provided for in thestatute.MS. McKIEVER: I understand that -- that may 351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as2 -- taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if3 it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts,4 whether they are truly retirement accounts or -- or if5 they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify6 under this statute. If -- if you want to open it up and7 -- and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under8 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on9 what can be potentially exempt under that statute.10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No. Well, obviously, it's --11 it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be12 a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or13 similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.14 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it includes IRA's16 apparently because of the last provision in the statute17 referring back to individual retirement acts under section18 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.19 MS. McKIEVER: The section 408 reference is --20 does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is21 a further condition to place on the -- the exemption.22 First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum23 requirements for an IRA to qualify as a -- as a tax-24 favored plan. That --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Karlan says she361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425doesn't know of any -- of any IRA that did place a -- arestriction which would bring it within that exemptioneven though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within theexemption.  Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that --that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?          MS. McKIEVER:  Absolutely.  Those arecustomizable plans.  Any person can go into --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  They can, but do -- do you knowthat there's -- there's one out there?  I don't know --          MS. McKIEVER:  I -- I do know of several outthere.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You didn't just draw one up forthis case, did you?(Laughter.)          MS. McKIEVER:  I did not create one for thiscase.  No, I did not.          But they -- they definitely exist.  In fact, inthe Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit BankruptcyAppellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior tothe filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected thatshe would only receive periodic payments based upon herage, and that was found to be exempt by the BankruptcyAppellate Panel because that qualified.  The payments werebased upon her age, and it was then ashe could not access the funds at any37similar plan becausetime but only forWashington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the specified reason such as age.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was that -- was that an IRAthat she had?  It was an IRA?          MS. McKIEVER:  My understanding is, yes, it wasunder section 408(b) was -- that's my understanding basedupon that case.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me -- let me ask you.Maybe this is irrelevant, but were -- were theserestrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under thoseterms in contemplation of bankruptcy?  If the answer isno, why would anyone so restrict his -- his IRA?          MS. McKIEVER:  I -- I do not know if that onespecifically was, but no.  These have not been set upthrough --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But why -- why would anyone dothat?  They're -- they're qualified without theserestrictions.  Why would anyone want to cut off his -- hisrights to -- to withdraw?          MS. McKIEVER:  Clearly to protect the moneypotentially for retirement and -- and just as --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, like setting upa personal spendthrift trust?          MS. McKIEVER:  That's --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I want to make it tough sothat I -- I will not be tempted to withdraw.  Is that the381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 motivation?2 MS. McKIEVER: Well, that would potentially be a3 motivation because clearly the money is there readily4 accessible at any time to -- to buy anything that the5 debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 306 or 40 years old can liquidate their -- their IRA account,7 whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't8 have that910 title, on11 it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress12 trying to fool people?13 (Laughter.)14 JUSTICE BREYER: Was the Federal Trade15 Commission? Should they investigate? What -- I mean, the16 -- the -- I think of it as an account that's basically17 aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at18 retirement, which has usually to do with age.19 MS. McKIEVER: Well, the -- the name is clearly20 not determinative.21 Also, Congress in the -- in the --22 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm reading the statute and if23 I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think24 of the word individual retirement account, is there any --25 I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOkind of access --JUSTICE BREYER:  Should we put any weight on thethe name?  I mean, I -- I can't but thinking￼1 of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any2 indication, when people passed this, that they didn't3 think they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible4 words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?5 MS. McKIEVER: Yes. First of all, Congress did6 historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status7 overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account8 is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set9 forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e) -- 522(d)(10)(e)10 requirements that -- that are much more stringent in the11 requirements of the traditional IRA.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are they? Because13 there was one statement -- I think it was in Ms. Karlan's14 brief -- that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans15 permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on16 payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which17 was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially18 identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as19 long as you're willing to pay the penalty.20 MS. McKIEVER: That's a misnomer that that's a21 -- a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow22 as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to23 payment. They have the right to borrow the funds.24 However -- for example, in the New York Police Department25 pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of theirpension plan funds.  However, they -- as long as they'reemployed there, they have to continue to repay that.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what if they don'trepay it?  What's the sanction?          MS. McKIEVER:  There is a 10 percent penalty.However, as the bankruptcy --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But what -- where -- wherewould the -- where would the principal repayment comefrom?  I assume it would come from deducting whatever thebalance was from the -- the person's account.          MS. McKIEVER:  That would be correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, we call it -- the --the loan feature then boils down to a -- a withdrawalsubject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if thatobligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will beexactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deductwhatever the balance is from the person's rights under theplan.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Plus 10 percent you say.          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.  However --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's just -- just like anIRA.          MS. McKIEVER:  But -- but this is in thebankruptcy context, which makes it completely different.411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a2 picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the3 bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the4 debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor5 has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-6 year look-back period. But because it's a picture in7 time, it's what the -- the debtor can reach is what the --8 the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that9 -- that the debtor owns. This is very different than the10 pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have11 -- have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the12 bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there,13 would be present at the retirement. But because they14 could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their15 creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy16 trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the17 ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially18 reach.19 There are other exemptions, of course, set forth20 in -- in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry,21 but the assets that are not exempt are readily available22 to repay creditors, for -- for the benefit of the23 creditors. Therefore, that -- that makes it24 significantly --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Subject to the 10 percent if421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the bankruptcy trustee does that?          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.  That's correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  The -- the penalty still has tobe paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out topay the creditors, on your view.          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.  Yes, they do.They do.          Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are -- byallowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the otherplans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much morelike a savings account.  It's not any form of deferredcompensation.  They can't look to that to fill a salaryvoid after they retire because the money may not be there.Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, theycould have liquidated those funds prior to their reachingany age or any illness that -- that may befall them.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there -- there is nopenalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account,and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.  That is correct.That is correct.          But the -- the key here --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me just get -- get straightwhat -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have infront of us here.  Do you assert that there are no other431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permitwithdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.  None of thespecified plans listed, the -- the ones enumerated.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would permit withdrawal for anyreason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.          MS. McKIEVER:  That's correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  None of them is like that.          MS. McKIEVER:  None of them is like that.  Theyall have specific factors.  There has to be a causalconnection between the ability to access the money.          Additionally, it's very important that -- thatan account or plan that qualifies under the statute -- ithas to be determined on a case-by-case basis.  And there'sno question that there are definitely IRA's that -- thatcould and do qualify for this exemption.  It is, instead,that --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do -- do you disagree withMs. Karlan that this is -- this is a standardized productso the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn'tget a tailor-made IRA?  They would have to take thestandard product.          MS. McKIEVER:  That's not -- that's not correct.There are many customizable products that are -- are outthere.  In fact, for example, when employers set up441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and2 they can choose from many different options. For example,3 they can choose if they even have a -- a loan provision4 built into a -- a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the5 IRA. They -- they can be customized because section 4086 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify7 for tax-favored status. That -- that is an Internal8 Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit9 additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it10 allows the -- the individual or the employer because some11 -- there are two different types of IRA's that can be set12 up by an employer -- to go and customize those so that13 they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.1415 allow you16 reason --17 1819 I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for -- for20 a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What21 -- what is the sanction?22 MS. McKIEVER: My understanding is that -- is23 that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed24 by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that -- that25 is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SCALIA:  These -- these other plans thatto withdraw for certain reasons but not for anywhat happens if you withdraw for any reason?MS. McKIEVER:  That --JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the sanction against --￼1 Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds2 in the -- she could no longer reach the corpus of the3 account. The -- the lump sum of money was there for her4 retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the5 money is not protected at any time. There's no6 prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds7 from the account other than the payment of the penalty.8 But whether an account or plan qualifies under9 the statute, it -- it -- you look at the language of the10 plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument11 renders the terms of the statute superfluous because,12 first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans,13 and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the14 money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is15 not based upon any factor other than the -- the account16 holder wanting to withdraw the funds.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: The right to receive18 100 percent is -- is dependent on a factor, isn't it?19 MS. McKIEVER: Yes, it is.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. At least as to the 1021 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get22 that money unless you have a certain age.23 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. Unless you have24 -- or another factor such as for education or for a home25 loan, something like that. There are several different461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 reasons that you can -- you can reach the money and not2 pay a penalty.3 However, the penalty is not -- is not the4 deciding factor. It's their ability to access5 at any time that -- that makes that a right of6 It's not a right of payment without a penalty.7 that the right to payment exists at all times.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't dispute9 that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's,10 in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.11 MS. McKIEVER: That -- that -- that is --12 appears to be correct. I don't have those exact13 statistics, but yes, that -- that appears to be correct,14 that they have -- that they may not exercise that at -- in15 great numbers.16 First of all, going back to the causation factor17 about the -- the ability of the debtors to withdraw the18 funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 20319 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean20 because of, and that -- that is a key point here because21 if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is22 not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case,23 this Court found that that reading, the because of24 reading, absolutely applies to this section of the -- the25 Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOthe fundspayment.It's justthat --￼1 direct causal connection is required between the right to2 receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In3 -- in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever4 between the right to receive the payments5 of the factors enumerated in the statute.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: The words, on7 this -- this statute are sort of unusual,8 construe them, because really the payment9 the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things.10 You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be11 better if it said a payment for which you became eligible12 for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on13 account of all of these things. You may get the same amount14 whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms15 of the plan are.16 MS. McKIEVER: That's correct. There are, of17 course, always some other factors, such as you have to18 first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But19 once those barriers are passed, then -- then the right to20 receive the payment has to be at least --21 causes must be one of these factors. And22 enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for23 must be an enumerated reason in the plan.24 And the -- with the penalty, only the avoidance25 of a penalty is based upon the -- the age of the debtor or481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOand -- and anyaccount of, inno matter how youis on account ofone of theit has to beany reason, but￼1 the -- or any of the factors. It's -- section2 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status3 or to the4 It's only56 ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument7 prevails, then these other plans would be affected asright to receive the payment without penalty.the right to receive the payment overall.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does your argument draw a8 well.9 MS. McKIEVER: Only to the extent that -- that10 they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in11 the statute. If -- if they are available for payment at12 any time for any reason, then -- then they would not13 qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're14 payable for -- for one of the factors and that there's a15 direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and16 -- and the factors, then -- then they would qualify for17 the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It18 is just the types that -- currently that the petitioners19 would have or that people would have that would allow the20 access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the21 trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for22 exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all23 the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose.24 There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist,25 that can exist. It's just that people have set these up491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they2 access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to3 access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory4 requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can5 and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that6 the petitioners' don't.7 The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well8 settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for9 approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar10 plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and11 that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to12 claim this exemption. The -- the debtors knew or -- or13 potentially should have known that -- that their IRA's14 were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time15 that they filed because of the way that -- that these had16 been construed for a long period of time. So that they17 could have set up accounts that did qualify for such18 exemption, but -- but they did not restrict their access19 in that way.20 Thank you.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. McKiever.22 Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're23 not required to use it all.24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN25 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. KARLAN:  I'm going to retire early.          (Laughter.)          MS. KARLAN:  The -- the first point is thatthere are two rights under IRA's:  the right after age 59and a half or upon death or disability or illness towithdraw the money without any kind of penalty; andthere's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiaryright, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to apenalty earlier.  The existence of that second entirelysubsidiary, almost never used right -- and the statisticon this is in the green brief at page 23 -- means that thereal essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age.          The second point.  As this Court said lastyear --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't really have a rightto receive it on account of age.  You have a right toreceive it without a penalty on account of age.          MS. KARLAN:  Well, at the age of --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't the right to receivethe money that depends on your age.  It's the right toreceive the money without paying a tax.          MS. KARLAN:  Well, that's a right that's veryimportant because let me give you just a mathematicalexample of the difference.JUSTICE SCALIA: It is a right that's important, 511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425but it's not what the statute says.  The statute says --          MS. KARLAN:  The statute gives that right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the right to receive apayment on account of, among other things, age.          MS. KARLAN:  And you do have that right.  Youalso have another right.  But the existence of that secondright doesn't negate the first right.  The statute doesn'there, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of theBankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you -- aplan is eligible only if you have solely the right toreceive on this --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but it lists the otherreasons:  on account of illness, disability, death, age,or length of service.  And -- and, you know, when you havea list like that, you would think that the right toreceive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn'tqualify.  I mean, I would think that that's --          MS. KARLAN:  That might be your first thought,but then --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or -- or at least -- at leastsome other reason that isn't closely related to those.          MS. KARLAN:  Oh, but I think even if that wereyour first thought, you would then get to the implicationthat many of the Justices have been pressing today, whichis the implication of that for all plans is tremendous521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because all plans give -- well, I shouldn't say all plans,but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k)plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give youearly access to your money, and that's valuable to you.          That's why in section --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is it true that none of themgive unfettered access?  They're all qualified in somefashion.  Do you agree with that?          MS. KARLAN:  Well, the qualification of hardshiphas been interpreted by many employers to say, you want tobuy a house and you can't otherwise?  That's a hardship.You want to sent your kid to school and you can'totherwise?  That's a hardship.  You have huge, you know,consumer loans and you could consolidate that?  That's ahardship.  So it's not as if IRA's operate differentlyfrom everything else in the system.  That's why --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, yes.  You -- you don'thave to make up a hardship.  You just say I want themoney.  Okay, you want the money?  Here's the money.          MS. KARLAN:  I think that's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't even have to lie aboutthe hardship.  I mean --(Laughter.)          MS. KARLAN:  I need the money.  I don't have themoney.  That's a hardship.  If you -- if all you have to531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why wewould say IRA's are similar plans or contracts becausethis Court has made it clear similar is not the same thingas identical.  So if similar reasons allow you towithdraw, that's enough.          And that's why in section --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  In any of these other plans,can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay apenalty?          MS. KARLAN:  As I read the New York City --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Without any qualification fordisability, illness.  No.  I just want the money.  Give methe money and I'll pay you 10 percent.  Is there any planthat works like that?          MS. KARLAN:  I don't know, but the New York CityPolice Department plan appears to work like that.  You cantake the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Has any judge ever taken the-- adopting Justice Scalia's approach, thatcan't put the whole IRA -- exempt the whole IRA,view thatwhile youbut you can exempt 10 percent of it?          MS. KARLAN:  Not to my knowledge.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  At least you ought to get thatmuch, it seems to me, under his -- his analysis.MS. KARLAN: We'd be happier with 10 percent 541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that2 way.3 The second point is a point that comes out of4 this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the5 Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a6 line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one7 that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of8 section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that9 section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans10 or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section11 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal12 Revenue Code, which IRA's do.13 And this may have led to some of the confusion,14 I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the15 Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money16 under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement17 account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an18 individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we19 know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you20 put money into while the money accumulates before you're21 ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that22 are customizable.23 And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need24 the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the25 unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist atall or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea thatthey would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank fora customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible.          That's why we think the most sensible reading ofthe statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in themis necessary for the support of the debtor.          Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40056Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
