UnitedStates.            Mr. Srinivasan.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. ChiefOfficial￼10111213   economy and citizenry.  Countless individuals in the14   Houston area were affected, as the court of appeals15   explicitly recognized, so much so that 60 percent of the16   jury venire affirmatively acknowledged in the responses17   to questionnaires that they would be unable to set aside18   their deep-seated biases or doubted their ability to do19   so, or that they were angry about Enron's collapse, an20   anger that was manifested in the vitriolic terms in21   which Petitioner Jeff Skilling was referred to22   repeatedly both in the questionnaires and in the23   community more generally.24               The passions about this case were so intense25   and the connections to Enron ran so deep that the entire3Justice, and may it please the Court:            The dramatic collapse of Enron had profoundreverberations experienced throughout the HoustonAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   United States Attorney's Office, all 150 or so 2   attorneys, recused themselves from the investigation 3   that culminated in this prosecution. 4               In those conditions, the court of appeals 5   was correct in unanimously concluding that this was one 6   of the very rare cases in which, because of the degree 7   of passion and prejudice in the community, the process 8   of voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret 9   out and identify unduly biased jurors.  And --10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do we take from11   trial counsel at the end of the voir dire process12   announcing that if he had had extra preemptory13   challenges, he would have used them only against 6 of the14   12 people that were finally selected?  If that's all he￼1516171819202122232425would have ejected, why couldn't a fair jury have beenfound?            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, Your Honor, to beclear even one juror who should have been excluded andwasn't would have been enough, but --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different --that's a different question.            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are taking a broaderproposition and saying that the presumption could notunder any set of circumstances be overcome, and that's4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   what I'm trying to probe. 2               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 3   The reason that trial counsel objected to six specific 4   jurors at the juncture that Your Honor's referring to 5   is that that corresponded to six cause objections that had 6   been, in our view, erroneously denied.  Now, that in no way 7   suggests that we were satisfied with the remainder of 8   the jury.  We had made an objection -- 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  There was10   only one juror that had been challenged for cause11   against -- for which a preemptory challenge wasn't used.12   I thought that every other for-cause challenge ended up13   being excused on the basis of a preemptory challenge.14               MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, and that's15   what I was trying to say, Your Honor, that the reason16   why trial counsel identified six specific jurors was17   that there were six other jurors who would have been on18   the venire as to whom we had applied -- as to whom we had19   asserted a cause challenge that was denied, and because20   of that we had to use a preemptory to strike those21   jurors, which left us without --22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that means that23   there were six that were okay.24               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, no.  There were25   six as -- there were six remaining as to which we didn't5￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   have a corresponding for-cause objection that had been 2   denied.  But in no way indicates that we were satisfied 3   with the other six. 4               From the very outset, we complained about 5   this process.  We said at the outset before trial that 6   no juror could be seated in this case because the 7   process of voir dire couldn't adequately be relied upon 8   in these conditions. 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me what in the10   process itself, outside of your general proposition that11   no process could find fair jurors?  What else in the12   process was deficient?13               MR. SRINIVASAN:  The process was deficient14   in a couple of respects, Your Honor:  First, with respect15   to time and scope.  The voir dire that the trial judge16   conducted was essentially an ordinary voir dire for17   ordinary circumstances.  He announced before the fact18   that the voir dire would be conducted in a period of 119   day, and we objected to that.20               He also announced that he would have limited21   questioning and that counsel would have very limited22   opportunity to follow up with additional questions.  We23   also objected clearly and repeatedly to that.  And that24   was manifested in the voir dire that occurred, because25   what the trial judge did is made two fundamental, we6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   think, mistakes in the way he conducted the voir dire. 2               One occurs with respect to those jurors as 3   to whom they had laid bare their biases, and another 4   occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they 5   didn't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, but, 6   given the conditions that prevailed in the community, 7   they might well have had biases that they didn't 8   affirmatively acknowledge. 9               Now, with respect to the first, the mistake10   that, in our view, the trial judge made was to accept a11   simple assurance of fairness in the face of overt statements12   of bias and in conditions that confronted this community,13   where there was deep-seated community prejudice and animus14   that permeated the Houston -- that permeated the city of15   Houston, that kind of acceptance of a simple assurance of16   fairness in the face of repeated overt statements of bias17   shouldn't be countenanced.18               And we think what the trial court should19   have done in that situation is to move to an additional20   juror.  But instead of doing that, the trial court21   interviewed 46 jurors, nearly 8 more than the minimum22   that was necessary to constitute a jury in this case.23   And just to give this a frame of reference, the entire voir24   dire process in this case took 5 hours, and the trial25   judge interviewed each juror for approximately 4 and a half7￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9minutes.By way of comparison --Official            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he did -- he did givetime for counsel to ask additional questions, trialcounsel.            MR. SRINIVASAN:  He -- he did.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He asked both sides ifthey had additional questions.￼            MR. SRINIVASAN:  He gave some time, JusticeGinsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire beganthat that opportunity was going to be limited both in101112   time and scope.  With respect to scope -- and this is at13   page 11805 of the record -- what he said was that14   follow-up questioning would be permitted if it was15   reasonable and if it was related to the purposes for16   which the juror was brought before the bench.17               And just to paint the picture a little bit,18   the -- the potential jurors were brought before the bench,19   and they were left standing, which I think reinforced the20   conception that this was going to be a rather quick affair21   and it was not going to allow the kind of extensive,22   meaningful follow-up that we thought was required.23               And to give it a frame of reference, in the24   Oklahoma City bombing case, the prosecution of Timothy25   McVeigh, that proceeding was transferred from the city8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   of Oklahoma City to Denver, but even after the transfer, 2   the trial judge conducted an 18-day voir dire with an 3   average of 1 hour of interviews per juror; 18 days and 4   1 hour as compared with 5 hours and 4 and a half minutes. 5   And we think the Oklahoma City experience is much more 6   befitting of the kind of voir dire that’s necessary in 7   circumstances of community prejudice and passion of the 8   kind that existed here. 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You made a change of10   venue motion at the outset, right?11               MR. SRINIVASAN:  We did.  We --12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I'm unaware of any13   case in which we have said a change is mandatory when14   what's involved is money rather than life or limb.  Life15   or limb obviously was involved in the McVeigh case.16               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure, it was, Your Honor,17   and by no means would we in any way diminish the -- the18   profound human tragedy that accompanied the Oklahoma19   City case, but I think the reality of the sentiment on20   the ground in Houston was that Houston citizens, as we21   pointed out in our brief, in fact referred to the -- to22   what happened in the wake of the collapse of Enron in23   terms that were similar to the way they referred to24   terrorist attacks.  They -- they in fact talked about it25   in terms of the 9/11 attack.9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what was remarkable 2   about some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of 3   people didn't read the newspapers.  There were a lot of 4   people who indicated they really didn't know anything 5   about this case. 6               MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's true, 7   Justice Ginsburg, but I’d like to clarify one aspect 8   of that, if I could, and that’s that our argument is not 9   -- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding --10   that pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice11   in the community.  This is -- is very much a case12   in which pretrial publicity was a symptom rather than the13 cause.14               Now, pretrial publicity, to be sure, stoked15   the passions that -- that already lay within the16   community, but really this was a case in which the17   passions existed regardless of pretrial publicity.  And18   I think the juror questionnaires and the surveys and all19   the other evidence that we put before the district20   court manifests that.  If you look at the juror21   questionnaires -- and they are -- there are several examples22   of situations in which particular jurors said that they23   were unaware of any of the pretrial publicity, they did24   not watch the news, they didn't read the newspapers,25   they hadn't seen the movies about Enron, but yet they10￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234   panel, is a good example of that.  She answered “no” to5   all the questions concerning her exposure to pretrialstill said they had feelings about Jeff Skilling and KenLay.Juror 63, a person who wound up on the 6   publicity, but then when she was asked whether she had 7   views about the guilt or innocence of Jeff Skilling, she 8   said yes, she did; and she elaborated on that by 9   explaining that I think he probably knew he was breaking10   the law.  So this is a person who, notwithstanding a￼11121314151617   some of the fatal flaws in this voir dire process.  The18   follow-up --19               JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you really think that20   if -- if there had been a much more lengthy voir dire21   and if the trial judge had been more willing to -- to22   grant motions to dismiss for cause, that it would have23   -- that it would not have been possible to find a fair24   and impartial jury in the district?25               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, our first --11lack of exposure to pretrial publicity --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was somefollow-up to that.            MR. SRINIVASAN:  There -- there was a bit offollow-up to that, Your Honor, but I think the nature of thefollow-up is -- is quite illuminating on what we think areAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   certainly, there should have been a more intensive voir 2   dire, Justice Alito.  Now, our first order of submission 3   is that the proceedings should have been transferred, 4   not necessarily because there don't in fact exist or 5   there didn't in fact exist 12 unbiased jurors in the 6   city of Houston. 7               Our point is a different one, and that is 8   that in conditions where you have the level of passion 9   and prejudice that permeated the Houston community,10   there’s too great a risk that the process of voir dire11   and particularly the ordinary process of voir dire12   wouldn't be successful in identifying those 12 people.13   That's the danger.14               And the other problem with the argument that15   the government makes with respect to the fact that there16   are 4 and a half million citizens in Houston, which I think17   is part of Your Honor's question, is that that would mean18   more if the trial judge had gone deeper into the jury19   pool than the mere 46 jurors he did interview.  Because20   when he interviewed those 46 and stopped at that point,21   what we were left with was a jury panel as to which22   there was too great a danger of bias, too great a danger23   that they would bring their biases to bear with them in24   adjudicating Petitioner's guilt.25               JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, rule 21 says that the12￼Alderson Reporting Company1819202122232425process of voir dire, as this Court's decisionsrepeatedly recognize, in Mu'Min, in Patton, and Murphyand others, the ordinary process of voir dire in thatsituation can't be trusted to identify those people.right?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because you think --MR. SRINIVASAN:  And that’s the danger here.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- they’re going to lie,13Official 1   judge must grant a transfer if the judge is satisfied 2   that a prejudice against -- that so great a prejudice 3   against the defendant exists in the transferring 4   district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and 5   impartial trial there. 6               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct. 7               JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, doesn't that suggest 8   that if you could find a fair and impartial jury with an 9   adequate voir dire, then the transfer need not be10 granted?11               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think it has to be12   read against the context of whether we can be confident13   that you can find that fair and impartial jury.  I think in14   any -- I think we would say that in any community in15   which there is 4 and a half million people, there may,16   in fact, be 12 individuals who aren't so biased that they17   can't sit.  The real danger, though, is that the ordinary￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Mr. Chief Justice.  With respect, that's not -- that's10   not the only danger.  I mean, that's -- that's part of11   it, but I think there's -- there's other ones that we12   would put forward before that one.13               There’s two in particular:  First, in a14   community like Houston, in the state of the -- the15   passion and prejudice that existed in Houston at the16   time of this trial, there’s a real concern that jurors17   will not feel fully free to return to that community18   delivering anything other than the conviction for which19   the -- the community desires.  And that, I think, is an20   important concern that this Court's decisions identify.21               And the other one, and this is in Murphy in22   particular, where there’s a substantial share of the23   community that's impassioned and prejudiced, as this one24   was, there’s a concern that even jurors who don't lay25   bare -- who don't affirmatively acknowledge their14MR. SRINIVASAN:  I'm sorry.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because you thinkthey're going to lie?MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, that’s --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When they fill outthe form and say this is what I've heard, and this -- Ican fairly evaluate the law and the arguments?MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, no.  No,￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   biases -- are unwittingly subject to the same biases 2   that permeate the community.  And that sort of danger is 3   -- is the reason that in these situations, we think 4   transfer is required. 5               But even if transfer wasn't required, what 6   needed to happen was a more extensive and intensive voir 7   dire than happened here.  The voir dire was deficient -- 8   and Justice Ginsburg, this gets back to your question 9   about juror 63.  The voir dire was deficient in at least10   this respect.  In conditions like those that permeated11   Houston, we think it's error to accept the assurance of12   fairness of a juror who has already laid bare their13 biases.14               Now, juror 63, for example, she said she15   thinks she knew that Jeff Skilling -- she thinks that16   Jeff Skilling knew he was breaking the law.  This is17   someone as to whom we ought to be very concerned.  In￼1819202122232425   this case.  And then we did challenge -- as Justice15our view, that person shouldn't get --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there a challenge forcause against her?            MR. SRINIVASAN:  There -- there wasn't aspecific challenge for cause against her, Your Honor,but -- but again, we challenged everybody on the basisthat voir dire wouldn't adequately ferret out biases inAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   Sotomayor's question about the six specific challenges 2   that we lodged at the close of the voir dire, but before the 3   jurors were sworn -- juror 63 was one of those jurors. 4               And so I think it was evident that juror 63 5   was not at all somebody who we were satisfied with.  And 6   the reason is, if you look at the nature of -- at the 7   voir dire colloquy with her, the trial court asked her 8   about that statement and asked her:  You remember 9   making this statement?  Do you still feel that way?  And10   her response was:  I don't know.11               And then she acknowledged: I have no further12   information to bring to bear on that question than I did13   then.  And at that point, she has only fortified the14   bias that she brought with her, but the trial court was15   unsatisfied, and he continued to press.  And then he asked16   her at some point:  Can you apply the presumption of17   innocence?  And she said yes.  And then that was it.18               But in our view, a -- a search for a --19   -- what I think can fairly be described as a rote20   assurance of fairness can't be sufficient, given the21   very evident danger that someone like juror 63, who has22   already laid bare her biases, would bring her biases23   with her to the panel when she adjudicated Petitioner's24   guilt or innocence.25               JUSTICE BREYER:  How do you say we -- in16￼Alderson Reporting Company89 10 11what I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that juryselection can go on a very long time.            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right.                 JUSTICE BREYER:  And judges have to -- have12   to run their trials.  And if we tell the judges that1314151617181920   nature a contextual inquiry.  The standard that this21   Court has articulated to identify the circumstances in22   which this sort of extra -- I think -- precaution is23   necessary is that there has to be, a quote, "wave of24   public passion," close quote, and that's the language25   that the Court has used in a number of its decisions.17Official12345   would we sketch the lines?  That is, when does the6   jury -- does the judge have to do more than is ordinary,7   and what counts as more than ordinary?  I mean, I --your opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if,which is totally hypothetical.MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.JUSTICE BREYER:  If we agreed with that, how￼they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated,and they’ll administer it in a way that will make ithard to select juries.            That's the harm I'm worried about.  So I'masking you, how would you sketch a line that preventsthat harm?MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Breyer, it is byAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Now, that may --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: See, the problem with --MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry. Go ahead, Justice Sotomayor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Finish Justice Breyer --MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I -- anticipating what you might feel, which is that that language may not be self-evident as to the circumstances in which a deeper inquiry is --JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you -- I just asked you to do your best.MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, and that --JUSTICE BREYER: So we’ve got the wave of public passion --MR. SRINIVASAN: Wave --JUSTICE BREYER: And what about the secondhalf?MR. SRINIVASAN: Wave of public passion, and I guess the substrata that I would put beneath that, especially for this category of cases, is pervasive animus directed towards the defendant as responsible for a harm felt by the entire community.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what's the second half? The second half, which I'm really worried about, is that we get into the business of running the18Official￼Alderson Reporting Company1 trial court's trials. So I want to know what it is that2 the trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other3 than transfer, has to do?4 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think what the trial5 court has to do is two things, Your Honor: First, for a6 juror who has laid bare his or her biases, that juror7 should not be allowed on the panel, and an assurance of8 fairness from that sort of juror isn't enough. At the9 very least, Your Honor, on this category -- and then I’ll10 go to my second point -- in a situation in which a11 juror has laid bare his or her biases, we think that12 juror shouldn't be seated.Official￼13 But if you’re going to entertain the14 thought of seating that person, at the very least this has to15 happen: They have to be forced to confront their assurance16 of fairness as against the many statements of bias that17 they may have uttered.18 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens if -- I gather --19 that a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and20 people say, yes, I think he is guilty? And -- and the21 trial judge says, now, if you listen to the presumption,22 can you be fair? You look him in the eye, and if he says,23 yes, I can put this aside, trial judges do accept those24 jurors.2519Now, if that is the practice, and othersAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   would know more than me, then our -- our -- I'm 2   worried about changing that ordinary practice. 3               MR. SRINIVASAN:  To be clear, Justice Breyer, 4   that ordinary practice would only be altered in the very 5   rare category of cases that involve a wave of public 6   passion.  And -- and they would be altered in the 7   following respect:  That if somebody had laid bare their 8   biases, the -- in our view, what should happen is that 9   you should move to the next juror.10               But even if you didn't do that, at least the11   following should happen, Justice Breyer, and that is12   that when somebody utters an assurance of fairness, that13   itself shouldn't be enough when the community is14   permeated with the sorts of biases that attended this15   proceeding.  The jurors should at least be forced to16   reconcile their previous statements of bias with their17   utterance of fairness.18               The other point I would make is this:  That19   the danger that this Court has identified in conditions20   like those that pervaded the Houston community is that21   even with prospective jurors who don't affirmatively22   acknowledge their biases, there’s a danger that they23   may have biases they haven't brought to the fore.  And24   we think what can't happen is what the trial judge did25   in this case, which is to refuse to question any of the20￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9jurors on the basis of any response they gave in thequestionnaire, other than responses that raised a redflag.            And we think if you curtail the inquiry inthat regard, it doesn't allow for the sort of voir direthat's necessary to in order to be --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I look at --            MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- in order to ferret outbiases that may be latent.Official￼1011121314   Sotomayor.  There’s at R 12036, I think, is an --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any place inthe record I could look to see questions that you wouldhave posed absent the judge's limitations?MR. SRINIVASAN:  There are, Justice15161718   change of venue and related relief.  And that was after19   the questionnaire responses had been received.20               And the point we made in that document is21   that as a consequence of the questionnaire responses, we22   already knew that a great deal of bias permeated the23   venire.  And we proposed not only that the proceedings24   should be transferred, but also that a different25   sort of voir dire should be conducted than the one that21JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Repeat that.            MR. SRINIVASAN:  I sorry.  R 12036 is animportant document, which is our renewed motion forAlderson Reporting Company1   the trial court envisioned.  And we laid out in that2   motion the sorts of things that we thought should be3 done.4               And we did that in other places as well,5   Your Honor, but I think that would be a good place to6 look. But --7 8 9            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, can I --perhaps it's time for you to shift gears, if I could --            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.Official￼1011121314   why it's difficult.  The statute prohibits “scheme to15   deprive another of the intangible right of honest16   services.”  Skilling owed the Enron shareholders honest17   services.  He acted dishonestly in a way that harmed18   them.  But I don't understand the difficulty.19               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I20   think part of the problem with that sort of rendition is21   that that -- I think nobody suggests that any dishonest22   conduct falls within the compass of this law, that no23   pre-McNally case suggests that.  And I think the24   government doesn’t takes that position, either.25 If it did --22            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and move tothe statutory question.MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understandAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, there has to 2   be -- there has to be a right to honesty.  In other 3   words, it's not just in the abstract.  And the 4   shareholders had a right to his honest services. 5               MR. SRINIVASAN:  But I don't think that 6   you’ve advanced the ball, with all due respect, that much 7   by saying there has a right to honest services, because I 8   think what -- at the end of the day, what that would mean 9   is that any situation in which there’s a fiduciary duty10   or even if there’s not a fiduciary duty, but at least11   any situation in which there is a fiduciary duty, a12   nondisclosure of deception would give rise to a13   Federal felony prosecution.14               And that has never been the understanding15   under pre-McNally case law, and that shouldn't be the16   understanding now, because its sweep is breathtaking, and17   it's not something that we would ordinarily construe18   Congress to have intended.19               Now, I think in -- in this case, there’s20   several objections we have to the application of the21   honest services fraud statute to this case.  We think22   the statute is unconstitutionally vague.  We think it's￼23 24 25particularly vague as applies to -- as applied to anythingbeyond the narrow category of bribes and kickbacks.            But I think in some ways the most23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   straightforward way to understand why the honest 2   services fraud statute can't be applied validly in this 3   case is to appreciate what I think is an evolution in 4   the government's theory.  And -- and at the time of 5   Weyhrauch -- and this is at page 48 of the government's 6   brief in Weyhrauch, just a few months ago.  The government 7   said that the honest services fraud statute, quote, 8   “Nor does it cover an official whose interest is public 9   knowledge.”10               So, at that point, I think we -- we would have11   believed that the honest services fraud statute can't be12   applied to Jeff Skilling, because his interest, as the13   government acknowledges, was public knowledge.14               But the position that the government has15   taken now is that even though his interest was16   disclosed, he didn't disclose that he was acting in17   pursuit of that interest at the expense of the18   employer's interests, which I read to be contrary to the19   position that they took in the Weyhrauch case and, I20   think, which is problematic in two respects.21               First, there is no pre-McNally22   understanding, none, that a disclosed interest can give23   rise to honest services liability.  And, second, and24   maybe more importantly --25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  A24￼Alderson Reporting Companyfact, in a post-McNally case, the Thompson caseout of the -- out of the Seventh Circuit, JudgeEasterbrook, we think, explained persuasively whypursuit of an interest in personal compensationshouldn't afford the gravamen of --prosecution.Official 1   disclosed interest? 2               MR. SRINIVASAN:  A disclosed interest, where 3   the interest is disclosed.  All the cases dealt with 4   situations in which the interest is undisclosed, as the 5   government suggested would be the case in the Weyhrauch6 brief. 7               But -- but perhaps even more importantly, 8   there is no pre-McNally understanding to the effect 9   that acting in pursuit of an interest in compensation10   can give rise to honest services liability.  And, in￼1112131415161718192021   compensation.  It was essentially Skilling owned shares,22   and he had information that those shares were inflated.23   Shareholders owned shares.  They didn't have that            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I thought part ofthe government's theory was not --MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- an honest servicesJUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- wasn't limited to the24   information.  Skilling then sold those shares at a great25   profit to himself.  And the shareholders were left25Alderson Reporting Company1   without that information.  And then when the stockOfficial 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   and 50.  And the interest that the government identifies10   that was furthered by Petitioner Skilling's action is11   his interest in compensation.  That's -- that's how the12   government, I think, describes it.13               And the -- it's true, Your Honor --14               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What 49 and 50?  Of the15   government's brief?16               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Of the government's brief.17               And it's true, Your Honor, that the18   deception that they identify has to do with securities19   fraud.  And I'll bracket for the moment that we think20   that the honest services fraud theory that was put21   before the jury is not at all commensurate with the one22   that’s being asserted now.23               But even if you take as a given that it's24   the theory now, the elements of honest services fraud25   under the government's theory are that the individual26price plummeted, they all lost out.            I thought that the government was notlimiting the -- its position to the compensation, but wasalso dealing with the share price.            MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think, Justice Ginsburg,the government's theory on how the honest services fraudstatute applies in this case is laid out at page 49￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   would act in pursuit of his interest in his own 2   compensation at the expense of the employer's interests 3   in acquiring better information with which to make an 4   informed decision. 5               And one of the fundamental problems we see 6   with that approach is that it would threaten to convert 7   almost any lie in the workplace into an honest services 8   fraud prosecution for the following -- 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I --  I just don't10   -- because I'm looking at page 50.  I thought this11   discussion goes from 50 to 52, and that the part on 5212   certainly homes in on the share -- the shares.13               MR. SRINIVASAN:  It -- it does, Your Honor,14   but the interest at issue -- and I'm reading from page15   50.  This is in the middle of the first full paragraph16   on page 50.  The government says, “That constitute” --17   “That conduct constituted fraud.”  The only question here is18   whether the public nature of petitioner's compensation19   scheme prevents his conduct from constituting honest20   services fraud.”21               And then they go on:  “Although the” --22   “Although petitioner's basic compensation scheme was23   public, his scheme to artificially inflate the24   company's stock price by misrepresenting its financial25   condition, in order to derive additional personal27￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1 2 3 4 5 6   the "i.e."?  Additional personal benefits could be both. 7               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because the stock is the 8   compensation, Your Honor.  There's -- there's no -- I 9   think, in this sort of situation, there’s not a10   disaggregation between the stock and the compensation.11   The stock was intimately tied to his compensation, and12   the personal benefit that, I think, was being received13   was that compensation interest.14               I mean, the government can clarify that, but15   that's my understanding of the government's view.16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think we’ll ask the17   government to do that.18               MR. SRINIVASAN:  And the danger with that theory19   is that it would have the capacity to convert almost any20   workplace lie into a Federal felony, for the following21   reason:  That, in a variety of situations, an employee22   might -- might engage in an act of deception to his23   employer with respect to a work-related matter.  For24   example, suppose that there is an employer policy that25   says you can only use workplace computers for business28benefits” -- i.e., his compensation -- “at the expense ofshareholders, was not” disclosed.            So I think the theory of application here isthat because he was acting allegedly --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why do you put in￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   purposes, and when asked, the employee says that he is 2   only using it for business purposes, but he is in fact 3   using it for personal reasons.  Well, at that point he 4   will have made a deception to the employer.  Arguably, 5   it would be material, particularly given that it acts in 6   the face of an employer policy, and it arguably was made 7   in furtherance of the employer's personal interest in 8   maximizing his compensation at the expense of the -- at 9   the expense of the employer's interests in having better10   information with which to make an informed decision11   about the employee's future.12               So for that reason as well, we think that13   the application of the honest services fraud --14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What you've just15   explained is why you think the statute is very broad.16   You haven't explained why it's vague.17               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, there are two18   different arguments, Your Honor.  Our threshold19   submission is the statute is unconstitutionally vague,20   and we believe that it's particularly vague as applied21   to a category that extends beyond bribes and kickbacks.22   And I haven't been through those arguments, but they're23   -- they’re spelled out in our briefs.24               Now, with respect to the remaining category,25   which is undisclosed self-dealing, even that category we29￼Alderson Reporting Company1   think is a problem in and of itself.  But it's2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9particularly problematic when it's applied to the realmof compensation for the reasons that I have outlined.            If the Court has no further questions, I’dlike to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Dreeben.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBENOfficial￼   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,10111213141516171819202122   community.  He worked with the parties to develop a 14-23   page questionnaire, which I encourage the Court to look24   at, if the Court has not already done so.  It's25   extraordinarily detailed.  It has more than 70 questions30and may it please the Court:            When Judge Lake approached this case withthe question of how to select a jury, he had 15 years ofexperience in selecting juries, and he informed theparties that it was his experience that voir direconducted by the trial judge is more effective ateliciting the potential biases of a juror than theoftentimes tendentious voir dire that’s conducted bythe parties.collapse had a significant impact on the HoustonHe did not ignore the fact that the EnronAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   designed to ferret out any possible connections between2   the individual jurors and the Enron collapse.

It asked for4 5 6 7 8 9whether --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me of anyother high-profile case comparable to this in which thevoir dire lasted only 5 hours?            MR. DREEBEN:  Judge -- Justice Sotomayor,I’m not familiar with the length of voir dire in￼10   particular cases.  But I think that there is no --11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you aware of any12   that's been reported where the selection was 5 hours13 only?14               MR. DREEBEN:  No, I’m not aware of any,15   but I don't think that there is any problem with this16   voir dire, and I think there is really --17               JUSTICE BREYER:  There's no problem?  I went18   through the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my19   own subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of20   whom only one lasted, but I counted five others that21   they had to use peremptories on that include one juror,22   29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune23   of $50,000 or $60,000.  The judge said:  I will not24   challenge her for cause.25               I counted another, juror -- what's this one31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   -- juror number -- number’s 74, who when he looked her 2   square in the eye and said, "Can you be fair?"  She said, 3   "I can't say yes for sure.  No." 4               Okay?  So, in my own subjective account, there 5   were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps 6   if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which 7   apparently they don't, they might have said these should 8   have been challenged for cause.  So I’m concerned about 9   the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about10   the very, very brief questions that he provided to11   people who had said on the questionnaire they could12   be -- they could be biased.  They said we think he's￼13141516   trial judge.  I’ve expressed those concerns.  I know17   this is a special case.  Half, almost, of the jury18   questionnaires they just threw out.  And theguilty, for example.            And all those are cause for concern.  At thesame time, I’m worried about controlling too much a19   community -- you know all the arguments there.  You see20   what's worrying me.  And I’m worried about a fair trial21   in this instance and to say -- and I'm genuinely worried,22   and -- and I’d like to hear your response to the kind of23   thing I'm bringing up.24               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think25   that there was a fair trial in this case, and I think32Alderson Reporting CompanyI'm not familiar with, but I think that that's notsupposed to be.Official1   that a full reading of the voir dire reveals that2   individuals sitting from this vantage point with a cold3   record who were not there may have different viewpoints4 about --5               JUSTICE BREYER:  I’d never heard of an6   instance where a trial judge would not challenge for7   cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the8   juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of9   $50,000 to $60,000.  See, we are getting into an area that￼10111213   any per se disqualification.  But even if there was,14   that juror did not sit, and this Court held inMR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that there’s15   United States v. Martinez-Salazar that one of the16   purposes of peremptories is to protect against the17   occasional accidental error.18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How -- but is it19   occasional or accidental?  I think that’s what Justice20   Breyer is getting at.  With such a truncated voir dire21   and one in which the judge basically said to the lawyers,22   I'm not giving you much leeway at all, how can we be23   satisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked24   when the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says,25   I'm a victim of this fraud?  I don't know -- I would find33Alderson Reporting Company7 8 9of not following through adequately?            MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that a -- whatOfficialit strange that we would permit jurors who are victims ofthe crime to serve as jurors.            MR. DREEBEN:  Well, none sat in this case.I don't think there is any claim that they did.123456   didn't strike her for cause.  So isn't that symptomaticJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but -- but the judge￼this Court may perceive as an error in the denial of onefor-cause challenge --1011121314   And they can't appeal this.  And it's that taken15   together, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as16   they point out for the reasons they say, some cause for17   concern.  And that's what I'm trying to get at.            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it's not just one.There were like five, of which I have given you theworst, and they had to use up all their peremptories.18192021   were qualified to sit.  He was not interested in having22   the voir dire used as a lobbying or a argumentative            MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I thinkthat reading the entire voir dire reflects that thejudge was interested in determining whether these jurors23   exercise by the lawyers.  And as a result, he relied on24   the very extensive questionnaires to pinpoint the25   examples of areas in which further questioning was34Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   necessary.  And then he went and he, I think, did fairly 2   allow sufficient inquiry into whether these jurors could 3   sit.  And I think one of the best examples of that is 4   actually juror number 63, who Petitioner says was not 5   properly voir-dired.  And I think what juror number 63 6   illustrates -- and this is in the Joint Appendix at page 7   935a and then following -- is that, as this Court has 8   remarked many times, the question of -- 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me.  What was the10   page?  Nine --￼111213141516171819   with the voir dire.  I actually think juror 6320   illustrates not only what was right with the voir dire,21   but the immense distortion that Petitioners have22   attempted to perpetrate by putting together effectively23   a highlight reel of every bad headline in every Houston24   publication and claiming that the entire jurisdiction,25   all 4.5 million people virtually, were infected with35            MR. DREEBEN:  935a.  This is in volume 2 ofthe Joint Appendix.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead with it, but theydidn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waivedit.            MR. DREEBEN:  They did not challenge 63 forcause, but they -- but they came to this Court today andtried to use 63 as an object lesson of what was wrongAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   some sort of a pervasive prejudice that could not be 2   ferreted out in voir dire. 3               If you look at what happened in juror number 4   63, she happens to be a 24-year-old who comes to court. 5   She filled out a questionnaire that she said:  I can be 6   impartial.  She did have the statement:  I -- I think that 7   probably Skilling is guilty of some crime.  When the 8   voir dire proceeds, it turns out that she's not one of 9   these jurors who has been in the Houston culture10   pervasively exposed to what Petitioner says is11   prejudicial publicity.  She was living in Austin at the12   time, going to school.13               Then she's asked, “Are you watching major14   networks?”  And she says, “No, I don't really watch the15   news at all.  I'm a turtle person.”16               “Do you recall anything that may have --17   you've seen -- that you may have seen or heard on18   television about this case?”  “No.”19               And then the judge, after some more questioning20   about her that reveals that, among other things, Ken Lay21   is a member of the country club that her parents belong22   to, he asks her about the very question that Petitioners23   focus on as problematic:  “Do you have any opinion about24   the guilt or innocence -- and you say, I think they probably25   were breaking the law?”36￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And her answer is: "I don't know. The only thing I can say is, anything I've ever heard even peripherally has not been, you know -- but that's what people say and, I mean, it's hard to know. People don't know what they are talking about."And the judge says, “Well, I'm just trying to find out what you think.” She says, "I don't have an opinion either way."JUSTICE BREYER: Let's try juror number -- let's try 76: Judge: "Here's the detail that really concerns me. You said, 'I think they're all guilty.'""Right.""Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking that, if that's what you really think. You just need to tell us that.”“Okay.”“That's what you think, isn't it?”“It's been a long time since I answered thatquestionnaire.”“Right. Now, as you" --Okay? Now, that’s -- that, as far as I could tell, is as close as I can get to a recantation of what shethought originally.MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, this Court has recognized -- and it has recognized this as37Official￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   long ago as Chief Justice Marshall in the Burr case -- 2   that people come to court with opinions in highly 3   publicized cases.  We expect our jurors to be somewhat 4   informed of civic affairs.  They receive information 5   through the media or through their friends, and they have 6   light opinions.  And they come to court, and the trial 7   judge instructs them:  This is a legal proceeding; you’re 8   going to hear evidence in court.  What happened 9   outside of the courtroom no longer matters.  What10   matters is what has been presented in here.  I'm going11   to instruct you that defendants have a presumption of12   innocence.  Can you follow that?13               And then the judge is the only person on the14   scene.  We're not there, the court of appeals is not￼1516171819202122232425there; the judge is the only person on the scene tojudge the jurors' inflection, the jurors' demeanor, thejurors' apprehension of the seriousness of the duty.And this Court has held that the standard for review ofa determination of no removable bias for cause ismanifest error.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were -- were thesecolloquies that are reported, the -- the pages we havejust been reviewing, heard by the entire jury pool?            MR. DREEBEN:  They were not --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or were they just -- where38Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1234   Kennedy.  This was not a case like Mu'Min, where in your5   concurrence -- your dissent, you pointed out that thethe person -- the juror was standing in front of the benchfor this?MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct, Justice 6   colloquy occurred in the full presence of the -- of 7   every other juror, and there was no individualized voir 8   dire.  Here there was individualized voir dire.  Judge 9   Lake had that juror right in front of him, eyeball to10   eyeball, and was able to make the kind of credibility11   assessment, taking into account all of the context, that12   no other judge can do.13               And it's not to say that there’s no judicial14   review of that on appeal.  In the Irvin case, Irvin v.15   Dowd, which is really the Court's first case in this16   line, the Court noticed that there -- 90 percent of the17   jurors had an opinion that the defendant was guilty.  It18   involved a highly sensationalized murder in rural19   counties in southern Indiana.  There was a barrage of20   pretrial publicity.  Eight of the 12 jurors said they had21   an opinion that the defendant was guilty.22               The Court, after meticulously reviewing the23   voir dire, concluded that the judge had committed24   manifest error in accepting the representations of the25   jurors that they could be impartial.  But this is39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   nothing like that. 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's hard for me to think 3   that the voir dire would have been much shorter even if 4   there had been no showing of pervasive prejudice. 5               MR. DREEBEN:  I think that what Judge -- 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Five hours sounds to me 7   about standard for a case of this difficulty. 8               MR. DREEBEN:  I -- I think that's not 9   necessarily correct at all, and it would not have been10   the case that in a normal trial there would have been as11   detailed a 14-page questionnaire as there was in this12   case, that was designed to elicit any and all13   connections to Enron.14               Now, whether there may have been some15   individualized mistakes along the way, whether some of16   us would have preferred that the voir dire be more17   extensive, is not the issue; and unless this Court is18   prepared to set standards that are based either on a19   stopwatch or some sort of, you know, notion of how many20   days voir dire has to occur, it's going to be very21   difficult to administer a standard that says this was22   too little.23               The Oklahoma City bombing case, it is true,24   took many, many days, but that was a capital case, and I25   know that this Court is well familiar that there are40￼Alderson Reporting Company12345678   heart of the entire nation.  Judge Matsch, who sits in            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It took manydays after it had been transferred.Officialnumerous --            MR. DREEBEN:  It did, and Denver itself wasexposed, probably almost as much as Oklahoma City, tothe pretrial publicity, and a terrorist act of thatmagnitude, Mr. Chief Justice, really strikes at the￼9 10 11 12 13 1417   think is comparable to what happened with a financial18   meltdown in Houston, a 4.5 million city with a robust19   economy and a trial that took place 4 years later,20   after numerous other Enron trials had already taken21   place in Houston, resulting in favorable verdicts for22   defendants, mistrials, acquittals of one defendant.23               This very trial itself of Mr. Skilling24   resulted in nine acquittals on insider trading counts.25   Now, if you would think that the jury had some sort of41Denver --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was very -- theatmosphere in Oklahoma City was very different from thatanywhere else, in terms of the impact of the bombing onthat particular community.                 MR. DREEBEN:  Agreed.  It was 168 deaths.15   Many of them were children.  There was a sense of -- of16   victimization in the part of the community that I don'tAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   it seems -- I'm being flip.  It seems that that's where12   you would focus your attention, if you think your community13   has essentially been fleeced by somebody because of his14   dishonesty.15               MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so,16   Mr. Chief Justice, because the honest services component17   actually, and the component of this trial, was really a18   subset of the securities fraud.  The essential gravamen19   of Petitioner's crimes were lying to Enron, lying to its20   shareholders about the health of the company in a21   financial sense, when, in fact, he knew that he had been22   engaging in numerous manipulations of earnings and23   schemes that are detailed in the briefs, in order to24   avoid Enron having to recognize that portions of its25   business were imploding.42a substratum of subterranean bias that was ineradicable bythe conventional techniques of voir dire that we have beenusing for 200 years, then insider trading where thedefendant pockets personally, as a result of theexploitation of insider information -- you would thinkthat would be the first place the jurors would go to vent --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no.  No.They’d go to the statute that says honest services --(Laughter.)￼CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  It seems --Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1               And the victimization was of shareholders. 2   That was expressed through securities fraud; it was 3   expressed through insider trading.  There were counts 4   involving liars -- lying to auditors, and one object of a 5   multi-count conspiracy charge involved an honest services 6   object as well as a money or property fraud object, and 7   as well as a securities fraud object. 8               Now, in our view Petitioner has essentially 9   conceded that the honest services statute is not vague10   as applied and, therefore, facially unconstitutional.  He11   all but acknowledges that bribes and kickbacks, which12   constitute the bulk of pre-McNally honest services13   cases, can be defined with precision.  There is not an14   unconstitutional vagueness in it.  And so I think at a15 minimum --16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, a concession that a17   bribe or a kickback scheme statute would not be vague is18   hardly a concession that this statute as written is not19   vague.  In fact, I thought that was the point.  The20   point is that the Court shouldn't rewrite the statute;21   that's for the Congress to do.22               MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that in this23   case, Justice Kennedy, the Court needs to rewrite the24   statute so much as to recognize that what happened in25   McNally was this Court said that the mail fraud statute43￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425has two clauses, scheme to defraud and scheme for obtaining money or property by false representations and pretenses. The government's position, in accordance with all of the lower courts, was that these two clauses set forth two separate crimes. Scheme to defraud was not limited to money or property. This Court disagreed, and it said, oh, yes, it was.And what Congress did in responding was toinvoke words that had appeared in this Court's decisionin McNally, in the dissent written by Justice Stevens,in the lower court opinions, and intentionally -- asthis Court put it in Cleveland v. United States -- coverone of the intangible rights that the lower courts had recognized before McNally, and that was the right to -- intangibleright of honest services. And in the context of thepre-McNally honest services cases, that was well knownto include at its core the bribery and kickback casesand, in the additional category, nondisclosure of apersonal, conflicting, substantial interest.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose you have a statute that -- that makes it criminal to -- to do any bad thing, okay? Now it's clear that murder would be covered. All right? Nobody would say that murder is not covered by that. Does -- does that make the statute non-vague?44Official￼Alderson Reporting Company                 MR. DREEBEN:  But this is not like a     statute, Justice Scalia, that says prohibiting any bad10   thing.  It's a statute that responded to a decision ofOfficial1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911   this Court in which a term of art, the intangible12   right of honest services, featured prominently.  And13   Congress has --14               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there were cases that15   -- that -- some of which included bribery, but others of16   which included a variety of -- of other actions, some of17   which were allowed by some courts and some of which18   were disallowed by some courts.  There was no solid19   content to what McNally covered.20               MR. DREEBEN:  I think that there was a solid21   enough content for this Court to be able to respond to22   the McNally decision by giving shape to the crime in23   accordance with the paradigm cases that the lower courts24   had done and logical implications of those cases, just25   as if it had concluded, in accordance with Justice45            MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Scalia, but --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, just because you canpick something that everybody would agree comes within adenial of honest services, doesn't -- doesn't mean thatwhen you say nothing but honest services, you’re sayingsomething that -- that has sufficient content to -- tosupport a criminal prosecution.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   Stevens's dissent, that the statute did protect 2   intangible rights in the phrase “scheme to defraud.” 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if -- if you’re 4   going to say that the statute refers to a term of art, 5   the whole point of a term of art is that it’s a shorthand 6   for defining something.  And then -- but if you’re 7   saying that it's a term of art that means the 8   pre-McNally case law over the -- you know, all the 9   different circuits and the district courts and that some10   knowledge of that, it -- it's descriptive of11   something, but it's not a term of art.12               MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's a term of art in13   the sense that it referred to a -- a body of law that14   until quite recently, when defendants began making15   vagueness arguments, was understood to refer to the kinds16   of schemes that had been prosecuted before this Court17   held that "scheme to defraud" was limited to money or18   property.  And it --19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm with you20   there.  But then the kinds of cases -- that's where it21   gets fuzzy.  I mean, you need lawyers and research22   before you get an idea of what the pre-McNally state of23   law was with respect to intangible -- the right to24   intangible services, of honest services.  And I’m just25   wondering how clear does what that body of law is have46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   to be before you can say, you know what, when we tell 2   you that right, you know that that's what it's referring3 to? 4               MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's clear enough at 5   the core, this Court can say so and can provide 6   definition, and it can use its standard tools of 7   interpretation of criminal statutes to dispose of cases 8   that are at the periphery and ensure that there is -- 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It kind of -- it10   puts the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully11   difficult position, though, if he has got to wait.12   There’s this common law evolution over time.  You have13   two cases the government wins, one it loses, three --14   and he's supposed to keep track of that.  That doesn't15   sound like fair notice of what's criminal.16               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I17   don't think it puts a defendant in a very bad position18   at all, because this statute is only triggered when19   there's an intent to deceive, an intentional fraudulent20   act taken to deprive the victim of whatever right exists21   in question.22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was -- Mr. Dreeben,23   what was the jury told when this honest services count24   was given to the jury?  What was -- what were they told25   was the definition --47￼Alderson Reporting Company212223   it?2425   Justice Scalia.  I’ve read this phrase many times, and48Official 1               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the jury instruction, 2   Justice Ginsburg, appears on page 1086a of the Joint 3   Appendix.  That’s in volume 3 of the Joint Appendix. 4   And I will describe the jury instruction, too, but I 5   want to say at the outset that this jury instruction was 6   drafted against the background of Fifth Circuit law, 7   which I think did take a somewhat broader view of the 8   honest services crime than the government has taken in 9   this Court, and it has to be read against that10   background.11               But the -- the instruction said that “to show12   that defendants deprived Enron and its shareholders of13   their right of honest services, the government must prove14   beyond a reasonable doubt that, in rendering some15   particular service or services, the defendant knew that16   his actions were not in the best interests of Enron and17   its shareholders or that he consciously contemplated or18   intended such actions, and that Enron and its19   shareholders suffered a detriment from the defendant's20   breach of his duty to render honest services.”￼So -- and this was against a background --JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's circular, isn'tMR. DREEBEN:  The -- I would agree,Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 it does seem a little circular to me.2 The introduction to this jury instruction says,3 "Honest services are the services required by the defendant's4 fiduciary duty to Enron and its shareholders under State law."5 So this was tried in a circuit that followed the State law6 principle that’s at issue in the Weyhrauch case. The7 government defined the fiduciary duty in that way.8 But the essence of the fraud was that -- that Petitioner9 had a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of Enron to act10 in their best interests, and he betrayed that by acting11 contrary to the best interests of the shareholders,12 fraudulently upholding the price, and ultimately that13 constituted the crime.14 Now, I think there's a --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that covers the16 case that your friend put of the employee using the17 computer for personal use? That fits under this18 instruction?19 MR. DREEBEN: Well, whether the employee had20 a fiduciary duty in that respect would be, I think, quite21 a litigable question. This case doesn't involve any22 subtle or arcane fiduciary duty. This is one of the23 basic fiduciary duties that any chief executive has, not24 to lie to shareholders about the financial condition of25 the company.49￼Alderson Reporting Company123456   fiduciaries, no, Justice Scalia.  I mean, most7   fiduciaries have a sort of heightened duty towards8   the --Official            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry.  The duty of anemployee to provide honest services to his employer --that's not included because the employee is not afiduciary?MR. DREEBEN:  Not all employees are￼ 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where do you get the10   fiduciary limitation?1112   in that --1314   services."  I would think that --15               MR. DREEBEN:  Well --16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- any employee has the17   obligation to provide honest services.18               MR. DREEBEN:  I think, Justice Scalia, that19   you cannot successfully attempt to understand Congress's20   reaction to this Court's decision in McNally without21   some cognizance of the McNally decision and the22   preexisting law.23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What authority do I look24   to, to see that some employees are fiduciaries and25   others are not?50MR. DREEBEN:  I think that it's inherentJUSTICE SCALIA:  All it says is "honestAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MR. DREEBEN:  That would be a standardagency law principle, Justice Kennedy, and --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I look in theRestatement of Agency, and they have a section thatapplies to fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries, both of whomare employees?131415161718   services case.  The honest services cases are about19   conflicting interests and the misuse of officialOfficial            MR. DREEBEN:  Normally, Justice Kennedy, nosuch complexities are necessary, and I think that thisCourt can resolve this case without introducing suchcomplexities, because the core duties of loyalty thathave formed the core of the honest services prosecutions￼101112   are universal.  They are equally applicable to agency.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I would assume that anyemployee, even at the lowest level of the corporatestructure, who has corporate property, a car or something,has a duty to protect that car for the employer.MR. DREEBEN:  But that's not an honest20 position.21               I'm not even sure, in the personal computer22   use case, that the government could successfully show23   that the employee had misused his official position.24   This case is quite typical in that respect.  Petitioner25   absolutely misused his official position to serve what51Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   we say was his private interest in private gain. 2               JUSTICE ALITO:  Were there any pre-McNally 3   cases that involved a situation like this, where the 4   benefit to the employee was in the form of the 5   employee's disclosed compensation? 6               MR. DREEBEN:  There were not to my 7   knowledge, Justice Alito, and I would frankly 8   acknowledge that this case is a logical extension of the 9   basic principle that we have urged the Court to adopt in10   the nondisclosure cases.  And the Court can evaluate11   whether it believes that that is legitimately within the12   scope of an honest services violation or not.  But it13   should not obscure our fundamental submission, which is14   that there was a definable category of undisclosed15   conflict of interest cases, that a person furthered16   through his official actions that constituted17   honest services fraud.  A good example of that is United18   States v. Keane, which was a Seventh Circuit decision.19               Petitioner, in his reply brief, claims that20   Keane involved financial injury to Chicago as a result21   of an alderman's concealment of his interest in22   properties that the City was selling.  Actually there23   were three separate schemes in Keane.  In one of them,24   the court was quite clear that, even though the alderman25   got the same deal that every member of the public would52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   have gotten, it still was honest services fraud because2   he did not disclose his financial interest in that3   property to the council when the council was voting on4 it. 5 6   hypothetical:  I'm a councilperson in a jurisdiction 7   that’s considering a tax increase or a tax break, and I 8   vote for the tax break, and I happen to have property 9   that qualifies.  Is that a breach of the statute?10               MR. DREEBEN:  It may well be, Justice11   Sotomayor.  It depends, I think, on whether the tax break12   was something that basically all general members of the13   public were in a position to benefit from, which may14   well be the case if it's just a private residence,15   versus if it's a particularized business property16   interest that you have either acquired --17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please tell me what I18   look to, to discern -- if I'm a councilperson, to discern19   what needs to be disclosed or not disclosed?20               MR. DREEBEN:  I think in the first instance,21   you will inevitably, as a councilperson, turn to your22   local law.  And I think this brings up an important point23   that was discussed in the Weyhrauch decision, which is24   that the mail fraud statute does not criminalize25   breaches of duty without more.  There has to be a53JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I -- the following￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   showing of scienter, of a mens rea element of intent to 2   deceive.  And unless the government can point to 3   something which shows that the individual knew that they had 4   a duty to disclose and did not do that -- 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So could -- 6               MR. DREEBEN:  -- or -- if I could just 7   finish this part of the answer -- or can point to 8   circumvention-type activity, using of shell companies to 9   conceal an interest, then the government is not going to10   be able to have an indictable case on honest services11   fraud.  And I think what --12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't give me a13   whole lot of comfort, I mean, just because there’s an14   intent to deceive.  An intent to deceive can be the basis15   for -- for terminating a contract.  There's -- there's16   been fraud in the inducement or something of that sort.17   So I know I’m liable to have the contract terminated, and18   maybe for damages for the contract.  And you say:  And also,19   by the way, you know, you can go to jail for a number of20   years, because, oh, yes, it's very vague, but you21   intended to deceive, and that's all -- that's all you need22 to know.23               MR. DREEBEN:  But this Court has recognized24   in numerous cases, Justice Scalia, that a mens rea25   element requiring an intent to deceive, an intent to54￼Alderson Reporting Company6   intent to violate the law.  I believe in another case,7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you’re saying they don't have to have an intent to violatethe law because there was no State law that prohibitedwhatever was at issue.            So is the government now saying -- which is abig difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unlessthey know, i.e., they intend to violate a law thatforbids the conduct in which they are engaging, otherthan this honest services law, or are you not sayingthat?            MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not saying that,Justice Breyer.            JUSTICE BREYER:  You’re not saying that.            MR. DREEBEN:  I'm saying that in theordinary case --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Then if you're not sayingthat, what the person has to carry around with themis an agency treatise.            (Laughter.)            MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that what55Official1   violate the law, is exactly what helps prevent statutes2   that might otherwise be considered too vague from3 falling --4                JUSTICE BREYER:  You can -- well, you focus5   on what you just put together.  You said intent to deceive,￼Alderson Reporting Company 1   happens, Justice Breyer, is that unless the government 2   does have some sort of legal platform like that to show 3   that there was knowledge of a duty, it's not possible 4   for the government to bring its proof to the court and 5   establish that the individual acted with the requisite 6   mens rea, unless there is activity that reveals an 7   intent to circumvent the law and to withhold the 8   information, as in Justice Sotomayor's example, 9   information about a property interest that might well10   affect the deliberations of the council.  And that kindOfficial￼1112131415161718   information.  I agree with that.  But the problem is19   they don't know it's unlawful to do so.of evidence often requires use of offshore accounts --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I mean, of course theyintend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's thecase that is not obvious that worries me, and --            MR. DREEBEN:  I don’t see any of those --            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in the case thatis not obvious, of course they intend to withhold20               MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I think if you21   look at the cases in which this has happened, there is --22   there’s not like a deliberation on somebody's part -- oh, do23   I have to disclose or not disclose?  What these cases are,24   are really outright criminal conduct in the form of25   conflicting interests that every fiduciary knows you56Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1   need to disclose this before you take official action to2   further that interest.  That --3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, would you4   clarify the issue that came up:  Is the government's5678   as well.  That was part of the compensation, and it’s9   linked to it.  But, Justice Ginsburg, if you look at thetheory focused simply on the compensation or does itinvolve the sale of shares?MR. DREEBEN:  It involves the sale of shares￼10   government's opening statement in this case, the11   government opened by saying, “You will see that12   defendants Lay and Skilling knew few -- a few key facts13   about the true condition of Enron, facts that the investing14   public did not know.  With that information, defendants15   Lay and Skilling sold tens of millions of dollars of16   their own Enron stock.”17               And then continued:  “When an investor buys a18   share of stock, an investor buys some rights in a19   publicly traded company.  When an investor buys a share20   of stock, they buy the right to hear and receive truth21   from the chief executive officer.  And, importantly, they22   buy the right to have their interests placed ahead of23   the chief executor officer every day of the week.”24               So there was, baked into this case at the25   outset, the notion that these officials were not acting57Alderson Reporting Company1   in the best interests of the shareholders.  They were2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425furthering their own interests by maintaining a highstock price so that they could profit from it.Official Thank you. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief￼Justice.            A couple of quick points on the honestservices fraud issue, and then a couple of points on thejuror issue, if I might.           With respect to honest services fraud, firstof all, I think that the government pointed to the juryinstruction -- and, Justice Ginsburg, this goes to somequestions that you had raised -- I think what's clear fromthe capacious nature of the jury instruction that was issuedin this case is that the elements that the government saymake Jeff Skilling guilty of honest services fraud weren'tput before the jury or required to be found by the jury.And for that reason alone, the conviction against JeffSkilling ought to be overturned.            Another point I'd make very quickly withrespect to the sweep of the government's theory58Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   concerning the workplace is, under our understanding, 2   the duty of loyalty does extend to all employees.  It 3   does, and, therefore, the theory that they assert should 4   apply in this case, I think, has devastating 5   implications for workplace relations. 6               Now, with respect to the juror question, a 7   couple of preliminary points, and then I’d like to 8   walk the Court through just one aspect of the voir dire 9   which I think exhibits the manifest flaws in the process10   the trial court conducted.11               With respect to the question about the12   issuance of questionnaires, questionnaires were also13   issued in the Timothy McVeigh case.  But I don't want to14   limit our comparison to Timothy McVeigh, because I think15   in response to some of the questions that were raised, I16   don't want to leave an impression that a multiple-day17   voir dire with the sort of extensive questioning that we18   think was required here is not in use in other cases19   that involve like crimes.20               In the Martha Stewart case, for example,21   which was a financial case, there were 6 days of voir22   dire and after a questionnaire was issued.  And in that23   case, the only reason you needed an extended voir dire24   was because of the celebrity status of the defendant.25   You didn't have the deep-seated community passion and59￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   prejudice that characterized the Houston venue in this2 case. 3               So, I think it's not at all unusual to have 4   that kind of extended voir dire, and, in fact, we would 5   say it's absolutely necessary to assure that the 6   defendant receives the fair and impartial jury to which 7   he's entitled. 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  So either this was too 9   little or Martha Stewart was too much?10               (Laughter.)11               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think the former12   rather than the latter --13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's -- it’s14   a different model of it.  As Mr. Dreeben was explaining,15   if you have an experienced judge who goes through this16   all the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say:  Look,17   bring the person in front of me.  We’ve got a questionnaire.18   I can identify the problems, look him in the eye, and I’ve19   got a lot of experience picking a jury, and it's better to20   let me do it than to have the lawyers have 3 weeks to do it.21               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, you don't necessarily22   need all of that, Your Honor, but I think with respect23   to the way in which the district court, in fact,24   conducted this voir dire, if I could just take -- if I25   could just direct the Court's attention to one juror in60￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial 1   particular -- and, Justice Breyer, this is -- maps onto 2   some of the points you were making.  This is juror 61, 3   and the relevant exchange is at pages 931a to 932a of 4   the Joint Appendix, which is at -- in -- in volume 2. 5               And I think the way the trial court 6   conducted the voir dire in this case exhibits the 7   manifest flaws in his approach generally.  This is 8   someone who at page 932a, it's revealed, answered the 9   question whether she was angry, whether there was anger10   about Enron, with yes, quote -- it was, quote, “based out11   of greed, hurt a lot of innocent people.”12               And to paint the picture more fully, the13   person was also asked:  Do you have an opinion about the14   collapse of Enron?  To which the answer was, quote, “Yes,￼15161718192021   the course of the voir dire.  In the middle of page22   932a, the first answer -- she's asked the question:  “Can23   you presume as you start this trial that Mr. Lay is24   innocent?”  The answer is, “I hope so, but you know, I25   don't know.  I can't honestly answer that one way or61criminal, caused a huge shock wave which the entirecommunity felt,” close quote.            Now, at 931a at the top, she was asked thequestion whether she had the opinion about Mr. Lay andher answer was, quote, “Shame on him.”And then much of this was put before her inAlderson Reporting Company1   another.”23   it, and says, “He's assumed innocent.”  “And can you4   conscientiously carry out that assumption?”  “I could5 6 7 8 9honestly say I will give it my best.”            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Not until --            JUSTICE BREYER:  And so the judge looks herin the eye and says -- fine.101112131415161718192021   of appeals.  So I think that they are.22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.23               MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you.OfficialJUSTICE BREYER:  Then on 932, she does answer￼            MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, not -- not until thishappens first, Justice Breyer, between 932a and 933a.And so she's asked, “So that might -- might your viewsabout Ken Lay cloud your judgment relative to criminalresponsibility?”JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  And I'll --MR. SRINIVASAN:  And her answer is --JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll read that again.  But myquestion is, can we get a hold of these 238 questionnaires?Are they in the record in front of us?            MR. SRINIVASAN:  I believe that they are.  Ithink that they’re certainly in the record before the court24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel.25               The case is submitted.62Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
