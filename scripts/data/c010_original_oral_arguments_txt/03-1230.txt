Michigan PublicService Commission and a companion case.          Mr. Digges.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.        ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230          MR. DIGGES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 pertruck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks thatare registered to do point-to-point operations in theState of Michigan.  We submit that this fee, this flat pertruck fee, has the same impermissible effects oninterstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that werestruck down by this Court in American TruckingAssociations v. Scheiner.          In the American Trucking Associations v.Scheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effectof these fees and found that because of theirunapportioned structure, that the fees had fourinterrelated types of impermissible effects on interstatecommerce.First, the Court found that these kinds of flat 41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 fees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor2 carriers even coming into the State that imposed the --3 the fee. There's no question in this case that the4 Michigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist5 quality.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it does for trucks7 that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan.8 It doesn't for anybody else.9 MR. DIGGES: Yes, it -- it discriminates and it10 -- it has an exclusory effect on trucks -- out-of-state11 carriers that want to compete in the -- and bring their12 trucks across the -- the border of Michigan and compete13 against local carriers for intrastate hauls.1415 certainly16 fact what17 many trucks does it affect?18 MR. DIGGES: There was not a trial below. So we19 don't have that fact.20 We believe that as in the Scheiner case, these21 -- these tendencies are inherent there. Because of the22 structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has23 what this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and24 that is to -- for carriers, once they have paid this fee25 as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOJUSTICE SOUTER:  It would have that -- ithas that tendency.  Do we have -- do we know inthe effect is?  Is it deterring anybody?  How￼1 commerce and to concentrate them into -- in the State of2 Michigan in the local activities. And that -- in fact,3 the State acknowledges that. Below, the State said that4 motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to5 the State of Michigan in order to avoid these6 consequences. And even the Michigan Court of Appeals7 recognized that, saying a local carrier would be8 discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it also -- I mean,10 you say it -- it favors11 because if you're doing12 you -- you amortize the13 the interstate carrier,14 state, doesn't do that.15 On the other hand, you can certainly argue that16 -- that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers17 in -- in another respect, that is to say, interstate18 carriers who -- who do nothing within the State do not pay19 it, whereas the -- the Michigan carrier that does a lot of20 interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate21 business -- interstate business, he still pays it. Isn't22 that right?23 MR. DIGGES: Well, Your Honor, I think what --24 what that's saying -- and I know that25 made in the Solicitor General's brief61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOwas the argument-- is that you canWashington, DC 20005the in-state -- intrastate carriernothing but intrastate carriage,$100 over many more miles, whereasmuch of whose business is out-of-￼1 discriminate against one component of interstate commerce,2 those carriers that want to actually compete and do3 intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a4 benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those5 who just wish to operate in the -- in the State of6 Michigan in interstate commerce.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not so much that you8 necessarily can do it, but it -- it sort of interrupts the9 -- the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown10 back on a -- on -- on a practical effects analysis under11 Pike.12 MR. DIGGES: No, Your Honor. I think what13 happens is that -- that there are the segment of carriers14 that would like to compete against intrastate carriers.15 The fact that other carriers may be getting a break in16 terms of regulatory fees -- and we don't know that to be17 the truth, getting the other interstate carriers. It's18 the Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again19 in the Scheiner case that -- that you can't discriminate20 among interstate carriers.21 And as we pointed out in our brief, you could22 set up a situation in which a -- a State discriminated in23 favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries24 where their locals had no interest in25 their -- their locals were interested71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOcompeting, but wherein competing, theyWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425could set up a discriminatory system.  So you can protecttimber industry in -- in Oregon and --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But may I ask this question?Suppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000miles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastatecarrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan.They both say the -- pay the same tax, don't they?          MR. DIGGES:  If they each do 100,000 miles ofintrastate business in Michigan --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. DIGGES:  -- they would pay the same flatfee.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  They would both pay the sametax, both the intra and the interstate.  Now, that doesn'tsound to me like discrimination against either one.          MR. DIGGES:  If -- if this -- if this tax wasapportioned based on mileage, it would not bediscrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but I'm just saying if theintrastate and interstate carriers both have the sameintrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.          MR. DIGGES:  And we -- we would -- and again, ifthis was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be -- itwould be fine.  But the fact is as in Scheiner, the out-of-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is -- is81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425operating --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but you might have anintrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage,only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays --does 100,000 miles.  They both pay the same tax too.  Andeverybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.          MR. DIGGES:  That would be true but that --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the tax only operates onintrastate business.          MR. DIGGES:  The factual situation is going tobe that the interstate carrier is just not going to havethe opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as theintrastate carrier.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it seems to me you shouldhave introduced some evidence on that point.  I mean, it-- it really is an assumption of your unfairness argumentthat purely intrastate carriers do significantly moreintrastate business than interstate carriers who choose todo some interstate business.  Now, does that strike you asself-evident?  It does not need any --          MR. DIGGES:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- demonstration?          MR. DIGGES:  It does strike me as self-evident.In fact, to courts below -- we have -- we've made thisargument.  We've seen this argument now.  The cases have91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 called it intuitively obvious. And from the discussion of2 -- in the Scheiner case and from the discussion in the3 Nippert case, the very difference between interstate and4 intrastate commerce means that on average the interstate5 carrier is just not going to use the State's facilities as6 much as the in-state carrier.7 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Wouldn't we be better8 able to decide this question after a trial rather than9 speculation on both sides?10 MR. DIGGES: I don't think a trial is necessary11 because, as I say, this -- this Court quoted Justice12 Frankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in13 his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is14 not going to get as much benefit from this fee. This is a15 variable cost fee. In effect, the out-of-state carrier is16 having to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the17 -- of the State's regulatory system. And again, that's18 something that was accepted in the Scheiner case, accepted19 in -- in the Nippert case. And the intrastate carrier --20 every time that it operates in the State, it is using that21 privilege.22 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Nippert was over23 100 years ago, wasn't it?24 MR. DIGGES: I think the Nippert case was from25 the 1940's I believe. In any event, as we've been101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 discussing --2 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It seems like 1003 years ago.4 (Laughter.)5 MR. DIGGES: It's --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Digges, this -- the --7 the -- there was a question about the ramifications of the8 position that you're presenting. That is, there are many9 situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee10 that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount,11 although some people who are licensed will be doing12 business in other States and have to get licenses there as13 well. The example that was featured in the -- in the14 briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed,15 say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any16 break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also17 admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his18 practice out-of-state, out of the District.19 MR. DIGGES: Yes, Your Honor. I know that --20 that example was given. I think there are a variety of21 flat fees that would be unaffected by this. There are22 fees that would be administrative charges and -- and if23 all the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost24 of a background investigation or the cost of a truck25 inspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 carrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a2 fixed fee.3 With respect to the bar fees, they are obviously4 different than the trucking industry and -- and the5 taxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce.6 But we think that there may be impracticalities in7 apportioning a bar fee. You could have an attorney in his8 office in Virginia that is working for a California9 customer or California client that is being -- for a case10 that is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and11 then for transaction work, he could be working for a12 customer or a client in -- in Missouri for -- a multi-13 state. So it may be difficult to apportion fees. We14 haven't really examined that.15 But we know from this Court's decisions that --16 that is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and17 truck fees -- this Court said in Scheiner that the18 technology is now available to look at the extent of the19 activity and the taxpayer in -- in -- of the truck in the20 State, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you21 can easily track large physical objects over States. So22 you can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in23 the State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated24 with the --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Scheiner case didn't 121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 make a distinction based on in-state activity. I thought2 that that -- that flat fee was applicable to every motor3 carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.4 MR. DIGGES: That is accurate, Your Honor, but5 -- but nominally Scheiner -- for instance, the6 Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say7 that -- did uphold the fee because they said only8 Pennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using9 Pennsylvania's highways. So like a lot of -- like all10 interstate commerce, you can always -- as -- as the Court11 said in Nippert, you can always find -- carve out a local12 activity to say that this is going to be the focus of the13 tax.14 I think a problem here is with the -- the15 approach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is16 they suggest that you go back to the days in which you're17 trying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate18 activity, this time not because the intrastate activity is19 going to be immune from the tax, but this time because20 you're going to have some separate, different kind of test21 applicable to something that clearly is subject to22 Commerce Clause protections, but is -- is, in their view,23 subject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection. And24 I don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days25 of having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425commerce and -- and then having separate tests.          If there are no more questions, I'd like toreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr. Digges.          Mr. Hanson.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. HANSON        ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234          MR. HANSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In contrast to the ATA case, the question beforethe Court today in the Mid-Con case is whether the fee onvehicles operating solely in interstate commerce ispreempted by 49 U.S.C., section 14504.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It's the same fee we'retalking about.          MR. HANSON:  It is --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But a different theory ofinvalidity.          MR. HANSON:  It is not the same fee.  The -- thefee under subsection (1) that ATA is arguing about is anintrastate fee charged only to --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Intrastate.          MR. HANSON:  -- carriers that engage inintrastate activities.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, and yours is the 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425interstate fee.          MR. HANSON:  The subsection (2) fee under478.1 --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And your fee applies to allMichigan-plated vehicles.  Am I correct about that?          MR. HANSON:  That are operating solely ininterstate commerce.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do -- do I understand that thetwo distinctions in what is done with the -- or the waythe fee is collected and what's done with it is that the-- the fee is charged against the -- is it the operator asopposed to the owner, if there is a distinction?  Is -- isthat correct?          MR. HANSON:  All of the fees under subsections(1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  The carrier.          MR. HANSON:  -- or --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's the term I should use.          MR. HANSON:  -- motor carrier, not to the owner.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which may not be the owner.          And number two, as I understand it, as distinctfrom the registration fee, this fee goes to a differentState department.  Is that right?MR. HANSON: That's correct. 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, let -- that's -- that's a2 premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question3 is in economic effect, is there any difference really4 between charging this $100 fee with those differences from5 the registration fee and simply jacking up the6 registration fee by $100? Would there -- would there be7 any economic difference to the -- to the public or -- or8 indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the9 -- the registration fee by $100? Because the -- the10 registration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not11 the owner, and the carrier -- it doesn't make any12 difference to the carrier whether the -- whether the State13 diverts the $100 up front or -- or divides the -- the14 registration fee after it's paid. So is there any15 economic difference?16 MR. HANSON: Yes, there is and the reason why17 there is a difference is that the -- the fees that are18 paid for plating are under the -- under the International19 Reciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP. And20 that is an apportioned fee. It is charged to all21 vehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of22 whether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in-23 state or -- of interstate. So everybody pays their24 apportioned amount based on mileage.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that shows -- that --161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425maybe I don't understand.  That -- that tells us what happensto the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make anydifference to the person who is paying the money, does it?          MR. HANSON:  Yes, it does.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Except that he only has to payin one place, and -- and if they --          MR. HANSON:  He pays --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- increase the registrationfee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.          MR. HANSON:  But he wouldon his mileage in the State.  It isis put onto the IRP fees.  Those --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who --only pay the fee basednot a flat fee if itwho sets the fee forthe plating?          MR. HANSON:  The -- the State does.  It isadministered by the Michigan Secretary of State --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So --          MR. HANSON:  -- but I believe all of those arestatutory fees.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you could have -- unlikethe -- the fee, the $10 fee, that --          MR. HANSON:  The SSRS.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the Federal cap, thiswould -- for plating it could be anything each individualState chooses it to be?171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HANSON:  In terms of the plating fee?          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.          MR. HANSON:  Each State is free to charge its --its own amount as the plating fee.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sure, but it -- so -- soregardless of what Michigan does with the apportionedamounts, the amount itthe case of the -- thethe State             charges to the -- to the owner, in             plating fee, is -- is simply set byof Michigan.MR. HANSON:JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.MR. HANSON:  -- that is correct.JUSTICE SOUTER:  So what -- and -- and the --That is --the virtue of the apportionment is that the -- that theowner or the -- or the owner, I guess in this case, doesnot have to pay fees in 49 other States.          MR. HANSON:  That is correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But he doesn't -- it doesn'tmatter to -- that's the value to him.  It doesn't matterto him how they apportion whatever that fee is thatMichigan charges.          MR. HANSON:  If they apportion it, however, itis -- it is not -- it does not -- if they put it into theIRP, it is not part of the registration process.

HANSON:  Well, the -- the difference for theperson who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstateoperating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the State,they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I ask a quick question?The -- there are three things.  Were -- were you finished?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I don't think he -- Ididn't --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand your answer.If you were finished, I don't understand.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.          MR. HANSON:  If it's -- if it is put into aplating charge as opposed to a registration -- part of theregistration of a carrier for the privilege or theopportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities inthe State of Michigan, that is the flat fee that we'retalking about.  Under the SSRS we believe that $100 chargeexceeds the $10 maximum and is therefore preempted.191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 If they put it into the IRP, that -- IRP is2 charged against the owner of the vehicle, paid against the3 Secretary of -- paid to the Secretary of State. It is not4 a qualification under -- for the privilege of engaging in5 interstate trucking in the State of Michigan.6 The SSRS sets up the standards by which a7 carrier becomes qualified to operate in the State.8 Michigan exceeds those standards. If you put those fees9 into the IRP fees, then the carrier -- or then the owner10 of the vehicle pays only the proportionate amount based on11 his mileage in the State.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?13 Supposing the -- Michigan changed its system and said14 we're going to charge you $90 for -- as a plating fee.15 We're only talking about vehicles that are plated in16 Michigan. We're going to charge you $90 for a plating fee17 and now we're going to take 10 -- what used to part of the18 $100 and another $10 registration fee. Would that be19 permissible?20 MR. HANSON: It would be permissible because the21 -- if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the22 registration process, in order to be qualified to engage23 in interstate trucking. The $90 would be charged to the24 owner of the vehicle and would be paid on an apportioned25 basis under IRP.201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  What if he said $20instead of $10?          MR. HANSON:  If he said $20 was going to be puttowards the -- the State instead of -- instead of $100?          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. HANSON:  And $80 towards IRP?          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. HANSON:  In that case, that would stillviolate the -- the SSRS, if it is done as part of theregistration process, which is what Michigan does.Michigan -- even though you're properly SSRS registered,Michigan still requires, under its SSRS form -- it directsthe carrier to specifically identify vehicles by make,model, and serial number to obtain a decal by paying $100for that fee.  If they pay $20, that exceeds the $10maximum that Congress set up in the SSRS in order to bequalified to operate in interstate trucking in the Stateof Michigan, as an interstate carrier in -- in Michigan.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that -- that assumes it'san SSRS charge, and the State denies that it -- it hasanything to do with SSRS.  Don't you have to establishthat it's part of the SSRS program?          MR. HANSON:  I think what you have to do is youhave to look at what the -- the standards do.  The -- theregistration standards in the SSRS are set up as the211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 process by which a carrier has the privilege to enter into2 interstate trucking activities in Michigan. When you look3 at the statute --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but what -- what if the5 State says, you can enter -- enter into interstate6 activities for nothing? We're simply going to increase7 the registration fee by $100. Couldn't the State do that?8 MR. HANSON: The State could do that and that9 would be perfectly permissible.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: So this is pure formalism.11 MR. HANSON: It is not pure form. Any -- what12 -- what Congress did was say that in order to qualify a13 carrier -- they were concerned about the burdens. When14 ISTEA was enacted in 1991, they were concerned about the15 burdens on carriers of individual State registration16 requirements. And they sought to -- to alleviate that by17 making it so that carriers could only -- would only have18 to register in one State so they could do business in all19 States on an interstate basis.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they sought to but maybe21 they didn't succeed. As I read the statute, it -- it22 really applies to the -- the limitation of $10 only to23 those fees that are SSRS fees, and these are not. So24 maybe there's -- there's a hole in the Federal statute.25 MR. HANSON: And I don't believe that's the221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're trying to make theFederal statute work sensibly, but --          MR. HANSON:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I hate to tell you, but notall statutes work sensibly.          MR. HANSON:  Right.          I think what you have to do, though, is go backand look at what Michigan does.  Michigan has a -- a Statestatute, 478.7(1), that says in order to operate to carryproperty on an interstate basis in Michigan, you mustregister with the PSC and you must pay the requiredvehicle fees.  The registration standards are what they doas in accordance with SSRS:  insurance, service ofprocess, and operating authority.  Then you have to pay afee, and the fee is limited to $10 per vehicle.          In the case of Michigan, those vehicle fees areset forth in two different sections of the statutes.  Oneis .7(4), which is the $10 SSRS fee.  The other one issubsection -- it's 2(2).  That fee is $100 --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Hanson.          MR.

BOYNTON               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. BOYNTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The petitioner, American Trucking, began itsreply brief with the claim that the central reality inthis case is that the Michigan intrastate fee placessignificant burdens on interstate commerce.  The MichiganCourt of Appeals rejected this claim squarely, saying thatas a matter of -- that that was a matter of purespeculation.          There's no evidence in the record before thisCourt that the trucking companies' route choices areaffected by the intrastate fee.  Furthermore, there is noevidence in the record that the intrastate fee keepsanyone out from engaging in intrastate trucking inMichigan.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It sure does make sense to me,though.  Surely it's the case that a company that doesnothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by andlarge, log in many more miles intrastate than a companywhich does interstate business but part of its business isintrastate Michigan business.  I -- I just -- it seems to241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 me obvious that --2 MR. BOYNTON: Well, the Michigan Court of3 Appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they4 pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support5 that finding.6 And this is completely different than in7 Scheiner. In Scheiner you had a -- a trial, you had8 evidence before the court. This Court noted that the --9 the cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was10 five times greater than the cost to a trucker that was in11 Pennsylvania. You just simply don't have those facts12 here.13 What you have is a discrete or a distinct local14 activity that is something that doesn't affect the15 interstate commerce.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it's the case that a17 company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs18 all of its miles on -- in Michigan. Right? No miles19 outside of Michigan.20 MR. BOYNTON: That's right.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems to me it's obvious22 that a -- a company that does interstate business does not23 log all of its miles in -- in Michigan, and likely --24 likely -- very likely does -- does less miles in Michigan25 than -- than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. BOYNTON: Well, Justice Scalia, that very2 well may be true, but we don't have any way of -- of3 qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't4 have those facts.5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it difficult to apportion6 the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled7 intrastate?8 MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think it9 is very difficult to do that. As the United States noted10 in its brief, they didn't think that mileage would be11 appropriate because this -- this fee doesn't support the12 maintenance of the highways. What this fee does is allows13 trucking companies or allows that truck to operate that14 truck in intrastate business. So mileage isn't15 appropriate.16 Our position is that mileage isn't appropriate17 because it's next to impossible to try and figure out.18 What do you compare it to? Do you -- do you compare it to19 interstate miles? Do you compare it to a ratio of20 interstate -- intrastate to interstate? And if you do21 that, how -- how can you come up with a accurate picture22 of, you know, what the value of that license is in23 Michigan? It may be --24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it make any difference25 how high the -- the fee is set? If it were $10,000 a261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425truck, does that raise any concerns that are different?          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, Your Honor, the MichiganCourt of Appeals had taken the position that this was afee, not a tax, and under a fee -- if -- if a fee was$10,000, if the expenses matched the -- the revenue fromit, well,as a fee.position,Clause sothen it -- it would be a -- could be sustained Now, if were a tax --JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you defend thatthat -- that it doesn't violate the Commercelong as it's a fee not a tax?MR. BOYNTON:  Your Honor, we think that the --fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appealsif it's aapplied the correct standard, and that was the standard ofPike v. Bruce Church.  And you would look to the --whether the statute regulated even-handedly, whether itaffected a legitimate local --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whenever it's a fee, not a tax,you immediately go to Pike Church.          MR. BOYNTON:  I think that -- that that was whatthe Michigan Court of Appeals --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know.  I know that's whatthey said.          MR. BOYNTON:  Yes, and I -- I think that's a --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I found it very strange.          MR. BOYNTON:  I think that's an appropriate271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 manner in dealing with it.2 But if you -- if you look at the Michigan Court3 of Appeals opinion --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What makes it a fee instead5 of a tax other than the court saying so?6 MR. BOYNTON: Well, first of all, it provided a7 direct benefit to the intrastate truckers. They were able8 to operate in the State of Michigan. Second of all, they9 pointed out that it was in relation to the services10 granted, being able to do that, and then the third11 component would be the voluntariness, whether they could12 agree to -- they didn't have to engage in intrastate13 trucking --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same about a15 tax. You could say, you know, you only have to pay this16 tax if you operate in Michigan. You don't want to17 operate; you don't have to pay it. And you could also say18 unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan.19 Does that make it a tax or a fee?20 MR. BOYNTON: Well, I think in the Michigan21 Court of Appeals opinion, it -- it was a fee, and I think22 -- I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea23 is there a specific class of individuals or businesses24 that are benefitted. And I think that that's the25 distinction between a fee and tax.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Also, a tax is a general revenue-raisingmeasure, whereas a fee is not.  And that's anotherdistinction of -- of a tax.  And indeed, this Court -- inNational Cable Industry v. the United States, which wecited in our brief, this Court said as whether an exactionis a tax or a fee depends on whether its purpose is toraise revenue or regulate an industry or services.          One of the things --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'd like to get back just fora moment --          MR. BOYNTON:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- to the answer you gaveabout apportionment because I wasn't quite sure Iunderstood the answer.  You said, well, apportionment isvery difficult.  What are you supposed to do?  What areyou -- what's the base?  Well, and you said, should weapportion against -- between in-state and out-of-state,and I would think the answer is yes.  That's the wholepoint.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if we're talking aboutmileage here, maybe this is something that's eminentlysusceptible of apportionment.  Now, it may be thatadministratively this is just too expensive.  That may be-- that may be a very valid argument.291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But so far as saying that there's no basis forapportionment, I didn't understand your answer.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, I -- I -- maybe I misspokemyself.  What I really meant to say was it would be verydifficult to do.joint appendix --          JUSTICEadministratively.And in our joint appendix -- in theKENNEDY:  It would be difficult to do But -- just because of the cost ofcollecting all the --          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, Your Honor, I think that yougot to look at what's the total cost here.  The cost isnot only to the administrative aspect by the State, butthis imposes another cost on the truckers.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That -- that -- I agree thatthat is expensive.  However, it seems to me that it wouldbe easier to do it with trucks which have miles thanwith --          MR. BOYNTON:  But, Your Honor, the problem is --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- than with, say, attorneysor accountants or whatever.          MR. BOYNTON:  Your Honor, the problem with thatis that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go tomaintain the highways as it was in Scheiner.  They makethe argument that it's very easy that the mechanism --they, being American Trucking, makes the argument that301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 it's very easy to just start logging up the miles and --2 and you have the mechanism there.3 But the difference between Scheiner and this4 case is that in Scheiner you were measuring all intrastate5 miles, any miles traveled within that State. And there's6 a mechanism available administratively to do that. The7 IRP requires that.8 But here you're not logging all intrastate9 miles. You're only logging those miles in the State that10 involve a point-to-point delivery, from one intrastate11 point to another. So you don't -- you'd have to get a12 whole new record keeping or you'd have to keep track of a13 while different set of miles than you would with respect14 to the IRP.15 And that's the thing that I find striking about16 this, that the American Trucking Association is basically17 saying to its members that they want to have them do more18 record keeping on their part.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the American Trucking20 Association is -- is willing to be thrown into the -- into21 the briar bush apparently. It certainly involves no -- no22 difficulty for your Michigan intrastate truckers. All of23 their miles are intrastate. And the plaintiffs here say24 we're -- we're willing to -- you know, to provide figures25 showing how much of our carriage was -- was exclusively311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425intrastate if you want to apportion.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, that may be, Your Honor, butthe -- the point is -- what we're dealing with is a -- afee that has revenues of about $3 million.  And if youhave additional record keeping, how much of that $3million is going to have to be devoted to paying for theadministrative costs that are involved?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?  Isthe fee payable before the -- a carrier may engage inbusiness or is it after the carrier has paid?  Is it -- isit like a tax that's paid after the year is out?          MR. BOYNTON:  It's paid before.  They -- theyhave to have --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you had to pay it before,there would be no way to calculate it ahead of timebecause nobody would have had any mileage.  Isn't thatcorrect?          MR. BOYNTON:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you have to pay it beforethe year begins and before you're allowed to engage in thebusiness, you would have no way of measuring the number ofmiles you're going to travel during the -- the ensuingyear.have --MR. BOYNTON: That's correct. You would have to 321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose that's the samething for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym isthere.  That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn'tit?  And it has to be apportioned among the States.  Andyou don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of theyear.          MR. BOYNTON:  Now, you're talking about theinterstate fee, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right, right.  But I'm sayingthe same problem arises when you do any apportioning.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, it -- let me back up.  Thereason I asked with you -- when you were referring to the$10 fee is because the intrastate fee -- we have a $10component in that as well.  You can obtain a temporary feefor $10 for 72 hours to conduct an intrastate operation.So the statute in -- structurally has some apportionmentfactor in it.  So you don't have to necessarily buy the$100 intrastate fee decal to conduct intrastateoperations.license.JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's like a 3-day fishingMR. BOYNTON:  I suppose that would be one way --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how does that work in-- in practice?  Is it easily accessible?  Suppose thecompany --331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BOYNTON:  Well --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- wants to fill up its truckand -- and it said, well, this is going to be -- the onlyhaul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit.          MR. BOYNTON:  Yes, Your Honor, you can obtainthe permits in advance.  You don't have to have truckslined up at the border waiting to get a decal or get apermit.  You can purchase them in advance.  So that --that's available to the truckers.          The one thing I should mention, though, is youhave to have one -- you already have to have one vehiclelicensed intrastate.  You already have to have paid thefee on one vehicle, and then you would be eligible topurchase additional temporary permits as the need arosebased on seasonal needs or an emergency situation.  Sothat -- that allows the -- the statute -- I -- I wouldsubmit to Your Honor, allows some apportioning in and ofitself.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This -- this applies only tooperations that are both licensed and registered inMichigan.  Is that so?          MR. BOYNTON:  No.  Your Honor I think isreferring to the interstate fee --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right, right, yes.          MR. BOYNTON:  -- which is a different fee, which341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is in the Mid-Con case.          Our position --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Are you going to address theMid-Con question?          MR. BOYNTON:  I'm sorry?          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Are you going to address theMid-Con question?          MR. BOYNTON:  I was going to do that right now,Your Honor.          The position that the State of Michigan and theMichigan Public Service Commission has is the SSRS doesnot preempt the interstate fee.  And the reason for thatis --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what's the point of thelimitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose anyadditional fee it wants just by calling it a differentname?          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, Your Honor, I think what youhave to realize is you have -- when you look at the textof the statute, I think what is very clear from readingthe text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State feesand charges on motor carriers.  It only preempts thosefees and charges that are specifically related to theregistration of that motor carrier's interstate authority.The interstate fee, or the Michigan-plated vehicle fee351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 here, is not preempted because it's a regulatory fee that2 does not relate to the registration of the motor carrier's3 SSRS interstate authority.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it -- it does.5 Number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it6 applies only to interstate travel.7 MR. BOYNTON: Well --8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And9 other vehicles pay $100 for the10 and so this seems to me that --11 shows that it's like a registration fee.12 MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think a couple13 things. Number one, I think that -- I believe that if you14 look at the structure of the Michigan statute, you'll see15 that under section 2, which contains both the interstate16 fee and the intrastate fee, virtually all Michigan17 vehicles that are plated in Michigan -- the effect of it18 is that all vehicles that are plated in Michigan will have19 paid this $100 fee.20 And furthermore, if you look at section 7 of the21 Michigan statute, which is 478.7, that involves the22 registration procedure. That's specifically applicable to23 the registration of interstate authority. And within that24 section 7, subsection (4) deals with the payment of the25 $10 fee for -- and -- and it's to be made by vehicles that361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO-- and then the -- the-- for the in-state fees,that on -- on its face￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are not plated in the State of Michigan.          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's the problem.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, that's the argument.          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the problem because herewe're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people whoare plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is thefee for them.          Well, let me -- I have a question.  I'm tryingto test this.  Suppose that I have a company in Maine.All right?  And I have -- I decide all my -- I -- I haveall Maine plates, by the way.  And I decide I want my --now, let's -- one word is license plates.  I'm going totalk about plating.  Another word is the ICC insurance.Let's call it a decal.  And the third kind of a concept iswhatever you refer to in your statute by a fee.  Allright?  The $100.          MR. BOYNTON:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, suppose inMaine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan tobe my home State for purposes of -- what do you call it?The SS?          MR.

And your question is?          JUSTICE BREYER:  Do I get a decal after I gothrough all this procedure?  You have a whole form.  I pay$6 for Alabama.  I pay $2 for Idaho, and -- but -- but Ido it all in one shopping place which happens to beMichigan.          MR.

AndI go and I make -- I say, Michigan, I'm going to give youthis big check to distribute, but the amount I'm puttinghere for Michigan, by the way, is zero.  And you say payme $100.  No.  I'm not going to do it.  So I haven't paidthem the $100.  I haven't paid Michigan everything, but Ipaid $2 for Idaho.  Do I get the decal or don't I?          MR. BOYNTON:  To get a decal from Michigan, youhave to be Michigan-plated and you have to pay the $100.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Excellent.  Now, if I don't getthe decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100is a charge that falls within the SSI.  It is a charge fora decal which shows that I registered the ICC and myinsurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give methe decal.MR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, we believe that under 391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 the -- the section 7 of the Michigan law, there is no fee2 charged for your SSRS.3 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm talking about a fee. I'm4 trying to -- oh, fine. If there's no fee charged and I5 didn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd6 give me the decal. But you said you wouldn't.7 MR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, you have to -- you8 have to -- if it's Michigan-plated, that's the triggering9 mechanism. It's not the -- that's -- that's what triggers10 the $100 fee.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boynton, may I just -- may12 I just ask this question? Is part of your position that13 the Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving14 the $10 fee on -- for this particular purpose?15 MR. BOYNTON: Our position, with respect to16 that, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 717 Michigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no18 authority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at19 all.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. So that -- but you're21 saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $1022 and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are23 plated in Michigan because they've already charged them24 $100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being25 plated.401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOof the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, I don't know if I'm sayingthat, Your Honor.  I'm saying that the -- there's a zerocharge, and then there's -- there's another charge withrespect to a vehicle fee.          The one thing that I need to point out here isthat the SSRS is not vehicle-specific.  It talks aboutnumbers of vehicles, but the Michigan decal fee for -- orthe interstate fee is vehicle-specific.  You have toidentify the particular --          JUSTICE SCALIA:me -- I wanted to ask thisvehicle-specific.  SupposeMichigan-plated, so I haveIs that right?

Do you want to use it in interstate commerce?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I've paid for eight, but Ihaven't paid for the ninth.  As I read the Michigan law,it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or overthe highways of this State while any of the fees imposedby this act remain unpaid.  Now, if -- if I can't operatethe other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.          MR. BOYNTON:  Yes, it is.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean -- I mean the opposite.It's -- it's not vehicle-specific.          MR. BOYNTON:  Oh.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I've paid for the eight, and Ican't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, I think administrativelythat -- that wouldn't happen.  I -- I think once you go --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me how it reads.Am I reading the law wrong?  It says, shall not operateany motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by thisact remain unpaid.          MR. BOYNTON:  I suppose that if the -- for --for nonpayment of fees, a motor carrier risks itsauthority to operate in the State.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  At all.  So it's not reallyvehicle-specific.          MR. BOYNTON:  Well, I -- I think it is.  I woulddisagree with Your Honor.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, the computation isvehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles ashostage for the payment of -- of any shortfall.  That'swhat you're doing, isn't it?JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's carrier-based. 421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 MR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I would have to2 disagree with Your Honor respectfully. I think that the3 -- that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the4 particular vehicle that's involved here. And I -- I think5 you have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the6 scope of what preemption has sought to do here, and not7 all State fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are8 preempted.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you place any reliance in10 this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it11 are people who have their principal place of business in12 Michigan?13 MR. BOYNTON: No, Your Honor. The triggering14 event for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle15 in Michigan.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and anyone can choose to17 do that? I mean, going back to Justice Breyer's example,18 anybody can say, well, I think I'd like to be plated in19 Michigan even though I operate in -- in other States. My20 principal place of business is in another State.21 MR. BOYNTON: Right. I think all parties have22 noted, Your Honor, that the -- under the SSRS it's much23 more stringent, more rigorous --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm just asking about what25 you do in Michigan.431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BOYNTON:  Yes.  Yes, you can.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  You really can do that?          MR. BOYNTON:  You can plate wherever you havecontacts with the State.  If your principal place ofbusiness is in Ohio but you have trucks going to and fromMichigan, that -- that would allow you to plate in Stateof Michigan.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  You -- you can plate your wholefleet in Michigan under those circumstances.          MR. BOYNTON:  You could -- you can choose whereto plate your feet -- plate your trucks, and a number ofconsiderations go into that.  It's not just the licenseplating fees.  It has everything to do -- as we noted inour brief, it could have to do with no fault insurance,the weight limits on trucks.  It's an economic decisionand there's a number of different factors that go intothat decision of where to plate a vehicle.          In conclusion, I would say that the MichiganCourt of Appeals correctly decided this case.  And they --they found that the challenged fees in these cases areregulatory fees, that they serve the critical function ofprotecting the people of Michigan that use the highways.And the Michigan Court of Appeals should be affirmed.Boynton.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,       SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 03-1230 AND         SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234          MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The United States as amicus curiae supports theState in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con.          With respect to American Trucking, in our viewthe central question in resolving the constitutional issueis not whether it would be possible to apportion theintrastate fee on a more precise basis.  The question iswhether the Constitution requires it.          And in the prior cases that we've cited in ourbrief, both the older cases dealing specifically withintrastate transportation and the more recent casesdealing with authority to engage in other intrastatebusinesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authorityof States and municipalities to charge flat fees for theprivilege of engaging in the local business within thejurisdiction during the -- the relevant period of time.And that practice --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That seems to me really togo back on -- on Scheiner.  And I thought we tried to get451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 away from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis2 of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce,3 you know, the original package doctrine and things that4 succeeded it. And you're -- you're just dragging back in5 this -- this inquiry into whether it's really interstate6 or -- or rather local.7 MR. STEWART: Well, with -- with respect, Your8 Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the9 notion that there is a bright, absolute line between10 intrastate activities which are subject to plenary11 regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause12 inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune13 from State regulation. The Court has recognized that the14 question is more complicated than that.15 But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance,16 the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an17 interstate bus trip could be taxed in -- in its entirety18 by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the19 sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete20 event properly severable from the underlying interstate21 transaction.22 And the case for severance is all the more23 powerful here. That is, here we're dealing not with a --24 an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with25 point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. It's461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do2 interstate business, and it's even true that in some3 instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same4 truck at the same time that it's also carrying goods5 between the States. But the intrastate haul is itself a6 discrete commercial transaction. To the shipper it's7 wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the -- the8 truck is also doing an interstate business.9 And to differentiate this case from Scheiner,10 one of the things that the Court has looked at in the11 dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple12 taxation. And the Court doesn't just mean multiple13 taxation in -- in the abstract because it's necessarily14 going to be the case that an entity that does business in15 many States will be taxed in many States. Rather the16 question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple17 taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or18 the same activity.19 And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if20 you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to21 Florida and passing through several States on the way, and22 it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for23 entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage24 traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable25 to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips --471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to2 Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same3 event.4 Here we don't have a problem with that. The tax5 is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the6 State of Michigan. If a particular truck also makes7 point-to-point hauls in some other State within the8 calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they9 can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or10 the same transaction.11 The second aspect of -- of Scheiner --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it could. I mean, if --13 if this -- this truck is making one -- one haul, it's14 carrying some goods from Texas to -- to Maine, but some15 other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and16 just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and17 then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it18 elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed. It19 seems to me it's -- it's one trip.20 We never used to -- used to divide railroads on21 the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the22 interstate portions and -- and the two stops within a23 State can be regulated by the State.24 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think you're right that25 it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of2 goods between States as a discrete, separable event. But3 if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and4 depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the5 shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete6 transaction. The shipper is unlikely to have any interest7 in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods8 among the States. And it's reasonable to regard that as a9 discrete event that is taxable by the State in which it10 occurs. 1112 even if13 average14 hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the15 average truck that does business solely within that State,16 there's still a whole different class of interstate  The other point to make about Scheiner is thatwe assume, as the petitioner argues, that theinterstate truck that makes some point-to-point17 truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads18 that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage19 traveled and they're being let off the hook because the20 State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity.21 Petitioners' response to this is that you can't22 discriminate against one class and then make up for it by23 -- by discriminating in favor of a different class.24 And if this were, to use title VII terminology,25 a disparate treatment case, we would agree. That is, if a491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 State overtly discriminates against one class of2 interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of3 the law those people are treated less favorably, then we4 would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for5 it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class6 of out-of-state entities.7 But here the petitioner is making what amounts8 to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a9 disparate impact claim is not that any particular10 individual has suffered unfair treatment. The way you11 prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect12 cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in13 this case in the aggregate. And there's really no way to14 feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't15 do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to16 focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the17 basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of-18 state truckers that are not currently covered.19 I'd like to speak briefly at least about the --20 the Mid-Con case. And in our view the best way of21 understanding -- to -- to return to the historical22 antecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original23 form, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an24 unreasonable burden of -- on interstate commerce to25 require an interstate carrier to register its Federal501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 certificate so along as you do so in accordance with the2 standards of the ICC. If you go beyond those standards,3 it's an unreasonable burden on commerce.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to know the text you5 rely on.6 MR. STEWART: That was --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: For -- for preemption, the text8 of the current statute that you rely on.9 MR. STEWART: The text of the current statute is10 set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari11 petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b). And12 the statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a13 State that a motor carrier providing transportation14 subject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 13515 -- and that refers to interstate transportation --16 providing interstate transportation and providing17 transportation in that State must register with the State18 is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred19 to in section 13501.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: 13501 deals just with SSRS.21 MR. STEWART: No. 13501 is the provision that22 -- that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the23 Department of Transportation and the Surface24 Transportation Board. And it basically says these25 agencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 transportation between points in one State and points in2 another State and -- or between points in the same State3 passing through another State. So in -- in using that4 shorthand reference, the Congress just means interstate5 transportation.67 Because I8 imposed a9 preciselyJUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?know your time is short.  Supposing Michigannew $10 fee per -- and it identified itas in order to comply with that statute and then10 reduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would11 that be permissible?12 MR. STEWART: Well, as long as the -- again, to13 -- in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature14 of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed15 specifically on vehicles that operate entirely in16 interstate commerce. And if Michigan reduced to $90 the17 extra --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not saying -- they reduced19 to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $1020 fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.21 MR. STEWART: As long as --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could they do that?23 MR. STEWART: As long as they were still24 imposing that additional -- again --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: The $90 is for plating. It521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 said only2 Everybody3 $10.4-- only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90.else -- everybody -- and everybody also pays the              MR. STEWART:  As long as that $90 fee was5 imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally,6 but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate7 entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's8 preempted because our reading of the statute is that9 basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what10 you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to11 intrastate carriers.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that? Let --13 let me come back to the -- to the section of the statute14 you're quoting. You didn't finish the sentence. It says15 that it's not an unreasonable burden when the State16 registration is completed under standards of the Secretary17 under subsection (c). Subsection (c) is entitled SSRS,18 Single State Registration System.19 MR. STEWART: May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?20 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Briefly.21 MR. STEWART: The State doesn't argue that this22 registration was completed in accordance with this23 standard. It argues that the provision doesn't apply at24 all because this is not the sort of registration25 requirement that the statute speaks of. We think it is531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Stewart.          Mr. Digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.        ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230          MR. DIGGES:  Thank you.  I'd like to justbriefly cover three points.          First, I believe that -- that is accurate to saythat the Solicitor General's position is returning us tothe pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more thanthat, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring thepractical effect of these fees on taxpayers.  I think the-- the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of casesillustrates that.          The only difference between the Peddler casesand the Drummer cases was that in the -- in the Nippertcase and -- and the Drummer case, they looked at thepractical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whetherthat salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that wasbeing imposed from coming into the State.  In the Wagnercase, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentiallylocal event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn'tlook at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman.I don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state --541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 that out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged2 from coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee,3 whether or not they're carrying the goods with them4 that time or whether the goods are later mailed in.5 So, again, I think it is returning to the6 drawing issues, and really there is no test that is7 to, after you -- you draw these lines, what the appropriate8 test should be.9 The second point is it -- with respect to the10 administrative practicality of apportioning these fees.11 The purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway12 tax, to -- to show the amount of highway damage that was13 done by a truck. The purpose of apportionment here is14 simply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of15 activity in the State. It would be like a general revenue16 tax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's17 activity to particular States, make sure that that18 taxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs19 with respect -- of the State's generic costs, in this20 case, generic regulatory costs. So, again, I think that21 apportionment would be very easy.22 As Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is23 willing to take the onus of this. We bill by the mile.24 You could do it on number of loads. You could do it in a25 lot -- a lot of ways. And by apportioning the fee, you551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPOin atline- made as￼1 eliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state2 carrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only3 hauling a4 haul that56 bit is the need for additional -- the need for evidence in7 this case. Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases,8 there -- they -- they -- it was expressly said that there9 was no need for evidence in the cases because in theload or two -- he would then have the ability toload and -- and not be discriminated against.The final area I'd like to talk about a little10 general average of instances, the out-of-state trucker11 will always pay more than the in-state trucker.12 And in answer to your question, Justice Stevens,13 I think it was recognized in those cases that there would14 be some exceptions to that rule. There would be a few15 out-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in16 the State than in-state carriers. But that exception17 wasn't -- wasn't what was going to happen and the most18 often, and that the average of instances, it would always19 work to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers.20 And -- and the final point is that with respect21 to evidence, you have here also a failure of internal22 consistency test, and this Court has said a number of23 times that failure internal -- of internal consistency is24 not a test related -- it doesn't rely on specific facts25 but it relies on hypotheticals.561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400 Alderson Reporting Company Washington, DC 20005 1-800-FOR-DEPO￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And in this instance, I think there's a veryclear failure of internal consistency.  Like in Scheiner,there's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker.If a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commercearound the country, it has to -- and just haul one load inevery State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay$4,800 in eligible -- in order to be eligible to haul inall of those States.  So that illustrates how that's goingto balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going tobe able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide.  Sothat carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in-- in only a few States or maybe none.          And again, we think that that defeats thepurpose.  When Congress passed economic deregulation ofthe trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up toout-of-state carriers to be able to augment theirinterstate loads.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Digges.          MR.
