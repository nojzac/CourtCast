Terry J. Hatter.          Mr. Wolfson.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          When Congress brought Federal judges within thecoverage of the Social Security and Medicare programs,they began to share with the vast majority of all otherAmericans the costs and benefits of a universal program ofsocial insurance that benefits society at large.  Theobligation to participate in those programs posed nothreat to the central purpose of the Compensation Clause,which is to protect the judiciary from interference fromthe other political branches.          As this Court recognized in O'Malley v.Woodruff, judges are also citizens, and the CompensationClause does not grant them an immunity from participatingin the burden of Government, whose Constitution and lawsthey are charged with administering.          A nondiscriminatory tax that falls on judges aswell as most other citizens does not violate the3         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    Compensation Clause.  The concern that the Framers had 2    with Congress' possibly abusing its power to set judges' 3    statutory salaries does not apply to Congress' application 4    and extension of a nondiscriminatory tax on income. 5              Now, the Framers understood that when Congress 6    exercised its authority to enact statutory salaries, it 7    would have the opportunity for mischief. 8              QUESTION:  Excuse me, how does that 9    nondiscriminatory get into it?  Suppose Congress simply10    reduces the salaries of all Federal employees, officers11    and employees, and judges among them.  Surely the fact12    that it was nondiscriminatory wouldn't prevent it from13    violating the Compensation Clause, would it?14              MR. WOLFSON:  That is correct, Justice Scalia.15              QUESTION:  Although you could say they're16    clearly not trying to impair the independence of judges.17              MR. WOLFSON:  That's the holding, of course, of18    Will, which is that a nondiscriminatory reduction in19    Federal employees' salaries that includes judges does20    violate the Compensation Clause, but it's one thing to say21    that a direct reduction of judges' salaries violates the22    plain language of the clause, because it is, after all, a23    diminution of their compensation that is owed to them for24    their services, but it's another thing -- and -- but it's25    another thing to say that a tax, which is not a direct4               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9reduction of their compensation but is an obligation thatthey must share with all other citizens, implicates theCompensation Clause.          QUESTION:  Why is that, because a tax doesn'thave anything to do with their compensation, and thereforeit doesn't count?  Why would a discriminatory tax violatethe Compensation Clause, then?          MR. WOLFSON:  First of all, I think --          QUESTION:  If it doesn't have anything to dowith compensation, you could do it discriminatorily, I1011 assume.12              MR. WOLFSON:  I'm not sure it would violate the13    Compensation Clause itself.  It very likely would violate14    fundamental principles underlying Article III, a15    discriminatory tax, even if it didn't fall on judges'16    compensation.17              If -- one -- there are two, essentially two18    different principles here.  One is a reduction of judges'19    compensation, and another is discriminatory treatment of20    judges in some way which might or might not be directed at21    their salary or at their income.  I think the same22    principles would apply, a discriminatory tax principle23    would apply if Congress --24              QUESTION:  Well, what cases support the -- your25    second hypothesis?  We've had cases involving, you know,5ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    the Compensation Clause and decided them one way or the 2    other, but what cases support this second line of3 argument? 4              MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think the 5    cases like Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm show that there are 6    broader principles protecting the independence of the 7    judiciary that go beyond some political interference, that 8    go beyond just the Compensation Clause, but I want to add, 9    even if I'm wrong, and even if one should analyze the10    discriminatory tax on judges' salaries under the11    Compensation Clause, that doesn't mean one would have to12    also conclude that a nondiscriminatory tax violates the13    Compensation Clause, because the clause would still be14    interpreted in light of its central purpose, which is to15    protect judges from interference with their function by16    the political branches.17 Now --18              QUESTION:  Well, but maybe -- you call it a19    central purpose, but it's not the only purpose, and it's20    clear that another purpose is to enable those who come to21    the bench, setting aside a lucrative profession, to be22    able to be sure that they will get so much money over the23    term of their lifetime service.  You acknowledge that's24    one of the purposes.25              MR. WOLFSON:  I certainly acknowledge that that6               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    is a benefit that the Compensation Clause has, but I think2    it's -- I think it's --3              QUESTION:  A purpose.  I mean --4              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I'm not sure that I agree5    that that is a central purpose of the Compensation Clause.67 then? 8 9    would certainly be a benefit of the clause, but I think10    that even if that's -- even if that's so, and even if I11    agree with you, it doesn't necessarily follow -- it12    doesn't follow, in fact, that every expectation that a13    judge had, that he brought with him, or her, when taking14    office, was protected from any disparagement or any15    adverse effect by later action in Congress.16              After all, the same claim was made in Will.  The17    judges argued that the formula for adjusting the statutory18    salary had been built into the statute at the time they19    took the judges, and they fully expected that those20    adjustments in salaries would come automatically each21    year, and yet Congress in 2 years prevented those salaries22    from taking effect.23              QUESTION:  But there, it was because they had24    not yet become effective, and therefore they were not part25    of the compensation that the judges had --7               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOQUESTION:  You disagree with Alexander Hamilton,MR. WOLFSON:  But I -- Hamilton said that that 1              MR. WOLFSON:  But the broader point is that it 2    just is not the case that every single expectation that a 3    judge has about his financial position when he takes 4    office is something that the Compensation Clause freezes5 in place. 6              For example, Congress surely could have raised 7    the rate of the general applicable income tax on all 8    citizens in the exact same amount as was the amount of the 9    Medicare and Social Security taxes in this case, and10    Congress could have done so, in fact, because it had11    decided that from this point on these programs of social12    insurance should be financed out of general income tax13    revenues instead of a separate tax on income.14              QUESTION:  Perhaps, but is it fair to equate15    payments into a retirement system with general taxes?  I16    mean, when employers offer compensation, they offer a17    compensation package, which very often includes retirement18    plans.  Some of them are contributory, some of them are19    noncontributory, but that is part of the whole scheme of20    compensation, and it may well be the case that the general21    taxes are something entirely different, but does that22    necessarily show that contributions to retirement schemes23    are entirely different?  Isn't that much closer to24    involving the compensation of the judges?25              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I think that they bear8               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425elements, Social Security bears some analogizing to acontribution to a retirement scheme, but it also isprincipally a tax that is laid on the wages and salariesof every earner.          QUESTION:  It's quite -- it's actually quitedifferent from other compensation schemes, where you getout what you --          MR. WOLFSON:  Right --          QUESTION:  -- a fraction of what you paid in.Social Security, you can go for just a few quarters andget the whole deal, and pay 60 years and get nothing more.          MR. WOLFSON:  The -- not only that, but there'sboth a floor and a ceiling in Social Security benefits.Congress has also made clear by statute that it can adjustSocial Security benefits, and that there are nocontractual or vested rights in a particular level ofbenefit, so --          QUESTION:  And you could be -- you can be abachelor, or you could have nine children, and it would bethe same.  It's a tax.  It's not like the Civil Serviceretirement system that's also a piece of this case.          MR. WOLFSON:  Right.          QUESTION:  It's not a tax.          MR. WOLFSON:  It's a pay-as-you-go system,principally, and it operates on a principle that a large                             9         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9fund is being financed by all taxpayers, and that alltaxpayers -- and that all wage-earners also derive abenefit from it, but there's no direct connection.          QUESTION:  This was meant to replace for thesejudges the Civil Service retirement system, wasn't it,which they previously had been entitled to participate in?          MR. WOLFSON:  Actually, no.  The judges -- thejudges themselves, while judges, did not participate inthe Civil Service retirement system.  Now, Federalemployees did participate in an entirely separate, self-contained system, CSRS, and Congress did not bringincumbent Federal employees into Social Security on amandatory basis.          QUESTION:  Congress replaced that element ofcompensation with the Social Security system for otherFederal employees, right?          MR. WOLFSON:  For Federal employees --          QUESTION:  And yet you say that it really hasnothing to do with --          MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I --          QUESTION:  -- retirement or compensation forretirement.  It seems to me Congress thought it very much1011121314151617181920212223    did.2425          MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I -- no, I don't think thatCongress thought that Social Security is a Civil Service10         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    retirement system.  It is not a contributory retirement 2    system.  It is -- it obviously does, as does a Civil 3    Service retirement system, go to the -- go to citizens' 4    interests in retirement income security, and Congress 5    didn't want Federal employees to have to pay twice for 6    retirement income security. 7              QUESTION:  Why is the contributory versus 8    noncontributory factor, whether you get out as much as you 9    put in, why does that have anything to do with whether it10    is realistically regarded as part of your total11    compensation?  Does it make a difference, when an employer12    hires you and promises you a certain retirement system,13    whether you contribute to it or not, or whether, you know,14    somehow it is tied to your wages or not?  It seems to me15    it's part of the total employment package.16              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, first, the question here is17    not whether judges' Social Security benefits are part of18    their compensation.  I mean, the question that we are19    presenting here is whether Congress could ask judges, or20    could require judges to participate in the financing of a21    system that operates for the benefit of society at large,22    and that is the obligation that was extended to judges for23    the first time in 1983 and 1984.24              And the reason why that is different from a25    statutory form of compensation, or why, I should say, that11               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    the concerns that the Framers had with diminishing direct 2    reductions of statutory salary don't apply here, is that 3    when Congress enacts and shapes a general tax like Social 4    Security, it legislates with the broad perspective of 5    society at large, and it doesn't have a narrow focus on 6    the judiciary, and when Congress sets the generally 7    applicable tax rate, it is also constrained by political 8    checks, by the popular political objection to -- 9              QUESTION:  But you could say that Congress did10    have a focus on the judiciary here, since judges weren't11    included until 1983, and then it was decided to bring12    judges in, who had not been in before.13              MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, Congress --14    it's true Congress brought judges -- Congress eliminated15    the exemption.  It did bring judges within the Social16    Security system, and that is part of a general progress of17    extension of the Social Security system over time since18    1934 to the present.  I mean, it's one of many extensions19    that Congress has made.20              In 1984, along with Federal judges and new hires21    in the Federal Government, it brought in employees of22    nonprofit organizations.  In 1986, it extended mandatory23    coverage to employees of State and local governments who24    weren't otherwise covered by a system similar to CSRS.25              QUESTION:  That may be, but when they do come to12               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    the step of extending it or not extending it to this very 2    discrete group of individuals, judges, you're confronted 3    with the problem that they may be induced to extend it or 4    not to extend it on the basis of whether they like judges 5    or not, on the basis of whether they think these judges 6    have been coming out with decisions of the sort they like7 or not. 8              Once you allow Congress, whether it's part of a 9    step-by-step proceeding or not, to single out judges for10    an imposition of this sort, you run the risk that, you11    know, that they're doing it for a wrong reason, and we12    can't inquire case-by-case whether they did it because13    they were mad at judges or not.14              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, first of all, there is no15    claim in this case that Congress did this for that reason,16    that Congress extended the coverage of the programs to17    judges.1819202122232425          QUESTION:  I don't know how you'd find that out,to tell you the truth.          MR. WOLFSON:  Well, second, this isn't -- excuseme.  This is not the imposition of a special tax.  This isthe -- this is eliminating an exemption that had precludedjudges from both the costs and benefits of the SocialSecurity program, so that is a --QUESTION:  Well, but many judges, speaking                  13ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9generally, had already qualified for the Social Securitysystem in private practice.          MR. WOLFSON:  Many judges -- many judges mighthave, Mr. Chief Justice.  Some judges might have not.Judges also get a benefit that society at large has fromhaving a fiscally sound Social Security program thatbenefits everybody.          After all, the logic of Social Security is notjust that it benefits the people who pay in specificallyfor what they paid in.  It benefits -- it is a program ofsocial insurance.  It benefits us all that other peopleobtain Social Security benefits and are not impoverished,do not have to draw on public welfare resources --          QUESTION:  The figures that I have said that 95percent of those who were judges in 198 -- '82, '92 --'82 -- '82, 95 percent had already maxed out, so as tothat 95 percent, this had the effect of nothing but a tax.          MR. WOLFSON:  I don't think it would matter.          QUESTION:  That's at least the figures I saw.Do you have anything to the contrary, or do you thinkthey're not right?          MR. WOLFSON:  I think that there was a widevariety in judges' experience, and --          QUESTION:  You think these figures are not14         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO10111213141516171819202122232425    right?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WOLFSON:  I think it probably is the casethat the majority of judges, majority of judges werealready fully insured.          QUESTION:  Now, is it also right that -- is italso the case that when this was extended to, let's say --how many million in Federal employees were there in --there were about, say, 5, 10 million Federal employees,extended --          MR. WOLFSON:  A couple of million, I think.          QUESTION:  A couple of million, all right.As -- if there were 2 million, let's say, 1,950,000 itdidn't apply to, because there it was just for the future.          As to the remaining 50,000, there were probablyless, probably 5,000, maybe 2,000, it did apply to them,but they were given the choice whether to opt in or not.But for 800, there were only 800 out of that 50 million,or 5 -- 2 million that didn't -- that had no choice, thathad to take it, is that right, and those 800 were theFederal judges then sitting, so everybody else could optout --          MR. WOLFSON:  Well, that's not quite --          QUESTION:  -- but in fact only a few had to optout because it didn't cover any sitting employee but forthose few.          MR. WOLFSON:  Well, first of all it's not quite                            15         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    right, which is that in the first place one has to 2    remember that close situation of employees of the 3    legislative branch and Members of Congress, who before 4    1984 were not mandatorily covered by either CSRS or Social 5    Security, and they were required, as of '84, basically to 6    choose one, and so they were in roughly the same situation 7    as Federal judges, which is that beforehand they were not 8    subject to any mandatory contribution, and the other 9    person who is similarly situated is the President of the10    United States.11              QUESTION:  The President of the United States12    and the 800 judges had to accept this Social Security.  No13    one else did.14              MR.

So, but as to thisparticular tax at issue, the only ones that had to acceptit were the judges and the President.          QUESTION:  Is that right?  I just want to knowif that's right.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. WOLFSON:  They're the only ones who had toaccept it then, yes, but of course 90 percent of thecivilian labor force had to accept it.          QUESTION:  No, no --          MR. WOLFSON:  Right.  No, I understand, butthat's right.          QUESTION:  Isn't that, what you just said,totally irrelevant, in that isn't the issue whether or nota person who was already employed at that time had toaccept it?  I'm trying to just get the facts right.          MR. WOLFSON:  I understand.          QUESTION:  I'm not making an argument, yet. Iwant to get the facts right.          MR. WOLFSON:  They were the only people who werenewly required, as incumbent employees.          QUESTION:  Now, this is my question, if thosefacts are right.  Suppose Congress said, I want a generaltax, everyone in the United States will pay it, the tax isequal to $100,000 a person.  It's a big tax, but everybodypays it.  No problem with that for judges, right?  I'm --the answer is right, no problem.  Okay.          Now, what they do is say --          MR. WOLFSON:  I'm thinking about the end of the          QUESTION:  No -- everybody in the United States                            17         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO101112131415161718192021222324    question.25 1    happens to get a rebate, exactly of $100,000, or to make 2    it -- and, by the way, our reason for this is not to 3    discriminate against judges.  It's that everybody else in 4    the United States doesn't have this marvelous, guaranteed, 5    nonpayable in retirement system, so we're only leaving out 6    those who have this -- who happen to be judges, of course. 7              Now, a) is that okay, in your view, under the 8    Constitution? 9              MR. WOLFSON:  I doubt that would be okay.  I10 mean --11              QUESTION:  If that's not okay, and I don't think12    it is either, what's the difference?13              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, the question is -- well,14    first of all, it seems to me that even though Congress is15    calling that a tax, it really is not a tax.  It's not16    raising revenue.  It is what is, in effect, a reduction in17    judges' salaries.  That is to say, if -- what it is, is18    basically is if Congress had done the same thing that it19    did in Will, but had just called it a tax.20              That is, I don't think it would have mattered to21    the decision in Will if, instead of passing a law that22    said, this tax -- this salary increase is rescinded, if23    Congress had said, there shall be imposed a tax on Federal24    judges in the amount equal to the salary increase that25    they received on October 1, 1979, so I mean, I think the18               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    first question is, is that really a bona fide tax of any 2    kind, and so I think that's one question. 3              Then the second question, even if one gets that 4    point, the second question is, is there a legitimate 5    reason for Congress to treat Federal judges differently 6    from everybody else? 7              QUESTION:  Well, there is.  The reason is that 8    they have, guaranteed by the Constitution, a retirement 9    system, and no one else does.  Now, is that a legitimate10    reason, or not?11              MR. WOLFSON:  I don't think it would be in the12    situation that you present, because it doesn't -- I13 mean --14              QUESTION:  No, no, no.  I mean, it's easy to15    manipulate the hypothetical.  We don't call it 100,000,16    call it 50,000, have it come out of the retirement17    committees of Congress, have it viewed as some kind of18    effort to help people who don't have guaranteed19    retirement.  I mean, you know, we could fix that up.20              MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Breyer, I agree that when21    Congress treats judges for tax purposes differently than22    other people who are similarly situated, it has to have a23    significant reason for doing so, but I would say two24    things.  First of all, I think that tax equalization,25    bringing judges into line with the vast majority of other19               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    people and also extending, of course, the benefits of 2    the -- the attendant benefits of the coverage that I 3    discussed earlier to them as well as everybody else, as 4    well as 90 percent of the civilian labor force, I believe 5    that that is a significant reason for tax equal -- for 6    treating judges for tax purposes equally, as all other7 citizens. 8              Now, the hypothetical that you gave me is not 9    tax equalization.  I mean, it's -- it is imposing a10    special tax on judges.11              So that, I think is -- I think that is almost12    always, perhaps always, a legitimate objective of13    Congress, which is to treat judges equally with all other14    citizens for tax purposes, because the Constitution does15    not require Congress to grant judges a perpetual exemption16    from taxes.  What it does require Congress to do is to17    recognize that when judges take office with a particular18    salary, that they cannot reduce that level of salary.19              QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, do I understand your20    argument to be essentially, this is no different than if21    Congress had initially given Federal judges an exemption22    from income tax, and they enjoy that exemption -- say, a23    judge when he took office got that exemption.  10 years24    later, the Congress decides that judges shouldn't be25    exempt from the Federal income tax, so puts it on.20               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              Now, we decided a case that deals with the 2    prospective aspect of it and said that's okay if someone 3    was coming on the bench, once the tax is in.  We didn't 4    decide the part that says, what about people who are 5    already there. 6              MR. WOLFSON:  Right.  I -- 7              QUESTION:  Is it your view that these two cases 8    are the same? 9              MR. WOLFSON:  Yes, they are, and that case that10    you mentioned is basically the case that was decided by11    the Fourth Circuit in Baker v. Commissioner, after this12    Court decided O'Malley, and in that case, a panel in which13    Chief Justice Stone sat, it raised the situation that14    after this Court's decision in Miles against Graham,15    Congress exempted judges from the income tax and then,16    after O'Malley, it brought them back within the income17 tax --18              QUESTION:  And that's okay, you say.19              MR. WOLFSON:  Yes, I think that is okay.20              QUESTION:  That's okay.21              MR. WOLFSON:  Yes, and --22              QUESTION:  You know, there's some science23    fiction book I read once that had a devilishly clever plot24    in which one of the protagonists is poisoned, but he has a25    poison scanner that detects all sorts of poison, so you21               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    couldn't get to him that way, and the way they get to him 2    is that they give him something that isn't poison, but 3    that is very addictive, and then withhold it from him, and 4    if he doesn't get it, he will die.  You're saying that you 5    can do the same thing with Federal judges. 6              (Laughter.) 7              QUESTION:  You cannot put a new tax just on 8    judges, but when they come in, you can say, hey, guys, 9    we're going to give all of you a special tax exemption,10    and if you behave yourselves, you can keep that tax11    exemption, but you get us mad, and you're not going to12    have that special exemption any more.  You really think13    that that's okay?14              MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Scalia, I think the15    problem with analyzing it that way is that there's no16    question that Congress could have raised everybody's17    income taxes in the exact same amount that it raised18    judges, that it was equal to the Medicare and Social19    Security taxes in these cases.20              So judges did not have any expectation -- if21    they came into office at the salary of $100,000 and the22    income tax rate was 30 percent, there's no question, or it23    isn't disputed in this case, I don't think, that Congress24    could have raised the general income tax on everybody 5,25    10 percent.  It might have required -- it might have been22               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    required to by economic distress, by wartime.2              Not only that, Congress could have imposed what3    it has called from time to time a surtax, which is, you4    know, a special kind of tax that is found necessary to5    impose from time to time.6              Now, that has the exact same economic effect as7    a -- as the elimination of the 5.4 -- the exemption for8    the 5.4 percent for Social Security taxes and the Medicare9    tax, so I think it's just wrong to say that the judges had10    an enforceable entitlement that required Congress to11    freeze this in place, because their economic situation12    could have been changed in exactly the same way.13              QUESTION:  Isn't the reason that judges were14    distinguished from some other categories in this general15    revision of the Federal retirement system, isn't one of16    the reasons that they had a guaranteed retirement income,17    and that was the basis for narrowing the focus to judges?18    Do you think that's a fair basis for saying, well, since19    you have this retirement income, which the Constitution20    guarantees you, we're going to use that guaranteed income21    as the basis for treating you differently from other22    people?23242523               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          MR. WOLFSON:  I think it would be accurate tosay that Congress realized that if it was -- if itextended the Social Security taxes -- and we're only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425talking about the old age tax here.  I mean, the Medicaretax applies to everybody across the board, so that'scompletely nondiscriminatory, but as for the OASDI tax, ifCongress had required incumbent Federal employees to paythat, they would have been subject to double deductions,and Congress realized that that in itself was unfair.That is, it would be required to treat alike things thatwere not, in fact, alike, so the fact that judges had theguaranteed retirement annuity was a difference fortreating them differently.          I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Wolfson.          Mr. Rosenthal, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN S. ROSENTHAL               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          We believe that the Court determined theliability issues in 1996 and need not reach them now, butif this Court does reach the liability issues, we believethis case presents the question whether a tax can ever bea diminution in judicial compensation.  We contend that itcan in at least two circumstances.  Circumstance number 1is where Congress or the political branches change theeconomic tradeoff that a judge makes when assuming the24         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    bench, and secondly, where Congress discriminates against 2    Federal judges. 3              QUESTION:  What authority in our cases is there 4    for either of those, Mr. Rosenthal? 5              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, with respect to the 6    discrimination, the latter, virtually every one of these 7    cases, especially the Woodrow case, refers to a 8    nondiscriminatory tax. 9              With respect to the issue of the tradeoff, the10    tradeoff is derived from both Will and Evans, which refer11    to the fact that one of the primary purposes, an equal12    purpose of the clause, was to bring judges -- bring13    qualified judges into the judiciary.  To quote Alexander14    Hamilton, one of the purposes of the clause was to get15    people with the requisite knowledge, combined with the16    requisite integrity.  That was a primary purpose, as he17    indicated in Federalist 78.18              Therefore, the purpose was so that -- and I'm19    again quoting Hamilton.  It was so that a man knew what20    ground he stood on, and the ground that these judges stood21    on was, they didn't get -- they got a lot of22    disadvantages, Your Honors, from when they became Federal23    judges, but one of the small advantages they did get was,24    all of the plaintiffs were free from OASDI and HI, and25    that was retroactively changed.25               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  So would you say on that reasoning 2    that when the Social Security tax came in and everybody in 3    the general population was exposed to it, and the judges 4    were not, that the judges' compensation went up, they had 5    an increase -- they had an increase in compensation, 6    therefore, that couldn't be decreased later on. 7              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well -- 8              QUESTION:  You would have to say that, that 9    exempting them from the tax increased their compensation.10              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I would prefer to say it11    the other way.  Our view is that compensation refers,12    Justice Ginsburg, to what's available for the support and13    sustenance of a judge.  When our clients, when these14    plaintiffs took office they had available to them the15    stated salary, but the stated salary without a deduction16    for OASDI and HI, and --17              QUESTION:  But if they couldn't diminish the18    compensation, and this is a diminution, you argue --19              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes.20              QUESTION:  -- then equally, it had to be an21    augmentation when the Social Security first came in and22    the judges were exempt from it.  If it didn't increase23    their salary, how did it decrease their salary?24              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I -- I'm not sure how I25    answer the question about whether it was -- the exemption26               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    constituted an increase.  It may have, but it's quite 2    clear to me that the imposition of the tax definitely 3    constituted a decrease, and this was a policy decision, 4    Justice Ginsburg, that was made by Congress in 1935. 5              QUESTION:  What about a judge who has served -- 6    this is perhaps a rather -- a very old judge, who was 7    serving in '37.  When they came in, they're exempted, so 8    unlike the rest of the population the judge gets a benefit 9    that the rest of the population doesn't get.  Then he10    continues to serve until 1982.  Then the exemption is11    taken away.  Now, he's in no worse shape now than he was12    when he went on the bench in 1936.13              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Your Honor, that is admittedly14    not this particular case.  What that is is actually the15    evidence case itself.  That was a case in which the judge16    took office before the tax was imposed on the general17 public.18              Our position is that the -- that a general rate19    increase which is uniform for the entire population does20    not -- and applies to everybody, does not change judicial21    compensation, and although we believe that the principle22    of evidence is correct, we believe there is a possibility,23    Mr. Chief Justice, that the particular facts of evidence24    might have been different, depending on whether Evans was25    appointed in 1912 or 1915.27               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  What about a change in the tax rate?          MR. ROSENTHAL:  No.  Your Honor, if it's auniform change in the tax rate, that doesn't go to thepurpose of the clause.  What we're looking for are changesin taxation which will induce justices who are in officeto leave office, or lead potential candidates not to jointhe bench.          QUESTION:  It seems to me that's reallystretching Article III.  I mean, it's a perfectly goodpolicy reason, but I don't think our cases have -- atleast in their holdings haven't extended Article III tothat length.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I think, with respect, Ithink that a fair reading of Hamilton -- Hamilton's --          QUESTION:  Well, Hamilton's not a case.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, I understand, it's not acase.  But in reality, the only case that is here, theonly case which has dealt with this issue is Evans v.Gore, and Evans v. Gore might have used broader language,but it didn't deal with this particular case.          QUESTION:  Well, O'Malley casts some doubt onEvans against Gore, didn't it?          MR. ROSENTHAL:  On the broad reasoning of Evansv. Gore, but O'Malley does -- because the Court overturnedMiles but didn't overturn Evans, I think a fair reading of28         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    this Court's case law, reading the three cases together, 2    is that the principle we're advocating, a change for a 3    sitting judge in -- that changes the economic tradeoff, is 4    prohibited by the Compensation Clause.  That's the 5    principle we derive from reading those three clauses 6    together, and I -- 7              QUESTION:  All that was involved in O'Malley is 8    it was somebody who came on board -- 9              MR. ROSENTHAL:  After --10              QUESTION:  -- after the tax, so the Court didn't11    have to deal with somebody who was already a judge when12    the tax came on, but is your --13              MR. ROSENTHAL:  That's correct, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  I think I grasp your argument15    correctly that you would say, if the -- there is no income16    tax, and there are sitting judges, and then Congress puts17    an income tax on the general population, everybody, you18    can't put it on the judges who were appointed to the bench19    before the tax came in.20              MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, that isn't -- our position21    is, this Court doesn't have to reach that question.  Our22    position is that if Congress were to adopt a new tax23    today, and were to impose it uniformly on both judges and24    nonjudges, there would be no incentive for a judge to want25    to leave the bench.  There would have been no disincentive29               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011    judgeship.12              MR.

ROSENTHAL:  In the private sector or on the15    bench.1617181920212223242530               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOfor him going on to the bench.          QUESTION:  But it changes the tradeoff.  Youwere making a tradeoff argument before, and it seems to methat Justice Ginsburg's question goes right to thetradeoff, and if your tradeoff argument is right, it seemsto me you've got to say, no, it can't -- that tax can'tbe imposed --          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I may have misunderstoodJustice Ginsburg's question.QUESTION:  I'm deciding whether to take a          QUESTION:  Right, and then I take the bench, andthey -- but I know what my salary is.MR. ROSENTHAL:  That's right.QUESTION:  And then there is a tax.MR. ROSENTHAL:  Imposed on --QUESTION:  Imposed on everybody, so my take-home pay is less, because of this tax.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  I would submit, JusticeGinsburg, that on that fact pattern there is no incentiveto leave the bench because the tax is the same on both 1    sides of the equals sign. 2              QUESTION:  Sure, but the income isn't. When I -- 3    the theory of the tradeoff is that I go on the bench, I 4    take less money, but I know where I stand, and it seems to 5    me that argument is just as strong when the tax goes on 6    everybody.  It's quite true, I can go out and start 7    earning a living under different conditions, but I -- the 8    deal is being changed. 9              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Our position is that, although10    that additional category might be covered, we don't need11    to reach that question in this case.  At least in our view12    of the tradeoff, Justice Souter, we don't need to deal13    with a case where there is a uniform change in rates or a14    uniform change in --15              QUESTION:  But I think it does cut against your16    tradeoff argument.  A judge can go on the bench, no income17    tax anywhere, saying, I'm getting 100,000 a year for this18    job, I've got so many kids to educate, I can just make it19    the way it is, and I'm willing to sacrifice whatever I20    would have -- more I would have made in the profession.21              But then the tax comes along and the tradeoff,22    what he had bargained for is no longer there.23              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, Your Honor, I understand24    that position.25              QUESTION:  I really don't think Hamilton would31               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have bought your argument there.  I think -- you know, thejudge knows where he stands --          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I think the impositionof -- this Court held in Evans v. Gore and that theimposition of a new tax does violate the CompensationClause.  We don't reach that issue because we have a morelimited circumstance.  We have a case where judges takeoffice during a 50-year period in which Congress had apolicy in effect that a tax would not be applied.          This is not a transitory issue, I might add.          QUESTION:  Well, under that same reasoning, ifthe judges take office and there's no tax for SocialSecurity, and there's a Social Security tax on everybodyelse, under that reasoning, if Congress decides to repealthe Social Security tax on everybody else, the tradeoffhas now been changed as well.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  And if it did -- if it didrepeal the tax on everybody else and left it in effect --          QUESTION:  No, so -- even if the judges stilldon't pay it, they're still in a less advantageousposition vis-a-vis everybody else under your tradeoffargument.  Congress can't repeal the tax on anybody else,either --          MR.

One is, it's not a uniform tax.  It'sonly applying to some people and not others, in your view.MR.

ROSENTHAL:  Thank God, there are.16              We have -- we had 2-1/2 million, approximately,17    Federal employees to whom this tax was not applied.  Those18    were incumbent Federal employees who were not required to19    join OASDI.  That represented 99-1/2 percent --20              QUESTION:  But they were required to join that21    or something else.22              MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, actually, they were already23    in CSRS, and they were allowed to simply stay where they24    were, but they were not required to join OASDI.25              QUESTION:  But they were already having a bigger34               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425bite taken out for the CR -- the Civil Service retirementwas a larger percentage of their salary than the SocialSecurity would be.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  I believe --          QUESTION:  So if you were socking them withSocial Security on top of the 7 percent for Civil Service,and then putting 5.7 -- I think those employees would say,we've been discriminatorily impacted.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  All of that, I -- we view asbeing form over substance, because -- well, because theGovernment sets the salaries and then takes 6, 7, 8percent out.  They could have just as easily have set thesalary at the lower level and said, we give you thisbenefit, which is what they did with judges.  Instead ofsaying, you get paid X dollars and we take out 10 percentfor your retirement annuity, they simply set the salaryand say you get the retirement annuity.          We view that as essentially artificial.  It'sjust -- the fact that it's taken out is just a matter ofthe semantics of the way the statute was enacted.          QUESTION:  But you were just giving the numbersthat I was quite interested in.

I'm tryingto think of people in the Federal Government who get apaycheck once a month.  Now, most of these people don'thave as good a retirement program as judges, so it'salready -- that paycheck is right there.  It's alreadyreflecting a great thing for judges, okay.          Now, we look at that paycheck.  Now, I want toknow -- I'm just thinking, some people will get a smallerone because of Social Security.   Other people won't get asmaller one at all than they had been getting.          Okay, I want to know who's getting a smaller onethan they had been getting, and who is getting the sameone they had been getting?          MR. ROSENTHAL:  I'm happy to answer thatquestion.  The Article III judges and the President of theUnited States are in that category.

Nobody else is.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  That is contrary to what the SG justsaid, because the SG just said there are also some peoplein Congress.  Now, who are those people?          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, there was a theoreticalpossibility that you had not been in CSRS before, and theGovernment for the first time in the reply brief raisedthis issue.          I've done some inquiries, and I am informed thatthat set of people who did not elect CSRS is either veryfew or none at all, and the reason for that is, it wasalmost irrational not to elect CSRS because it'srefundable, so if you were a youngster who was just out ofschool and went to work for Congress in 199 -- 1983, youelect CSRS because 2 years later you can get the money10111213141516171819    back.2021 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  You're saying, as of the date thatthis took effect, there might have been some people inCongress who were not already having a deduction fromtheir paycheck, but you believe that number is zero.          MR.

ROSENTHAL:  It's very small, Your Honor. 3    But of the 2-1/2 -- of the 2-1/2 million, we're talking 4    about, a number in the three digits or the low four5 digits. 6              The fact is -- and that is the basis of our 7    discrimination argument, and I would point out that the 8    election that was given was not just given once, it was 9    given three times, so if you were fool enough to miss it10    the first time, you were given a number of opportunities11    to opt out of the deduction from your salary, and that is12    the basis for our discrimination argument.13              The Government says, oh, we have a rationale for14    discrimination, and that is equalization.  I would answer15    that, number 1, this Court's decision in the Will case16    said, equalization can't justify a diminution, because the17    Government made the same argument in Will.  They said, oh,18    we lowered Federal judges' salaries, but we were lowering19    all Federal employees' salaries at the same time, and this20    Court said, equalization can't be a rationale.21              But secondly, the fact is that it doesn't take a22    very creative legislature to come up with some reasonably23    sounding rationale to justify a diminution in a particular24    case, and equalization, which is an argument concocted --25    excuse me, an argument presented by the Solicitor38               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    General's office, nowhere appears in the legislative2    history of any of these statutes.3              There's nothing -- this equalization doctrine,4    as we point out in our brief, is nothing that appears in5    the statute or in its legislative history.  They didn't6    say, we need to tax Federal judges because we need7    equalization.  We think, at a bare minimum, for this8    argument to be honored by this Court, at least Congress9    ought to say, we wanted to equalize Federal judges.  We10    still don't think it's constitutional, but --11              QUESTION:  Is there any evidence in the12    legislative history, or any evidence that might have been13    admissible in this case, that there was a discriminatory14    intent?1516171819202122232425          MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, and this Court has neverrequired discriminatory intent.  In Will, recall, JusticeSouter, there was an increase for a mere 12 hours, andthen the salaries dropped back down again.  There was nofleeing from the Federal judiciary.          QUESTION:  No, that's quite true, but I mean,that was a case in which it was -- in effect, it was easy,because it was stated salary, and you could say, howeveryou literally read the Compensation Clause, this had to bewithin it. Now we're not in such a situation.  We're                   39ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    saying, well, this isn't so clearly literally within the 2    core of the Compensation Clause, and maybe one of our -- 3    maybe our principle criterion ought to be to determine 4    whether this is also prohibited, since it gets away from 5    the core, is a discrimination criterion, was it used to 6    discriminate for purposes of cowing the judges and so on, 7    so the fact that in the core case we didn't look to it 8    doesn't mean that we shouldn't look to it here. 9              MR. ROSENTHAL:  If I could suggest a case which10    I think is quite analogous, and that's Davis v. Michigan11    Department of Revenue.12              As the Court may recall, that was a case in13    which State employees were exempted -- State retirees were14    exempted from a tax on their retirement benefits.  Federal15    employees and the rest of the Michigan public had to pay16    income taxes on retirement benefits.  This Court held,17    under the intragovernmental immunity doctrine, that that18    was discriminatory.  There was no intent to discriminate19    against Federal employees.20              QUESTION:  But isn't that because that's what21    the intragovernmental immunity doctrine means?  In other22    words, it was discriminatory as a matter of law, rather23    than discriminatory as a matter of intent.24              So I guess you would have to say, on that25    analogy, anything which is unequal to the extent of a40               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    penny is, on the discrimination criterion, going to be 2    discriminatory as a matter of law, and I guess that's what 3    you are saying. 4              MR. ROSENTHAL:  I think that is what we're 5    saying, and obviously the penny -- I mean, if there were a 6    penny drop in stated salary, that obviously would be 7    unconstitutional, but we infer the intent from the facts. 8              QUESTION:  Well, if we get outside the 9    Compensation Clause, several recent congressional pay10    raises in 1989 gave district judges a higher percentage11    pay raise than court of appeals judges, court of appeals12    judges a higher percentage pay raise than Supreme Court13    justices.  Now, would that be grounds for saying that14    maybe Congress had it in for the Supreme Court?15              MR. ROSENTHAL:  No, Your Honor.  I mean --16              QUESTION:  Well, why not, under your theory?17              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, because first of all we're18    dealing -- all of those cases are by common consent19    increases, and this Court's holding in various cases give20    Congress very broad power when one is dealing with an21    increase.  The discretion with Congress is how much to22    increase.23242541               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          There is no dispute -- there is a factualfinding by a rather unsympathetic trial court that therewas a reduction in our salary in this case.  There was a 1    reduction in take-home pay, so we're dealing here with a 2    reduction in take-home pay, and the question in this case 3    is, was it an unconstitutional reduction? 4              So we distinguish it from cases where there are 5    different levels of increase, where, frankly, political 6    factors do play a role, but that was a decision made by 7    the Framers, that when you deal with increase Congress has 8    a much greater role than with a decrease, where a 9    prophylactic rule has to be --10              QUESTION:  Is the word discrimination applicable11    here or not?12              My check is $200 smaller this month.  No one13    else's is but for judges and four other people, and the14    reason is not that they don't like my opinion.  The reason15    is because I have a constitutionally guaranteed pension,16    something that judges only have.17              Now, those are the facts.  Is that18    discrimination?19202122232425          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well --          QUESTION:  In a sense, it's not, because they'renot doing it because they don't like my opinion.  In asense it is, because they're picking on a characteristicthat belongs only to judges.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I agree --          QUESTION:  What is it?42         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, I think the worddiscrimination is used to cover a number of things.  Itdoesn't necessarily, Justice Breyer, just include anintent by Congress.  It includes exactly the circumstanceyou're describing, in which a distinction is made betweenFederal judges.          Suppose the distinction weren't merely based onthe pension, but the fact that we think you should getless because you've got a lifetime job and everyone elseholds their job at the pleasure of the President of theUnited States.  Any factor that inheres peculiarly withinthe judiciary, and is a basis for a distinction, I thinkcould also be a basis for finding discrimination.  Inother words it covers a broad mix of factors.          QUESTION:  Mr. Rosenthal, does this targeting ofjudges almost exclusively apply to both programs, or justto one of them?          MR. ROSENTHAL:  No.  This would only apply tothe OASDI.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  We agree with that.  The HI wasmore universal.  Our first argument about the tradeoffwould have to apply to the --          QUESTION:  But you're saying the second tax isno good, either, then -- as I understand it -- or are you43         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    just saying the OASDI? 2              MR. ROSENTHAL:  The discrimination argument, 3    Justice Ginsburg, only applies to the OASDI, because it 4    doesn't apply to the HI. 5              QUESTION:  So then to that extent you're saying, 6    Congress has a choice.  Either it taxes -- it gives no 7    exemption, ever, to judges, because if it gives them an 8    exemption, it can never take it away, so it's got to treat 9    judges -- it can't give them preferential treatment, in10    other words, if it gives them preferential treatment, that11    it's stuck with that, but you --12              MR. ROSENTHAL:  Well, that's correct, Your13    Honor.  If I could just give you an analogy, suppose14    Congress next year, instead of providing an increase in15    stated salaries, said, all judges can take $10,000 tax-16    free, $10,000 of their income is tax-free.  I point out17    this is not so unusual.  Congress for a number of years18    gave the President $50,000 for expenses tax-free.19              I would submit that becomes part of a judge's20    compensation, and Congress -- the Congress can't, 10 years21    later, decide to take it away.22              QUESTION:  Explain how that -- you've answered23    my question, did the judge's compensation go up when24    everybody else was exposed to this tax and the judges25    weren't, and you resisted saying that yes, they got an44               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425increase in compensation, even though their salaryremained the same.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  I resist it because exemptionfrom a tax -- I think now that I've used my hypothetical,I think if there were at least one directed to judges, ifthere were an exemption, that might be interpreted to bean increase in --          QUESTION:  You wouldn't say, as I understandyour argument -- I don't understand why you wouldn't --that if everybody in the country had a $10,000 exemption,your first $10,000 is for free, okay, and then they tookit away for the whole country, is it your contention thatjudges alone would have to be --          MR. ROSENTHAL:  If it were uniform throughoutthe United States, we're not contending that that wouldconstitute a diminution --          QUESTION:  I understand that's your position,and it's a reasonable outcome, but I don't see why thelogic of your argument supports that.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Because, at least on thediscriminatory point, it wouldn't be discriminatory.          QUESTION:  No, on the discriminatory point Iunderstand --          MR. ROSENTHAL:  But I --          QUESTION:  -- but you're using this argument for45         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    the aspect of your case in which there is no2    discrimination.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. ROSENTHAL:  I admit that these representclose cases, but our position -- first of all, it's notthis particular case, but moreover, I think changes intaxing, if they were uniform and taken away from judges,my inclination is not to be arguing here that that's partof compensation.          QUESTION:  In other words, you're saying for the10,000 exemption just what you were saying for theoriginal tax, which is nondiscriminatory.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. ROSENTHAL:  Let me briefly touch on the lastpoint, the claim of the Government that this increase wasterminated by subsequent increases.  Our position is verysimple.  A congressional action doesn't remedy orterminate an unconstitutional diminution if the judge'scompensation is the same, unless it is the same as itwould have been but for the unconstitutional diminution.We are subscribing to a but-for test.          It's quite clear that the increases that tookplace after OASDI and HI were imposed were general cost-of-living increases that applied not just to judges but tobroad categories of Federal employees.  We would have46         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    gotten those anyway, and in that circumstance it can 2    hardly be said that those terminated or remedied our 3    particular diminution in this particular case. 4              We do contend, however, that if Congress were to 5    provide us with the amount of our diminution plus 6    interest, that would compensate us for past periods. 7              We urge this Court to affirm the Federal Circuit 8    and hold that in order to vindicate both the text, which 9    we believe is clearly applicable in this particular case,10    and the purposes of the Compensation Clause, that the11    plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that's ordered.12              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal.13              Mr. Wolfson, you have 5 minutes remaining.14              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON15                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER16              MR. WOLFSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.17              When Congress extended Social Security taxes to18    Federal judges and to other Federal employees in 1984 it19    had several objectives that had to be balanced.  One20    objective was to bring as many people as possible within21    the Social Security system, people who had been exempted22    from it in order to sustain the fiscal soundness of the23    system.242547               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          Another objective was to treat Federal -- peoplein Federal service similarly in that each should be 1    subjected to one, but only one, contribution for 2    retirement income security, and a third was, Congress 3    understood that Federal employees in the Civil Service 4    retirement system had a large vested interest in that 5    system, which had been in place since 1920, and that it 6    would be extremely disruptive just to terminate it and 7    start as if it had never existed, especially because many 8    Federal employees would not have been able to accrue 9    enough service in Social Security after that point to10    become eligible in Social Security, especially if they11    were older.  The Federal -- the Civil Service retirement12    system allows retirement at age 55.13              It also is more expensive on the cost side for14    Federal employees than Social Security in some sense,15    because the contribution rate is higher, and there was no16    earnings cap on Social Security -- on CSRS, as there was17    under the old age tax system, so all of those factors had18    to be balanced.19              The point is, at the end of the day, Federal20    judges joined virtually everybody else in our society in21    being subject to a 5, 6 percent mandatory contribution for22    a retirement income security system, and that's what I23    mean when I say that the overall objective of Congress was24    equalization, and that Congress treated them no25    differently at the end of the day than it treated48               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    everybody else. 2              Now, it is true, there are issues that come up 3    in a transition, as there are any time when Congress 4    extended Social Security, or where a State might adjust -- 5    a State might adjust an exemption, for example, the 6    intragovernmental tax immunity system doctrine was alluded7 to. 8              Well, there was a time when States exempted all 9    Federal employees and Federal contractors from their taxes10    because they thought they were required to under this11    Court's decisions in Collector v. Day.  Then along came12    Graves, and the Court said that States could tax Federal13    employees and Federal contractors on an equal rate.  The14    States were required to adjust their systems, or had the15    opportunity to adjust their systems, and they were able to16    do so in many different ways.17              It required some -- it required a lot of18    adjustment because of the ways that different people had19    been treated differently, and this Court has many cases on20    that point, reviewing the adjustments that the States21    made, but the point is, the principle that emerged from22    those cases was, what was required at the end of the day23    was nondiscriminatory taxation of those who dealt with the24    Federal Government, and that principle we think is the25    same principle that should govern here.  That is, at the49               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    end of the day, Congress is required to do more than treat 2    Federal judges on par with the vast majority of American3 citizens. 4              I do want to touch on the termination of 5    violation point, which is, even if we're wrong about 6    everything that I just said, it seems to me the only 7    expectation that judges could have had when they took 8    office was that their net pay would not have been reduced 9    below the level at which they took office.10              So the expectation -- the expectation that11    judges had was not that they remain exempt from Social12    Security taxes in a kind of indefinite number that is13    just, they have an interest in an exemption, quia14    exemption, but a particular number has to be put on that,15    so if a violation did occur, the violation came to an end16    when Congress brought judges' net pay back up above the17    highest level that it had ever been at any earlier time.18              If the Court has nothing further --19              QUESTION:  Well, yes, as long as you're at it,20    the part that was bothering me was not the part, treating21    judges the same.  It was the part of treating judges22    differently.  So what -- I mean, they're treated23    differently in that everybody else is allowed to opt out24    but judges.  Now --25              MR.
