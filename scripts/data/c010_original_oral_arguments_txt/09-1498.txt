Tinklenberg.Official - Subject to Final ReviewD. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. ROBERTS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:To accommodate important pretrial proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing trial. This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt disposition of such motion.For more than 30 years, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless of its effect on the trial schedule. The court below correctly rejected that established rule, which accords with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades.The Court's cases construing the exclusion,3￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule.2 They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically3 once a motion is filed without any need for district4 court findings. Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared5 with the approach of Respondent and the court below.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all that might7 be true. On the other hand, the statute does say "delay8 resulting." And under your approach, the time would be9 excluded even if delay does not result.10 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. Delay refers11 to the interval of time from the filing of the motion12 through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial13 Act's deadline is tolled. We know that delay has the14 meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the15 interval of time between two events.16 And we know it has that meaning in the17 statute here because subsection (D) tells us so. It18 defines the period of excludable delay resulting from19 the motion as the time from the filing through the20 disposition of the motion. Respondent's definition -­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice says22 only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if23 it results in a delay. Well, suppose it doesn't result24 in a delay?25￼MR. ROBERTS: That's assuming that delay is4Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in2 the trial. But delay can't have that meaning because if3 it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with4 subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time,5 of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the6 motion through the disposition of the motion, because7 the statute excludes periods of delay.8 And if delay meant postponement of the9 trial, then the excluded period would be the time during10 which trial is postponed, but that period is often11 significantly shorter or longer than the time from the12 filing of the motion to the disposition. And in13 Henderson and Bloate -­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that doesn't -- that15 prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief16 Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -­17 there's a delay that results and in other cases there18 isn't.19 MR. ROBERTS: But, Your Honor, the statute20 excludes the period of delay, and then it says the21 period of delay is the time from the filing through the22 disposition. If delay -- if delay means postponement of23 the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in24 the first part is the -- is the time during which trial25 is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection5￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 (D) because that period is not necessarily the period2 from the filing through the disposition.3 If I could give you an example. Say a4 motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and5 the motion takes 16 days to resolve. Trial is postponed6 only by two days. And so if delay means the7 postponement of trial, then the period of delay should8 be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the9 excludable time is the time from the filing through the10 disposition, which is 16 days.11 And that's what this Court held in Henderson12 and Bloate, that that's the exact time. So if you adopt13 a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering14 mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't15 line up with the rest of the statute.16 In addition, that would be a totally17 unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would18 turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of19 whether the motion would or could delay when trial would20 begin, and it's often going to be difficult or21 impossible to make that determination at the time that22 the motion is filed.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, is there -­24 is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress25 might have had in mind is that in criminal cases6￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the2 trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after3 that period runs?4 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Sometimes5 trial -- judges might take motions into account in6 setting the trial date and other times they might not7 take the motions into account. So a rule that -- that8 said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the9 trial date in response to the motion would lead to10 arbitrary results.11 It would mean basically that whether time12 was excludable depended on whether the judge took the13 motions into account when it set the trial date14 initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly15 estimated the amount of time. And also sometimes16 motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the17 rule would be totally unworkable in that situation.18 And Respondent, in one of his formulations19 for what the test might be, suggests that a motion20 wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would21 postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial22 could otherwise begin. That's just a totally unworkable23 rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts24 would have to assess the effect of multiple different25 factors that could affect when trial would begin, such7￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 as: How much time do the parties and the counsel need2 for factual investigation and legal analysis? How long3 is discovery going to take?4 There would be numerous questions that would5 arise about how to apply those factors. For example,6 the courts would have to decide: Should they take7 potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or8 should they instead think about whether those obstacles9 could be eliminated? The courts would also have to10 figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial11 date changed between when the motion was filed and when12 the motion was resolved. And how would they take into13 account other periods of time that might exclude14 delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also?15 For example, say a court gets two motions16 filed at the same time. Trial could start in 5 days17 absent the motion. One motion's going to take 3 days to18 resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to19 resolve. What's the court supposed to do? Is one -- is20 the 3-day motion excluded? Is the 4-day motion21 excluded? Are both of the motions excluded? Does it22 depend on the order in which the court decides them? It23 just is not possible for a court to make these24 determinations.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said at the outset8￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that things have been working fine. Of course, the2 whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a3 pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there4 might be a very complex case the judge just really wants5 to put off as long as possible and will continue to6 accept motion after motion. Is there anything I can -­7 I can read or consult to show that this has been working8 very well and that there's not a problem?9 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I can't point to10 anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -­11 that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being12 filed as a -- as an attempt to extend the Speedy Trial13 Act deadline. The court's been -- the -- Congress has14 reviewed the Speedy Trial Act's operation in the past.15 It made changes in 1979 to address problems that have16 occurred. It hasn't felt the need to address this17 problem since, and there's no evidence of any abuse of18 the automatic exclusion on the other side.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, on that issue,20 do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood21 that if the government is found to be attempting to22 frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that23 those motions and their delays won't be counted?24 MR. ROBERTS: Well, first, Your Honor, I25 don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule.9￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425The motion -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It suggests thatqualification?MR. ROBERTS: It suggests that there mightbe that qualification. I think that the statute provides that the -- that any pretrial motion tolls the deadline, regardless of the purpose for which it's filed. But, of course, if -- in the unlikely event that a prosecutor did file a motion solely to extend the deadline and avoid proceeding to trial, that conduct would be sanctionable under -- under the Act, under section 3162(b)(4).JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sanctionable against the government, or -­MR. ROBERTS: The attorney could be sanctioned for that.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does that help a defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated?MR. ROBERTS: Well, the -- the court doesn't need to put off trial just because time is excluded, Your Honor, and the court has other mechanisms that it can use -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my question. The rights that this statute protects are the rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or10Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 extended to these exclusions. If the government2 frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why3 shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and4 have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?5 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the statute provides the6 circumstances in which time is excludable and in which7 time is not, and it doesn't create an exception for8 certain kinds of motions. It applies to any pretrial9 motion. But I have to say, there's been no evidence10 over the 30 years that anything like this is happening,11 and in Hood itself, the motion was filed by defense12 counsel, and the court was simply saying that this is13 not -- that that's not what's going on here, there's no14 suggestion that this motion is part of a process to try15 to frustrate the Act. There's -- the problem just16 hasn't arisen.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I hope you18 won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue19 and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue20 is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of21 discretion. And although you say it's unimportant22 because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal23 conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the24 defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to25 address the question once the case is before us?11￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the Court -- the Court2 does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider3 them of sufficient importance to -- general importance4 to warrant a review. Nobles is one example. There are5 others cited in Stern and Gressman. But the reason that6 this issue is not of any ongoing importance is that the7 rules have been amended. It now expressly applies to8 statutes like this one that don't specify a method for9 counting time.10 And, you know, turning to the merits of the11 issue, also -- one other point on the importance of it.12 The circuits all have adopted the same approach as the13 Court of Appeals here, and -­14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Two? How many15 circuits are we talking about?16 MR. ROBERTS: Two other circuits, but there17 aren't any that have -- that have held to the contrary.18 JUSTICE ALITO: If we were to decide this19 based on subsection (F) involving the counting of 1020 days, wouldn't that render our decision on anything that21 we had to say about subsection (D) dictum?22 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think it would render23 it dictum, Your Honor. The Court can address issues24 in -- in whatever order it chooses to, and it doesn't25 mean that the -- the decisions that you make along the12￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 way aren't precedential and binding if they're part of2 the rationale to get there. But we would -- we don't3 think -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not part of the5 rationale. The rationale for our decision would be6 (h)(1)(D) alone, and all the other discussion would be7 perfectly gratuitous, because we're going to set this8 individual free anyway. To say, well, this other thing9 is not a good reason to set them free, but this one is,10 I mean, that -- the former is just utterly irrelevant to11 our decision.12 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, the13 Respondent offered this argument as a ground not to14 grant certiorari in its -- in his brief in opposition.15 The Court nonetheless took the case. The circuits are16 divided on this -- this issue -­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not disagreeing with18 you. I'm trying to help you.19 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think you could -- I'm20 not sure that I think that it would be impermissible for21 -- for the Court to decide the issues in that order, but22 if you think so and you think that that's a reason -­￼23 JUSTICE SCALIA:24 impermissible, but I'm also25 we say about the ground for13I'm sure it's notsure that if we do it, what which we took the case wouldAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 be -- would 23 so.456 would follow it. But -- but I'm not arguing that you7 should just -­810 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not trying to argue you11 should decide the issue. We don't think you should12 decide the issue.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it because,14 Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing15 problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar16 days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're17 suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that18 question?19 MR. ROBERTS: Exactly. You wouldn't have20 granted cert on the question. It's of no continuing21 importance. It's not going to affect cases going22 forward, and there's no reason for the Court to reach23 out and decide it. In any event, the court of appeals24 correctly decided the question. The -- the statute25 doesn't specify whether the 10 days are calendar days or14be the purest dictum.MR. ROBERTS: I can see how you might thinkCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Courts of appeal -­MR. ROBERTS: I think the courts of appealsJUSTICE SCALIA: It's their fault; they 9 shouldn't follow dictum, you know?￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 business days, and it's therefore reasonable to infer2 that Congress expected that the -- that the courts would3 interpret the provision in accordance with the counting4 rules that are applicable in similar criminal contexts.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It -- it may be6 pertinent on this question: Mr. Tinklenberg was7 designated for transfer to MCC in Chicago on November8 10th. How was that done? Was that done by -- is that a9 court order or is that an administrative -­10 MR. ROBERTS: I believe what happened is the11 court ordered -- the court ordered on the 2nd that there12 should be a competency examination. On the 10th, the -­13 the BOP designated that the MCC would be where14 competency examination -­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the BOP16 not a court?17 MR. ROBERTS: -- would take place.18 Yes. And on then the 10th was, as19 out, was a Thursday before Veterans Day. Then20 Veterans Day, and November 12th and 13th were the21 weekend. So on the next Monday the Marshals Service22 asked the Justice Transportation Service to transport23 the defendant. But the way these things worked is that24 when there are interdistrict transportation, they use25 airlifts that go around the country; and the airlifts go15Alderson Reporting Companythedid it,￼it turns there was1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- there are two flights a day. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:know -­MR. ROBERTS: They makeCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:getting into this. I just wanted to know if it was a court order on the 10th, and what you're telling me is the last court order before he was moved was on the 2nd.MR. ROBERTS: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is it right that the Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said the way the defendant here thinks it should be is that's what it should be?

ROBERTS: Yes, we do. We think thatthey -­Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why shouldn't this defendant whose case was on appeal get theadvantage of that?MR. ROBERTS: Because at the time, thatwasn't -- at the time that -- that the transportation was done then -­JUSTICE BREYER: I know it was under a different rule. But where -- normally with cases where you have a new rule come in, it does apply to the advantage of the people who were then on appeal. Is there something special about this, that Federal rules don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have, and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on appeal, it doesn't apply to him? Is there some law on that?MR. ROBERTS: I think -- I think that -­ that at the time that was the method that -- that dictated the transportation for him, and -­JUSTICE BREYER: I understand. I understand they followed the rule at the time.MR. ROBERTS: -- retroactively -­JUSTICE BREYER: They've changed the rule.17￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425His case is still on appeal. Why shouldn't he get the advantage of the new rule?MR. ROBERTS: Because it's not -- it's not a -- a rule of law that we're talking about. It's the counting of the time, and it's impossible for a court to anticipate -­JUSTICE SCALIA: No. You want to -­JUSTICE BREYER: It wasn't anybody's fault. Why shouldn't we go back and say do it again, and now, let's -- since his case is still on appeal, it's the same question. What's the argument against doing that? Why can't we?I'm sure there's some rule out there that says we can't do this, but I want to know what it is because it seems fair.JUSTICE SCALIA: May I suggest that perhaps the reason not to do it is, assuming this person was treated entirely fairly on the basis of the law that existed at the time, the consequence of what Justice Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly convicted of a crime.MR. ROBERTS: That's right.JUSTICE SCALIA: And to do that simply because, although the -- the process was perfectly fair when it was applied, there's been a change in the rule18Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 and therefore we don't redo it, but we let this person2 go; right?3 MR. ROBERTS: I agree.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And can't be tried again.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Any other reason?6 MR. ROBERTS: I agree completely, Your7 Honor. While, I think -­8 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I'm thinking that9 we normally -- although all this is quite true, what10 Justice Scalia says, normally we do apply new rules to11 those who are on appeal at the time.1213 with that. 14151617 that?1819 don't think20 talking about. This is how the -- this is -- is the21 counting method.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who wants the23 benefit of this new rule? Who wants the new rule? Does24 the government want the new rule or does the defendant25 want the new rule?19JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't agree Do you agree with that?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe -­ MR.

Congress hasn't -­345 correct? 678910 we're going11 Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days?12 I take words in a statute like that at their plain13 meaning. It says 10 days, not 10 business days. So -­14 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, I think that15 there's no plain meaning. "Days" sometimes can mean16 business days; they can sometimes mean calendar days,17 and as I said before -­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But Congress has used 1019 -- has used business days in other provisions, hasn't20 it?21 MR. ROBERTS: I -- I don't know whether it's22 used business days or not. Respondent does point out23 that there are some statutes that contain specific24 exclusions of weekends and holidays, but those statutes25 were -­21MR. ROBERTS: Yes, I like that.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- made an amendment;MR. ROBERTS: I like the way we're going. (Laughter.)JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think you don't. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Will you like the way if I accept your proposition that when￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to -- I2 don't think you should have been so happy with the way3 the argument was going -­4 (Laughter.)5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because -- because6 your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that7 there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was8 business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say9 calendar days, but included statutes for the first time.10 So I think what you're saying is that the11 interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule12 45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now13 calendar days, there is conformity. And plus, "statute"14 is in Rule 45, and that was at least laid on the table15 of Congress, so they know that it was there.16 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. I think that17 -- that the statute always meant the same thing, and18 that it meant that 10 days should be interpreted in19 light of whatever the background rule is at the time for20 counting the time. And so there's no -- there's no new21 rule; at the time the 10 days meant exclude the weekends22 and holidays, and now because the background rule has23 changed, it means count the weekends, and -­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So Congress changed its25 mind between the two rules?22￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review12 changed its3 to-­45 Where? Rule 45 doesn't apply to statutes.6 MR. ROBERTS: Well -­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where in the statute8 does it -- say, apply the criminal rules?9 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that -- that my10 point is that when it doesn't specify whether it's11 business or calendar days, that Congress anticipated the12 courts would say, okay, let's look to the background13 rule; and the place, the sensible place to look to the14 background rule is the rule -- is a rule of criminal15 procedure in analogous contexts.16 In fact, courts frequently do that when17 they're trying to interpret statutes to figure out what18 the 10-day limit is/ as many of the -- many of the cases19 cited in the ALR article that Respondent cites show.20 JUSTICE ALITO: When you're trying -- when21 you're trying to figure out -- when you're dealing with22 procedural rules that involve filing things in court, it23 was once thought to make sense to exclude weekends24 because things couldn't be filed on the weekends, but25 when you're talking about transporting a prisoner. What23MR. ROBERTS: No, I don't think Congress mind. Congress wanted the -- the statuteJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do I know that?￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 sense does it make to exclude the weekend? Does this -­2 MR. ROBERTS: Well -­3 JUSTICE ALITO: Do these flights of4 prisoners from one facility to another come to a stop5 when -- you know, when the whistle blows on Saturday -­6 on Friday afternoon?7 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor, generally the8 flights don't occur on the weekends or holidays. That9 was sort of what I was trying to explain in my extended10 digression to the Chief -- to the Chief Justice before.11 The BOP doesn't admit and discharge12 prisoners on the weekends. In addition, there are13 various other factors that -- that go into the need to14 have two -- two deputy marshals transporting people. So15 the transportation doesn't generally occur on the16 weekends. And it's because of the weekends and holidays17 that the transportation of the defendant actually took18 the amount of time that it -- that it did here.19 But I would say, as I started, in urging you20 not to address this issue, which is of no ongoing21 importance, that the question that we did ask the Court22 to address and that the Court granted review on is a23 very important question that's divided the circuits; and24 that allowing the rule that the court below adopted to25 continue to stand could frustrate the application of the24￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Speedy Trial Act, not only with respect to the pretrial motions exclusion but potentially with respect to all the other automatic exclusions; and I think it's very important that the Court correct this error and reaffirm the established rule.If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Fisher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHERON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Before turning to the substance, I wouldlike to, if I may, start with the procedural question that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure there's no confusion on the posture of this case.In particular, this Court's precedents squarely reject the notion that there's any history in this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an argument in this posture. In particular, in Langness v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a Respondent's, quote, "right" to defend a judgment below on a ground that is properly preserved all along and25Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote,2 "beyond successful challenge."3 Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any4 exception from that rule in the 80 years since.5 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the petition here6 had simply raised one question, and that is the question7 of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule8 45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is9 not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no10 conflict in the circuits. How would you grade the11 chances of the Court taking cert on that?12 MR. FISHER: Well, I'll take your13 hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to14 correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing15 importance. But I'll assume that your hypothetical on16 that kind of a question would be cert denied. But17 that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question.18 Let me give you two things that are very19 important here. The first is the problem with the20 Government's citation to Nobles is not just a21 distinction between discretion and law. If you look at22 the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it23 pointed out that the problem with the alternative24 argument there was that it would give the defendant25 different relief. So it was therefore subject to the26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern2 and Gressman that's cited in their brief. Those are the3 only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles4 and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all5 about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different6 relief. We want exactly the same relief. We want a7 dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act.8 So finally, even if it were somehow9 discretionary and this Court were to consider in this10 case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -­11 let me give you one more example before I turn to the12 discretionary.13 In the Walling case in 1947, this Court14 reached as an alternative ground the defendant's15 argument that there was insufficient evidence. Now,16 that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy17 question, but this Court felt required to reach it18 because the lower court had reached it and rejected it19 and the defendant had preserved it all along in that20 case.21 And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I22 can keep giving you citations. But let me just say,23 even if it were discretionary, you would still want to24 reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the25 Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a27￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 circuit split on this issue. And the new Rule 45 hasn't2 made that go away for two reasons.3 The first is because the Solicitor General's4 own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45. Instead,5 it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts6 10 business days, not simply calendar days. And,7 second, there continue to be decisions after the8 amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said9 that this provision means only 10 business days.10 Let me give you one more citation, and11 forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a12 reply brief in this case on this issue. But the Zabawa13 case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern14 District of Michigan last summer where the Government's15 own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court16 to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant17 only ten business days.18 JUSTICE ALITO: If I could just come back to19 where you started before you go on to these additional20 points. Your argument is that if the Government21 petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on22 which there's a conflict in the circuits and the23 Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to24 have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we25 -- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway,28￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 152 grounds?3 MR. FISHER: You're not duty-bound to decide4 it, Justice Alito. But I do think under this Court's5 precedent, at least, you have never reversed the6 decision below without reaching them. So you may well7 affirm on the question presented or some one or two of8 those questions. You may also dismiss the case as9 improvidently granted, which happens sometimes in these10 circumstances. Of course, what ordinarily what would11 happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this12 Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to13 reaching the question and might well deny cert in the14 first place. But as I said, there's no decision on this15 Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't16 appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a17 conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a18 Respondent in these circumstances.19 Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten20 day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the21 Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions22 issue as well. There's a few important points to make.23 Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically24 abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 4525 automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial29￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Act and now they're making the making the argument that2 what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was3 somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background4 principle. So that the meaning of the Act, I guess,5 would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said. Now,6 there's two versions of this argument. I can't tell7 which it's making. First it could be saying that what8 Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was9 that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's10 what we expect to be applied. Well, that can't possibly11 be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule12 45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded13 weekends and holidays only for periods of less than14 seven days. That wasn't changed until 1985. So the15 Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule16 45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted,17 excluded weekends and holidays here.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't Congress19 think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and20 we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they21 should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule22 45?23 MR. FISHER: I think the much more natural24 reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional25 rule, which is not just cited in Am. Jur., please30￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 understand, this is a cannon of common law, traditional2 construction of time periods that goes back to3 Sutherland's treatise in 1904. There's a Second Circuit4 case called Morasca in 1921, 277 F.2727, I could cite5 you 20 or 30 state cases all up and down the last6 century. So the common law rule has always been for7 periods of less than seven days -- I'm sorry, for8 periods of more than seven days, it's up to the9 legislature to expressly tell the court to exclude10 weekends and holidays. And if you look at the U.S.11 Code, it's perfectly consistent with that common law12 understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in13 the Bail Reform Act, to exclude weekends and holidays14 from a ten day period, it expressly says so. Now, we15 cited three or four examples in our brief. Again, this16 is at page 40, 41 of our brief. I could have cited 1517 or 20. So the U.S. Code is quite clear and I think the18 much more natural inference its that when Congress19 wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with20 the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in21 the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply22 calendar days -- now, if you want confirmation.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the 2009 amendment,24 Rule 45 includes statutes it didn't before and now it25 does?31￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FISHER: It does now, but two things are telling about the 2009 amendments. The first is that when it switched to statutes, it reverted to counting calendar days.2009 -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not relying on theMR. FISHER: No.Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't say -- you say this was wrong when it was decided?MR. FISHER: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Regardless of the 2009? MR. FISHER: That's right, that's right.But if you want to talk about Congressional intent, I don't think we have to even go there. But, remember, after the -- in 2009 there's also a Federal law, the Technical Amendments Statutory Act made a hash of that. But Congress went through, most recently about a year and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this alone. So I think every indicia of evidence you can look at from every possible angle shows that ten days meant ten days at the time of the trial, and that's not to affirm the judgment.The last point I'll make concerning -­32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE ALITO: Congress thought about the2 Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical3 amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts4 had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that5 point?6 MR. FISHER: No, my point, Justice Alito, is7 Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't8 do anything9 1011 it was, but12 the clincher here. Remember, we have not just this13 alternative argument, we have a second alternative14 argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr.15 Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day16 provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform17 Act. Now, I don't think you have to get to that18 argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue,19 but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General20 is arguing with respect to the ten day issue. They're21 saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying22 anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed23 that the time in subsection F would wax and wane24 according to this rule. Well, if that's -- even though25 the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time.33with the Speedy Trial Act.JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't think about -- okay. MR. FISHER: Well, maybe we leave that where let me make one final point that I think is￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any2 basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly3 the same assumption with respect to another Federal4 statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if we don't6 agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we7 would have to reach this third argument, right?8 MR. FISHER: Yes. So I think the only9 way -- somehow, you've accepted the Solicitor General's10 argument, which I don't think you can, but if you did11 accept it on merits, it runs headlong into our third12 argument, which the Solicitor General takes exactly the13 opposite position, which is, the Speedy Trial Act is its14 own self-contained universe that doesn't incorporate any15 other statutes or any other provisions of law.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why aren't they17 trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to18 prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has19 improvidently granted? If we were to write an opinion20 that says that the -- the Sixth Circuit was wrong in its21 interpretation of subsection (f), and therefore, we're22 not going to get to -- and anything we then had to say23 about subsection (d) is just dictum, and that's the24 issue that we took the case to decide, why should we25 keep the case at all?34￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you would be very happy if we didn't.MR. FISHER: I think you could do that, Justice Ginsburg. I think you could decide based on my discussion of the Zabawa case. There's another case that postdates the rule 45 amendments, called Clifton, out of the Southern District of Mississippi. So you might decide that there's enough of an ongoing question here to write an opinion. You could do either one.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you would have to -- we would have to wait for another case to decide this issue, one which is a split, that is, the delay resulting from. What does that mean?JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I can't stand the suspense. I -- I would like to hear about the delay point.MR. FISHER: Right. And I think, Justice Ginsburg, as to your -- your question, I'll just leave it to this Court's best discretion how it wants to handle that issue.Now, Justice Kennedy, let me turn to themerits.We think this is a straightforward case where the text dictates the outcome of the case.Remember, the key words in the statute are "delay35Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 resulting from," and I think the -- I think the ordinary2 meaning, in fact, the only meaning, of "delay" is a3 hindrance to progress or a postponement. So it's -­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to5 interrupt you so early, but what about Justice6 Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's7 always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's8 just that the district judge takes that into account,9 says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual10 pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at11 this point.12 So that is delay, when the trial date might13 otherwise have been set, resulting from these pretrial14 motions, and then the -- the statute goes on to tell you15 how you count that delay.16 MR. FISHER: That's exactly our argument,17 Mr. Chief Justice. Our argument is there's two ways you18 can have delay: One is by the trial date simply being19 moved to accommodate the motion. The other -- and this20 is where we agree with what the Solicitor General said21 here today, as well as at page 38-39 of his opening22 brief -- delay can also, in the ordinary English23 language, mean that the trial date was originally set to24 accommodate the motions in the way you just described.25 But what the Solicitor General is arguing for is36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 something much more dramatic than that. They are2 arguing for an exclusion of the time, even if trial date3 was set irregardless of the motions -­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How would you ever know5 that? How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher? A trial6 judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that7 there's going to be some motions as you get closer to8 trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this9 particular judge took into account the likelihood of10 motions in setting the trial date or didn't?1112 Ginsburg --13 cases. But14 the trial judge would say on the record when the date is15 set. Now, if it's -- if there's motion practice before16 there's any date that's ever set, the NACDL brief, I17 think, explains how that works in the district in the18 Sixth Circuit right now. Parties often stipulate or are19 asked to stipulate by the court. Common sense goes a20 long way in this scenario, Justice Ginsburg. It's21 obvious.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why would the23 defendant stipulate?24 MR. FISHER: Pardon me?25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would -- why would a37MR. FISHER: Well, ordinarily, Justice remember, this is only a small subset of in those cases, ordinarily, I would think￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 defendant who would benefit from the clock running2 stipulate?3 MR. FISHER: Defendants don't always benefit4 from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg. I think5 there's two reasons why they might stipulate. One is6 because it might simply be obvious that the motion is of7 sufficient weight and difficulty that it's going to8 consume the court's resources, so why argue something9 that wouldn't have a basis to begin with?10 But I think the NACDL brief is forthright in11 saying, at least at the beginning of criminal cases,12 often defendants find themselves wanting more time, and13 so, again, they don't have the incentive to argue14 against that.15 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you reconcile your16 argument with the situation in which the motion is17 pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the18 filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of19 that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -­20 this is going to force me, this is going to result in 1021 days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so22 the trial date is pushed back 10 days? Now, in that23 situation, how much time is excluded?24 MR. FISHER: I think the -- the text of the25 statute allows you to say either 30 or 10. I think in38￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 light of this Court's Henderson decision -- and perhaps2 I think Congress had administrability concerns in mind3 with that last clause -- I think 30 days could be4 excluded. But if you disagree with me on that and you5 want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute6 resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your7 only other option.8 Because, if I could ask the Court, or at9 least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor10 General's reply brief, this is where they give -­11 because I think what the government wants to do is pose12 these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult13 question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this14 Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw15 the words "delay resulting from" out of the statute.16 Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal17 with what the Solicitor General offers.18 First, they say that delay means time, and I19 think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, "delay"20 means something more than time. It means postponement.21 So then the fallback argument -- this is the second22 paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is23 postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial,24 and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question.25 That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that you're2 ask whether34 that what the statute says? Meaning, if you look at5 (h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, "Thelooking to subsection (d) to apply it is to you should exclude the time.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, but isn't6 following periods of delay shall be excluded in7 computing the time within which the trial of any such8 offense must commence."9 It's not talking about the delay of the10 trial. It's talking about the computation of the start11 date for the trial. So if that's what that commands you12 to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's13 position consistent with that? It's telling you to take14 the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must15 start by excluding those. That's the language.16 MR. FISHER: I think for two reasons, I17 would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor. First18 is, I take that language to say that we're going to now19 tell you all the circumstances under which you exclude20 time, and so if any of these subsections are satisfied,￼21 you exclude 222324 is that you25 from" meansthe time. But the -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the -­MR. FISHER: -- Solicitor General's argument start from the premise. "Delay resulting you've already excluded the time. That's40Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the premise.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's what3 (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the4 trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these5 periods of delay. It's defining it for you.6 MR. FISHER: Well, if -- if there was delay.7 Maybe another example, Justice Sotomayor. In8 subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's9 appendix, I think is another way of showing that it10 can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the11 question, it can't possibly be right. It has to be12 talking about the trial itself, because this is the13 continuance -- the end of the justice continuance14 section. And it says, "Any period of delay resulting15 from a continuance granted by a judge on his own16 motion," and blah, blah, blah, "if certain criteria are17 met."18 Now, it's very clear that in that section,19 "period" -- "period of delay resulting from" can't mean20 that we've already said that the clock is stopped,21 because there's an "if" clause that gives you certain22 things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it.23 So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're24 talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea25 of the words "delay resulting from" can only sensibly41￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 mean delay resulting from trial.2 And so I think the definition that we've3 given you again, which is, delay results from a trial if4 the trial itself is postponed, or if the trial is set in5 a way that accommodates the motion, is the only way to6 give meaning to the operative words in the statute.78 substantial9 your motionJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it doesn't matter how and important a motion is, whether it wasto dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or10 the administrative motions here that you say really11 didn't require time? It doesn't matter; all that12 matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement13 of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the14 trial date, that it does it at the end of all the15 motions. That's the only time the court can do it.16 MR. FISHER: The distinction between17 administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think,18 doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't -­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why wouldn't it matter?20 MR. FISHER: Well, it would matter, I think,21 Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial22 date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an23 argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this24 dialogue already to some degree. I didn't -- I expected25 these kinds of motions to be filed. I knew there was42￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 going to be a suppression hearing. We had the whole -­2 therefore, I set the trial out. That would seem to be3 saying this was a nonadministrative matter that I had to4 accommodate. I don't think a trial judge -- put another5 way, I don't think a trial judge could say I'm setting6 trial date outside the 70-day deadline because I had to7 sign my name to that pro haec vice motion.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, actually it9 happens all the time. In the "rocket docket" in10 Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file11 whatever motions you're going to file. Under your12 theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial13 date, none of those motions exclude time.14 MR. FISHER: That may well be correct, but I15 don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't16 matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin17 with.So-­18 JUSTICE BREYER: It matters because the19 trial judges have to know what to do, and while your20 reading might fit the language in ordinary English21 better, I think it does.22 It's also possible to read those words23 "delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period24 of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time25 are excluded from accounting. Now, the virtue of that43￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the2 trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get3 mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for,4 in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it,5 do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying6 to figure out what causes what.7 MR. FISHER: Let me say a couple things,8 Justice Breyer. First, with all due respect, I have to9 disagree with your premise that it's possible to read10 the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read11 it. Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your12 question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it13 that way. I think our rule is not as difficult to14 administer as you think it might be in the -- NACDL15 brief LDY. And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has16 been the -- this has been the law in -- in the Sixth17 Circuit for 17 months. They haven't pointed to a single18 dismissal as a result of it.19 Now let me take the other side, and this20 brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument;21 the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either,22 unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act.23 You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says24 every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances,25 tolls the clock.44￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 But that's not the law in the First Circuit,2 for example. They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor3 said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy4 trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and5 that makes perfect sense. I mean, look at this case.6 And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or7 bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case8 illustrate the problem.9 On August 1st, trial date was set for August10 14th. There were 14 days before the trial was going to11 happen. Yet there were only -- even under the best12 reading there were only 10 days left on the clock. So13 if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would14 have a Speedy Trial Act violation. So the government's15 whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this16 purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the17 courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial18 conference the judge had already told the government was19 going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't20 have been made at the moment the evidence was21 introduced; and one other administration motion, then22 the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated.￼2324 phrase from25 relation toAnd to borrow the Solicitor General's own page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no the Act's purpose. So what you have to do45Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 to have, I think, the government's argument be at all2 faithful, even if it were possible under the language -­3 have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act,4 is to have some kind of exception for motions that5 frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are6 purely administrative, however it would be defined.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you think that -­8 MR. FISHER: And you walk in -­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your motion -- I mean,10 the government had administrative motions, but you had a11 Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count,12 either?13 MR. FISHER: I -- well, two things, Justice14 Ginsburg. First of all, we're not relying in this Court15 on the Speedy Trial Act motion to get us to the Speedy16 Trial Act violation. The two motions the government17 filed get you to the 70 days, and so we haven't made an18 argument with respect to the Speedy Trial Act. But if19 we had to, the argument would be -- with regard to that20 motion, would be that it didn't delay trial. Trial had21 already been set, the Court said this is when we're22 going to trial; trial wasn't moved, and we all went to23 trial. And so -­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't believe25 I had a trial in my district court days where between46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the time I had the pretrial conference and the time2 trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because3 that's about the time counsel tends to wake up.4567 that really 8910 whether it's an administrative motion or simply to11 clarify the functioning of the trial? Why should we not12 exclude those times, because those -- those motions,13 whether they're administrative or not, will cause the14 trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise15 consume the time of the court during trial are being16 resolved before trial.17 MR. FISHER: I think that might be an18 argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different19 way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether20 the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that21 the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and22 answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going23 across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of24 time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply25 doesn't delay trial.47MR. FISHER: Yes.(Laughter.)JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay? And -- and decide now they've got to get ready.MR. FISHER: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should we care￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 At page, I believe it's 5 or 6 of the NACDL2 brief, they talk about pretrial conferences. And they3 say what happens in the Sixth Circuit right now is the4 judge holds the conference; as you say, counsel wakes5 up; and everybody -- and the judge says tell me the6 motions you're going to file. And the counsel from both7 sides tell the judge what motions are going to be filed,8 and they discuss right then and there whether they're9 going to delay -- whether they're going to cause some10 delay for trial. And so -­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher -- delay, you12 make an argument about the meaning of delay. I am13 troubled by the meaning of the "from the filing of the14 motion" of that clause. You read that, I think, to mean15 delay resulting from any pretrial moment and not to16 exceed -- right -- the peered of the filing of the17 filing of the motion to the conclusion of the hearing.18 Right? Isn't that right?19 MR. FISHER: I think that's right, and I20 think that's -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, where do you -- where22 to you get that "not to exceed"? It doesn't say not to23 exceed; it says delay resulting from the filing of the24 motion.25￼MR. FISHER: I think the difficulty is with48Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 the word "from," Justice Scalia. I think it's a tough2 word to know exactly what transition is taking place3 there, but in this Court's Bloate decision, last term, I4 think -- what I'm -- the argument I'm making is5 perfectly consistent with that decision, where it said6 the "from clause" is sort of the boundaries on when7 subsection D applies. If you're talking about delay8 that a motion caused either after the hearing or before9 the filing, we don't want to hear from you. But the10 from clause tells you if the delay falls within those11 two goalposts, then it's excludable.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a funny way to say it.13 It's a funny way to say it.14 MR. FISHER: I don't think it's a perfect15 way to say it, either, Justice Scalia. And I said -- in16 my dialogue with Justice Alito, I think that you could17 also say, especially with a little bit of pushing on18 Henderson, that "resulting from" actually gives you a19 specific time period in between those that you have to20 exclude. But I think that that's the best reading of21 the Act, and again, it's the only one that gives -- that22 gives meaning to the phrase delay resulting from.23 If I might just say one or two words to24 circle back to where I began, Mr. Tinklenberg urges you25 to affirm the Sixth Circuit decision or to dismiss this49￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case as improvidently granted; but what he urges you not to do and thinks there's no basis in precedent for doing, which is to reverse the lower court without reading the alternative arguments; and with all due respect, the 10-day argument that we preserved in our bio and we fully made in our bottom side brief in this case, I think is extraordinarily strong, and it's difficult to get around in this case for all the reasons I've explained.So with that, I'll -- I'll answer any other questions this Court has about that argument, because I think it's very important. Otherwise, I'm happy to submit the case.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Roberts, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTSON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor. First I would like to stress that thegovernment thinks that it's very important that the Court address the question that we raised in our cert petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and which we believe that if it's left standing will result in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act.50Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Turning to -- to that question, a few points2 first. Respondent's definition of delay is plainly3 inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the4 period of delay that's excludable is the time between5 the filing of the motion and the disposition of the6 motion. That can't be squared with the notion that7 delay is the period during which trial is postponed.89 gives delay10 statute and11 held that it has the meaning that we suggest.12 Third, Respondent's test is totally13 unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion14 is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and15 whether trial is going to be postponed. District Court16 judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an17 average District Court judge. A hundred of them are18 criminal. The court -- the Speedy Trial Act cannot19 function if the judges are going to have to make a20 complex judicial determination in each case to determine21 whether each motion is excludable.22 Respondent says that NACDL says defendants23 won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion24 of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change25 their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change51Second, Respondent's definition of delaya different meaning in the first part of the in subsection D, where this Court's already￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy2 Trial Act, their prior failures to object and3 stipulations may very well not be binding because this4 Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively5 waive the application of the Act. And Respondent's6 tests would also throw the established way that the7 Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years8 into disarray.9 Turning to whether this Court has to address10 the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly11 says that the Court has discretion not to address those12 issues if those issues are not independently worthy of13 certiorari. It doesn't base that on the fact that14 the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the15 judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary16 makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the17 court to address numerous issues that are not important18 and -- in every case where they're raised, and would19 also lead the court to either dismiss writs as20 improvidently granted or to address only as dicta21 important issues on which the Court has granted22 certiorari.23 Finally -­24 JUSTICE ALITO: So given the choice between25 a dismissal and an affirmance with good dictum about52￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 subsection (d), you would prefer the latter?2 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, I think that we would3 like the Court to address the issue on which cert was4 granted. We think it's a very important issue. We5 think that the courts of appeals would follow it even if6 it might technically be viewed as dicta. We would think7 that it would be an alternative holding or ratio8 decidendi.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.10 The case is submitted.11 (Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the case in the12 above-entitled matter was submitted.)1314151617181920212223242553￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial -
