OLSONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:When libraries block Internet pornography fromtheir computer terminals, they are simply declining to put onto their computer screens the same content they have traditionally excluded from their bookshelves. By offering Internet access without pornography, freedom of speech is expanded, not abridged. Under the Children's Internet Protection Act, or CIPA, no Internet speech is prohibited, inhibited, threatened, or chilled. Libraries are simply exercising their discretion as to the content that their libraries will contain, the historic discretion to exercise that -- that authority, and to how their library resources will be used.QUESTION: Mr. Olson, you have a number of important legal concepts to address. I have three factual questions. I've been through the extensive opinion of the3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425district court, and -- and they may be important for me. Three different things.When the library patron requests that the filter be disabled, does he have to explain why he wants it disabled?asked --MR. OLSON: No. Shall I wait until you'veQUESTION: Go ahead.MR. OLSON: It's my understanding that the -- the library patron would not have to explain any reason why he was asking a site to be unblocked or the filtering to be disabled.QUESTION: That's the next question. Do you ask site by site or can I -- can the library patron say, unblock the whole thing?MR. OLSON: The library patron, if the patron is an adult, can ask the -- the entire filtering to be disabled, and the library may disable -- I mean, eliminate the filtering with respect to specific sites either on their own or at the request of a patron.QUESTION: All right.And third, the district court said in some cases it takes 24 hours to a week. Is that the usual thing or does -- in many cases can the librarian just push a button?4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. OLSON: I think that it is -- it is -- the2 record is not clear on that, and I -- but my -- my3 experience and my judgment in connection with our4 preparation is that it need not be a very difficult thing.5 It's something that libraries can do without a great deal6 of difficulty. But to the extent that it took any time at7 all, it would be the same as asking for a book that is not8 on the shelf or asking for an inter-library loan, the kind9 of customary things that library patrons do when they ask10 for a book or a resource in a library.11 QUESTION: Is -- is there anything in the12 statute that would prohibit a library from doing the13 following? Any adult who wants to watch the thing without14 the screen, come up and ask, do you want to do it, and you15 -- we can tell you, don't watch these obscene child16 pornography, et cetera. Then we disconnect it. Does the17 statute prohibit the library from doing that?18 MR. OLSON: If I understand your question19 correctly, I -- I know of nothing in the statute that20 would prohibit the library from doing that, provided that21 the -- the person asks and the patron asking is an adult.22 The First Amendment does not require libraries23 to sponsor the viewing of pornography. When Government24 gives financial aid to speech on Government premises, it25 may make rational choices as to what not to finance.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Those -- that -- that doctrine is consistent with this2 Court's previous decisions. In connection with this3 particular content, Congress and this Court have found4 that Government has -- the Government has a compelling5 interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,6 child pornography, and in the case of minors, material7 that is harmful to children. Such material has been8 traditionally excluded from public libraries, and9 Government has a basic, fundamental right in addition not10 to associate with or finance pornography.11 QUESTION: Isn't part of the problem that a lot12 more is being excluded? I mean, as I understand it, the13 statute requires that a -- a filter of some sort be used.14 Filters are not sold -- the blocking devices are not sold15 or prepared apparently in terms of the concepts that the16 statute uses. The companies that do prepare them will not17 even disclose what in fact they are blocking so that it18 seems that an inevitable price of this is blocking more19 than -- than the statute requires, and that's even without20 getting into the question of blocking material for adults21 as -- as opposed -- that -- that might be unsuitable for22 children, but certainly aren't for adults.23 How do you -- how do you get over the problem of24 the -- sort of the -- the imprecision, the crudity, the25 overkill of the blocking devices?6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. OLSON: Justice Souter, that is -- that is2 true that any system is going to involve some over-3 blocking and under-blocking because it's impossible to4 know what is going to be coming over the Internet or5 impossible to make systems that are perfect. But that's6 consistent with what -- the historical decisions that7 libraries have made.8 QUESTION: But there's one thing that is clearly9 inconsistent I think, and that is when the libraries make10 -- historically have made these decisions, they've known11 what they weren't buying or weren't stocking on their12 shelves, and here they don't --13 MR. OLSON: Well --14 QUESTION: -- because they -- the blocking15 makers regard that as proprietary information.16 MR. OLSON: It's -- there's several answers to17 that it seems to me. In the first place, libraries have18 known that they have not stocked pornography, and it's not19 because of space, popularity, or expense. They have20 chosen traditionally not to stock that type of material.21 Every time a library decides not to subscribe to a22 magazine, it is over-blocking in a sense. A magazine may23 have three pornographic pictures in it or sexually24 explicit pictures in --25 QUESTION: But it -- but it does know what the7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 magazine is, and here it does not know what the website2 is.3 MR. OLSON: It knows what the magazine has been.4 It may not know what the magazine is in the future.5 Furthermore, librarians don't read every book.6 QUESTION: No, but it -- you know, it knows it's7 Playboy or whatever the magazine is, and here it doesn't8 know what the website is that's being excluded.9 MR. OLSON: Yes, but it can -- it can test this10 -- what we're saying here with respect to that is over-11 blocking or under-blocking is a necessary part of the12 library function of making appropriateness judgments with13 respect to content generally. That's the type of14 distinction --15 QUESTION: Well, I -- I have a problem with --16 with that. It -- it seems to me a large part of your17 argument is you want us to think of this just in the same18 context of the librarian going through a list of books and19 deciding what books to buy. But the Internet isn't like20 that. What is it? There's a -- 1.5 million new entries21 into the system every day? This is a whole new medium.22 It's not like a library.23 MR. OLSON: Yes. And, Justice Kennedy, it seems24 to -- it seems to the Government and it seemed -- it25 seemed to Congress that gross judgments are going to have8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 to be made. These libraries, as the record reflects and2 the findings of the district court reveal, traditionally3 or -- or customarily block e-mail, chat, gambling, gaming,4 dating services, and some of them, as reflected -- I think5 it's on page 37, 38 of the appendix to the jurisdictional6 statement -- make -- make judgments with respect to what's7 appropriate, what's offensive. Those types of judgments8 are being made.9 Yes, this is a new medium and it's --10 QUESTION: Well, but General Olson, there are11 supposed to be 90,000 books a year published in the United12 States. Do you think librarians know the contents or even13 know of the existence of all of those 90,000 books?14 MR. OLSON: No, that -- Mr. Chief Justice,15 that's our point. This is a difference in quantity, but16 it is not a difference generically from what libraries17 traditionally have done.18 QUESTION: But when the library makes a book19 decision, doesn't it make a decision that says, we will20 not put God's Little Acre on our shelves? It's a yes or21 no decision with respect to the book. It's quite true22 there are lots of books out there that the library not --23 may not know about, but when it makes a decision not to24 put it on the shelf, it knows what it's deciding not to25 do, and here it doesn't.9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. OLSON: Well, in a specific situation, a2 library might know that. A library might decide that it3 would just stock history books or just stock -- stock4 novels of a particular period. There's nothing to suggest5 that libraries don't have the right to make those6 decisions and customarily make those decisions.7 QUESTION: Sure, but somebody along the line8 knows what they've decided to buy within the category and9 what they haven't decided to buy.10 MR. OLSON: Well, that's right, but the11 traditional decisions that libraries have made -- and the12 appellees do not dispute this -- is that libraries have13 not chosen to stock the types of material on their shelves14 that they're now being asked to keep out with respect to15 the Internet. This is a similar decision with a different16 medium.17 QUESTION: No, but that's -- that's true. But I18 think the thing that -- one of the things that's troubling19 us is they're -- they're -- they are -- they are forced,20 by virtue of that decision, not to stock a lot of other21 material, and they don't even know what it is and there's22 no way for them to find out.23 MR. OLSON: But, Justice Souter, they -- they24 may on their own -- there's a -- there's -- one of the25 materials that's in the record is someone that made a10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 study of several hundred thousand sites and decided which2 ones were properly blocked or improperly blocked. Those3 types of studies may be used to unblock sites, to modify4 the filtering system. Libraries could get together and5 create their own filtering system rather than the ones6 that are --7 QUESTION: Could the library in -- General8 Olson, in view of what you answered earlier, you said any9 patron could say, I want to unblock everything. Could the10 library say, well, we want our staff to have access to11 everything? Therefore, we are going to unblock everything12 for the computers that we use internally. I thought the13 answer to that question was no, but it seems inconsistent14 with the answer that you gave. A patron says, I want to15 see everything. Fine.16 MR. OLSON: Well, I -- I believe that the answer17 is that, A, the librarian can, in response to a request18 from a patron, unblock the filtering mechanism altogether.19 And secondly, I think it's not entirely -- it's not20 statute doesn't get into it, but it -- but it seems21 entirely consistent with what I've just said, and I22 consistent with the import of your question is that23 library staff can disable the filter in order to make24 judgments about whether something has been, quote,25 properly or improperly blocked.11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼-- thethink the1 QUESTION: Because one of the things that was2 criticized about this statute was that every terminal,3 even the ones in the librarian's own office, closed4 office, has to have this filtering. But your answer is,5 no, they don't. You -- you make it sound like it's really6 the library's option. If they want to put everything on,7 they can.8 MR. OLSON: I -- I was answering your question9 with respect to what the staff may review in making the10 administrative decisions with respect to unblocking or11 other decisions with respect to the implementation of the12 statute. The statute speaks in terms of having in place13 this technological mechanism by which this material can be14 filtered out or is designed and calculated to do that. It15 doesn't -- the statute does not require perfection. It16 doesn't require librarians to act in --17 QUESTION: General Olson, if I understand the18 situation correctly, the libraries are wasting a lot of19 money litigating. They could simply hire somebody to come20 into the library everyday and say, please unblock21 everything, and then they could do it.22 MR. OLSON: With respect to that patron. I23 mean, the -- the -- if my answer suggested that the24 library could just switch off the filter on a daily basis,25 I didn't mean to say anything remotely like that.12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Oh, okay.MR. OLSON: It -- this -- particular patrons may say, I'm investigating breast cancer. This -- the sites -- some of the sites that I'm looking for I can't find, and they appear to be on block. Can those sites -- or I've heard about these sites -- be unblocked?QUESTION: But do they have to --QUESTION: Or -- or he can say, according to you, what do you care what I'm investigating? I just want the site unblocked. Isn't that right?MR. OLSON: That's -- that's correct. Yes, that's correct.QUESTION: I wonder how -- how effective that -- that system is in -- in achieving some of the goals of the statute which -- which is not just that -- that some people using the -- the Net happen to stumble across pornographic stuff but also, passing by, see it, and -- and including children.MR. OLSON: That -- that may happen, Justice Scalia. The system is not perfect. It is not going to be perfect. But what it does, it's a reasonable, rational articulation by Congress of an attempt to decide --QUESTION: Why couldn't the -- why couldn't the children be protected by having two screens? One screen for the kids; the other for the adults. One is blocked;13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the other 23 practical4 might require a great deal more resources from librarians.5 It might require establishing different screens and7 have done8 judgment,9this differently, but this is a rational consistent with --QUESTION: May I go back to Justice Ginsburg'sisn't.MR. OLSON: Well, I think that is -- again, is a judgment that may work in some libraries. It6 mechanisms. Yes, there are ways in which Congress could10 question with respect to the library staff on the11 unblocking? I -- I think her original question was, could12 the library say, we want our staff to have free access on13 the computers that they use, not that we want them to be14 able to look behind the block to see what's being kept15 out. We just want them to have a free computer. Is -- is16 that a violation of the statute? I had thought it was --17 MR. OLSON: I think that the -- my answer to18 your question, if I understand it correctly, is that the19 computers in the library, if the library uses the -- the20 Federal funds with either respect to the discounts or the21 subsidies, direct subsidies, all the computers in that22 library must be equipped with the technology protection23 measure with respect to each of those computers.24 QUESTION: And that would include the staff25 computers.14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. OLSON: Yes. But that does not preclude the staff from determining, in connection with specific requests --QUESTION: Yes, but that's not the question. The question is can the library say, this is ridiculous blocking this stuff for our staff. We're not going to block them. The staff computers are either going to have no blocks or every morning we will press the button that unblocks the staff computers.MR. OLSON: Well --QUESTION: That would violate the statute, wouldn't it?MR. OLSON: Well, one could -- you're in an area, it seems to me, that -- where there might be an as- applied challenge. We're talking about a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute.QUESTION: And we want to know the extent of the statutory prohibition.MR. OLSON: I -- I understand that. I -- and the -- your -- the import of your question suggests that in this situation a librarian might exercise this discretion with respect to a filter. I don't think in the first place --QUESTION: All I want to know is whether they can do it without violating the statute.15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. OLSON: My answer to your question is that to the extent that librarians are disabling the filter for the performance of their administrative function --QUESTION: That's not my question. The library simply says, we want our staff to have free computers.MR. OLSON: I don't think so, Justice Souter. QUESTION: That would violate it.MR. OLSON: That's right. But remember, this isin the context of -- of material that's been traditionally excluded by libraries, that libraries are free to put on their shelves in the form of books anytime they want.It -- the -- the position of the district court and the position of the appellees is that the libraries, by doing this, violate the First Amendment right of their patrons. I don't think that would be an issue in that context, and we're suggesting that the patrons have a right to Internet access anywhere they want outside the federally subsidized library.And the library has several choices it may make here. The library might not have Internet. Maybe it's not appropriate for that particular library. The library may have Internet with the filtering and accept Federal money with respect to putting in the computers. Or the library --QUESTION: Could the library do this? Could the16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 library say, okay, we're -- we're certainly going to2 comply with the statute for the library, but we are going3 to -- we are going to establish -- or the city says, we4 will establish a separate office? It's called the -- the5 computer viewing office. It has a separate budget from6 the library. It's in a separate building. It has a7 separate staff. Administratively it's different. And8 with respect to the computers in -- in that establishment,9 we're not going to ask for any Federal subsidies and the10 computers are going to be wide open. Any reason they11 couldn't do it?12 MR. OLSON: I -- I think they could. They could13 either have a separate branch where separate Federal funds14 are not being obtained, or you're talking about a separate15 administrative ability --16 QUESTION: Yes.17 MR. OLSON: -- facility. I don't -- I don't18 believe that the statute would prohibit that set of19 operations.20 QUESTION: Yes, but it would apply if they had,21 say, ten computers and nine of them were financed by the22 Federal subsidy and one of them was independently23 financed. That one would be covered by the statute.24 MR. OLSON: Yes, it would, Justice Stevens,25 although --17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And if you rely on the -- on the2 Spending Clause to justify this restriction, how do you --3 how does that justification apply to that tenth computer?4 MR. OLSON: Because it's a reasonable condition5 to the operation of the funds. In the first place,6 Justice Stevens, in -- the Internet is going to come7 through one opening, and the -- the various different8 computers will be plugged up to that one opening so that9 the -- the technological answer in part to your question10 is it's -- the -- the library would have to decide --11 QUESTION: Well, you -- you could have it on a12 separate phone line, it seems to me.MR. OLSON: Yes, the library could do that sort but it would --QUESTION: The statute would still apply.MR. OLSON: Yes, it would. Yes, it would. QUESTION: And how do you justify that under the1314 of thing, 15161718 Spending Clause?19 MR. OLSON: We believe that it's a reasonable20 condition that Congress reasonably -- the patrons may not21 be able to distinguish where the --22 QUESTION: Well, wouldn't it be equally23 unreasonable if we said it applies to separate facilities24 too? I don't know why -- I don't understand the25 distinction between a branch library that has one computer￼18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 in it and a big central library with 10 computers, one of2 which is separately financed.3 MR. OLSON: Well, again, as we said in our4 briefs, that to the extent that that is an issue, it5 should be made -- that point should be made in a -- in an6 as-applied challenge to the statute, as opposed to a7 challenge on the face. We don't think it's8 technologically going to be a problem and we do think that9 Congress can reasonably have assumed we're using Federal10 money to finance Internet in this library. Patrons are11 going to be exposed. If you're going to take the money,12 we would like patrons not to be exposed in this manner to13 that material, and the Congress could well have decided14 that it -- the taxpayers don't want to be associated with15 a subsidy of that types of material -- that type of16 material which has traditionally been excluded from the17 libraries in any event.18 QUESTION: Well, you're saying not only that19 they -- that they don't want to be associated with the20 subsidizing of it, but they -- you're saying they don't21 want to subsidize an operation which includes some non-22 subsidized material of this sort. Don't you have to say23 that in --24 MR. OLSON: I -- well, I think that that would25 be a reasonable choice for Congress to make.19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: You say they've made it.MR. OLSON: Well, with respect to all of the computers in the library in -- in that narrow context, yes, but I do think that that's the -- we're getting down to the refinements of particular applications and those types of challenges have not yet been made.QUESTION: General Olson, the words of the statute itself, though -- there is some ambiguity. It's -- with regard to disabling the filter, the words are for bona fide research or other lawful use. And am I right in thinking that your prior answer meant other lawful use means anything? So, in effect, for an adult anything but obscenity would be a lawful use.MR. OLSON: I believe that that's -- that's -- well, child pornography would also be excluded. Both obscenity and child pornography --QUESTION: Yes.MR. OLSON: -- there are Federal criminal statutes with respect to both of those. And -- and again, this is a reasonable effort by the library -- by the Congress to make rational decisions with respect to allowing for some escape for people who are doing research or for other appropriate purposes.QUESTION: Yes, but -- but how would that authorize the unblocking entirely which would let in not20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425just the material that's useful for research, but also obscenity, also child pornography? How is that allowing a -- a lawful use? That's allowing an unlawful use, isn't it?MR. OLSON: Well, I -- I agree with that, but --QUESTION: So if you agree with it, it means that -- that --MR. OLSON: If -- if -- excuse me, JusticeScalia.QUESTION: No. I think if you agree with it, it -- it means that you can't unblock a whole channel. You can say, I'll let you have this material, but I can't unblock this channel.MR. OLSON: The -- the --QUESTION: God knows what else there is outthere.MR. OLSON: The statute put it in terms of bona fide research or other lawful purposes. That -- there's bound to be some interpretive -- given the joints there. And again, to the extent that that would trigger a funding decision with respect to the enforcement authority or something, that's appropriately raised in an as-applied challenge.I think it's important to stress the converse of what the appellees are asking for here. They're asking21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 this Court to make a judgment that the First Amendment2 prohibits them from exercising the discretion to make that3 kind of choice with respect to the Internet that they've4 always made or traditionally made with respect to the5 books on their shelf.6 The consequence of that, it seems to me, would7 be strict scrutiny applicable to librarians' judgments8 with respect to not just the Internet, but microfilm,9 television, other medium that might -- other media that10 might come into the library, and that librarians, instead11 of spending money on books, are going to be spending money12 on lawyers defending cases brought by authors saying, you13 -- you violated my First Amendment right not to have14 strict scrutiny, and that instead of librarians making15 these --16 QUESTION: But, General Olson, Justice White17 wrote a number of opinions in the First Amendment area18 where he started out saying, this is a case about19 billboards, or this is a case about something else. I20 would think this is a case about the Internet. It's not a21 case about books.22 MR. OLSON: Well, it might be if the decision23 was written that way, Justice Stevens, but if -- if the24 appellees are right, the types of decisions that25 librarians have been making, appropriateness is -- is the22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 word, quality, appropriateness, and appropriate decisions2 -- it's -- it's in the record. Those types of decisions3 the librarians are saying -- asking this Court to say are4 subject to strict scrutiny and violate the Constitution.5 This Court would have to make a First Amendment6 distinction between the selection of a book and the7 selection of another source of information.8 QUESTION: But isn't there a practical9 distinction that's got to be taken into consideration in10 your argument? And that is, not every library can have11 every book. Something has got to be excluded. So we12 start with the assumption that the librarians have got to13 make these judgments. We don't start with that assumption14 in the case of the Internet at all.15 And the question in the case of the Internet is16 the different one. Can you require them to exclude17 certain materials that it would be illegal for them to18 have as -- as an abstract matter? Sure, I suppose.19 But the -- the tough question is, can you20 require them necessarily to exclude a great deal more21 about which they make no decision whatsoever and which22 would be perfectly legal for them to have?￼2324 Souter -- 25MR.

OLSON: If it wants to.14 But the case comes to this Court in the posture15 that the district court has held and the appellees are16 arguing that for the library voluntarily to make that17 choice on their own, irrespective of any Federal18 Government subsidy or anything, would violate the First19 Amendment rights of their patrons.20 QUESTION: General Olson, what does the record21 disclose is the percentage of lawful material that is22 excluded under these software programs as opposed to23 material that is unlawful for the library to --24 MR. OLSON: Well, the -- the testimony was25 varied, Justice O'Connor. One of the -- one of the￼24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425findings of the district court was that tens of thousands of pages of material may be erroneously blocked. Now, the problem with that is that different filters might block different things. Sites may be unblocked. The filter may be set aside. But even if it's tens of thousands of the -- of the 2 billion pages of material that is on the Internet, we're talking about one two-hundredths of 1 percent, even if it's 100,000, of materials would be blocked.If it -- if it please the Court, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.QUESTION: Very well, General Olson. Mr. Smith, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The Children's Internet Protection Act is unconstitutional for two separate reasons.First, the act does require libraries accepting Federal funds to engage in conduct that is itself at least presumptively unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny does apply, we say, because the --QUESTION: What -- what cases are you relying on to say that the libraries would be required to engage in25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- in conduct that is presumptively unconstitutional?2 MR. SMITH: This Court's whole series of cases3 involving the public forum doctrine, Your Honor, which I4 noticed was -- was not really mentioned by my colleague,5 Mr. Olson.6 The Internet, when it comes into the library, is7 -- all of the information available on the Internet, as8 diverse as human thought -- immediately available to the9 patron. It is the most pure form of public forum that you10 can possibly imagine.11 QUESTION: Yes, but it begs the question. The12 -- the point is that the Government is saying, if you want13 to get our money, you don't let it all come in. So it is14 not -- it is not a public forum once -- once the -- once15 the blocking is applied.16 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the whole question17 about whether the library could do it this way depends on18 how you view the public forum doctrine. And the -- what19 the Court has said again and again is in deciding whether20 something is or is not a public forum, you look at whether21 the access is selective or general. That -- that's what22 the terminology was in the Court's case --23 QUESTION: You're not relying, at any rate, on24 cases dealing with libraries as such.25 MR. SMITH: No. No, Your Honor.26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: You're relying on a more general --MR. SMITH: Applying the Court's general holdings in -- in a whole series of cases to try to decide whether this is a public forum, a designated public forum, created --QUESTION: You conclude that -- you conclude that a library is a designated public forum.MR. SMITH: The Internet terminals in the library are a designated public forum, Your Honor.QUESTION: Not the whole library?MR. SMITH: Certainly not. We do not say that strict scrutiny applies to the decisions that the library makes about which book to buy because when the library buys books, it chooses books one by one. It engages in selective access as opposed to general access.With the Internet, on the other hand, the entire world of -- of content that is on the Internet is there available to the patrons. It has not been selected --QUESTION: Not --MR. SMITH: -- by the library in any way. QUESTION: Not necessarily. I mean, a librarysays -- and some have -- some did this before -- before the Federal statute was in effect. A library says, there's this whole wide world of the Internet out there, but we don't want all of it. Some of it is garbage, and27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 therefore we're going to block the obscenity. We're going2 to block the child pornography, and we're going to block3 the -- the pornography that's harmful to children. Now,4 once they've made that decision, hey, presto, it is not a5 public forum anymore.6 MR. SMITH: That -- that -- with respect,7 Justice Scalia, the way the public forum doctrine works in8 our judgment -- and we're basing this as -- as close as we9 can on this Court's cases -- is that the one thing that10 Government can't do is allow all content under the sun,11 not even knowing what content is there, and then exclude,12 cull out one area of disfavored content. If -- if you say13 that that exclusion, that -- that pointing at that one14 particular area of content and excluding it, is the same15 as not making it a public forum, then -- then the public16 forum doctrine no longer has any meaning.17 QUESTION: Is it also a public forum if it's a18 public school library?19 MR. SMITH: The -- the case of a public school20 library is a -- is a more difficult case.21 QUESTION: I just want a yes or no answer. On22 your theory is it or is it not a public forum if it's in a23 public school library?24 MR. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, I can't give25 you a yes or no answer.28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, I need a yes or no. You either do think it is or you don't think it is.MR. SMITH: I would policies are of the school --QUESTION: No, no. same. I just want to know onhave to know how theExactly everything is theyour theory of the public forum doctrine is the 10th grade library or in anelementary school or a high school -- they have -- they do exactly what the libraries do here. Is it a public forum?MR. SMITH: Then I -- then I do say it's a public forum, Your Honor. If they allow students --case --QUESTION: All right. So on your theory of theMR. SMITH: Yes.QUESTION: -- then if it is a public forum, the elementary school, Addison Hill Elementary School, has to let the worst possible pornography go over the computers￼that comeinto the public school library.MR. SMITH: Certainly not, Your Honor. QUESTION: Because?MR. SMITH: Certainly not.QUESTION: That's what I want my answer to -- MR. SMITH: First of all, all that holding thatit's a public forum does is -- is give you the level of scrutiny that applies to the rule. Then you have to look29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 at the rule, apply the usual standards of narrow2 tailoring, less restrictive alternatives, compelling3 interests --4 QUESTION: No. We make all those same arguments5 that you've just made and say, look, there would be all6 these other alternatives and all -- all the -- I'm -- I'm7 just -- I'm not putting a -- I'm putting a difficult --8 what to me is -- is a difficult problem with your9 doctrine. And I -- I want to see how it works here.10 MR. SMITH: But I think the Constitution11 analysis may well come out differently with respect to12 young children, Your Honor.13 QUESTION: Well, but I -- I need to know fairly14 specifically because I don't want if there -- if -- to me15 frankly if -- if your theory of it means that every public16 school has to have a computer attachment which bring this17 material into the school, I suppose a lot of schools18 wouldn't have computers at all in their libraries. And --19 and that is worrying me. So I'd appreciate --20 MR. SMITH: Well --21 QUESTION: -- a fairly definite answer on this.22 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I think that -- that,23 first of all, classrooms are different from libraries even24 in the school context because a school classroom --25 library -- a computer is obviously not used for30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 independent research. If the -- in the library situation2 in the school, you would have different age groups. You'd3 have different considerations. You'd have different4 policies. There's a lot of different things that could be5 distinguished from this case.6 And I think it -- it's important --7 QUESTION: So your answer is that in your8 opinion now you think it probably would be constitutional9 as applied to school libraries but not as to public10 libraries?11 MR. SMITH: It -- it may well be, Your Honor,12 depending on the age group, depending on the13 circumstances, depending on the way the -- the library is14 used by the students.15 QUESTION: Mr. Smith, why shouldn't we be16 conscious of the holding of this Court in Denver Area v.17 the FCC where the Court concluded it might be premature to18 apply forum analysis due to changes taking place in the19 law, the technology, and the industrial structure related20 to telecommunications? I mean, this too seems to me an21 area for caution, is it not, in importing wholesale public22 forum analysis in the library?23 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --24 QUESTION: I would think Denver Area would have25 some bearing on that.31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. SMITH: Denver Area has a substantial2 bearing and I think it's one of the strongest cases3 supporting our position. It is true that the Court did4 not go -- it -- the -- the plurality opinion in -- in the5 case did not go so far as to say we're going to apply a6 public forum analysis and strict scrutiny, but -- but7 Justice Breyer's opinion went much -- very close to that8 and said we're going to apply very heightened scrutiny.9 We're going to look very carefully at this.10 And this was a law that is in many ways closely11 analogous to what's going on here. It was a law that12 said, we have a public access station. Anybody from the13 outside world can come in and put whatever programming14 they want on that station, but we're going to exclude15 indecency, just that one area of content, because we don't16 think that belongs in the home.17 QUESTION: But the -- the other part -- assuming18 it's some kind of stricter than just reasonable, however19 that is brought about, the -- I'm very much concerned also20 about something Justice Kennedy raised. If all that this21 statute means is that a person who wants access to the22 10,000 deep -- whatever it's called -- what's the -- some23 special word. It's -- it's deeply like Star Wars almost.24 It's some kind of like an extra galaxy that's very hard to25 get to.32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 All right. These 10,000 pages which now were2 blocked -- what he has to do -- that person -- is he goes3 to the desk and says, please unblock it. I want to use --4 I want to do research and this is blocking things that I5 want. I'm not going to look at material that is6 absolutely unlawful, such as this very obscene material,7 child pornography. And then the library is free -- will8 say, fine.9 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --10 QUESTION: Now, if all that's necessary, you11 have to go to the desk, what is the great burden on12 speech? After all, I grew up in a world where they used13 to keep certain materials in a special place in the14 library and you had to go and ask for them. So?15 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the way the16 disabling provision is set up, first of all, is it's17 designed to give the library some job to determine whether18 your purpose is bona fide or not. It says bona fide19 research or other lawful purpose. So the first problem is20 you go to the librarian's supervisor who has the authority21 under the statute to turn off the filter and you have to22 explain to them what your purpose is to look at the --23 QUESTION: General Olson said no, you don't have24 to explain.25 MR. SMITH: Well, the -- the statute on the face33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 of it says the library is required to inquire into your2 purpose and make a decision about whether it is a bona3 fide research purpose or other lawful purpose for looking4 at the material which has been filtered out by the -- by5 the filter.6 So you have a discretion problem of severe7 proportions, I submit. Plus, you have a stigma problem,8 very much like the one --9 QUESTION: But not if you read other lawful10 purpose to mean everything except the specific categories,11 child pornography, obscenity.12 MR. SMITH: They will presumably have to have13 some information about what sites you're interested in14 looking at in order to determine whether that would be15 lawful or not. So they will then have to inquire into,16 well, what's -- what is it you need to get that's being17 blocked? Why are you looking at it? Is it lawful?18 QUESTION: It doesn't say that in the statute.19 All it says in the statute is that the administrator may20 disable a technology protection to enable access for a21 lawful purpose. So why couldn't you just sign a piece of22 paper saying I do not want to use this for an unlawful23 purpose? Period. End of the matter. What in the statute24 prevents the library from accepting that?25 MR. SMITH: Well, clearly the library is34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 responsible for determining whether or not you fall within2 the exception. Even if -- even if they're empowered under3 the statute -- and I think this is unclear -- just to4 accept your representation without any further5 explanation, you still have the problem that you're going6 up to the -- to the librarian and saying please turn off7 the smut filter. I need to get access to some material.8 So that -- that you're being required to do that. There's9 a stigma problem very much like --10 QUESTION: Is there any other problem?11 MR. SMITH: There's a third problem, which is12 you have -- a lot of times this will only come up in the13 middle of your research session. You won't know that14 you're going to be blocked getting access to the15 Republican National Committee site or to the site for some16 orphanage that is trying to raise money. There's -- since17 the -- many of the blocks are so irrational, you can't18 anticipate it. So you'll have to stop your session and go19 talk to a librarian about getting this thing turned off or20 getting this site unblocked. Somebody will then have to21 look at the site --22 QUESTION: But in a library, when you're looking23 for a book, it might not be there, and you might have to24 go to the librarian and order it or borrow it from another25 institution. I don't think that's atypical of what35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 happens in research.2 MR. SMITH: But certainly, Your Honor. But --3 but our submission is that you shouldn't just willy-nilly4 compare the Internet in the public library to books and5 how they're handled by libraries because the Internet is a6 public forum. It is all of this content that has not been7 prescreened or preselected by the Government which they8 are making available to you --9 QUESTION: But in this context, perhaps we10 should not import public forum analysis. It creates lots11 of problems --12 MR. SMITH: Well, perhaps --13 QUESTION: -- for instance, in public schools,14 as has already been discussed. So it's -- and there is no15 case from this Court saying that having an Internet in a16 library creates a public forum. That's what we're here to17 decide I think.18 MR. SMITH: Indeed, Your Honor. And -- and the19 Court has repeatedly cautioned that when you're making a20 decision about whether something is a public forum, you21 have to look at the particular medium of communication22 that is at issue, not the broader context.23 So, for example, when the Court in Cornelius was24 looking at the Combined Federal Campaign and trying to25 decide whether that was a public forum, the Government36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 said, well, it's the Federal work force. The Federal work2 force is not a public forum. But the Court said, no, we3 have to look and see what kinds of people have been given4 access to the Combined Federal Campaign and allowed to5 solicit funding from the Federal -- the Federal workers6 and has it been done on a selective basis or a general7 basis. Because it was selective, the Court ultimately8 determined that it's not a public forum.9 It may well be that --10 QUESTION: Well, if you say that the world we11 look at is the people using these programs under the12 Federal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a13 public forum.14 MR.15 Government to16 under the sun17 that they don't like, then I submit that -- that will be18 the end of the public forum doctrine because there will19 never be any situation in which the Government will be20 constrained in any way to censor out a particular piece of21 content that it -- from the public forum.22 QUESTION: Designated public forum doctrine.23 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.24 QUESTION: Traditional public forums will always25 be public forums.37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005SMITH: Well, Your Honor, if you allow the define its forum as all content under sun -- ever invented by mankind except the piece￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SMITH: Right, but I'm -- we're here in the context of designated public forums. And if you allow content --QUESTION: I've always had trouble with that doctrine anyway.MR. SMITH: If -- if you allow the content -- (Laughter.)MR. SMITH: -- to be defined as everything but,that's okay. Then there -- there is no doctrine. QUESTION: So -- so a -- a library that choosesnot to get the Internet at all is not a public forum. It's only when it gets Internet terminals that it becomes a public forum?MR. SMITH: Well, and it -- and then it has to make another decision. Is it going to just turn the Internet on or is it going to do what it could do, which is to say we are going to treat websites like we treat books. We're going to look at them one by one and decide whether they should be available, whether they meet our collection development policies.QUESTION: But I thought -- you said there are two reasons why you should prevail, and we're still on the first.MR. SMITH: I appreciate that, Your Honor. (Laughter.)38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But -- but you -- you said at the -- at the outset that it would be -- as I understood it, that it would be unconstitutional for you to do this on your own initiative. And now you're saying that you could?MR. SMITH: No, no, no. It would be -- it would trigger strict scrutiny for a library to do exactly what the statute requires. That's our submission, which is to say if they allow the whole Internet in except this one piece of content under the public forum doctrine -- or perhaps the Court wants to apply the kind of public forum doctrine light of the whole question of whether --QUESTION: I just want to be -- I just want to be clear. Suppose this is a general public library.MR. SMITH: Yes, sir.QUESTION: Could it voluntarily do exactly what the statute tells it it must do?MR. SMITH: Our position is that that would trigger strict scrutiny that they would then have to satisfy and --QUESTION: Well, and how would the strict scrutiny come out?MR. SMITH: Excuse me? Well, in -- in most, if not all, cases it would come out against it. It would be unconstitutional, clearly, because they're blocking a vast amount of speech that is not even sexually explicit. And39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425so we have a narrow tailoring problem. And there are much more -- much more effective, less restrictive alternatives which we had all this evidence at trial about.QUESTION: And that -- and that is -- and that is because legally you would be a state entity denyingaccess to member ofa designated forum to a -- a listener who is a the public.MR. SMITH: Exactly, Your Honor.QUESTION: Okay.QUESTION: What was your --QUESTION: What if the -- what if the facts were changed in this way? The library -- I'm sorry. Did I -- no. Please go ahead.first --the --QUESTION: No. I think we're still pursuing theMR. SMITH: Yes. I'm trying to make sure I get￼QUESTION: Sooner or later, I want you to get to the second --MR. SMITH: I appreciate it, Your Honor. (Laughter.)QUESTION: Okay. One last question before youget to the second one.What if the library said, we're not letting inthe whole Internet? We think there are some sites that it40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would be valuable for our research patrons to have. We're going to -- we're simply going to select 100 websites or 1,000 out of the millions that are there and we're going to let them in. Would that be a violation of designated public forum?MR. SMITH: Clearly not, Your Honor. QUESTION: Okay.MR. SMITH: There's no -- there's no argumentthat we -- we'd make that that would be unconstitutional. They would then be letting them in as they would books, using their collection development policies, deciding what's valuable, and that would not be a violation.QUESTION: But -- but how did -- I mean, it's fine to say it's no violation of the Constitution. But you're also saying yet it remains a designated public forum.MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.QUESTION: Oh, it -- you agree it would not be a designated public forum.MR. SMITH: Absolutely not. If they're not letting everybody in, as -- as general access. They're exercising selective access.QUESTION: But don't -- don't many libraries already exclude, for example, chat rooms?MR. SMITH: It's not a question of exclusion.41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425It's a question of affirmative inclusion through selection --QUESTION: No, no. I mean, but -- but my understanding was that some libraries that -- that have access to the Web do not allow access to chat rooms. They don't think that that's a proper library -- library function or whatever. At least as to those libraries, I assume you would acknowledge that there's no designated public forum.MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. We don't acknowledge that excluding --QUESTION: I didn't think you would.MR. SMITH: -- excluding an area of content can take it out of the forum doctrine.Let me get to my second point, though, which --which is --QUESTION: When you start on your second point,let me just ask you to comment on one thing because I want to be -- I want the Solicitor General also to comment on the same thing. Do you think, given the state of the record now, if we agreed with the Government's submission that the district court's rationale was wrong, would it be proper for us to decide to rule on the second theory?MR. SMITH: Oh, clearly, Your Honor. I don't think there are any -- any facts that it would be42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 necessary for the Court that haven't been brought out in2 that -- that trial and that lengthy opinion.34 is--56789 preciselyNow, our position with respect to point twoQUESTION: What is point two?MR. SMITH: It is that libraries --(Laughter.)MR. SMITH: -- even -- even if the Internet is analogous to books in the library context, that about the library context lets librarians in the10 something11 exercise of professional judgment that they ordinarily12 exercise, even in deciding to edit the Internet, that the13 Federal Government under the First Amendment has no14 business using the spending power to try to distort that15 medium and push librarians away from their professional16 judgment toward the most restrictive possible policy on17 information flow into the library setting.18 In other words, our second point is that a19 library is very much like a public university which this20 Court has several times indicated is a -- is a special21 sphere set off for the governmental promotion of private22 and free expression, that in that kind of a setting, the23 Federal Government should not use the spending power to24 impose a one-size-fits-all policy about --25 QUESTION: Is this a federalism concept and you￼43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- and you would cite our cases like Printz and so forth? MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. I'm citing onlyFirst Amendment cases. I believe it is a First Amendment concept that there are certain kinds of relationships or certain kinds of institutions in which the amount of speech that is being allowed is decided by the people who are designated as professionals to run that institution. For example --QUESTION: So -- so your argument would be the same if the -- if the State of California were doing it. It's not just the Federal Government.MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.If it was done by statute. But -- but, for example, professors should set the curriculum at a public university. I don't think that the Congress can say to the universities of this country, we've given you money, you therefore have to cut your departments. If you -- if you take the money --QUESTION: How about -- can the board of regents set the curriculum?MR. SMITH: I think it -- when you get to the people who run the -- run the university as their job, that's fine, yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: I mean, that's pretty far-reaching. It's very interesting. But the -- the question -- I'm --44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 I don't suppose you object to the Federal Government2 saying, even if it's money to be spent on books, you3 cannot spend this money for material that it is unlawful4 for the student to see, such as child pornography. Are5 you objecting to that? Suppose the Federal Government6 were to say, no child pornography.7 MR. SMITH: Certainly not, Your Honor.8 QUESTION: Certainly not, okay. So then what9 you're objecting to is we let them cut that stuff out, but10 you're objecting to the requirement of a particular11 technology where the technology may exclude some other12 things.13 MR. SMITH: Well --14 QUESTION: That's your objection.15 MR. SMITH: -- first of all, let me address the16 book question. What this law is analogous to is, as17 applied to the book context, a law where the Government18 says we're going to help you buy books. Here's 10 percent19 of your book budget a year, and it doesn't just say you20 can't spend our money on books of a particular content.21 It says you can't have in your library books of a22 particular content. It starts to try to invade the23 professional judgments of librarians about what books24 would need to be to their patrons.25 And we have here a situation where 93 percent of45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the libraries have made a more liberal, more open policy2 decision than the one that the Congress favors, and3 they're now using the spending power to push them in --4 QUESTION: Well, what if -- what if the Federal5 Government said, we're going to give you 10 percent of6 your annual appropriation and you can't use that money to7 acquire a particular class of books?8 MR. SMITH: I think as long as it was viewpoint9 neutral, Your Honor, and otherwise a legitimate line, that10 would be not a problem. But -- but here --11 QUESTION: Well, supposing you -- you can't use12 it to acquire soft pornography.13 MR. SMITH: To the extent one could define that14 concept, I think that generally the Government -- the15 Court has said the Government can decide what -- what the16 money that it uses to subsidize the -- the local17 government with -- what it will be spent on, but it can't,18 I think, then expand the subsidy into attempting to19 regulate things like the other book decisions that the20 library might make.21 QUESTION: Well, even in areas where it's22 already against the law to have materials that are obscene23 or harmful to minors? You think the Government has no24 authority to prohibit its aid to be used for that?25 MR. SMITH: Of course not, Your Honor.46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Certainly the Government can say that you shouldn't make2 available materials to people that -- that -- for whom3 they have no constitutional right to see them, obscenity4 for adults --5 QUESTION: Right. Now, should we make any6 allowance here? Is there any leeway, if you will, simply7 because the technology is not yet available to filter8 perfectly where it's evident that there isn't a huge9 percentage amount of things that are being excluded, but10 the software isn't perfect?MR. SMITH: Well --QUESTION: Should -- should our doctrine take account, do you suppose?MR. SMITH: If -- if I might, just in answer to111213 that into 1415 that question, Your Honor, take a moment to describe what16 -- what it really is that the record shows about how these17 filters operate because I -- I think that that's really18 very helpful.19 What these -- these filters are, are lists of --20 of sites that are banned for access in the -- in the21 setting where they're -- where they're in effect, and the22 -- the findings are that there's about 100,000 sexually23 explicit sites on the Internet at the time of trial. And24 so we can assume that some high percentage of that 100,00025 are on the list, 90,000 perhaps, because there were some￼47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 that they missed constantly.2 Now, in addition, the court found that the --3 the very same list blocks at least tens of thousands of4 additional sites that are not sexually explicit at all or,5 if they have sexually explicit materials, are educational.6 They -- they teach people about gay sexuality or they7 teach them about safe sex techniques. And so we have --8 on these lists is a proportion, a huge proportion, perhaps9 25, perhaps 50 percent of the sites that are blocked that10 are not illegal even for children.11 Now, of the 90,000 or so that are blocked that12 are sexually explicit, there isn't a shred of evidence in13 this trial record that the Government attempted to put in14 about whether any of those are obscene. There was no15 showing of any kind that the filters ever actually find16 speech that is illegal for adults. And there's good17 reason to think that there isn't a lot of it on there18 because clearly illegal material is distributed in a19 different way than the -- than the way that would allow20 the filtering --21 QUESTION: Mr. Smith, you used -- you said22 perhaps 50 percent. This -- and General Olson said tens23 of thousands of pages, but consider the --24 MR. SMITH: Well --25 QUESTION: -- in relation to the Internet.48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 In this record, at least in this opinion, this2 was the finding made more often than any other by that3 three-judge court, but every time they used the word4 substantial -- and they don't give us any 50 percent.5 Substantial over-blocking is the word that's come up over6 and over again. I think you must have said it in at least7 a dozen findings.8 MR. SMITH: If I could -- if I could address9 that, Your Honor. The -- the court did say at least tens10 of thousands and they used the word pages at that point.11 But it's quite evident, if you look at the way they were12 reasoning from the evidence, that they meant sites. And13 the evidence is that there's about 11 million websites on14 the Internet, in -- in the accessible part of the Internet15 and that 100,000 of those are the sexually explicit ones16 and that the -- there are at least tens of thousands more17 that are on the list.18 So it's -- the Government also says in their19 brief that about one percent of the Internet is over-20 blocked, which would be about 100,000 sites.21 So it is a substantial percentage. It is also a22 substantial amount. And most importantly, it's a very23 large percentage of what they're blocking is not what they24 intend to block.25 QUESTION: Mr. Smith --49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Oh, you mean the Government --QUESTION: -- can I ask you a question about -- about the public forum doctrine? As I understood your earlier answer, the Internet is not a public forum if a library does not take all of it and chooses to exclude chat boxes.MR. SMITH: No, that is not my answer. QUESTION: Oh, that isn't your answer.MR. SMITH: No. Our answer is --QUESTION: It -- it remains a designated publicforum even if you don't take all of it, you say. Chat rooms. We don't want them.MR. SMITH: The way for it not to be a public forum is for them to decide affirmatively what they do want to include, not simply to say we'll take the -- the content of 400 million people contributing to the Internet, but we'll carve out one thing. If you allow that, then there is no designated public forum doctrine, and the Court has repeatedly said the distinction between a public forum and not is whether or not there's been selective access, which -- by which it means case by case --QUESTION: Why isn't that selective access? I -- we don't want chat rooms. And it's not a total free- for-all, anybody wants to come in and talk. No, we don't50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 want chat rooms.2 MR. SMITH: Maybe chat rooms are okay because3 the question is whether that's a content-based exclusion.4 But clearly, here you have a content-based exclusion.5 QUESTION: It isn't content-based. No. Okay.6 It's not a content-based --7 MR. SMITH: And it --8 QUESTION: Now, so if they say no chat rooms, it9 doesn't become a designated public forum.10 Why does it remain a designated public forum if11 what they say is, in addition to chat rooms, we don't want12 that portion of the Internet that runs a risk of bringing13 into our computers obscenity, child pornography, material14 harmful to children? We don't -- I don't really know what15 it is but it's not worth it to us. So we don't want chat16 rooms and we don't want this -- you say it's over-17 inclusive. It's not over-inclusive. It's whatever it18 takes to keep out of what we're bringing into our library19 those harmful materials. Now, why does that mean I've￼20 created a 2122 not think23 factor into the analysis, Your Honor. The way the -- the24 public forum doctrine works is you look at whether or not25 they -- they have allowed access generally or not, and if51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005public forum?MR. SMITH: The fact that they may -- may or may they have a good reason for doing it can't1 they have allowed access generally and then they say, but2 we don't want this, then that's a violation or at least it3 triggers strict scrutiny.4 QUESTION: And that would also be a violation if5 the Government paid for 100 percent of the cost of the6 computer, both the hardware and the monthly billing for7 the Internet.8 MR. SMITH: Yes, because it lets in everything9 in the world. Every commercial site, every catalog,10 everybody's personal website, and a11 can't even conjure up are all being12 provided to people in that setting.13 saying, except you can't have this.14 Now, if that's permitted under the forum15 doctrine, how can Southeastern Promotions be right where16 they said you can have any -- any play except Hair? We17 don't like Hair.18 QUESTION: Well, you can have it. You just have19 togouptothedeskandaskforit.20 MR. SMITH: And you have to deal with exactly21 the -- the discretion of -- of the librarian and about22 whether or not he or she is going to allow you -- allow23 it. You have to deal with the stigma, and you have to24 take the time out from your research session to go do that25 if it turns out in the middle of your research session52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005million other things I allowed in andAnd then they're￼1 that -- that some site that you need to go to. And you2 have to decide to do it not seeing the site because you3 can't see it to know whether it's valuable to you. So4 when you're surfing the Internet, the vastly more likely5 outcome will be that anything that's blocked people will6 just bypass and go on to something else.7 QUESTION: What would your response be if -- if8 you start where Mr. Olson started and said, you don't have9 to go through all of this? All you have to do is walk up10 to the librarian and say, I'm an adult. I want it11 unblocked. And it will be unblocked. Where -- where does12 that leave your position?13 MR. SMITH: Well, it's not clear that the14 librarian would say yes. The librarian certainly doesn't15 have to say yes.16 QUESTION: I -- I think Mr. Olson's suggestion17 was that the librarian, absent some extraneous reason,yes. So -- so let's add that to the mix. The says yes, unblock. What is -- where's yourMR. SMITH: It seems he's on a horn -- the horns22 of a dilemma. Either that is something that has got a lot23 of stigma to it that very few people are going to do, so24 it has the -- the effect of suppressing speech, or25 everybody --53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼18 would say19 librarian20 position?211 QUESTION: Is that your position --2 MR. SMITH: That is my position.3 QUESTION: -- that even to do that would be4 stigma?5 MR. SMITH: Yes.6 QUESTION: So that doesn't solve the problem.7 MR. SMITH: Sure. You've got to go up and say8 please turn off the porn filter, Your Honor.9 QUESTION: That isn't what he says.10 MR. SMITH: Well, that's what it is.11 QUESTION: He says, look, you block a lot of12 stuff. Just please unblock it.13 MR. SMITH: Well, if it turns out that people14 wouldn't be stigmatized by that -- and I think the court15 below was correct to conclude that they will be -- then --16 then there's the second problem, which is what -- what is17 the purpose that you've accomplished by requiring people18 to go through this meaningless exercise other than to19 deter them. That is apparently then the only purpose of20 it and --21 QUESTION: Well, it distinguishes an adult from22 a child.23 MR. SMITH: You can do that in many different24 ways, Your Honor, that don't require anybody to approach25 anybody. You simply have a -- a card that they put in the54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 computer that shows their age, and then it gives them2 whatever access the library decides is appropriate or3 whatever the parents may have decided is appropriate for4 the children. There are many less restrictive5 alternatives including use of the filtering technology as6 an option, at the parents' option for different ages that7 -- that can be considered and which were explored in depth8 by the district court, which I must say looked at this9 issue very carefully, was very sympathetic to the problems10 that arise with the -- with the sexually explicit content.11 It said the one thing we can't do is have one12 across-the-board answer even in one library, especially13 nationally, to have Congress which has no knowledge at all14 about what conditions may prevail in any given library,15 saying, well, we're going to push you, through the16 budgetary process, toward our position even though 9317 percent of the librarians have found a much more suitable18 set of solutions in less restrictive, somewhat more19 subtle, more mixed policies than the one that Congress20 decided in its wisdom it should try to force on the21 library community using the spending power.22 QUESTION: Mr. Smith, this -- this law covers23 elementary and secondary schools as well, but this24 challenge relates only to libraries.25 MR. SMITH: Only to public libraries, Your55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Honor. 234QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Smith.General Olson, you have 5 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. OLSON: I would like to invite the Court's to page 37a of the appendix to the5 67 attention8 jurisdictional statement which is the decision of the9 court below. In the first full paragraph, the court found10 approximately 95 percent of libraries with public Internet11 access have some form of acceptable use policy or Internet12 use policy governing patrons' use of the Internet.13 Now, what the libraries are saying here is the14 exercise of certain discretion violates the First15 Amendment rights of their patrons, and therefore every16 time they exercise that type of discretion in this17 context, they're subject to strict scrutiny.18 What this statute does is gives the libraries19 the right, if they choose to accept Federal funds, to make20 what kind of decisions, to exclude pornography which21 there's no dispute in the record libraries have, from time22 immemorial, chosen not to put in their libraries. So the23 decision that they're making is the same one they have24 already voluntarily made over the years.25 It would inhibit their decisions to exclude56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 e-mail, chat, gambling, dating services, and the other2 things that this part of the court below's decision held3 that they are doing already. It's the traditional type of4 discretion that libraries have exercised with respect to5 whether they be -- want to be a fiction library or a6 library that's specializing in this or that or technology7 or anything along those lines. So the type of discretion8 that the librarians are saying violate their First9 Amendment rights are the types of discretion precisely10 that they've been exercising for years.11 QUESTION: General Olson, I hate to use part of12 your rebuttal time. But would you tell me whether the13 Government thinks we should address the unconstitutional14 conditions issue that's discussed at length in the15 footnote if we agree with you on your principal16 submission?17 MR. OLSON: I -- we have no problem if the Court18 decides it, although it wasn't briefed and it wasn't the19 decision below, but we don't think it's remotely possible20 for this Court to decide that question in this context21 against the Government. If -- if the libraries are right,22 they're saying they don't have a First -- they can't have23 it both ways. They don't have a First Amendment right to24 make this discretion -- discretionary decision with25 respect to their -- the -- the materials in their library,57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 and then they turn around and say, allowing us to make2 that is an unconstitutional -- or giving us an incentive3 to make that very decision is an unconstitutional4 condition.5 This is a condition that's connected with6 libraries' traditional decisions. It's in an area where7 the Government -- the Congress of the United States and8 this Court has said the Government has a compelling9 governmental interest already. It's a condition to the10 use of the funds. This is not extracting from libraries11 some separate, unconnected decision. It's connected with12 the actual use of the funds.13 And it does not say that libraries may not stock14 pornography. If they want to abandon the years of15 tradition of not stocking pornography on their bookshelves16 or in some other form, movies, whatever it might be, they17 can still do that without violating this condition.18 So the libraries have plenty of choices. They19 can not accept the public money. They can accept the20 public money and use it in -- in the way that Congress21 decided, which is consistent with their traditional22 exercise of discretion.23 There's many distinguishing factors between this24 case and the cases in -- in which the Court has exercised25 -- expressed some concern with respect to the First58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Amendment issues here. It is not -- this case is not a2 regulation of speech, but the actions of a Government3 acting in a proprietary capacity -- a library to make its4 own decisions, deciding what to subsidize, what speech to5 have in that library, what speech not to have in that6 library.7 The Government is merely -- is making a content8 decision, not a viewpoint decision. There's no contention9 that there's a viewpoint decision. The type of decision10 that they say is being forced upon them, which is actually11 voluntary, is the same type of decision that libraries --12 librarians customarily make.13 The Federal statute and the library policy that14 they're complaining about expands information, it doesn't15 contract information. And this Court said in the Arkansas16 Educational Television case, a jurisprudence that would￼17 result in18 expansion19 Amendment20the constriction of speech, rather than the of speech, would be a repression of First rights.If Congress can't put this condition -- QUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.MR. OLSON: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted.
