MILLER             ON BEHALF OF THE CHEROKEE NATION      AND SHOSHONE-PAIUTE TRIBESMR. MILLER:  Justice Stevens, and may it please101112131415161718   us how these two cases relate?  The Court of Appeals for19   the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth20   Circuit went another.  And are the claims at all21 overlapping? How are they differentiated?22 MR. MILLER: No, Justice O'Connor. They're -- 23 they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal24 Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal25 years 1994, 1995, and 1996. And the Cherokee contract at4Alderson Reporting Companythe Court:          These two contract cases concern whether theGovernment is liable in money damages under the Contract Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self- Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a contract price for the --1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Would you mind explaining to￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit isfiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement.The section -- remedial section of the act, section 110 --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But they're certainly at oddson the legal theory.MR. MILLER: Yes, they are, Your Honor. The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress.10111213141516   And to the contrary.  We submit that the Secretary's17 construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo18 section 106(b) of the act --And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented.19             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Are the circumstances any20 different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case21   and the one in the Federal Circuit?  Are -- are the22 circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any23 respect that could account for a difference in outcome?24 MR. MILLER: No, Justice O'Connor. There --25   there is no difference in that respect, and there is an5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 overlap in -- in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract2 that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve 3   fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee4 contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense, 5   both cases involved the -- the same relevant issues. 6             The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of7 the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to 8   our opening blue brief.  The act was amended in this9 section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to10   secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal11 bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding12   discretion over contract funding issues.13             In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of14 the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount15 of funds provided under the terms of self-determination16 contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall17 not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have18   otherwise provided.19             And then directly pertinent to this case is20 subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses21   contract support costs.  There shall be added to the22 amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs23 which shall consist of certain items. Incidentally, these24 items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs,25 procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or2 personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by3   the Office of Personnel Management.45   contracts678   they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it9   was going to cost.JUSTICE SOUTER: Does the -- do the actual reduce the -- the CSC's to a dollar amount MR. MILLER: Yes, they do.JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so we know -- they --10             MR. MILLER:  That is correct, Justice Souter.11 In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the12 parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they13 entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated14   contract amount.15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't want to get ahead of16   you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the17   question if -- if you choose.  But it seems to me relevant18 to (a). Does -- is -- is part of the submission that the19 Government used some of the funds that otherwise would20 have gone to you for its own monitoring and -- of -- of21 health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or22 was it just general overhead for other programs it used?23             MR. MILLER:  It -- it is precisely, Justice24 Kennedy, what -- what you stated. In fact, we can turn 25 directly to page 14a --7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005or --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I stated an or. I -- what I -- I stated at the outset?MR. MILLER: The -- the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of -- including contract monitoring --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Including contract monitoring.MR. MILLER: Including contract monitoring. Including contract monitoring. In fact, they say so in their brief and -- and defend that action.1011121314   course, aren't they?  I mean, are there any other15 contracts that the Government has to enter into? I mean,16 the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to17   take over, in effect, implementation of the -- of a          The -- the sections on page 12a and 13aarticulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of thecontract support costs that must be added.JUSTICE SCALIA:  These are strange contracts, of18   Federal health program, doesn't he?19 2021 that this22 facie, be23 as other contracts --24 MR. MILLER: Because --25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- where -- where an agency,8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. MILLER:  That is correct, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I -- why would you expectstrange kind of contract should -- should, primagoverned by the same rules as to appropriations￼1 having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will 2   limit the number of contracts it enters into?  But -- but3 here you're creating a situation where the agency has to4 contract and yet has no control over having enough money5 to -- to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me 6   a -- a strange way to run a railroad. 7             MR. MILLER:  It -- it is a unique contractual8 situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully 9   anticipated.  And -- and I would explain it this way.10             First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act11 which Congress said applies to these contracts. The12 contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior13 Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby14 case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced15 under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason16 Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In17 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced18 at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims,19   then the Court of Claims, and the district courts20 concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under21   the Contract Disputes Act.22   explains that Congress did23   Busby decision and to make24   the stated contract price.25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But further to Justice9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005 And the legislative historythis precisely to overcome thethese contracts enforceable for￼1 Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves2   contain clauses that say this is not a procurement3 contract? 45 6 7 8 9MR. MILLER: The -- the procurement contract -- that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor. The -- the act says that --19202122232425eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Miller, do --          MR. MILLER:  Justice Ginsburg.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- on -- on theinterpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean10Alderson Reporting Company          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, the act says that they'renot procurement contracts.These contracts began as procurement contracts. They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of -- the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision.Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy whichMR. MILLER: -- the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct.101112131415161718   it wanted to eliminate.  And for that reason, it1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or 2   generally to reserve some portion of this for what you 3   call Federal functions, that it -- every penny of the 4   appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and 5   nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal6 functions? 7             MR. MILLER:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would put 8   my answer in this context.  There are many sources from 9   which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these10   contracts.  It could have been, yes, as we submit, from11   the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial12   administration.  It could have been from the up to $8813   million increases Congress was making every year.  It14   could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover15   appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could16   have been from the regional and headquarters offices that17   the agencies had where they don't administer services.18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your -- your answer is,19 yes, if it came to that, they --20             MR. MILLER:  That's the duty Congress imposed21   upon the Secretary.  The Secretary was free not to22   reprogram.  That's -- that's a choice the Secretary had23   and the Secretary made it.  The question is what are the24 ramifications of that choice and we submit --25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, let me ask you another11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   question related.  Suppose -- this is an individual2 action. These are individual actions. They're not class3 actions. 4             MR. MILLER:  Correct, Your Honor. 5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do the ones who come to court 6   to sue get paid in full even though there may be many7 other self-determination contracts out there, and that if 8   you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be 9   paid in full?  Does it just depend on first come to court,10 first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?11 MR. MILLER: Your Honor, we -- we do not believe12   that that -- that should be the outcome.  That would13 advantage the contractors that came forward and not take14 account of the entire situation. We think the global15 situation has to be looked at. The total amount of the 16 contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994 --JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you can't get blood out1718   of a turnip.  I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the19202122232425question, what if there is not enough money to go around? MR. MILLER: If there were only sufficient moneyto pay half of the contract shortfalls --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MR. MILLER: -- without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half2 of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of3 money. 4          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Didn't the tribes get noticethey might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, andso they had ample opportunity to cut back on their567   spending?8910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MILLER: No, Justice Kennedy, and -- and to the contrary. In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health Service was telling everybody they were paying them in full. They told the General Accounting Office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in the Government's brief. But --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So these -- these are reliancedamages in a sense.MR. MILLER: The -- the tribes expected to be paid. The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be paid in full in the first year.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, they -- they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?          MR. MILLER:  That is correct.  That is correct.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   will have available to spend? 2             MR. MILLER:  The contractors don't know until 3   the year is over because throughout the year, the4 Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but 5   stated in a circular, to reprogram.  And the6 appropriations -- 7             JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what do you mean by 8   that?  You said a second ago the Secretary had the option 9   to reprogram.  What do you mean by reprogram?10             MR. MILLER:  When the Secretary prepares a11   budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum12 amount of, say, $1.8 billion. We -- we take $400 million13 off the top or $300 million off the top because that was14 specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the15   balance is a lump sum.  The Secretary crafts a budget.16   The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar17 amount is adopted by Congress. Now, Congress can step in18 and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap19 it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.20             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes, but the -- the tribes21   have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is22   going to be there at the end of the day?23             MR. MILLER:  The tribes enter into contracts, as24 most Government contractors do when they enter into25 contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the agency will have the money to pay them. That's okay. The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the appropriations. It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  All right.  So how was thatappropriation money in fact used by the FederalGovernment, do you say?10111213141516171819 programming?20 MR. MILLER: Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for 21 taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the 22 Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding 23 on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law24 because Congress didn't adopt it. And as conditions25 change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts15Alderson Reporting CompanyMR. MILLER: The Federal Government --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: There was the appropriation. MR. MILLER: Yes.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And the tribes had alreadyentered into contracts. Now, how was that lump sum used? MR. MILLER: The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion overhow it spends its appropriation except insofar as -- JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that what you mean by1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9its budget, which we call reprogramming.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So programming is allocatingvarious segments of the lump sum to various purposes. MR. MILLER: Correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. MILLER: And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught --MR. MILLER: Well, it should not be done without the contract amounts --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that in fact how it was          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And is that done withoutregard to the contract amounts that the tribes haveentered into?1011121314   done?151617 way?1819 Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on 20 the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So21 there's no question the agency cannot pay more than22 Congress gives it. When Congress only gives it $10023 million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's 24 it. The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more. 25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But didn't -- didn't Congress,16Alderson Reporting Companyregard to1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. MILLER: That is in fact how it was done. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And is it still done thatMR. MILLER:  Well, the times have changed.￼1 even before that, impose a significant limitation on how 2   much the Secretary could pay?  What do you with the3 provision in -- in (b) of -- of the section that you were4 reading from? Notwithstanding any other provision in this5 subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter6 is subject to the availability of appropriations and the7 Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs,8 projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds9 available to another tribe or tribal organization under10   this chapter.  I mean, what -- what money that the11 Secretary expends is -- is not expended for programs,12   projects, or activities that serve a tribe?13 MR. MILLER: Justice Scalia, we read this --14 this clause with -- keeping in mind the first sentence15 first of the sentence. The first sentence, which begins16 on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of17 funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced18 to make funding available for contract monitoring or19 administration by the Secretary. And the subparagraph (3)20 in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the21   Secretary to pay for Federal functions.2223 but -- 2425JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's all very good,MR. MILLER:  But then there's an exception.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- then the last paragraph17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision2   of this subchapter.  So this --3 MR. MILLER: We --4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it seems to me, overrides5 everything else. Unless -- unless you can persuade me6   that that -- that that provision doesn't give the7 Secretary the authority to -- to allocate the available8   funds among other activities that serve tribes, I -- I9   think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.10             MR. MILLER:  Justice Scalia, for -- for two11   reasons we think it cannot.12             First of all, if that exception swallowed up the13 rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the14   whole purpose of the act.15             And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a16   mandatory rule of construction that Congress has17 articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government18 never cites in the statutory interpretation case. And19   this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the20 act --21 22 23 24 2518Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.MR. MILLER: Page -- sorry --JUSTICE SCALIA: 21 of --MR. MILLER: 21a of our opening blue brief. JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, 21a, good.￼ 1             MR. MILLER:  21a, correct.2 Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination3 and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this4 contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of5 the contractor. That statement is repeated as well in6 every -- 7             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Oh, fine, but you still have 8   to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and9 grapple with what it means. The Secretary is not required10 to reduce11 serving a1213   challenge.14funding for programs, projects, or activitiestribe to make funds available to another tribe.MR. MILLER:  So what could it mean?  That's ourJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, what does it mean?1516171819   hospitals and clinics.  If I walked into the office of the20 headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville,21 Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white22 jackets. I'm not going to see patients and counselors.23 There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters24 offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what25   they do are administrative functions.19Alderson Reporting Company          MR. MILLER:  We have to give it meaning.  Webelieve it means the -- as the Secretary always said when-- and -- and said at the time these amendments wereadopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  May -- may I2 interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the -- 3   the position in your brief correctly.  I thought the4 position that you took there was ultimately regardless of5 what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough6 money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that 7   is actually made.  And if any money is going to be8 squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the -- 9   is the -- is the agency itself.  Its bureaucracy is going10 to have less money. And I understood your argument to be11   that given the provisions you read earlier in this12 section, Congress has made a positive decision that if13 there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and14 squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed.15   Is that your position?16             MR. MILLER:  That is our position.17             JUSTICE SOUTER:  If that is your position, do18   you have to even grapple with difficulties about the19   notwithstanding clause?20             MR. MILLER:  Well, we still need to provide some21 meaning to the -- to the provision that says the Secretary22   may not -- does not have to reduce funding for programs23 serving other tribes. I guess, I think we do need to 24 grapple with the clause in order not to --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but I thought you were20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   saying you could -- you could -- the -- the Secretary2   doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes.  The3 Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody4   is going to get the short end, it's going to be the5   bureaucracy.6 7 8 911   bureaucracy.          MR. MILLER:  It's going to be the bureaucracy.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Just give them the -- just givethem the money.               MR. MILLER:  It's not going to be the programs10   on the ground serving the tribes.  It's going to be theJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.MR. MILLER: Now, it may be felt -- JUSTICE SCALIA: To put it -- this is acompetition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program12131415161718   of programs.  I mean, it's -- it's not as though it's a19202122232425bureaucracy against the people. The whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats. I mean, it --MR. MILLER: Well, I would -- I would --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you -- you paint it asthough the -- you know, who cares about the bureaucrats.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   The -- the Government just wasn't interested in the 2   bureaucrats.  That may well be, but there -- there are 3   bureaucrats at both ends of this thing. 4             MR. MILLER:  I say that for two reasons.  First 5   of all, the -- the Congress, in our opinion, clearly6 privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's 7   Federal functions. 8             But more practically, let's look at the9 Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that10 had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract11 support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract12   was in round numbers $7 million.  So they get the13   hospital, $5 million to run it.  They don't get the $214 million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital.15 It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They16 didn't get the full hospital operational budget because17 they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance,18 undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There19 were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact,20 that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I ask you a basic22 question --23             MR. MILLER:  Yes, Justice Breyer.24             JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which maybe others25   understand, but I'm confused.22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             Imagine that this has nothing to do with 2   Indians.  It is simply an ordinary contract.  Now, my3 understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to 4   appropriations.  So we have to decide was there an5 appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government,6 the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for7 anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $9998 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their --9 what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need10 at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So11 there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't12   made.13             Now, my understanding of ordinary Government14   contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in15   principle available for the contracts.  You look to16 something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it 17 during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate18 amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah,19   I'm not sure.20 All right. Now, I want -- if I have the -- the21 theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money22   was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million23 in my example that you believe in principle was available24 to pay these -- for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend25   it's a regular contract.  What is the equivalent of that23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼123456   million.78 910111213141516          MR. MILLER:  -- in this case, up to $100          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, okay.  And anything else?MR. MILLER: Any of the increases, any of the sums. And then we move to this statute --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, forget this statute for asecond because I'll stop you there.  I want you to tell mewhy those sums -- I get the time.  I get the amount.          MR. MILLER:  Why the purpose.JUSTICE BREYER: Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for$10 million?          MR. MILLER:  The equivalent of the $10 millionwould be sums not spent on anything -- JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.17 this. 1819202122232425          MR. MILLER:  Well, that's one of the things the-- the Government and we agree upon.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It was one of the purposes.MR. MILLER: One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that satisfies the purpose test.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you think -- you2 and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary3 contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding4 contract would have been entered into and the clause,5   subject to appropriations, would not work for the6   Government.7 8 9MR. MILLER:  That is correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you can't say that the1011121314   contract.15Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it. JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Were it an ordinary -- MR. MILLER: The Government --JUSTICE BREYER: -- were it an ordinaryMR. MILLER:  In -- in the hypothetical.1617 rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the18 Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when19   you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum20 appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring21 Government operations and figuring out how much do they22   want to boost their functions for this or that or the23 other, and the --24             JUSTICE BREYER:  So our issue as far as you're25 concerned -- and I'll ask the Government the same question25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005No.  I think the Government would agree that the￼ 1   -- is, is this contract different from an ordinary 2   contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et3 cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference.4 And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that5 right? 6             MR. MILLER:  That is correct.  They claim these 7   aren't contracts -- Justice Kennedy. 8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you did say the -- these 9   contracts were unique.10             MR. MILLER:  These contracts are unique.  The11 contracts in Winstar were unique. The contracts in the12 United States v. New Mexico advance costs -- advance13 funded cost reimbursable contracts. Many contracts are14 unique. The question is whether the distinction makes a15 difference in the law. The distinction here that these16 are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the Government says it's18 unique because the tribes are providing governmental19 services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a20   city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.21             MR. MILLER:  But that's not unique either22 because the -- the Government, the Department of Defense23 in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision24 of food to our troops in Iraq. That's a quintessential25 governmental services, feeding the military. But they26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9contract it out. No one would suggest there that just because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to a private contractor. I mean, what -- what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these -- these tribes more governmental power, more self- determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.          MR. MILLER:  Absolutely.  And even Congressconsidered --JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's what makes it different from private contracts --MR. MILLER: We --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even -- even with1011121314151617   Halliburton.1819202122232425          MR. MILLER:  We --JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody. MR. MILLER: We submit that that difference wasconsidered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that was the language of the -- of the Senate report. They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount.          I'd like to reserve the balance of my time,Justice Stevens.10111213141516171819202122232425   percent.  So my question to you is the same.  I asked,JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you.Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASANON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES          MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes.          Now, the tribes have to point to some source offunding within that lump sum appropriation.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, they just did, the 228Alderson Reporting Company￼1 let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing 2   to do with it.  It was a typical, ordinary Government 3   contract for pencils.  All right?  Or for soda water. 4   Now, and everything were the same.  Under those5 circumstances, just an ordinary contract -- and they point6 to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking --7 we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in8 the Court of Claims. But -- but we have -- we have a9 contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The10 -- the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the11 contract because that 2 percent is available, legally12   speaking, time, purpose, and -- and amount.  Okay?13 Classic.14             Now, what's the Government's view there?15             MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it available or not were17   this an ordinary contract?18 MR. SRINIVASAN: No. With respect tothe219 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions,20   that's not available.21             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm asking -- all right.  Are22   -- is the Government's view then let's treat this just as23 an ordinary contract? Still it -- there was no money 24 available.25 MR. SRINIVASAN: With respect to --29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  Legally speaking under the 2   time-purpose-amount test. 3             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I'm 4   drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's5 reserved for core agency functions and -- 6             JUSTICE BREYER:  No. 7             MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- it's been a background8 principle of Government contracting law that there are9 certain core agency functions that -- that the Government10   is required to perform for itself and that it can't11 contract out. So I think that informs the interpretation12   of the subject to availability clause.13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I would like an answer to14 my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract15 with a subject to appropriations clause, is -- would the16   Government be saying this is invalid because the17   appropriations were not there?18             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, you have to look at the19   particular context.20             JUSTICE BREYER:  There must be a yes or no21   answer to that.22             MR. SRINIVASAN:  It would be no if this23   statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.24             JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  What it is is a contract25 for pencils. Can you not -- is it impossible --30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MR. SRINIVASAN: If -- if all --JUSTICE BREYER: -- to make -- you see what I'm driving --MR. SRINIVASAN: If -- if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.1011121314   they?1516171819202122232425MR. SRINIVASAN: There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because --JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, and which are the funds that are -- that would be available here? Which are          JUSTICE BREYER:  If this were under Blackhawk.MR. SRINIVASAN: Under Blackhawk, it would be -- it would -- it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be -- be directed in any particular manner.Now, there are some provisions in the --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  That includes the 2 percentthat you keep referring to.31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. SRINIVASAN:  That -- that would include inthe -- that would include the 2 percent.But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. So you'd have to take into account --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then let me do this          MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- those particular provisos.10   then.111213JUSTICE BREYER: You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and1415   they could have brought their lawsuit.  Now, tell me16   specifically, if you can -- and this may take you the17 whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want.18 What is it that's special about this contract that brings19   it out of ordinary contracting principles?20             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, first and foremost, the21 text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the22   appendix to -- to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your23 standard, garden variety subject to availability clause.24   You have to look at the particular context in which this25 statute --1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000532Alderson Reporting Company￼1             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, the language is the2   same.3 4 5 6 7 8 9MR. SRINIVASAN: It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other provision -- and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a -- the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and -- and this is --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  That phrase is the same,subject to the availability of appropriations.101112   hypothetical.          MR. SRINIVASAN:  That particular phraseresembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Exactly.MR. SRINIVASAN: But the term available -- and I think this is critical. The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.1314151617181920212223   funds available for other tribes.  It's simply that it24   would have squeezed you in your budget, your -- your25 headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if IJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the other -- the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000533Alderson Reporting Company￼1 understand them, that the -- that the nonreduction clause 2   doesn't save you here because you could have paid it 3   without reducing things for other tribes. 4             MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- I think that argument is5 incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation 6   of the terms of the reduction clause.  But second of all,7 the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 8   2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core9 agency functions, were available for contracting is10 contrary to -- to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if11   you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from12 450j-1(a)(1) -- what provision says is the amount of funds13 provided under the terms of self-determination contracts14 include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have15 otherwise provided. And then later on down in the 16 paragraph --17 18 19 2021 than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have22   otherwise provided.JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see that. Where?MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry. It's --JUSTICE SCALIA: Not less. Right?MR. SRINIVASAN: Shall not -- shall be not less23             And then further down in the paragraph in the24   last -- in the last clause, including support of25 administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are2 certain functions that are not otherwise contractable,3 namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the4 agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-5 1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds6 for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to7 the contracting tribes because the agency requires those 8   funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a 9   Federal agency.10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but I thought the11 submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of12 these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are13 functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a14   factual disagreement here?15             MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't think so, Justice16   Kennedy.  I think it's more of a characterization17 disagreement. There -- it's true that in a descriptive18 sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for19 contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that20   whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for21 core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be22   turned over.23             JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say that.  It24 doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable.25   And they could certainly -- for a lay person like me in35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that 2   says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for 3   the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of 4   Interior.  Well, if it said that, then that's not 5   otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but -- 7             JUSTICE BREYER:  So otherwise contractable 8   sounds like a -- a statutory question. 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it -- it's not talking10   about money that's otherwise contractable.  It says,11   including supportive administrative functions that are12   otherwise contractable.  It's talking about a limitation13 upon the contractability of functions --14             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct.15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- not the use of funds.16             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it's talking about both17   because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the18   amount of funds.  It's relating to the amount of funds19   that are required to be transferred, and what it stands20   for is that funds for supportive administrative functions21   that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core22   agency functions that the agency is required to perform23   itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to24   contracting tribes.  And that just reflects the common25   sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   to perform some core functions. 2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But how do you -- how do you 3   square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as 4   Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make5 funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or6 administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by7 the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but 8   not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls 9   under the heading Federal functions.10             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Ginsburg, the way we11 square that under the statute is that the leading -- the12 initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of13 funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our14 view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal15 functions were never required to be transferred under16 subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with17   is the funds that are left over after the funds for18   inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So are these noninherent20 Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal21 functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and22   noninherent?23 24 25MR. SRINIVASAN: Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set 2   of functions that the agency itself is required to3 perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal4 functions and Federal functions, although it might seem5 trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the6 definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically7 defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal8 functions. 9             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does it ever define them as10   noncontractable?  I mean, I -- I -- your answer, I1112131415 contractability?16 MR. SRINIVASAN: It does, Justice Scalia -- 17 Justice Souter. Excuse me.18             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Thank you, but apologize to19   him.suppose, is well, what -- what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to --MR. SRINIVASAN:  It -- it does.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- the point of20212223   for just one second, on page 31.  When Congress enacted24 the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the25   BIA -- and this is at the beginning of the first partial38Alderson Reporting Company(Laughter.)          MR. SRINIVASAN:  And we describe the -- therelevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 paragraph that begins with of particular significance.2 There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the3 provision reads that nothing in this section is intended 4   or shall be construed to expand or alter existing5 statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to6 enter into any agreement with respect to functions that7 are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies8 is that there are some functions that are not contractable 9   and can't be turned over to the tribes.10             JUSTICE BREYER:  That -- that all may be true,11 of course. They're talking about don't contract out to12 the Indians something that should be done in Washington.13   But what has that got to do with the issue?  We're14 talking, I thought, about -- about Government contracts.15 People who enter into Government contracts need certainty.16   They have to know whether that word, subject to17 appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they18 have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come19 up that are used to decide that. And under that set of20 principles, money is available to pay for the contract if21   it's time, purpose, and amount.  Okay?  That's the22   principle.  And --23 24 25          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  You don't think --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and I don't see anythingcontrary to that.39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer, one background principle -- and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves. One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal -- inherent Federal functions?MR. SRINIVASAN: No. They specifically --10111213   about.14JUSTICE O'CONNOR: They didn't violate that section, did they? The contracts that we're talkingMR. SRINIVASAN: They specifically did not transfer --151617   with that.  We're dealing with contracts that didn't18 violate that section. And you're just saying that some of19 the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government20   to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that21   the contracts violated that provision.22             MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  The -- that's correct,23   Justice O'Connor.  What I'm responding to is the24 suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary25 to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  No.  So we're not dealing￼ 1   diverted to pay for the indirect costs -- 2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're not saying -- you're3 addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are4 available. 5             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct. 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's where your argument is7 going. 8 9   funds that are available.10             And the tribes' position --11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you rely on the statement12 in (a) that the -- the only funds that are available are13   funds that include funds to -- to pay for supportive14 administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.15 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. Not funds --16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And not funds that are used to17   pay for administrative functions that are not18   contractable.MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct.  It relates to the192021222324 question that I'm having trouble following? As I25 understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriationMR. SRINIVASAN: Right. We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off -- off the --1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I --JUSTICE SOUTER: You said that --JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you sort of a basic41Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.JUSTICE STEVENS: But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.101112131415161718   part.  And let me -- but I think this is significant, and19   if I can just walk the Court through the process by which20 the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately21   is allocated.22             The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA23 and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation24   across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the25   next year's allocation will be built.  And that's42Alderson Reporting Company          MR. SRINIVASAN:  In -- in part it was mandatedby the statute.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE STEVENS: In part but not in whole. MR. SRINIVASAN: Perhaps not in whole -- JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's the point.MR. SRINIVASAN: -- but at least in significant￼ 1   reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a2 of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision,3 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred4 to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in5 subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited6 criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is7 the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing8 with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always 9   an increase.  And so the Secretary, pursuant to the10 statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at11   the level that it was at the previous fiscal year.12             Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds13 two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory14 across-the-board increases for things such as salary15 COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a16 standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in17 the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court18 to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where19   we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the -- is the nub of what21 you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in22   fact, mandated by a statute?23 MR. SRINIVASAN: It was -- I -- I think in24 principal part it was mandated by the -- by --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Principal part, but --43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that mean that there wasnot enough?          MR. SRINIVASAN:  At least as far --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  They could have made it 97percent --MR. SRINIVASAN: -- insofar as what I've said with respect --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and had enough money -- MR. SRINIVASAN: Sorry.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- to pay these contract101112   obligations.1314151617181920   have discretion to do that.  And that's what I'm trying to21 explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline22 and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated23   by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his24 budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done.25             With respect to the mandatory across-the-board1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, Justice Stevens.JUSTICE STEVENS: See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, I don't think that they44Alderson Reporting Company￼1 increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C.2 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the3 administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires4 the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for,5 quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, 6   other expenses relating to the provision of health7 services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such8 funds are provided to programs and services operated9 directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory10 across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate11 those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-12   contracting tribes.13             And that leaves the additional set of an14   increase from one year to the next year that deals with15 specific targeted items, and principally that would16 include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come17   on board during the course of a particular fiscal year.18 And with respect to those specific targeted items, the19   critical point is that the contracting tribes often20   benefit from the addition of those and from the21 enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks.22             For example, in this particular case, the -- one23 of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic24   in Oklahoma.  That was a new facility that came on board25   in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a2 self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that3 facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's4 budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation5 committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee6 Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are7 honored. 89          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are you telling me that thecommittee reports are -- are binding law?MR. SRINIVASAN: They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.10111213141516171819   agreements.  And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why20 contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.21             MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's not just the committee22 reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The23   reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has24 ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the25   proper interpretation of the contract.JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000546Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1             JUSTICE SOUTER:  And -- and their -- their2 argument is that you can pay the contract amount without 3   robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the4 nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying -- I think5 they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, 6   get squeezed.  Yes.  And if so, the contract comes first 7   and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to 8   Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're9 getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what10   they're saying.11             MR. SRINIVASAN:  That is what they're saying,12   Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's13 incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two14   separate types of bureaucracy.  There's that core1516171819202122232425bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.JUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not. But if -- if -- where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like -- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I read here -- look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available,2 not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems3 to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you 4   say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes.  And so 5   I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who6 really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. 7   So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a 8   point of normal contract law is legally available, I9 promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I10 might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now11   why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.12             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because, Justice Breyer, I13 think the core of it is that even if you think that14 they're right, that these funds are legally available,15   that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA16 specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that17   he not be required to reduce funding for programs,18 projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make19 funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.20             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there is -- is -- the21 kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be22 taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract23 Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still24 enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought25   you should take money from one tribe to give it to48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   another.  What did they think? 2             MR. SRINIVASAN:  No.  They thought -- the -- the3 board -- the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the4 Board of Contract Appeals, thought -- 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm thinking the Board of 6   Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit. 7             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I don't think the Board8 of -- of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with9 where the funds were coming from. They just thought that10   legal availability would be sufficient.11             Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that12 funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And13 we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't14 think those funds ever came into the group of funds that15 were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if16 you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds17 for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs,18 projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that19 one example of a core Federal function --20             JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but if that's true, then21   everything -- then every penny in the -- in the IHS22 bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the -- that23   swallows the entire budget.24             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, let's -- Justice Souter,25   if I -- if I could, let's look at the particular49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sources --JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no. But I mean, justconceptually isn't that -- isn't that the -- theimplication of what you're saying?JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you can't limit it to inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the -- the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.With respect to the administrative support --JUSTICE GINSBURG: On -- on that point -- on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   contract support costs are paid in full.  And he said, I 2   asked them again and again and again, and they were3 unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell4 the court what programs -- existing programs with other5 tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I 6   think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is7 unavailable and no existing program with other tribes 8   would have been diminished? 9             MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't -- I don't think so,10 Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why11   you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not12 only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court,13 it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's -- there14   are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that15 specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay16 for the contract support costs of these tribes would have17 required reducing funds for programs, projects, or18   activities serving a tribe.19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, what does that mean?20             MR. SRINIVASAN:  So --21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I mean, one thing is existing22 contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then23   another thing is, well, we think that there's a new24 program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going25 to put that new program in and say that that steps in51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 front of these contract support costs. Are we talking2 just about existing programs that -- that the Government3 has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government 4   is at liberty to benefit tribes?  And so what if the5 contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? 6   We're still doing good for tribes. 7             MR. SRINIVASAN:  We're talking about both8 existing programs and new programs, and with respect to 9   new programs, there's -- it's every bit as likely that10 those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as11   noncontracting tribes.  And again, one of the newfacilities --JUSTICE SCALIA: It's strange to talk of12131415   new program.  I mean, for a new program, there isn't any16   funding.  How can you reduce the funding for a newreducing -- is -- is not required to reduce funding for a17   program?181920MR. SRINIVASAN: Because --JUSTICE SCALIA: That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.21222324 baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is 25 the current year's appropriation allocation which takesMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000552Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1   into account increases.  And one way to see that is 252 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier3 that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-4 the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between5 contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what6 that provision means is that the reduction takes into7 account those mandatory across-the-board increases from 8   year to year.  So in some sense, I think reduce does mean9 this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to10   last year's spending amount.11             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you12 alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg,13 I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case14 that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce15   funds available for other programs.  Did those16 declarations get specific in the way that her original17 question was -- was asking about? Did it say -- did the18 declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for19   the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe20 and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say,21 as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations22   for other tribes?23             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, they -- they make the24   point as a general matter, and they also give an example.25   I think the one example that they give -- and maybe there53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 are more -- is -- is a diabetes program. But I think it's2 more the general principle -- 3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was that a new program or an 4   existing program? 5             MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's an -- the -- the6 particular example is an existing program. But I think7 it's more -- 8             JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seems to me you can9 interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did10   not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we11 now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.12             MR. SRINIVASAN:  You're -- you're speaking with13 particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?14             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.  It seems to me that you15 can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the16 Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough17   room for all the programs it wants to support in the18 current year and continuing to honor the obligations under19   the existing contracts.20             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I don't think that even21 with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough22   money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract23 support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall24   in contract support costs, for example, in 199725 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 2   to FY 1997.  It's more than the amount that was reserved3 by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so4 even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be5 sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs. 6             JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is there some way to avoid 7   these problems now?  Has anything changed? 8             MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice O'Connor, Congress9 changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit10 statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning11 with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it12   did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why was there that difference14 between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and15   not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?16             MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think the difference lies in17 the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.18 My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in19 BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become20 evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond.21 And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the22 two.23 24 25But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else,55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a2 subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme3 from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his 4   discretion under the ISDA.  And under this Court's5 decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination 6   by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great7 weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately8 exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you9 thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary10 had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA,11 I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation12   Act that its view was that Secretary had done so13 legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our14   favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA.15             I want to address really quickly, if I could,16 the notion that the funds for administrative support for17 programs that are administered directly by the Federal18 Government are available. And that would have significant19 consequences because one of the policies underlying the20   act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that21 are currently entered into self-determination contracts,22   but it's to protect the amounts that are available to23 tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-24 determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view,25 the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years.Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Miller, you have about 4minutes left.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD B. MILLER             ON BEHALF OF THE CHEROKEE NATION                AND SHOSHONE-PAIUTE TRIBES          MR.

That is a term of art with a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said that if -- unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I think they disagree with youabout the purpose in respect to the core Government1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000557Alderson Reporting Company￼ 1             MR. MILLER:  Secondly, with regard to the core2 governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a3 settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans4 Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't5 know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and 6   wanted to get approval from the Congress for that7 reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after8 the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the 9   Court then held when the payment was due, money was10 legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes11   from.  There is no protection for inherent Federal12 functions. It may have come from some other hospital13 budget. It may have come from some other activity of the14 Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does15 is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal16 obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has17 an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if18 there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply19 as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains.20             Secondly, when funds are not available, we know21 what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis'22 decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens23   when funds are not available.  There was a line item24 appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We25 understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything58Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 is square. 2             Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was 3   available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where4 the money could have come from, not that the Government5 had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to6 reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. 7   Where could the money have come from? 8             In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in9 a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other10 contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $9811 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was12 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in13 increase every year from $36 million to $88 million.14 There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They15   couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this16 contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken17 some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some18 of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at19 headquarters and area offices. That was their decision.20             But the contractor didn't take the risk that the21 Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided22   to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by23 golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes24 that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a25 tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in59Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   the statute doesn't take that risk either. 2             There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory3 in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, 4   the contractors come, after the allocation of the5 Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction 6   year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the7 contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and8 programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my9 decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough10   money to pay you.  There's no limit here on contract11 support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They12 could zero out these contracts and say it's practical13 availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money14 to deal with all of the health care needs in the country,15 so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you16   come last.  Now, that's not what the -- that's not what17 the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would18   lead to an absurdity.19             With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision,20 Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in21   the Tenth Circuit.  There was a declaration in the Tenth22   Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to23 have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in24 programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not25 sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's60Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary 2 judgment.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          So for all theseCircuit decision should beCircuit decision affirmed.          Unless the Courtreasons, we believe the Tenthreversed and the Federal1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005                 has more questions.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Miller.MR.
