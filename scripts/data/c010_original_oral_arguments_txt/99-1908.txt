SUTTON               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. SUTTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, mayit please the Court:          There are two points that I would like to makethis morning.  The first is that it is never appropriatefor a branch of the Federal Government to imply thecreation of a private right of action under the spendingpower.  The second is that, regardless of theparticipation of the State as a defendant in this case,the Court's implied right-of-action doctrine does notextend to these disparate effect regulations.          Let me start with the first point.  In caseafter case over the last two to three decades the Courthas made clear that States are not run-of-the-mill civildefendants.  They are not mere interest groups.  They arecoequal sovereigns and, as a result, the Court has notlightly inferred that Congress means to regulate theStates as States, to regulate in core areas of local3123456789    relief.sovereignty, or, as here, to expose the States to aprivate right of action.  Those principles areparticularly critical when it comes to the spending --          QUESTION:  Well, we're not dealing with adamages action here, are we?          MR. SUTTON:  That's true, Your Honor.  That'sexactly --QUESTION:  We're dealing with prospective10 11 1213    the Eleventh Amendment applies even to injunctive relief14    and even, as this particular case reveals, you can still15    alter the Federal-State balance by allowing private rights16    of action.  Indeed, in Cannon, the Court distinguished a17    case not unlike this one on just this ground.18              In Cannon, in footnote 13, the Court reviewed19    many of the implied right-of-action cases it had decided,20    and it looked at a case called Santa Clara Pueblo, a case21    in which the Court had not implied a right of action22    against a tribe, and for that -- and the reason it did not23    imply a right of action was because tribes are sovereigns.24    Now, they're statutory sovereigns, whereas States are25    constitutional sovereigns.4MR. SUTTON:  That's true, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Declaratory and prospective.MR. SUTTON:  Exactly, Your Honor and, of course, 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, do I understand what you 2    just told us to mean that if the Cannon case had been 3    against the State medical school instead of against a 4    private university there would have been no claim? 5              MR. SUTTON:  I think that's right, Your Honor. 6    I think that's right, and it would have been -- of course, 7    it's an even harder claim here, because this claim is 8    under regulations, which is something the Court has never 9    inferred before from congressional actions.10              QUESTION:  That's a different point, but I11    wanted to know how sweeping your position is, and you are12    saying that if Cannon had been against the University of13    Illinois instead of the Medical School of the University14    of Chicago, it would have been thrown out?15              MR. SUTTON:  That's exactly what I'm saying,16    Your Honor, and I think that's true, and that is our first17    principal point.  And I think, Your Honor, it follows from18    all of the cases -- I mean, whether you look at Gregory v.19    Ashcroft, Atascadero, or South Dakota v. Dole, Pennhurst,20    all of those cases made clear, when you alter the Federal-21    State balance Congress has to be unmistakable in what it's22    doing, and in this case it was anything but unmistakable.23    Everyone agrees --24              QUESTION:  Cannon itself said that's -- as far25    as implied rights of action it said, we come from a past5 1    when Congress was reacting to the courts' activity and 2    knew that the courts were implying private rights of 3    action.  I thought Cannon said, this much but no further. 4    Congress, we're now putting you on notice that henceforth 5    we are not going to imply private rights of action, but we 6    understand that Cannon comes from a different milieu, and 7    we're going to -- not going to change that. 8              MR. SUTTON:  But, Your Honor, States are 9    different.  The Court -- the only case that's been10    identified so far by respondents involving what seems to11    be an oxymoron, implied right of action against the State,12    is the Allen case from 1969.  That was not a Spending13    Clause case, point number 1, but point number 2, more14    importantly, that's a case that falls under this case's --15    this Court's decisions, specifically Atascadero, where you16    can have an overwhelming implication in the statute that a17    right of action was created.18              In Allen, had there not been a right of action,19    the individuals would not have been able to enforce other20    parts of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  That case is21    not a classic implied right-of-action case where there's22    no suggestion in the statute that Congress meant to create23    a right of action.24              In this case, it's just the opposite.  Here,25    Congress did create a right of action, just not by private61 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425individuals, by agencies, so you said my first propositionis a sweeping one, and perhaps it is, but there are not alot of cases recognizing the implied right-of-actiondoctrine against States.  I mean, that's not something theCourt has been doing.          QUESTION:  That's true, but you do -- in yourview, is this -- do I have your argument correct thatthere'll be a certain number of civil rights statuteswhere, in respect to an implied right of action, there isbasically silence, and do you think there could be anumber of those statutes where you would imply from thatsilence a private right of action against an individualbut not against a State?  That's your view?did --MR. SUTTON:  That may be true, Your Honor, but IQUESTION:  It is your view?MR. SUTTON:  It is my view, Your Honor.QUESTION:  All right.  If that's your view, thenyou're reading a lot of complication into the silence.          MR. SUTTON:  The reason you're saying that isbecause States will be treated differently from otherlitigants in the statutes?          QUESTION:  Yes.  You're reading all that into asilence, so if you're going to read that much complicationinto the silence, why not read into it that you could7 1    bring injunctive actions but not damage actions, given the 2    Eleventh Amendment? 3              MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, as 4    Justice Powell said in Atascadero, States are different. 5    I mean, to quote him at page 246, given their 6    constitutional role, the States are not like any other 7    class of recipients of Federal aid.  That's exactly the 8    premise for the Court's clear statement decisions. 9              QUESTION:  Is there any authority for that kind10    of interpretation of a silence that we get out of the11    silence actions against a private person but not actions12    against the State?13              MR. SUTTON:  That's exactly Atascadero, where14    you could get money damages actions against private15    individuals under Section 504, but not against States, so16    there is authority for that exact point.17              But I do want to go back to, I think a premise18    in your question, which is that this argument is somehow19    sweeping because there are lots of other civil rights20    statutes where somehow there would not now be a right of21    action against the State, and we're concerned about that.22    I don't think that's true, however.  I don't know what23    those statutes are.  No one's pointed them out.24              The Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself, Congress25    was very explicit when it wanted either private rights of8 1    action, as in Title II or Title VII, or AG enforcement 2    actions, as in Title III and Title IV.  Title VI -- 3              QUESTION:  Atascadero, which you put so much 4    reliance on, is distinguishable in that it did involve a 5    money damage action, and it explicitly involved the 6    Eleventh Amendment.  That's not the issue here, is it? 7              MR. SUTTON:  That's true, Your Honor, but as I 8    pointed out, in Cannon, in footnote 14, the Court has 9    already dealt with this very issue.  Santa Clara Pueblo10    was a case that was an ex parte Young action against a11    tribe.  What the statute in that case said is, we create12    an express right of action for habeas corpus relief.  It13    said nothing else under the Indian Civil Rights Act.  That14    was the statute at issue.15              The Court said, in light of the silence, in16    light of the express creation of one cause of action,17    silence about any other one, and in light of the18    sovereignty of the -- the statutory sovereignty of tribes,19    we're not going to imply a right of action.  That's Cannon20    itself, and that is this case.  If you don't imply rights21    of action casually against statutory sovereigns, you22    surely don't do it against constitutional sovereigns.23              QUESTION:  Would you explain, Mr. Sutton, the24    impact in the civil rights remedies, Equalization Act that25    I thought waived the Eleventh Amendment immunity for Title91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425VI, Title IX -- and 504 cases, no?          MR. SUTTON:  You're referring to the 1986Rehabilitation Act amendments?          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, that's a very goodpoint, and we're very sympathetic to it, but I just wantto clarify one thing.  That point goes to the applicationof the standard I'm advocating.  It does not contest thestandard, because what happens in 1986 is, Congress showsit understands this dialogue between the Court andCongress as to what is required before you regulate theStates in these areas, and I think there's a very goodargument that Congress was express in 1986 that there werecauses of action against States, but conspicuously missingfrom those amendments is any indication that they werecauses of action under regulations, as opposed to thestatutory antidiscrimination --          QUESTION:  I thought you were stating sweepinglythat when you answered my question, Cannon was under thebasic prohibition, not against --          MR. SUTTON:  Title IX.          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. SUTTON:  Under 901, yes.          QUESTION:  Right, and you said there would be nosuch claim, but now I think you're amending that, because                            10 1    you said after the '86 act there would be. 2              MR. SUTTON:  Well then, I misunderstood your 3    question.  I thought you were referring to all other 4    cases.  I mean, in other words, all statutes that are 5    silent about creating a private right of action, and I'm 6    acknowledging the argument is sweeping in that respect. 7    It applies to all statutes. 8              You are right, after 1986, when it comes to 9    Section 504, Title IX and Title VI, the argument's not10    sweeping at all when it comes to the antidiscrimination11    mandate, because, as respondents have argued, in 198612    Congress picked up on the dialogue and said, we are going13    to create an express right of action, so when it comes to14    intentional discrimination, that which is barred by Title15    VI or Title IX, there is a right of action.16              But the critical failing with that particular17    argument, and I think that's why it's really not being18    relied upon by respondents, is Congress says nothing at19    all about rights of action under regulations, which you20    know, after all, is an extraordinary concept.21              QUESTION:  What if it were a city who was the --22    which was the defendant in the case?23              MR. SUTTON:  In this particular case?24              QUESTION:  Uh-huh.25              MR. SUTTON:  Well, I think, as this Court has                                  11 1    said, cities are different from States.  I mean, in my 2    view, cities are -- they're statutory sovereigns.  They're3 State -- 4              QUESTION:  Do you acknowledge there would be a 5    private right of action for enforcement of the regulations 6    against a city? 7              MR. SUTTON:  There would be with respect to the 8    first argument I'm making, but let me switch now to the 9    second argument we're making, where I do not think there10    would be a right of action against a city, county, or for11    that matter, a private person.12              When one looks at all of the Court's implied13    right-of-action cases whether it's 1964 in the Borak14    decision, or Cannon, or more recent decisions, they all15    start with and agree that the most important point is16    congressional intent, congressional meaning and design.17              There are several indicators in Title VI that18    Congress did not mean to imply the creation of a private19    right of action under the section 602 regulations.  The20    first is that as this case comes to the Court there's no21    doubt what the antidiscrimination mandate means.  Everyone22 agrees.23 24 25          No one's contesting Bakke, Fordice, for the viewthat 601 only prescribes what the Equal Protection Clauseprescribes, so first of all it's a very unusual way for12 1    Congress to work, to prescribe one type of State action or 2    city, county action and then somehow implicitly create a 3    cause of action with an entirely different standard of4 review. 5              The second indicator of congressional intent, it 6    may be helpful to look at the statute itself, and if you 7    look at -- if you're interested, if you look at page 1 and 8    2 of the blue brief, our opening brief, I'd like to point 9    out some language that I think is -- well, we're obviously10    a little biased, but close to dispositive on this11    particular point.  If you're relying on Section 602 to12    implicitly create this cause of action, you've got to read13    all of Section 602.14              Granted, it does create rulemaking authority for15    the agencies, but if you look on page 2 -- it's about16    eight or nine lines down, the beginning of a new17    sentence -- you have the sentence that says, compliance18    with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may19    be affected, so once again, compliance with any20    requirement adopted in accordance with this section.21              In other words, Section 602 does give rulemaking22    authority to agencies, but it then says, if you want to23    enforce those rules, here's how you do it, and the here's24    how you do it creates special rules when it comes to25    termination of funding --13 1              QUESTION:  Well, it also says, or by any other 2    means authorized by law, so isn't that the issue? 3              MR. SUTTON:  Exactly, Your Honor, and this is 4    critical.  The second possibility for getting compliance 5    with these rules is by any other means authorized by law 6    and, as the Federal Government acknowledged in its brief, 7    I think at page 11, that includes, for example, injunctive 8    relief so, for example, under that, at a minimum all agree 9    an agency could come in and enjoin the State conduct, for10    example, the way Alabama is administering its driver's11 licenses.12              But here's now the critical second statutory13    point.  You then have this proviso, exactly after the line14    that Justice O'Connor has quoted, that now says that no15    such action -- the such is obviously referring to16    everything they've discussed so far -- says, shall be17    taken until the department or agency concerned has advised18    the appropriate persons, here the Alabama Department of19    Public Safety, of the failure to comply with a20    requirement, has determined that compliance cannot be21    secured by voluntary means.22              How in the world could a private individual23    establish that a State is in compliance with a Federal24    agency rule?  That's not something they have --25              QUESTION:  Well, one way the two could be14 1    reconciled, and I'm not suggesting that it's the best way, 2    but one way to reconcile them would be to say that the 3    private right of action is contingent upon the States 4    having taken the steps in the proviso, so that until the 5    State had notified, and until there had been some 6    conclusion drawn that voluntary compliance would not be 7    reached in the absence of action, the private party could 8    not seek the injunction. 9              MR. SUTTON:  But Your Honor, let's take the most10    virtuous and earnest State Attorney General.  They're11    faced with one of these private enforcement actions, and12    the private litigant does what you're suggesting.  They13    first put them on notice.  They send a letter, listen, we14    don't think what you're doing is permissible under this15 rule --16              QUESTION:  Well, I was suggesting something17    perhaps even more awkward.  I was suggesting that the18    private litigant couldn't go ahead until the State agency19    had said, you know, you're out of compliance, and the20    State agency had come to some conclusion that voluntary21    compliance was in fact not feasible.  At that point the22    individual could then go ahead with the suit, and one of23    the predicates for the private injunctive suit would be,24    the State has tried to get voluntary compliance and it25 can't.15 1              MR. SUTTON:  And the point -- I guess the point 2    I'm making is that, take the ideal State Attorney General. 3    They get this lawsuit, and the private individual says, 4    listen, we'd like to give you an opportunity to 5    voluntarily comply, and here's how we suggest you do it. 6    What assurance, what guarantee is there that the State is 7    now in compliance with a Federal agency's rules that8 this -- 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, look at the sentence,10    provided, however, that no such action shall be taken11    until the department or agency concerned.  Does the phrase12    department or agency there refer to the Federal department13    or agency in question?14              MR. SUTTON:  It does, Your Honor, and you're --15    this is a better point than the one I'm making in response16    to Justice Souter.17              That language makes it clear who is the one18    that's doing the advising, and if we're going to draw any19    inferences from this statutory scheme, it's an inference20    that whatever could be done under Section 601, under21    Section 602, that was an enforcement provision for22    agencies, enforcement provision in the sense that they23    could promulgate rules to effectuate Section 601, and then24    they could go about enforcing them, but as the Chief25    Justice's question points out, it is the Federal161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425department or agency that they're referring to.          QUESTION:  Oh, I -- actually, as I guess myquestion implied, I think that is certainly the easierreading, but I guess I also think that if we feltotherwise impelled to recognize the private action herebased on other principles, I don't suppose this wouldnecessarily stand in the way of that.          QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, do you think the wordcompliance talks about private actions as well as actionsby the Federal Government?  I always thought that sentencereferred to compliance may be effected, as by the FederalGovernment may be effecting this, but that isn't talkingabout private actions, is it?   Do you think --          MR. SUTTON:  Oh, Your Honor, but --          QUESTION:  Do you read it that way?          MR. SUTTON:  Well, I do, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Even though -- do you think there'san express cause of action, rather than an implied causeof action under Title VI?          MR. SUTTON:  Here's the reason I read it thisway, and I want to make sure I'm answering yourquestion --          QUESTION:  Do you think there's an express causeof action under Title VI?          MR. SUTTON:  I think there's a very good                            171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9argument that there's an overwhelming implication after1986 that there is a cause of action under Section 601.          QUESTION:  No, that's not my question.  Thequestion is, do you think there's an express cause ofaction, as opposed to one that we found in Cannon thatCongress intended to imply a cause of action?          MR. SUTTON:  Are you referring to 602, or 601?          QUESTION:  602.          MR. SUTTON:  I think there's a very goodargument that there is an express cause of action for allof Title VI.          QUESTION:  I see.          MR. SUTTON:  After 1986, so post Cannon.  Ithink that there is a very good argument for that.  Again,it requires implications, but I think that falls under theAtascadero point that it has to, if it's a sufficientlyoverwhelming implication, then we're going to recognize101112131415161718    it.19202122232425          After all, in 1986 they didn't create a right ofaction.  All they did is, they said, we're abrogating theState immunity.          But I want to make sure I'm understanding apoint that I'm not sure I addressed, and this goes back tothe compliance sentence about nine lines down on page 2.It says, compliance with any requirement adopted according181    to this section, and I don't know how one can read that to2    say, you don't follow these rules when you try to obtain3    compliance.4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, one could read it to say, thatsentence just refers to actions instituted by the FederalGovernment --          MR. SUTTON:  But it's --          QUESTION:  -- compliance actions, which is afairly normal way to refer to the --          MR. SUTTON:  Well, maybe this is my confusion.When it says, any requirement adopted according to thissection, the requirement's referring to the rules.Section 602 does two things.  It says, you can promulgaterules, number 1, and number 2 you can go out and enforcethem, and it does seem to me that that requirementlanguage is referring to the requirements promulgatedunder the section, and so --          QUESTION:  Well, why do you --          MR. SUTTON:  I may be wrong.  I may be wrong,but that is the way we think we read it, and we certainlythink, given the requirement of clarity, at a minimum it'snot ambiguous the other way.  I mean, that seems to mequite striking.          If I could shift to a few other points, thereare some other indicators --191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Do you concede that Congress hasauthorized the regulations at issue here?          MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor, we do not, and wethink the better reading is that these regulations areinvalid, but as we indicated in our opening brief and ourreply, we don't think the Court needs to address thevalidity of the regulations.          QUESTION:  Well, let's assume that theregulations are permitted.  Make that assumption.  That,then, is simply an implementation of 601.  I mean, it hasto be or we have a delegation problem.          MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, and that's apossibility, but you still have the problem of rules ofthe language in Section 602 that I just referred to thatsuggest indicates that all of those rules were rules thatagencies were to enforce, not private individuals, so evenif you decided -- and I don't think you need to decidethis, but even if you decide the rules were valid, itwould still be rules that could be enforced by theagencies.  In other words, if you thought --          QUESTION:  But the substantive obligation thatthe State must meet is a 601 obligation, as interpreted bythe agency under 602.          MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  Why can't you say the suit is under201 601? 2                MR. SUTTON:  Well, I don't think anyone      agrees -- I mean, I want to be clear but I don't think      anyone agrees that this suit can be characterized as being      under 601.                QUESTION:  I understand that, but I want to know10    cover disparate-effect legislation and, as Justice11    O'Connor and Justice Powell indicated in Guardians, one12    does not effectuate a statutory antidiscrimination mandate13    by redefining it.14              QUESTION:  But once the regulation is in place,15    doesn't the statute then have a new meaning, as16    interpreted by the agency?17              MR. SUTTON:  No.18              QUESTION:  Or else why does the agency have19    authority to do this at all?20              MR. SUTTON:  Respectfully, no, Your Honor.21              QUESTION:  As a preventative measure?22              MR. SUTTON:  The most that can be said is that23    you would be enforcing at that point Section 602, and24    Section 602 is the part of the statute that gives the25    agencies rulemaking authority.  I mean, that's the way2134567 why. 8               MR. SUTTON:  And the reason, the reason is that9    the Court has already made clear that Section 601 does not1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425respondents have characterized their action, that's theway the lower court characterized their action.          QUESTION:  Would the agency not have had anyrulemaking authority without Section 602?  Wouldn't ithave had the ability to promulgate interpretiveregulations --          MR. SUTTON:  That is possible.  In otherwords --          QUESTION:  -- setting forth what its own view ofthe anti-intentional discrimination provision of 601 was?          MR. SUTTON:  That's true, and that's not the waythe case has been argued, but if that were true, then Ithink it's fair you would need to look at whether that's alegitimate interpretation of Section 601.          QUESTION:  Right, and under our case law itwouldn't be?          MR. SUTTON:  Absolutely not, because Chevrondeference --          QUESTION:  So the only way the regulation hereis valid is on the assumption that it is not aninterpretive regulation, but rather is a regulation thatgoes beyond the meaning of 601 in a prophylactic way to,as 601 puts it, to effectuate the provisions of 601?          MR. SUTTON:  That's exactly right, and there'ssome guidance in the Court's cases.  In fact, it even221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425comes from the line of authority in which respondents arerelying, and that's the securities cases.  There have beenmany cases under Section 10(b) and under Rule 10(b)(5)where plaintiffs have attempted to bring a cause of actionthat broadens Section 10(b).  The most notable of them isCentral Bank from six terms ago.          Another one, Ernst & Ernst v. Hockhelder in 1976were both situations in which the private litigantsattempted to create a cause of action to Rule 10(b)(5),which actually has an even broader source of statutoryauthority, and the Court rejected them because theycreated a cause of action that contained fewer elementsthan the statutory right of action, and I think that's agood analogy here.          QUESTION:  Is the same true of Rule 14?          MR. SUTTON:  Excuse me?          QUESTION:  The proxy rules, the statute and theproxy rules, is the same -- what you're saying now true --          MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, that, of course,is the Hagen case that you wrote for the Court in 1997 --          QUESTION:  Where I thought I --          MR. SUTTON:  Under Rule -- I want to make sureI'm answering your question.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. SUTTON:  Under Rule 14(e)(3) you've got a23 1    different statutory authorization of rulemaking power. 2    There, the operative language is that the agency can 3    promulgate rules that, quote, prevent the underlying 4    prohibition. 5              QUESTION:  But the rule, the regulation there, 6    the rule went beyond the statute.  It was kind of like a 7    prophylactic, and I don't know -- perhaps you can tell me 8    if there is any other instance of splitting the regulation 9    from the statute.  I mean, the private right of action,10    the 10(b)(5) action, the Rule 14 action, they're all11    wedded to a statutory text, and as far as I know there's12    no distinction between, oh, I'm bringing it under13    Rule 10(b) and not -- rather than the statute, or Rule 1414    rather than the statute.15              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, I couldn't agree more,16    and I don't think there is precedent for that point.  I17    mean, that, I think, is our main point, that if the case18    comes to court, we all know what Section 601 means, and19    that's why they have to characterize --20              QUESTION:  But that's on your argument that the21    regulation is invalid.  If the regulation is valid, then22    it seems to me we just decide Rule 14.23              MR. SUTTON:  But Your Honor, the implied right24    of action inquiry is an inquiry that goes really to the25    same question that you ask when you decide whether an241    agency rule is valid, and that's what did Congress mean,2    what did Congress authorize here, so it's true, if there's3    not an implied right of action it may make these4    regulations of dubious validity, but that's not5    necessarily true.  The Federal Government --6              QUESTION:  If I understand your argument, you're7    saying even the Federal Government couldn't bring this8 argument. 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SUTTON:  If the regulations are invalid,that's true.          QUESTION:  Well, your position is, they areinvalid, therefore the Government couldn't bring thisaction, either.          MR. SUTTON:  That -- it is our -- we do thinkthey're not valid, but I want to make clear, we thinkthat's a harder --          QUESTION:  You wouldn't need to worry about allthe argument about implied cause of action and all therest if the regulation's invalid.          MR. SUTTON:  Well, that is one way to proceed,and we've argued that they're not valid.  That is aneasier way to proceed.          QUESTION:  But that's not the question for whichwe took the case, and I'm assumingm and will assume thatthe regulations are valid.25 1              Now, are -- is it your position -- is it your 2    position that if the agency promulgated a regulation that 3    was an interpretive regulation which was not precluded by 4    our prior case law, namely, it didn't say that you don't 5    have to have intentional discrimination but it said, this 6    is what intentional discrimination consists of, and that 7    regulation is within the bounds of reasonableness that 8    would satisfy Chevron, is it your position that that 9    regulation also would not be able to be vindicated by a10    private right of action?11              MR. SUTTON:  That's a harder case, Your Honor,12    but the reason -- I think the way to look at it is, does13    the text unambiguously create this right.  If the text14    doesn't do it, I don't know how a rule can do it by --15              QUESTION:  Well, a text cannot -- you're -- a16    text cannot unambiguously create a right for the agency to17    issue a Chevron-based rule which is premised upon an18    ambiguity in the statute.  I mean --19              MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, you're right.  Let20 me --21              QUESTION:  The agency has no Chevron power22    unless there's an ambiguity in the statute, right?23              MR. SUTTON:  This question gets to the24    distinction between my first argument and my second.  When25    it comes to the creation of an implied right of action261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112    rebuttal.131415161718    please the Court:19              The petitioners in this case are proposing20    substantial changes in the law in a number of distinct21    areas.  First, they characterize this case as involving a22    fundamental change in Federal-State relations requiring a23    particularly clear and explicit statement that Congress24    intends to do that.  This is a classic Ex parte Young25    injunction.  It's an injunction against Mr. Alexander in27against the State, the Court has always said it's aboutwhat's in the text, so if the State is a defendant, then Istick with what I just said.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. SUTTON:  If it's a private party, city, orcounty, then I do not.          QUESTION:  It doesn't matter to you whether it'san interpretive rule or a substantive rule, you can'timply it against the State in a private right of action?MR. SUTTON:  That's exactly right.If I could reserve the rest of my time forQUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Sutton.Mr. Schnapper, we'll hear from you.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTSMR. SCHNAPPER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it1    his official capacity to restrain future violations of the2    law.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          This Court held in Will that is precisely thekind of remedy that is not --          QUESTION:  In what case, Mr. Schnapper?          MR. SCHNAPPER:  In Will v. Department ofCorrections, that that is precisely the kind oflegislation that does not fundamentally disturb Federal-State relations, and I think the whole line of cases sinceEx parte Young simply could not survive if that were thelaw.  Secondly --          QUESTION:  Well, that handles the EleventhAmendment argument, but it doesn't handle the SpendingClause argument, you know, the argument that anyconditions you're imposing upon the States under theSpending Clause have to be clear.          MR. SCHNAPPER:  I -- to which I'm about to turn.          They -- Mr. Sutton next suggests that therecannot be an implied cause of action in Spending Clauselegislation, that any cause of action in Spending Clauselegislation has to be explicit.  If that is right, Cannonand Guardians were wrongly decided.  They are SpendingClause legislation, Guardians is this very statute.  Theyboth recognize an implied cause of action, and that wholeline of cases would have to be overruled.28 1              QUESTION:  What was Cannon?  I thought that was2 Title VII. 3              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Title IX. 4              QUESTION:  Title IX? 5              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Title IX. 6              QUESTION:  So that's strictly Spending Clause? 7              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Strictly Spending Clause. 8              QUESTION:  In Cannon, Cannon did not involve the 9    regulation, right?  It involved -- that was a claim under10    the substantive standard itself, whether -- I think it was11 a statute.12              MR. SCHNAPPER:  The specific claim in Cannon was13    actually an effect claim.  The plaintiff was a woman who14    asserted that the university's practice of rejecting15    medical school applicants over a particular age had a16    discriminatory effect.17              QUESTION:  Right, but the university wasn't a18    State university, it was a private university.19              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes, I understand.  I20    understand.21 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Well, that's sort of crucial to yourSpending Clause argument, isn't it?          MR. SCHNAPPER:  It's not --          QUESTION:  I don't think our cases say that evenwhen you're using your Spending Clause power to give29 1    private individuals the rights to some Federal money you 2    have to be clear.  I thought we only have said that when 3    you're giving money to the States under the Spending 4    Clause you have to be clear. 5              MR. SCHNAPPER:  I'm about to turn to the State 6    issue, but I think a fair reading of the -- I think the 7    Spending Clause argument is, as they make it, would 8    encompass private defendants. 9              QUESTION:  Well, but the Spending Clause10    argument is, as I understand it, goes to the fact that11    you're trying to make a State a defendant, so Cannon can't12    be dispositive of that.13              MR. SCHNAPPER:  If the Spending Clause rules are14    limited in that fashion, then that would be correct.  I'm15    not -- but then there --16              QUESTION:  But I thought you said to accept the17    Spending Clause argument meant that Cannon had been18    wrongly decided.19              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Well, if you conclude, were to20    conclude that the Spending Clause limitations don't apply21    to private parties or to cities at all, then you -- then22    that problem would be solved, but the next problem would23    not, because this Court has been applying this implied24    cause of action to State defendants.  It did so in25    Bazemore v. Friday, and in Alexander v. Choate.  Those301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415    regulation.16              QUESTION:  So in other words, you're saying that17    if you take the silence -- this is -- I'm trying to follow18    the complicated -- if you take the silence, and if you --19    you either read the silence as a whole, just private20    rights of action against States and individuals for21    damages and injunctions, or you try to create epicycles,22    or split the atom, if you're going to split that atom of23    silence, and if you split it to distinguish between State24    and private defendants, then you should also split the25    State defendants to distinguish between injunctive actions31were classic Ex parte Young injunctions against Stateofficials, and the Court had no hesitation in applying it.          QUESTION:  Did it explicitly decide thequestion, or did it just assume it in those cases?          MR. SCHNAPPER:  I think it's fair to say that itassumed it, as have the lower courts for years.  I mean,this is an established part of the fabric of the law, andit has been for many years.          QUESTION:  Did either of those cases involveregulations as the immediate premise for the suit?MR. SCHNAPPER:  Both.QUESTION:  Both did?MR. SCHNAPPER:  In Bazemore we relied on a TitleVI regulation, and in Alexander we relied on a Section 5041    and damage actions.2              At least, that's what you'd have authority for3    under case law, because you have some cases, injunctions4    versus States, and you have other cases, damages versus5    private.678910111213141516    they?17MR. SCHNAPPER:  Right.QUESTION:  Is that right?MR. SCHNAPPER:  That is right.  In our view, theprovisions of the Eleventh Amendment and the sort ofpenumbra of the Eleventh Amendment issue in Will exhaustthe federalism problems that are applicable in a situationlike this, and when you get to an Ex parte Younginjunction that problem no longer exists.          QUESTION:  Mr. Schnapper, the two cases that yousaid did involve regulations, Bazemore and Alexander, wereMR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes.181920212223    case.24              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes.25              QUESTION:  Here we have a regulation that cannot32          QUESTION:  Did they involve a regulation thatcould not possibly have been an interpretive regulation?You see, I mean that's what's distinctive about this --MR. SCHNAPPER:  I --QUESTION:  That's what's distinctive about this 1    possibly represent the agency's view of what the statute, 2    601, requires, because we've said what 601 requires, and 3    it doesn't require this. 4              Now, did those, either of those two cases 5    involve that kind of a regulation? 6              MR. SCHNAPPER:  They did not.  They did not.  I 7    mean, there was an authoritative determination of what the 8    scope of the statute was in the context in which those 9    regulations were invoked.10              Petitioners have suggested that there can never11    be an implied cause of action to enforce a regulation, or12    I would have to say here as well a rule, because that's13    really where this has come up, that contains a prohibition14    not contained in the statute itself.15              This Court has done that on two occasions.  In16    Borak v. J.I. Case, which was decided shortly before the17    announcement of the adoption of this statute, the Court18    recognized an implied cause of action to enforce rule,19    part of Rule 14.  And then in the Superintendent of20    Insurance case 7 years later, the Court did the same thing21    with regard to Rule 10(b)(5).  Those were implied cause of22    actions to enforce --23              QUESTION:  Those were a long time ago, weren't24    they, Mr. Schnapper?25              MR. SCHNAPPER:  Yes, but the Court has continued                                  331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to recognize that cause of action.  In any event, thosedecisions reflected the standard for implying causes ofactions that were prevailing at the time the 1964 CivilRights Act was adopted and it's been the practice of thisCourt, in addressing the question of whether it wouldimply a cause of action, to look at the law that existedwhen the statute was adopted, on the presumption thatCongress would have intended whatever result would followfrom the then-prevailing law.          QUESTION:  Well, it would be '64 to '86.  Imean, you're relying to some extent on much lateramendments to the Act.  I mean, that's a substantial partof your case, isn't it?          MR. SCHNAPPER:  We have -- we think --          QUESTION:  And at least by the time thoseamendments were adopted, those earlier cases were subjectto considerable doubt.          MR. SCHNAPPER:  Right, but we think that animplied cause of action was appropriate under the '64 actas written.          QUESTION:  Without resort to the '86?          MR. SCHNAPPER:  Without resort to the '86 act.          Finally, with regard to the suggestion of thepetitioners, they urge quite specifically that aregulation cannot forbid action not forbidden by the34 1    statute itself.  The Court has addressed that question on 2    several occasions, in Morning v. Family Publications 3    Service with regard to the truth-in-lending law, and in 4    Gemsco v. Walling, a 1946 decision with regard to the 5    minimum wage. 6              Both cases involved prohibitions containing 7    regulations which clearly went beyond the language of the 8    statutes.  Both cases, they were upheld by this Court, and 9    Gemsco again was the prevailing law at the time the10    Congress authorized regulations in 602, so it seems to me11    that's appropriate to look to here.12              With regard to the argument regarding the13    limitations on the preconditions for certain actions under14    Section 602, this Court has addressed that question15    already in Cannon.  It's important to note here that16    Congress clearly intended that the limitations in Section17    602 on an agency action would apply in a discriminatory18    intent case.  Indeed, the -- that was a particular19    focus -- intentional commission was a particular focus in20 1964.21              The one thing that's certain is that Congress22    didn't intend to permit an agency to cut off a State23    agency or a city agency or a private entity from Federal24    funding without going through all the loops set up in25    Section 602.  That is to say, Section 602 applies even351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9where we're dealing with a Section 601 violation.          So the Court had that problem before it inCannon, and this very argument was made.  It was made inJustice White's dissent in Cannon.  It was made in JusticeWhite's opinion in Bakke.  It was made in Justice Powell'sdissent in Guardians.  It was made by the defendants --          QUESTION:  Which argument do you say was made?          MR. SCHNAPPER:  That -- I'm sorry.  That thenotice and predetermination clause of Section 602 would beevaded if you allowed a private cause of action, becauseprivate parties don't make those -- you know, can't, ordon't do those things.  That very argument was made in allthree cases and it's never been accepted by the Court,indeed, specifically was rejected by this Court.          QUESTION:  Well, but when you start talkingabout Guardians, to suggest that it hasn't been accepted,really nothing was accepted, nothing much was accepted inGuardians, there were so many different opinions.          MR. SCHNAPPER:  Well, with all -- am I          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. SCHNAPPER:  With all respect, there werethree different issues in Guardians, two of which wereclearly resolved, one of which was opaque.  The questionof whether there was an implied cause of action was361011121314151617181920    answering?21 22 23 24 25 1    clearly resolved.  There were six members of the Court who 2    ruled that there was.  The question of the validity of the 3    regs was expressly resolved.  Five members of the Court 4    addressed it and resolved it. 5              What was unresolved was the scope of the remedy 6    in one of those cases.  That was the issue. 7              QUESTION:  Yes, but the reasoning of the various 8    opinions was not identical.  In the cases where -- in 9    those cases where they did -- where there was a holding,10    there was not any majority-accepted reasoning.11              MR. SCHNAPPER:  I think the reasoning with12    regard to the first two issues I mentioned was perfectly13    consistent.14              QUESTION:  Well then, why were there different15    opinions?16171819202122232425          MR. SCHNAPPER:  Because the -- because therewere differing views as to the -- as to subsidiary -- asto other issues.  There was a difference about Section 601covered intent, which separated Justice White and JusticeMarshall from Justices Stevens, Brennan, and Black, sothey had to write different opinions.          Thank you.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schnapper.          General Waxman, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN                            371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425         ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES          GENERAL WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          For over 25 years, courts have affordedinjunctive relief against violations of Title VIregulations against State officials as well as otherpublic officials and private officials.  That practice isconsistent with the expectations of the Congress thatenacted Title VI, particularly considering the legal andsocial contexts that existed in 1964, and successiveCongresses have validated the private right of action.          QUESTION:  What social context existed in 1964?          GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, among other things, Mr.Chief Justice, the persistent practice of many localjurisdictions in evading the dictates of this Court and ofCongress with respect to a variety of civil rights issues,the most prominent one being --          QUESTION:  You're referring to what was -- whatvarious local jurisdictions were doing at the time?          GENERAL WAXMAN:  Yes, local and Statejurisdictions.  For example, the kind of thing thatprompted the Voting Rights Act of '65.          QUESTION:  Can you say anything about -- it's 35years, and you said in 35 years everyone has assumed thatthere is a private right of action for injunctive relief38 1    based on a regulation under Title VI, but have there only 2    been like one or two in 35 years, or have there been a 3    lot, or is this the first time it's come up, or the second4 time, or -- 5              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Are you talking about6 against -- 7              QUESTION:  You can say anything -- 8              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Against States, or generally 9    speaking, because the answer is yes --10              QUESTION:  Well, let's say against a11    governmental body, however you want to answer it.  I'm12    just trying to get an empirical idea of whether13    people really -- this really is embedded in the public14    mind or not.15              GENERAL WAXMAN:  I think that it is utterly16    embedded.  The cases, the decided cases are collected in17    Mr. -- in two appendices to Mr. Schnapper's brief, but18    with respect to States in particular -- I mean, let me19    speak first to the regulations issue and then to the20    States issue, which I take to be the State of Alabama's21    principal points.22              There is no case of which I am aware in which23    this Court has ever even suggested, much less held, that24    in determining the scope of a right of action, whether25    expressed or implied, that a distinction should be made39123456    issue.7between rights articulated in a statute itself, and rightsarticulated in substantive regulations that the statutemandates that the agency promulgate.                QUESTION:  Well, one --                GENERAL WAXMAN:  This is a separation of powers 9    look at it differently now would be this.  We have --10    since the statute was passed, we have taken a different11    and at least in the minds of some of us a more realistic12    view of the circumstances in which you really can in fact13    infer a congressional intent to provide -- to recognize a14    private right of action, so we're trying to preserve15    Congress' expectations with respect to the law that was16    passed under the earlier regime, but it's also sensible17    for us not to expand that earlier regime any further than18    it necessarily has to go based upon the precedent that the19    Congress might have assumed.20              GENERAL WAXMAN:  That's --21              QUESTION:  And therefore there may be a good22    reason simply because this is no longer the world of Case23    and Borak, to draw just the kind of distinction which you24    point out we never have drawn before, but which we have25    never recognized, which we have never precluded drawing40               QUESTION:  General, I may -- I think I agree8    with the proposition you start with, but one reason to1 before. 2              GENERAL WAXMAN:  I would like to make two 3    points, Justice Souter, in response to that observation, 4    with which I agree.  First of all, the implication of 5    drawing the kind of distinction that's been suggested here 6    has very, very broad ramifications beyond enforcement of 7    civil rights statutes. 8              If you look at the cases, either implied or 9    under 1983, in which private parties have sought to10    enforce against State agencies obligations under the11    medicare and medicaid statutes, those are regulatory12    obligations.13              The contemporary legal context in which Title VI14    and the other civil rights provisions of the '64 act were15    enacted, as this Court recognized in Cannon and, in16    particular, in then-Justice Rehnquist's separate opinion17    in Cannon, were enacted in a regime in which it was18    understood that legislative silence with respect to a19    statute that created substantive rights for the benefit of20    individuals would be enforced by the courts in an implied21    right of action, and that existed in regulatory cases.22    We've talked about Borak.  Merrill Lynch was decided23    somewhat later in 1982.  The --2425 States.QUESTION:  None of those, though, were against411 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well -- no, no, no.  It's quiteright that those weren't against States, and Mr. Schnapperhas cited some of the Title VI and Title IX cases thathave operated against States.  My only point ondistinguishing between regulations and statutes forpurpose of implying a right of action is that you will runinto this Court's decided case law under the medicare andmedicaid statutes whether under implied rights of actionor under 1983, the Wright, Wilder, Blessing --          QUESTION:  Were those regulations that you'reconcerned about regulations that plainly went beyond aninterpretation of the statute?          GENERAL WAXMAN:  They were --          QUESTION:  You see, I mean, that's what'sdistinct about this case.  In addition to the fact that itinvolves a State, you have a regulation that cannotpossibly be characterized as simply an agencyinterpretation of the statute.  Now, are the medicareregulations that you're talking about of that genre?          GENERAL WAXMAN:  I wish I were more expert inmedicare and medicaid regulations.  My understanding --          QUESTION:  I wish I were, too.          GENERAL WAXMAN:  If --          (Laughter.)          GENERAL WAXMAN:  I will gladly take guidance42 1    from you, Justice Scalia, on this, but I believe that 2    those statutes, like others in 1983 actions against State 3    officials, involved both substantive and interpretive 4    regulations and, of course, if you were going to draw a 5    distinction here, it would drive a wedge right through the 6    heart of this Court's cases, including Chrysler 7    Corporation v. Brown and Chevron, that hold that 8    substantive regulations that are mandated by statute have 9    the force of law.10              Let me go to the State point, the notion that11 States --12              QUESTION:  My only thought, they may have the13    force of law, but they may not have the force of the14    unequivocal for purposes of the Spending Clause.15              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, I don't think I can do16    better than simply to repeat what I -- the point I hope17    that I had made, which is, there is no case suggesting18    that for purposes of enforcing a Spending Clause19    obligation there is a distinction in recognizing a cause20    of action based on a statute, or on regulations that the21    funding agency is mandated to put forward.  The22    principle --23              QUESTION:  But there's no case suggesting that24    there isn't, either.  I mean, I think Justice Souter's25    point was that this is an area where there is no precise43 1    authority one way or the other. 2              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Correct.  What we have on our 3    side is, I believe, a completely unbroken practice of 4    enforcing obligations under both the Spending Clause and 5    otherwise equally, whether they arise within the four 6    corners of the statute, or under substantive regulations 7    that are mandated by the statute. 8              Now, I understand that this -- that our position 9    puts great weight on the validity of these regulations,10    but that point, as the court of appeals noted, was11    expressly conceded by the State below, and we don't think12    that it's at issue here.13              With respect to the implication of a, an implied14    private right of action against a State official, which15    was Mr. Sutton's first point, Mr. Schnapper cited some of16    the cases under Title VI and its cognate statutes, but I17    think it's also important to recognize not only the long18    line of 1983 cases, many of which enforce Spending Clause19    statutes and their regulations in injunctive action, but20    also the point that Justice Kennedy made in his dissent in21    Golden State Transit for himself and Justice O'Connor and22    the Chief Justice, which is that there may be instances in23    which a healthy disagreement may arise as to whether a24    particular provision of Federal law creates a right,25    privilege, or immunity, but when what is being sought is44 1    injunctive relief, prospective relief only against a State 2    official, the courts have long recognized a cause of 3    action under the Supremacy Clause, Sections 1331 and 2201, 4    including in Spending Clause cases which we have cited and 5    discussed probably too briefly in footnote 12 of our6 brief. 7              Cases like Blum v. Bacon and Lead-Deadwood are 8    Spending Clause cases -- Blum was, even involved a 9    regulation -- in which a suit was brought by a private10    party against the State official saying, look, the State11    has a policy.  It's reflected in a regulation or a statute12    that operates in a manner that's inconsistent with Federal13    law and therefore it is preempted, and the background14    principle, the principle of law, I respectfully submit,15    that Mr. Sutton is advocating runs directly contrary to16    the particular cases we cited under Title VI and its17    cognate statutes and 1983, but also this more underlying,18    long line of cases that includes but goes well beyond19    Spending Clause precedents.20              Our position fundamentally in this case is that21    for 25 years, it is true, Mr. Chief Justice, there is not22    a holding directly on point that says, you may have a23    private right of action to enforce the Title VI24    regulations, but there -- for 25 years at least there has25    been a shared understanding among the three branches,45 1    reflected in a unanimous set of, body of case law from the 2    federal courts, from successive congressional enactments. 3              In addition to the attorney's fees amendment, 4    the Rehabilitation Act amendments, and the Civil Rights 5    Restoration Act, Congress has enacted 11 cognate civil 6    rights statutes in which the funding agencies are 7    expressly directed to promulgate regulations patterned 8    after those under Title VI, all against a backdrop in 9    which, at least since Lau v. Nichols and running up to the10    present, implied rights of action against State public11    agencies and other public agencies have been adjudicated,12    and the executive branch across administrations -- I've13    pulled out briefs filed on behalf of the United States by14    my predecessors, Robert Bork and Rex Lee, explaining to15    the Court that the implied private right of action to16    enforce these cases, and I believe that the former one was17    in Alexander, which was a case against a State, are18    important for the -- an important complement to Federal19    enforcement officials.20              Our brief in Darrone said, quote, the award of21    individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted22    her own suit is not only sensible but is fully consistent23    with and, in some cases, even necessary to the orderly24    enforcement of the statute.25              If there are no further questions, we'll submit.461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Thank you, General Waxman.          Mr. Sutton, you have 3 minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. SUTTON:  A few brief points, Your Honor.  Interms of the question of what vantage point the Court usesin looking at this issue, there are many cases from theeighties and nineties where the Court has not looked tothe date on which the statute was enacted for determiningwhether it's an applied right of action.          Touche-Ross, involving the 1934 Securities Act,is the very same statute that Borak involved, and itdidn't look back in time.  It followed what the Court wasdoing at that point in time.  The true is -- the same istrue of Transamerica, California v. Sierra Club, andNorthwest Airlines.  Even Cannon itself applied the Courtv. Ash test which came 4 years after Title IX.          Now, as for the question whether Guardians hasresolved this, the last thing that Guardians resolved wasthe question of whether there was an applied right ofaction.  Even if one allowed for the counting of dissentsand plurality votes, you only had two justices agreeingthere was an implied private right of action in Guardians,so that surely was not decided there.          And the notion that pre-1983 there were settled                            471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425expectations on this point can't possibly be true.  Lookat Justice Marshall's opinion in Guardians.  Footnote 1identifies the split in lower court authority on the veryquestion the Court tried to resolve but didn't, so thatdoesn't seem possible.          As far as the preemption cases that the FederalGovernment is relying on, I think it's footnote 11 or 12in its brief, that's a very different issue.  The questionof whether a properly promulgated rule would preemptState law is one issue.  It's a second issue whether aprivate individual can enforce it.          I have no other points.  Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr. Sutton.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)48
