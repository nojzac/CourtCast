CLEMENT                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice, and may it please the Court:          The Solomon Amendment conditions the Federalfunding of educational institutions on receivingsomething that any donor would expect, the opportunityto recruit students educated at the fundedinstitutions.  That opportunity allows the military afair shot at recruiting the best and the brightest forthe military's critical and vital mission.          The Federal Government does not insist on anypredetermined level of access; rather, it simply askswhat other employers receive.  Likewise, the recipientschools remain free to criticize the military and itspolicies, and, of course, they remain free to declineFederal funds altogether.  As a result of thesecircumstances, the Solomon Amendment comports with boththe Constitution and with common sense.3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say that it asks2 what other employers receive, but these institutions, I3 gather, would not allow other employers, who have the4 same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to5 interview at their institutions. So, you're receiving6 what other employers in the same situation would7 receive.8 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think, Justice9 Scalia, that you have to look at the -- I think, the10 statute in two steps. One is, I think it's quite clear11 that it gives the military a right to gain access to12 campus as a condition, that it has -- that they have to13 gain access to campus in order to perform their14 military recruitment.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it says -- I16 thought it says that the military must have equal17 access with any other employer. Now, every other18 employer is subject to the same policy, presumably, of19 the law school.20 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice21 O'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in22 response to that. First of all, I think the Solomon23 Amendment itself is a recognition that the military is24 not like any other employer for purposes of its policy25 and its treatments of homosexuals. And I think that,4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 unlike any other employer, the military's policy is a2 result of a congressional mandate. And --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's fine, but you4 were the one that made the argument that they want the5 same access as other employers. That's --6 GENERAL CLEMENT: And what --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when you -- I just --8 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- what I would say --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- want to make sure what10 the calculus is, at the outset.11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and Justice Kennedy,12 I think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining13 access to campus, we want to gain access at a level,14 and under circumstances, that perhaps some other15 employer would be excluded. Well, once access is16 gained, then the question arose under the prior version17 of the statute, all right, if access is gained, what18 level of access suffices? And on that second-order19 question of what level of access suffices, then you20 look to what is provided to any other employer. And21 so, that's why, when I say that we don't ask for any22 predetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a23 year, we don't ask for entrance into the public-address24 system or the e-mail system. We simply say, "Once you25 let us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 opportunity to recruit on the same terms as others."2 And that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment3 that the military is competing for the same pool of4 students that the other employers are competing for.5 JUSTICE BREYER: The constitutional argument,6 I guess, is, "Does the Constitution require access --7 is -- does it permit a statute which says you have to8 give access to the military, when you wouldn't give9 access to any other employer?"10 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right,11 Justice Breyer.121314 --1516 it -- 171819 answer to20 does the -- what's the answer?21 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there's -- I mean,22 there's -- the Constitution is -- has no difficulty23 with such a statute. It is this statute. As I say,24 there's -- if you want to think about it being25 preferential entry into campus, and then, at that6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now --GENERAL CLEMENT:  And, of course, we take theJUSTICE BREYER:  So, then what you're saying,GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- position that --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and then what's thethat question, "Does the Constitution" -- how￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point, equal access on terms of the -- the terms thatare extended -- however you want to think about it,though, there's no difficult constitutional questionhere.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, your argument --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but it seems me you'vegot us off galloping in the wrong direction.  Thestatute doesn't require simply giving the same accessthat you give to other employers.  It requires muchmore than that.  It requires that they -- it prohibits,or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibitsor, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a militarydepartment from gaining access to campuses for purposesof military recruiting in a manner that is at leastequal in quality and scope to the access to campusesand to students that is provided to any other employer. So, it seems to me that the statute demands more thansimply you give the same access as all other employers. If you allow any other employer, you have to give itto the military in the same manner.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think that's right,Justice Scalia.  I'm -- and I'm sorry if I got us offon the wrong foot.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think there is this7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 debate -- 23 question,4 says, "Go5 was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a6 statute about universities in Vietnam not letting7 military people on campus. So, in the -- at the heart8 of the statute was a matter which was unique to theJUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but it is an importantbecause the -- there is an amicus brief thatread the statute."  And, really, the statute9 military. Now, this is a matter that isn't unique to10 the military. So, why not interpret the statute in the11 way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a12 difficult constitutional question?13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, a couple of points,14 Justice Breyer. I don't think there is a difficult15 constitutional question to be avoided here, and I'll16 get back to that whenever I can.1718 itself, I19 reference20 version of this, which conditioned only NASA's fund.21 The original starting point is probably about 1996,22 when the first version of the modern Solomon Amendment23 was introduced. And there have been a couple of24 iterations of it, but I think one important reference25 point is the version that was in force at the start of8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005As to the statutory-interpretation questionthink that in -- the proper frame ofhere is probably not the original 1969￼1 this litigation, and that's actually reproduced at page2 88(a) of the petition appendix in the District Court3 opinion. And if you look at that against 88(a) of the4 petition appendix, there would be no question that what5 is at stake here is access to the campus, and the6 amicus argument that's being raised is not even7 available; because the statute at that point is, I8 think, in fairness, materially identical, except for9 that last clause, which says "in a manner equal in10 scope to -- in character to that of any other11 institution." So, it's clear that when this litigation12 starts, there's no argument available to the amicus13 that the statute effectively accomplishes nothing.14 Now, what happens under this version of the15 statute is, a second-order question arises. Okay, the16 -- in order to comply with the Solomon Amendment,17 universities have to give access, they have to allow18 the military to gain entry and gain access to the19 students in the terms of the then-extant statute. The20 --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with one --22 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- brief question? Would24 that be true if the university didn't allow any access25 whatsoever to any employer?9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 GENERAL CLEMENT: As a regulatory matter, the2 military took the position that if they simply barred3 access to --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: No --5 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- anybody --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not the regulatory7 matter. The statute.8 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could read the9 statute either way on that question, Justice Stevens.10 They interpreted it to say that there was no equal --11 there is no obligation to give entry if no employer was12 on campus at that time.13 The other thing they interpreted in the14 statute as a regulatory matter, though, was this15 second-order question of, "All right, if they get some16 access, is unequal access enough?" And as a regulatory17 matter, they said, "No. We need access that is equal18 in character and scope to that provided to any other19 employer." And then what Congress did in the iteration20 of the statute that's at issue here, which is21 reproduced starting at page 185(a) of the petition22 appendix is they effectively codified and ratified that23 regulatory interpretation by adding the phrase "in a24 manner that is at least as equal in quality and scope25 to the access to campuses and to other students that is10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to -- provided to any other employer."2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General --3 GENERAL CLEMENT: But I think --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Clement, do I5 understand, with respect to that brief that offered a6 statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional7 question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable8 interpretation of the statute that we now have? And if9 we're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from10 the Vietnam days, that -- this would have been a highly11 academic question, because there weren't any such12 policies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.13 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, that's true, Justice14 Ginsburg. That's why I said, in response to Justice15 Breyer, that I think that the proper point to start to16 focus on is the -- these -- is the 1994 Solomon17 Amendment. And, at that point, there is a question18 about this policy. At that point, the American19 Association of Law Schools does have its recruiting20 policies beginning in place, and I think the provision21 has been amended a number of times in the years since22 1994. There have been changes in the scope of the23 funding that's covered. First, student-aid funds were24 put in, then they were taken out. And then, this is25 the most recent iteration of the provision.11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 There's no question that what's at issue here2 is more than just the Vietnam-era concerns about ROTC3 presence on statute, because that's addressed in a4 different subsection of the statute. That's addressed5 in 10 U.S.C. 983(a). So this provision, 10 90- -- 106 U.S.C. 983(b) is specifically addressed at the problem7 of access to campuses for recruiting. And, I think,8 especially when you read the statute in light of the9 relevant history of the prior administrative10 interpretation, and that being codified and ratified by11 Congress, it's very clear that this phrase "in a manner12 that is at least equal in quality and scope to the13 access provided to any other employer," is just that,14 it's a regulation of the manner of access, once access15 is granted. And it addresses this difficult question16 of, If you allow some entry and access onto campus,17 what level of access is sufficient? And so, I think18 that --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does Title X of the20 United States Code deal with?21 GENERAL CLEMENT: It deals with the military.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you chose to defend23 this principally on the basis of the Spending Clause,24 and not on the basis of what it -- what it was, seemed25 to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 congressional power to raise and support armies.2 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I3 think the statute is clearly supported under both4 provisions, under the spending authority and the5 Article I authority to raise and support armies. I6 think, in answering your question, we tended to focus7 on the fact that it was a spending condition, because8 we thought, under this Court's precedence, that made it9 an even more straightforward case. We certainly think10 it would be constitutional, even if it were a direct11 imposition, and we certainly think the fact that this12 is an exercise of Congress's undoubted authority to13 raise and support an army, is relevant to the14 constitutional analysis.15 And if I could move over to the16 constitutional question and address that for a minute,17 I think one of the arguments that's raised on the other18 side is that there's an interference with associational19 interests in this case, and I think there are other20 statutes that, frankly, have much more of an21 interference with a university's associational22 interest. I mean, Title VII, for example, regulates23 who can be members of the university. And I raise that24 also because another provision in Title -- in terms of25 this same area of the military, requires that there not13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 be discrimination against veterans in hiring and2 employment. And you could easily see that a university3 could take their position to its logical conclusion and4 say, "In order to show just how much we don't like the5 military's policy, we're not only going to not let6 military recruiters on campus, but we are going to not7 hire former military people, veterans, and we're not8 going to admit them to our classes." Now, who's in the9 classroom, and who's a member of the university --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would --11 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- seems --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- be rather farfetched.13 The pitch that's being made is an equality pitch, that14 we are teaching our students equality, the equal15 stature of all people. So, I think that your example16 does not fit --17 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice18 Ginsburg, I'm not sure I understand why not. It's the19 same idea. In order to teach equality, that there20 should be no discrimination against homosexuals, we're21 going to exclude, (a), military recruiters, and, while22 we're at it, the former military, as well, because they23 voluntarily joined the forces knowing that they had a24 discriminatory practice. It's no stretch of the25 imagination to think that the principle that's being14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 articulated by Respondents, would stretch well beyond2 simply a direct antidiscrimination motive.3 For example, NYU -- this is in the joint appendix,4 at page 153 -- NYU, for 3 years, had a policy of5 excluding recruiters from the State of Colorado, simply6 because Colorado had passed Amendment II, which this7 Court dealt with in the Romer case. And so, it's not a8 matter of saying that, "Well, you know, the only think9 that's at issue here is excluding employers that are,10 themselves, discriminatory." The free-speech interests11 that are articulated on the other side, would extend to12 any basis for criticizing the military, whether it was13 not liking the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, or14 the discriminatory hiring policies.15 I also think, with respect to the issue of16 discrimination, it's worth pointing out here that17 there's more than one way to understand whether or not18 the military's policy is discriminatory. Certainly19 respondents are entitled to view it as being20 discriminatory. But the Congress that mandates this21 same policy towards homosexuals, I think, is equally22 entitled to look at it and say, "No, there's no23 discrimination going on here, because you have to take24 into account the special role of the military."25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but even if you do 15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that, you're still left, it seems to me, with the2 problem -- whether you characterize the problem as3 discriminatory and antidiscriminatory university policy4 or not, you're still left with a speech problem that5 they raise, that, in effect, you are forcing them, in6 effect, to underwrite your speech, up to a point, and7 you are forcing them to change their own message.8 You're forcing them into hypocrisy, in one alternative.9 And those arguments don't depend upon the -- sort of,10 the discriminatory character of what may be at stake.11 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's exactly12 right Justice Souter, and I think those arguments would13 be the same even if what was going on here was a14 concern about the military's other policies. You would15 still have a concern that the military is being forced16 onto campus to make its own speech, and you would still17 have the concern that that interferes with the message18 --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, discrimination --20 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- the university --21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- or no discrimination,22 you've got a speech issue that you're going to address.23 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree. I mean, I think,24 ultimately, that cuts in our favor, because it shows25 that the other side's position is not limited to this16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 narrow context, but is a much broader first-amendment2 claim.3 Now, turning to that first-amendment claim, I4 think what's wrong with that claim is several things.5 I think, with respect to what the military itself6 wants, it simply does not want a -- primarily a speech7 activity to take place, it wants access for recruiting,8 which is a traditional commercial enterprise, it is an9 activity that is something that is regulated by Title10 VII in other Federal statutes. Sure, there may be some11 incidental speech involved in that, but primarily it is12 an instrumental activity designed to get --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It happens, in this case, to14 be specifically authorized by the Constitution.15 GENERAL CLEMENT: It does, indeed, Justice16 Scalia, and I think, though -- I mean, there is this17 sense in which we certainly concede that there maybe18 some incidental speech involved; certainly,19 military recruiters are engaged in speech. I'm --20 we're not sure that's really the relevant speech. But21 even the university itself --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're making a --23 if I understand what you're saying, you are making a24 kind of O'Brien argument that the -- that the burden on25 speech, whatever it may be, is an incidental burden to17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 something else. Well, that -- I think we have2 this line between recruiting, on the one hand,3 what the military wants to do, and the Solomon4 Amendment, on the other hand. As I understand5 Solomon Amendment is directed, or is responsive,6 entirely to positions taken by law schools on, among7 other things, first-amendment expressive grounds, so8 that if we are going to address the Solomon Amendment,9 I think we are addressing an exclusively first-10 amendment-speech expression issue.11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I12 guess -- I'm inferring that you're drawing that13 conclusion from some of the statements of some of the14 floor sponsors about their purposes enacting the15 Solomon Amendment. I mean, if you look at the text of16 the Act alone --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't --18 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I don't think --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- know of any other reason20 for the Solomon Amendment.21 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think the reason22 for the Solomon Amendment is to ensure that military23 recruiters, in fact, have an equal opportunity to24 recruit the same pool of individuals that all the other25 employers are trying --18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005to drawwhich isit, the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- to recruit.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they're -- but theSolomon Amendment, in order to accomplish that, isaddressed to a particular expressive problem whichoccurs for the military -- and for the law schools, forthat matter --  in law-school recruiting.  So, it seemsto me that -- for -- I mean, my only point is that theSolomon Amendment seems to have one objective.Whereas, the "don't burn your draft-card rule," inO'Brien, had two -- or had a -- let's say, had aprimarily nonspeech objective with an incidental-speechburden.  Here, the sole objective, in the real world,seems to be an expressive objective.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, if by -- "theexpressive objective" you're talking about is themilitary's own recruiting, I guess --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, this express --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- I agree with you.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the expressiveobjective is, the law schools are taking a position onfirst-amendment grounds.  That position is interferingwith military recruitment.  No question about it.  Idon't know how much, but I will assume that there is noquestion about it.  The Solomon Amendment is addressed19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 solely, as I understand it, at the expressive2 activities which have, as you say, this interference.3 Its sole objective is expressive.4 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I would disagree,5 Justice Souter. If the -- if the law schools were6 denying access to military recruiters, for any reason,7 be it a first-amendment reason that they'd say it's a8 first-amendment reason, or just because they couldn't9 be bothered, the Solomon Amendment would be written10 exactly the same way, which would say, "Look, the11 military has an opportunity to get onto campus, and,12 once it gets there, it ought to get the same basic13 opportunities as other employers."14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot convert a law15 into a law directed at the first -- at first-amendment16 rights, can you, by simply saying, "The reason I am17 disobeying it is to express -- whatever, disaffection18 with the war, my objection to homosexuality, or19 anything else -- or to homosexual discrimination -- or20 anything else"? Does that convert it to a law directed21 against the first amendment?22 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely not, Justice23 Scalia. And I would go further and say it's also not a24 problem, if, in the real world, the conduct that25 Congress sought to regulate was, in fact, in practice,20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425generated by first-amendment concerns.  I think thatdescribes O'Brien.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, in --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, let me ask anotherquestion that may shed a little light on it.  Does theSolomon Amendment pose any restrictions on the extentto which the law schools can distance themselves fromthe military's views?  Can there be signs up at everyrecruitment office, saying, "Our law school doesn'tagree with any discrimination against gays"?  I mean,can they come forward with their position on this inevery recruitment office without violation of theamendment?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Yes, they can, JusticeO'Connor.  I think they would be, in fairness -- I wantto be clear -- I think there might be a line wherethere would be -- the recruitment office could conductitself in a way that would effectively deny access.But I think, with that caveat, there is --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- nothing in the Act thatprevents the universities --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- from disclaiming --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- this question, to follow21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 up on Justice O'Connor's thought. Can -- are you2 saying that the school can engage in speech expressing3 its views about the military policies, can it engage in4 symbolic speech by affording access, which is equal in5 all functional requirements, but yet sends a message6 that they are really disagreeing with what's going on7 by, say -- let a law school say, "Well, for -- most8 employers will let you use the regular law-school9 placement facilities, but, for the military, we will10 require you use the college facilities to send a11 message that we disapprove, if the college facility is12 equally of -- good, as a matter of functioning"?13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I14 would say, to the -- I think, the main thrust of your15 question, no, which is to say that if what you have in16 mind is really forcing them to go to the undergraduate17 campus, I think the military would take the position18 that that's not equal in scope. Now, if there's a way,19 though --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not equal because21 of the message it sends or because it denies the22 opportunity to recruit as effectively?23 GENERAL CLEMENT: It's the latter, Justice24 Stevens, and only the latter --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if I had an example22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425where they were equal -- equally effective asrecruitment avenues.  Could they -- could they make themilitary take one that was equally effective, but itsent a message, "Well, we really don't like what you'redoing"?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I mean, my own --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sort of like aseparate-but-equal.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I mean --          [Laughter].          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- I guess I'm -- I'm          a little bit just because I'm not -- I thinkresistingit would depend on the --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, the --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- hypothetical.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- the point I'm trying tomake is, Does your agreement, that you can engage inspeech by posting banners or handing a note, apply tosymbolic speech --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  It could --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- the kind of conduct thatis symbolic speech?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  It could apply to somesymbolic speech, I believe.  It's just -- I'm having23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 trouble, because, in a practical matter, if you look at2 the record here, I think it's telling. If you look, at3 joint appendix, at pages 215 and 219, describes the4 real situation at Boston College. And they want to say5 that, "Well, it's not really much of an imposition on6 the military, because all you have to do is get the7 recruiting list from the reserve desk at the law8 library, and then go to" --9 1011 is a mile 121314 difference.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY:16 statute, I assume, could be justified as symbolic17 speech.18 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and I think -- I19 mean, I'm -- I think that some resistance by some parts20 of the university might be fine. I think if the21 recruiting office -- this is the caveat I tried to give22 Justice O'Connor -- if the recruiting office engages in23 conduct that effectively negates the access that24 they're providing, then I think you would have a25 different situation.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE STEVENS:GENERAL CLEMENT:and a half away.JUSTICE KENNEDY:JUSTICE STEVENS:No, that's a functional ---- the main campus, whichBut the --That's a functional-- the resistance to any￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, can you2 be affirmative now?

I would draw the line, though, at15 saying that they have to go to the undergraduate16 campus, because I think, as a practical matter --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean, they could18 organize a student protest at the hiring interview19 rooms, so that everybody jeers when the applicant comes20 in the door and the school could organize that?2122232425 fair, andGENERAL CLEMENT:  The school could --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As -- when it's --GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- organize --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- when it's, say, a joball the employers are there, but then they25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425jeer just the -- and the school organizes a linejeering the -- both the recruiters and the applicants,that's equal access?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think that would be equalaccess.  I think you have to draw a practical line --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm surprised that --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- here between --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- you think that --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- between access andallowing the speech, but I think it -- you have to be - -          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not going to be anArmy recruiter, are you?[Laughter.]          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think the militaryand the Army recruiters -- and I -- and I won't be oneof them -- but I think the Army recruiters are notworried about being confronted with speech, they'reworried about actually not being allowed onto the samelaw schools --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're worried about havingstudents driven off.  And if you have jeering andpicketing, do you really think that that fulfills thepurposes of this amendment?26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't know if it wouldfulfill every purpose, but I think the amendment has toaccommodate the first-amendment  --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You think if you --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- interests at --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- have jeering --          GENERAL CLEMENT:  -- a university.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- jeering and picketing ifa black person came to recruit and people didn't -- anda school faculty didn't like blacks?          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I think that would --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think that that's anextraordinary position you're taking.          GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, but, Justice Kennedy,I think you have to distinguish what the Constitutionwould allow the Governmentdoes, which is to say -- Iis a --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:          GENERAL CLEMENT:          JUSTICE KENNEDY:meaning of "equal access."          GENERAL CLEMENT:to do and what this statutemean, what you have in mind We're talking -- -- race example -- -- about the practical                            Right, but in -- thepractical meaning has to turn on the statute at issue.And Title VI, for example, in the race context, 27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425forbids all discrimination because of race.  And so,some of the conduct that you have in mind may wellviolate that statute.  And if Congress wants to write adifferent statute that provides more rights to themilitary, we would be here defending it as valid first-amendment legislation.  But this statute gives, not aright to be free of any discrimination, but a right toequal access.  And we think that the right way to framethat inquiry is say, "Access, yes, but be respectful ofspeech."          And the last thing I would say, if I couldreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, is simplythat it's worth remembering that the recruiting officeis not the heart of first-amendment activity on campus. And if the recruiting office acts in a way thatensures access, and the rest of the university engagesin speech, that's a common sense way to accommodate theinterest of the military recruiters and the firstamendment.          If I may reserve.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.          Mr. Rosenkranz, we'll hear now from you.         ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ                ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSMR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. 28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:2 This case is not about whether military3 recruiters will be barred at the campus gates.4 Congress had a law on the books that guaranteed entry5 to campus, but that was not what Congress really6 wanted. So, it passed a new law. What Congress really7 wants is to squelch even the most symbolic elements of8 the law schools' resistance to disseminating the9 military's message, which is why it gave us the current10 version of the statute. The current version isolates11 for regulation the most communicative aspects of the12 law schools' resistance. The law schools --13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's --14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- -- are saying --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, but the16 most communicative aspect is saying what you think17 about a particular policy. This is conduct, denying18 access to the military recruiters.19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this is a20 refusal to disseminate the messages of the military21 recruiters. It is a refusal to send e-mails, post22 bulletins, and make arrangements for mutual exchange of23 ideas. It is "conduct" only in the sense that they are24 moving molecules, but it's speech that they are being25 forced to engage in. And I have to emphasize, this29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case is not about entry.  The Solomon Amendment doesnot require schools to give entry to militaryrecruiters, it requires them to give entry to arecruiter only if they provide entry to some --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no that --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- other employer.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if you had apolicy that, "We're going to deny any employer thatuses tanks," do you think that would pass muster underthe Solomon Amendment?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, for apacifist religious institution, absolutely.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about Yale LawSchool?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, because it has nomorally-based, conscious-driven reason for refusing todisseminate that message.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, where do you find that? In -- it has to be a morally-based, conscience-driven--          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought we were talkingabout freedom of speech, not the religion clauses.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, what I'msaying is, under the -- under this Court's30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425jurisprudence in the first amendment, it's actuallyrelevant whether the reason for refusing to disseminatethe message lies at the heart of the first amendment.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, is -- what aboutHurley?  Is there something deeply moral or conscience-driven about the position to exclude the gay-rightscontingent in the parade, in Hurley?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, it wascertainly a reason that they gave, and it was basedupon a political view of the legitimacy ofhomosexuality.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So, you're --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But I hasten to add, I'm notarguing that that is a required element of a compelled-speech claim.  I'm simply arguing that when someone hasa reason for resisting disseminating a message, thatsituates it further -- closer to the heart of the firstamendment.  Congress came back, after it --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- had a --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Excuse me, that -- Iunderstand that, so far as the associational claim maygo.  But so far as the speech claims may go, I don'tunderstand it.MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I -- 31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: I can say, or refuse to say,2 anything I want to, for any reason I want to, however3 bad that reason, however nonmoral that reason is. And4 I don't see how, in the speech -- on the speech claims,5 we get into moral basis at all.6 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I accept that as7 a proposition of the compelled-speech doctrine,8 absolutely. And what I'm trying to point out is that9 in this case what Congress has done is to engage in the10 most viewpoint-oriented regulation of speech. The11 reason Congress does not -- the reason Congress is12 insisting that the law schools disseminate the13 recruiting messages is because of the message of the14 law --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't --16 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- schools themselves --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it doesn't insist18 --19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- in providing --20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't insist21 that you do anything. It says that, "If you want our22 money, you have to let our recruiters on campus."23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and, under24 the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, the25 analysis is exactly the same.32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under -- what about2 South Dakota against Dole? South Dakota had a3 constitutional right, under the twenty-first amendment,4 to set whatever drinking age it wanted, and yet we5 upheld the Spending Clause condition that if they6 accepted Federal funds, they had to set their drinking7 age at 21.8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. And in9 subsequent cases -- and, in fact, in Dole itself --10 this Court pointed out that all bets are off when there11 is a superseding constitutional right. Here, we're12 talking about the Bill of Rights and the first13 amendment. I mean, Rosenberger and Rust --1415 -- in the 1617 interest, 181920212223 what is, for all intents and purposes, "conduct" can be24 infused by the school, at its option, with a first-25 amendment quality. Yet your argument would allowCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's the right toConstitution, to raise a military.MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, that is a Governmentfor sure.

ROSENKRANZ:  Absolutely not, Your Honor,because --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why not?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- because --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's the point?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- what the law schools areengaging in --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's an express -- it's an-- it's solely for an expressive purpose.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, there's adifference between refusing to abide by a universallyapplicable regulation of conduct, on the one hand, andthe Solomon on -- Amendment, on the other hand, whichis refusing to assist the dissemination of a message.Recruiting is all about speech.  Yes --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- it has --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you do about the --about the cases where we have required colleges toallow some student activities to put forward theirviews on campus, when other student activities areallowed to do that?  It seems to me that that flatlycontradicts the proposition that when you compel aninstitution to permit somebody else to speak, you are34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 violating that institution's first-amendment rights.2 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that is3 for public schools, and public schools are subject to4 the first-amendment rights of those who want to enter5 their forum. But there is a critical difference6 between that forum, Your Honor, which the schools7 opened up to everyone, and the forums in career8 services, which the schools filter on the basis of one9 very important --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, Mr. Rosenkranz,11 isn't the -- I thought the distinction was that in12 determining the forum for recruiting, the university is13 speaking. The university isn't creating a forum from a14 lot -- for a lot of third parties; it's speaking,15 itself. And I understand the essence of your claim to16 be that its speech is being affected, either by being17 mixed with something it doesn't want to say or by18 being, in19 something2021 to keep in mind that there are two messages going on22 here, and they are clashing. There is the military's23 message, which the schools are interpreting as, "Uncle24 Sam does not want you," and there is the school'seffect, forced to support it doesn't --it does not want to say.MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it's important25 message, which is, "We do not abet those who 35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425discriminate.  That is immoral."  And --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you would take, Mr.Rosenkranz, that same position.  If this was notspecial to law faculties -- I mean, we're told that therecruiters could go to the main campus; most of theseplaces, the restriction is limited to the lawfaculties.  Suppose it was universitywide policy thatwe do not give equal access to military recruiters.  Ithink your argument says it doesn't matter if it'sspecial to the law school or the whole university.  DoI understand it correctly?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  If theuniversity had such a policy, then the university wouldbe able to enforce it.  But I hasten to add --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so for members --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- the university --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- for medical schools, wecan't get medical schools for our Armed Forces -- chaplains, the same way, because it -- schoolteachers who teach on military bases -- in order to make the point.          MR.

ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So, how is the messageaffected --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- in that environment?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- let me answer in twoparts.  First, of course, under the compelled-speechcases, the ability to protest the forced message isnever a cure for compelled-speech violation, but --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- what's going on --37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, but, oncompelled speech, nobody thinks that these -- lawschool is speaking through those employers who comeonto its campus for recruitment.  Everybody knows thatthose are the employers.  Nobody thinks the law schoolbelieves everything that the employers are doing orsaying.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's correct, Your Honor,but, again, endorsement is also not an element ofcompelled-speech claim.  But let me -- let me bringthose two questions together on a factual point.  Thelaw schools are disseminating a message that theybelieve it is immoral to abet discrimination.  When --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- they --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- they can say that toevery student who enters the room.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And when they do it, YourHonor, the answer of the students is, "We don't believeyou.  We read your message as being that there are twotiers.  There's a" --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, there are --          MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- "double standard" --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- students --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The reason they don't38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 believe you is because you're willing to take the2 money. What you're saying is, "This is a message" --3 [Laughter.]4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- "we believe in5 strongly, but we don't believe in it, to the tune of6 $100 million."7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's right, Your Honor.8 And the problem with this Solomon Amendment is that the9 unconstitutional-conditions doctrine says that you10 can't put a private speaker to that crisis of11 conscience.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I have13 one thing straight? The content of the compelled14 speech, as I understand it, is you're aiding in the15 recruitment of the Armed Forces, right?16 17 18 1920 compelled21 statute saying, "University, you must allow our people22 on campus to recruit," and they some -- for some23 reason, didn't want to help. But that would have been24 a violation of the first amendment of the school if25 there were no other debate, just they didn't want the39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's correct --JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so, it --MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- Your Honor.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- would still have beenspeech if, 25 years ago, Congress passed a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Army on because they had to provide facilities thatwould aid recruitment.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  If it was-- certainly, if it was against their conscience to doso --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that it would haveviolated the first amendment during World War II whenthe -- whenever they are trying to raise an army, ifthey had compelled an unwilling university to providerecruitment facilities to the military.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, yes, Your Honor,unless there is a compelling need.  And the difficultywith the Solomon Amendment --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, that be compelledspeech, though, in your view.  That's the kind ofspeech we're talking about, anything that helps themilitary raise an army.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Anything that -- notanything that helps the military raise an army; anycommunication that a school is required to engage in.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, why isn't --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that the point?  Imean, your point is not that -- as I understand, that,for any reason, if the -- if the university, for any40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 reason, during World War II, had excluded recruiters,2 and there had been the equivalent of the Solomon3 Amendment, that there would have been a first-amendment4 problem. As I -- is -- maybe I don't understand your5 argument, but I thought your argument was, or is, that6 if they do it for some purpose of conscience, which7 implies a message -- e.g., if it is a pacifist college8 -- there would be a first-amendment problem. But if9 they're doing it simply because space is short and they10 would rather provide one more biology classroom, there11 wouldn't be a first-amendment problem, World War II or12 today, would there?13 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is absolutely right --14 correct, Justice Souter, which is why I answered your15 very early question with --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you --17 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- an answer that is --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- are saying that --19 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- by conscience --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that every time somebody21 gives as his reason for violating a law that he wants22 to send a 232425 amendmentmessage that he disagrees with that law --MR.

ROSENKRANZ:  -- someone says that as areason for refusing to host a message of an unwelcomemessenger, that's a compelled-speech violation.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, in fact, to be clear,you also think schools that are angry at the militarybecause they're too favorable to gays in the military,they havethe same right.MR.

I hope there are3 not too many --4 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but there might, and6 those people all have the same right.7 MR.

ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the problem with21 the Solomon Amendment is that the Government is22 demanding absolute parity. We have a statute before us23 that demands exactly the same services, without regard24 to whether the military actually needs them. In order25 for Congress to justify the parity requirement, which43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is the only statute before this Court, Congress has tostate a need.  It has to say why it needs what --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Here's a need.  How aboutthis? We have said in our opinions -- and I am quotingfrom Rostker versus Goldberg -- "Judicial deference isat its apogee when legislative action under thecongressional authority to raise and support armies andmake rules and regulations for their governance ischallenged."  And that's precisely what we have here.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, this Courtdefers to Congress, in matters of the military, whenthe military or the Congress is especially expert andthis Court is especially naive.  This Court has neverdeferred to a congressional statute about military when--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it has to dowith expertise.  I think it has to do with immensenational importance.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it has to dowith expertise, as well.  That's precisely what thisCourt --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But I would --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- said in Rostker.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I would like the answerto my question, because I'm thinking, as you correctly 44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425say, if you have that right, so do all the worsesegregationists you can imagine, et cetera.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  And the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And here -- yes, and herethere is a need of some kind to get the military in.And what the Government in this statute asks you --because I, personally, couldn't find anything in therecord that finds that student who thinks, by lettingthe military person in, that that school, whichbasically is completely against the military in thisarea, suddenly becomes for it.  And I haven't evenfound in the record an instance where there was arecruiter who told people that they couldn't join themilitary if they were gay.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So, we have not a tremendousdemonstration there of a need on the university side.And my question was, What's wrong with the Governmentsaying, "University, you disapprove of what we do.  Theremedy for such a situation is not less speech, it ismore speech."          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Go and explain it.          MR.last questionROSENKRANZ:  -- the direct answer to thatis that all bets are off when what the45Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400￼1 Government is doing is compelling the speech of a2 private actor, because the Government is not allowed --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it compel the speech4 of a private actor when the Government says, "Colleges5 and Universities, you are not going to get Federal6 money if you discriminate on grounds of race or gender.7 And we don't care what your private attitude may be,8 we will refuse to contract, we will debar you from9 future contracts, if you don't -- not only say, 'We10 won't discriminate,' but have an affirmative action11 plan." You know that is not hypothetical. This was12 the U.S. policy in the early '70s.13 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Your Honor. I14 understand the hypothetical, at least -- especially as15 to the first half, which links to Justice Breyer's16 earlier question. There is an enormous difference,17 under this Court's jurisprudence, between18 antidiscrimination laws and the sort of law we have19 here, the Solomon Amendment. And the difference is,20 the Government -- it is both on the need side and on21 the infringement side. On the need side, the22 Government has a compelling interest that is different23 from just regulating the conduct. The compelling24 interest that the Government has is a completely25 separate interest in seeing to it that not a penny of46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Federal money ever goes to support an institution that2 taxpayers3 Bob Jones45 said, that the act of discriminating against6 individuals is entitled to no first-amendment7 protection, regardless of whether there's a first-8 amendment right at stake. And I should add, also, that9 the vast majority of schools that are subject to Titlewould not be in a position to go to.  That'sand Norwood.And, on the infringement side, this Court has10 VI or to Title IX have no such expression that is at11 stake. They are not articulating a message, "We really12 need to discriminate on the basis of race or on the13 basis of gender."14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, could you15 tell me which elements of your argument rest upon16 compelled actual speech and which rest upon compelled17 symbolic speech? Because the latter, I have to tell18 you, I'm not very fond of. What compelled actual19 speech is imposed on the -- you mentioned something20 about e-mails, they have to send e-mails to say where21 the recruiter will be located --22 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is that the compelled24 speech you're25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400worried about?ROSENKRANZ:  It is -- Your Honor, it is47Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the forced hosting of a messenger-based decision --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's symbolicspeech. I'm talking about actual speech. What expression is the university -- real, you know, words - - words -- is the --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, but --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- university --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- with the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- compelled to utter bythis legislation?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Under the parityrequirement, what the university is compelled to do issit down with the employers and help counsel them onwhat their students are interested in and how best toshape the message.  The Third Circuit went out of itsway to point out that, and the National Association forLaw Placement brief is very compelling on that.  Theyalso have to disseminate literature, post bulletins onbulletin boards, help the recruiter -- or, excuse me,the law firm develop cocktail parties --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I suppose when you --when the police knock at the door and say, you know, "Ihave a warrant," I suppose somebody has to say, "Comein."  Is that          MR.compelled speech?  Does that --ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, there are --48Alderson Reporting Company1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does that -- does that raisea first-amendment problem?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  It does not.  And there aremany circumstances in which words are used that areincidental to an action.  These are not words used thatare incidental to the action.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's happening here isthe perspective employers, the recruiters, areproposing a commercial transaction.  And it seems to mequite a simple matter for the law schools to have adisclaimer on all of their e-mails and advertisementsthat say, "The law school does not approve -- and, infact, disapproves -- of the policies of some of theemployers who you will meet."          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the end of it.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- no matter what theGovernment does, it cannot convert the career-servicesenterprise into a value-neutral proposition.  For the lawschool, from its perspective, it's especially value-driven.  Yes, the --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do law schools have aninterest in the Constitution that other people don't?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm not claimingany exceptionalism for the law schools.  The AAUP brief49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425does --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Well, I --MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- a brilliant job --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- I suppose, under yourview, law schools really shouldn't permit firms -- lawfirms on campus if those firms, say, oppose -- takelitigation positions opposing gay marriage.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, as Dale pointsout, it's up to the private institution to decide whatits metrics --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- are going to be.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's your position.  Yourposition is, the schools could, and probably should, dothat to make their message known.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  My position, Your Honor, isthat the schools are entitled to make their ownjudgments about what messages they will disseminate.And even --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Dale is -- Dale --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even with reference tocommercial -- proposed commercial transactions?          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  But, Iwould hasten to add, that is not what recruiters aredoing.  It is no more commercial than what United Foods50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 was doing in an -- advertising, saying -- or resisting2 the message, "Mushrooms are good."3 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree with the4 Government, that the statute, as fairly interpreted, is5 violated when a school which uniformly applies to all6 employers the rule, "You can't come in if you have the7 discrimination against hiring gay people"?8 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that it is10 violated.11 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The12 statute focuses on the manner of providing access; and13 the manner of providing access is through the career-14 services --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you require any16 accommodation -- I mean, you have said, "It's up to the17 faculty to choose which causes to assist" -- I think18 you put it that way, or one of the amici did -- "and19 which to resist." And you've already told me that this20 happens to be the law school, could be the whole21 university. Could the law faculty, or the university,22 take the position, "We're not going to -- we don't like23 your message, and we are not going to let you have any24 of our facilities. We're not going give you the room25 on the main campus. Just a total bar"?51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, we're certainly2 not advancing that position here. The Solomon3 Amendment requires no such thing. The Solomon4 Amendment does not require that schools give entry to5 military personnel.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but a school --7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It says you must do it only8 if the other guy does it.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a school, as a matter10 of its own policy says, "We don't like discrimination,11 and we're not going to give discriminators access to12 any of our facilities, period."13               MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, are -- you're               what I would be arguing for my clients if               actually making --               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm asking --               MR.

ROSENKRANZ:  -- were a judge --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- is the -- if itlogically follows, from your position, about "choosingthe causes we resist and the ones that we assist."MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, if I were advancing that argument, it would be, this is a viewpoint-discriminatory statute which is subject to strict scrutiny. The Government is advancing a single message, and, even when the first-amendment rights that are at stake are minimal under this Court's opinion in R.A.V., strict scrutiny would apply. The Government has never come forward which a shred of evidence that it actually needs to be on campus, as opposed to directly off campus, or as opposed to publishing notices in student publications, or advertizing. But - -          JUSTICE STEVENS:  When you --          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- we are not advancing --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- were talking about --          MR.

ROSENKRANZ: The compelling interest on10 the Government's side is the recruitment interest.11 We're not arguing that the Government has a compelling12 interest in excluding anyone. That's precisely why --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, are you --14 MR. ROSENKRANZ: -- the law --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- are you saying that the16 Government -- that the only compelling-interest17 argument that the Government can raise here is the18 discriminatory argument? Since nobody denies that, if19 the Government were recruiting without the20 discrimination, that there would -- there would --21 there would be no problem with it. Everyone would22 agree with -- that that was a compelling --23 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- interest. But, I thought25 your argument on compelling interest was that the only55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425compelling interest that the Government can assert isthe discriminatory interest.          MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, what I'msaying is, if the Government wants to assert a need, ithas to identify the need.  It has to say, "We need morethan contact information.  We need more than a room --entry to campus -- a room on campus, a posting on abulletin board.  We need everything."          The story of the Solomon Amendment, YourHonor, is the story of private institutions tryingdesperately to accommodate the Government's need, evenin light of their own moral scruples.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the speech is on theirside.  The Government just says, "Let our recruitersin."  So, why isn't it sort of like, "Pay the propertytax"?  "I don't want to.  I hate the government."          MR.

ROSENKRANZ:  The message that the schoolsare hearing is, "Join the Army, but not if you're gay." And the schools have been trying desperately toaccommodate the Government, up until the point whereCongress says, "We don't actually want any of thosethings.  We want them only if you supply them tosomeone else.  We want them only if you have viewpoint-based reason that you don't want to give it to us."There's some reason in the law school's conscience, orthe academic institution's conscience, that it wants totreat this category of employers differently from anyother.

Does it necessarily follow, if4 there are occasional applications of this statute that5 might be invalid, that the whole Solomon Amendment6 needs to be struck down?7 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the -- this is8 not about application of the statute in one9 circumstance. The whole statute has to be struck down,10 because the Government is demanding absolute parity and11 there's no way for this Court to rewrite the statute.12 We don't know whether Congress would go back and go to13 the entry requirement, just bear entry, to entry-plus,14 or to a parity requirement, which is -- which it has15 now shifted to. So, there is simply no way to know16 exactly how Congress would rewrite the statute. But17 this is, at its heart, an as-applied challenge. It's18 about law 192021schools with nondiscrimination policies.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you --MR. ROSENKRANZ:   Thank you --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- Counsel.22 2324 have 4 minutes remaining.25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENTMR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- Your Honors.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General Clement, you60Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS2 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief3 Justice. I'd like to make just a few points in4 rebuttal.5 First of all, in starting with the compelled-6 speech problem, there are only two kinds of speech that7 are at issue here. First, there is the compelled8 speech of the military recruiters. And no one thinks9 that that speech is being misattributed to the schools.10 Even in the secondary-school context, in Mergens, this11 Court understood that secondary students could12 distinguish between the school's message and that of13 school groups.14 Now, the second piece of speech that's at15 issue is that of the university, when they incidentally16 send an e-mail around telling the students where the17 military recruiters are going to be on a certain day.18 And certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind19 of incidental speech does not implicate any compelled-20 speech doctrine. In the Title VII context, for21 example, if an employer says that there's a job22 opening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to23 say the same thing to an African-American applicant.24 Nobody would think that that other -- saying that to25 the African-American applicant, which is, of course,61Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 compelled speech by Title VII, violates the2 Constitution.3 I would also say, just as the last point on4 compelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in5 a strange land in the context of this case, since we6 are talking about a funding condition, not a7 compulsion.8 Second, let me move to the argument that the9 Respondents have about trying to distinguish this case10 from Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical. And,11 as I understand it, it boils down to the argument that12 the way that the legislature was reacting here to this13 problem and observing what it observed on campus14 somehow implicates different constitutional issues,15 different first-amendment issues. And I think the16 O'Brien case stands as an obstacle to that argument.17 In that case, if you look at it, the argument was18 exactly the same. There already was a prohibition that19 required you to have your draft card with you.20 Congress then passed a second statute that prohibited21 burning your draft card.22 Now, what did the Representatives say about23 that? Well, Representative Bray, of Indiana, said that24 this was an effort to get at "communist stooges and25 beatniks." Now, this Court did not strike the statute 62Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 down on that basis. It looked at the text of the2 statute and upheld the statute as a reasonable statute.3 Let me also, then, move to what you could4 call the "Bob Jones problem." And I think you have to5 have be cautious about interpreting this statute in6 applying a rule and having it come back in the context7 of other statutes that even the law schools like, like8 Title VI and Title IX. I don't think it's enough to9 simply say that race is going to be different. For one10 thing, Federal statutes also prohibit, as a condition11 on funding, universitywide discrimination on the basis12 of disability and on the basis of age. Now, those13 aren't things that trigger heightened scrutiny, and I14 think one has to be worried about converting this rule15 in this case to something that's going to threaten16 those statutes.17 This Court, in Hishon, for example, made the18 point that all discrimination can be recharacterized as19 somebody simply saying -- exercising their20 associational rights, "I don't want to associate with21 you, because you're female," in Hishon. You have to be22 leery of that kind of recharacterization.23 The last point I would make is that there's24 simply no limit on Respondent's argument in this case.25 I don't think their matter of conscious limitation is63Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 going to be enforceable by the courts. And, beyond2 that, I think, even in this case, there is more at3 issue here than just the military's policy on4 homosexuals. If you look at the original statement of5 the American Association of Law Schools -- which is in6 the joint appendix at 246 and 249 -- they were7 concerned, first and foremost, about the military's8 policies on homosexuals, but also about the9 discrimination in sex, on what kind of combat roles10 that women could have, what they call career-advancing11 positions. So, even if Congress changed "don't ask,12 don't tell" tomorrow, the -- presumably, the law13 schools would still be here protesting the military's14 position on gender, or perhaps the war in Iraq, or15 perhaps the war in Afghanistan.16 And the last point in showing there is no17 limits on their position is, as Justice Kennedy pointed18 out, any conduct can be imbued with communicative force19 just by saying, "We're opposed to this, and, therefore,20 we're going to engage in this conduct." That's simply21 not enough to generate a significant first-amendment22 interest.23 24 25Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.The case is submitted.64Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400          [Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]65Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
