On page 13 of itsbrief in opposition to certiorari, Milford concedes thatState law, the same State law at issue in Lamb's Chapel,requires it to censor petitioner's speech from its broadcommunity forums at all times, to all audiences becausethey had a religious purpose.  This Court rejected such anargument in Lamb's Chapel.  It should reject it in thiscase as well.  The Second Circuit circumvented thisCourt's decision in Lamb's Chapel by resurrecting adistinction that this Court buried in Widmar.  Adistinction between constitutionally-protected speech andunconstitutionally-protected religious worship and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MARCELLE:  Yes, Your Honor, quiteextensively, and dissent as well said, Judge Jacobs saidthe case couldn't be squared with Lamb's Chapel.          QUESTION:  Lamb's Chapel, if I'm correct, is noteven cited in the Second Circuit's opinion, is that right?          MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Isn't even mentioned?          MR. MARCELLE:  Isn't even mentioned.  And Ithink the way they got around Lamb's Chapel, Your Honor,was really by embracing a distinction that this Courtrejected in Rosenberger, a distinction --          QUESTION:  I assume that the judge who wrote theopinion for the Second Circuit was aware of Lamb's Chapel,not just because you cited it, but because it had reversedan earlier decision of his, isn't that right?          MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct, Your Honor. Hewas the author of Lamb's Chapel that this Court reversed.And I think the way --          QUESTION:  Mr. Marcelle, could you clarify forus the nature of the right that you are asserting.  Now,could the school district say we are not going to allowaccess to any groups in off-school hours?          MR. MARCELLE:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  And you contend that the school has,instead of doing that, opened a limited public forum4         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    allowing some groups to use the school in off hours? 2              MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 3              QUESTION:  Could the school say only hours after4 6 p.m.? 5              MR. MARCELLE:  Your Honor, yes, they -- 6              QUESTION:  And only certain days a week? 7              MR. MARCELLE:  Yes, Your Honor.  They have broad 8    discretion, the school board -- 9              QUESTION:  You're just seeking equal access on10    the same terms that the school offers it to other groups11    to benefit the welfare of the community, is that the idea?12              MR. MARCELLE:  Exactly, Justice O'Connor. We're13    not asking for unique access, just equal access.14              QUESTION:  What if a church asks for privilege15    to conduct church services once a week during the hours16    the school allows?17              MR. MARCELLE:  Because, Your Honor, Milford has18    chosen to create a forum that it's probably the broadest19    possible forum you could create, the uses that pertain to20    the welfare of the community under this policy, I think21    they would a Mass, or a church service would qualify, but22    of course, they have the power and the discretion.23              QUESTION:  So if one of the local churches came24    in and said we'd like to use it one day a week to conduct25    our regular services, that would have to be granted as5               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    well, if it fell on a day and an hour when the school said2 it was open?3              MR. MARCELLE:  Yes, Your Honor, under this4    policy.  Of course the school could write the policy to5    limit it to athletic, just athletic events or just6    theatrical events but they couldn't exclude religious7    groups or religious viewpoints on those subjects.8              QUESTION:  Well but, I think you can say that9    the school, that the school couldn't exclude religious10    viewpoints or religious groups and still not necessarily11    say that it had to be open for a full dress religious12    service.13141516171819202122232425          MR. MARCELLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, that'scorrect.  I think again in this case Milford has draftedthe broadest possible policy.  It's really when you sayany social, civic or recreation use or other usespertaining to the community you, I think, have created thebroadest possible forum --          QUESTION:  It specifically allows meetings andentertainment events and other uses.          MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct.  And I think thephrase is other uses that pertain to the welfare of thecommunity, Justice Kennedy.          QUESTION:  Might there not be a problem with theestablishment clause, apart from the viewpoint versus6         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    content discrimination if there were say a church service 2    to be conducted the same time the Boy Scouts are meeting? 3              MR. MARCELLE:  I don't believe so, Justice 4    Ginsburg, for this reason.  When you choose, when you 5    choose, as Milford has in this case, to shut its school 6    down at 3 o'clock and thereby open up a public forum 7    inside your school, you can't restrict religious 8    viewpoints even if the viewpoint in the speech is exercise 9    in a religious ceremony.10              QUESTION:  But you are talking about a First11    Amendment free speech right.  That's how you open this.12    There is also an issue that hasn't been aired in this13    case, and that is the issue that arose in Widmar and in14    Murgens, the distinction between, for establishment clause15    purposes, people of a certain sophistication versus16    younger people.17              MR. MARCELLE:  Justice Ginsburg, I'll give you18    two answers to your inquiry.  One, I think this is like19    Widmar.  For example, in Widmar would essentially be the20    cornerstone group which was the student group that sought21    access to the school was a religious group singing22    religious songs, reading the Bible and praying, and this23    Court didn't find a constitutional problem in that case24    because it was --25              QUESTION:  The age of the, the -- that played7               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    some role in the Court's decision, didn't it? That these 2    were college students who had a degree of sophistication 3    and could distinguish between just opening it up to 4    everybody, and the school endorsing it? 5              MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 6    And in this case, in Widmar, the appropriate community was 7    the students so you would look at the observer student, 8    but in this case, Milford has ended school and has opened 9    up a community forum for parents to initiate and parents10    to run these community groups.11              QUESTION:  What was at issue in Widmar? What,12    what kind of activity?13              MR. MARCELLE:  It was a -- praying and reading14    the Bible and singing religious songs and teaching from15 the Bible.16              QUESTION:  In, in the school or to the whole17    school body, before the whole school body?18              MR. MARCELLE:  Not before the whole school body,19    Your Honor.  Just to the participants who wanted to hear20    and chose to hear this message like this case.  The only21    children who attend the Good News Club are sent there by22    there parents.23              QUESTION:  And that was upheld?24              MR. MARCELLE:  And that was upheld, Your Honor.25              QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  Isn't the nub of the8               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    problem in this case that you're not dealing with college 2    students, you're dealing with grade school kids, kids 3    from, I think it was ages starting at six going up to 12. 4    You're doing it -- in this particular case, the meeting 5    was being held immediately after the school and the 6    meeting sounds to me as it was described as Sunday school. 7    They pray.  They sing sort of children's religious songs, 8    and they have a teaching lesson and I guess some 9    discussion, but it sounds like Sunday school, and isn't10    the problem in this case that you don't have a11    sophisticated group of people of college age who know that12    the university is not proselytizing them or approving of13    their particular religious practice, whereas in this case14    you have a bunch of kids who just don't make those kinds15    of distinctions, and isn't that the nub of the16    establishment clause problem here, which didn't exist in17 Widmar?18              MR. MARCELLE:  If I may, Justice, be allowed to19    give you, kind of, two answers.  One, that's not the case20    because if this meeting was conducted at 9 o'clock at21    night and was given just to adults, State law would22    prohibit from them meeting under those circumstances.23              QUESTION:  Well, that, that might be the case,24    and it might be the case that you would have a different25    case before us if those were your facts, but whether State9               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    law would prohibit it or not, my question is, don't we 2    have here at least a substantial, I won't decide it from 3    the bench, but don't we have a substantial establishment 4    clause issue, which we simply didn't have in Widmar so 5    that you can't take Widmar as being direct authority for 6    what was going on here? 7              MR. MARCELLE:  I would say the answer -- and 8    that would be in the second part of my answer. 9              QUESTION:  Right.  Get to number two.10              MR. MARCELLE:  -- to your, to your question, is11    the parents are the ones who decide whether or not the12    children will attend.13              QUESTION:  He's worried about the other children14    who are, who are supposedly hanging around the school15    after the bell rings, instead of skipping off the way my16    kids do.  Actually, and they are infected by seeing these17    other kids going into an activity which they think18    represents the approval of the State for these religious19    services.  I think that's the point he's making.20              QUESTION:  I would never spurn Justice Scalia's21    help, but actually -- actually, I think you understood my22    question.  Why don't you answer it as modified by Justice23 Scalia.24              MR. MARCELLE:  I guess I would go back to25    Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Capitol Square where she10               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    said the endorsement tests and the establishment clause2    are concerned with the political community at large and3    not particular individuals or isolated observers.  Here4    the day ends and --5              QUESTION:  That's, that's, you know, that's6    because that was the group to which Capitol Plaza was7    appealing, but here, the appeal is to kids, and in8    particular, to the kids who are going to this Sunday9    school kind of service.10              MR. MARCELLE:  I guess I would disagree with all11    respect, Justice Souter.  I think the appeal is to the12    parents.13          QUESTION:  Mr. Marcelle, was this the basis forthe school's refusal to allow the group, you can't do itright after school?  Was that the --          MR. MARCELLE:  No.  That was not the basis.          QUESTION:  And was this point raised before theSecond Circuit?  Was it part of the Second Circuit's          MR. MARCELLE:  Absolutely not.          QUESTION:  Was the point raised before theSecond Circuit?          MR. MARCELLE:  If I could search my memory and Idon't believe, or if it was raised, it was raisedtangentially, Your Honor.  It certainly wasn't the thrust.11         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO141516171819    opinion?2021 22 23 24 2512345678    happen?9          QUESTION:  Well then, then do you feel that thedecision that the judgment of the Second Circuit should bevacated and the case should be remanded for considerationof this issue?          MR. MARCELLE:  Well, I, I think what happens isfor the purpose of --                QUESTION:  What do you, what do you think should11    grant the relief we requested.12              QUESTION:  And why, why should this issue not be13    considered in the Second Circuit?14              MR. MARCELLE:  I believe that Milford school had15    the burden of proof.16              QUESTION:  But you were the Plaintiff in the17    case, and you had the First Amendment theory, and that18    lost, and you appealed on that theory.19              MR. MARCELLE:  Yes.20              QUESTION:  Now, it would seem to me if the other21    issue was, was not aired, we should not decide it in the22    first instance.23              MR. MARCELLE:  Justice Ginsburg, there was cross24    motions for summary judgment.  We moved for summary25    judgment and the school district moved for summary12               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO                MR. MARCELLE:  Excuse me.  I think this case10    should be reversed and remanded back to district court to 1    judgment, and to defeat our motion for summary judgment, 2    they had the burden of proving a compelling State interest 3    and that the censorship forum, from the forum was the 4    least restrictive means to achieve that interest. 5              QUESTION:  Mr. Marcelle, when the, when the 6    State refuses somebody something to which he is entitled 7    for the wrong reason, and the case is appealed up here, 8    and we say that reason was wrong, do we normally, if the 9    State comes in and says oh, we could have, we could have10    done it for another reason, you know, not because of his11    race.  We might have done it for some other reason, do we12    normally remand to give him a second bite?  Aren't they13    stuck with the reason that they gave?14              MR. MARCELLE:  Well, I think, they are stuck15    with the record as in any trial, on any appeal, you could16    raise new issues and new grounds and could have a new17    trial.181920212223242513               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  This school said we will not let youconduct this service, period.MR. MARCELLE:  At any time.          QUESTION:  At any time because we do not allowreligious services in the school, and that's the basis onwhich it was argued below, as I understand it.MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct.QUESTION:  Did the Court of Appeals rely on the 1    establishment clause in its decision? 2              MR. MARCELLE:  No, it did not, Mr. Chief 3    Justice.  We were briefly, my recollection, questioned 4    about it, but the Second Circuit did not rest its decision 5    on that grounds. 6              QUESTION:  And in a trial court, the school 7    district made no distinction in its summary judgment 8    motions or in its answer based on the fact that this was 9    immediately after school?10              MR. MARCELLE:  I'm not sure --11              QUESTION:  The school district said it could bar12    these, it could bar these meetings at any time of day?13              MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct.  And it's --14              QUESTION:  And it made no, and it made no15    distinction between right after school or an hour after16    school or two hours after school?17              MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct, Justice Kennedy18    and in fact on the joint appendix at G-4 and I believe19    it's paragraph 13, it's the superintendent's affidavit20    where he is basically says that your speech is too21    religious to be using the forum.22              QUESTION:  Mr. Marcelle, does State law require23    this school district to open its facilities after school24    to other groups?25              MR. MARCELLE:  No, Justice O'Connor.14               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  This is a decision made theparticular school.          MR.

MARCELLE:  But does not require it.          QUESTION:  And is it clear under State law thatthe school could adopt whatever provisions it wants forits opening of the school?  It could choose to limit it toathletic purposes at certain hours and on certain days?          MR. MARCELLE:  Yes.  What State law sets aceiling for what school districts can do, and they can go,the floor goes to not even opening the forum and they cango anywhere in between.  Here, Milford chose to, themaximum possible extent allowed under, under --          QUESTION:  So it would be entirely open,whatever this Court chose to do for the school to revampits policy for hours and days and purposes?          MR. MARCELLE:  Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.New York grants them broad discretion and the school boardhas that ability to exercise that discretion.          QUESTION:  May I ask, what is the, is there aState statutory ceiling you say?  In other words, is therea State limit on how much religious activity they could15         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO10111213141516171819202122232425    permit?1              MR.

MARCELLE:  I'm sorry, yes, Justice Stevens.We are challenging both.101112    unconstitutional?13              MR. MARCELLE:  The statute to the extent --14    Justice Stevens, actually it requires a little explanation15    under New York law.  It really isn't that, the history in16    New York law is a little more entangled.  The State17    legislature had opened up it for these broad purposes if18    the school board so chose.  In 1978, there was a mid level19    appellate court in the State that was decided prior to20    Murgens that said because the State legislature didn't21    specifically include religious purposes in the statute,22    the court interpreted as it meant to exclude religious23    purposes, although the State doesn't, the statute doesn't24    say that, that has become part of the judicial25    interpretation of the statute, so I don't want to mislead16ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    you and it's contained in the statute, Justice Stevens. 2              QUESTION:  Well, I want to know how that 3    explanation that you just gave us fits with, with what you 4    were telling Justice O'Connor a moment ago. If you win 5    this case, and the school board says we want to revamp our 6    regulations, and our regulations are going to be that 7    although religious purposes do not exclude a group from, 8    from use of the facilities, religious worship does, and we 9    are going to draw the line there, or they might say we are10    going to draw the line against any use that could be11    regarded reasonably as an establishment clause violation12    when young kids are involved.13              Would you take the position then that because14    you think the, the New York statute is unconstitutional15    that the school district could not draw that restriction16    or either of those restrictions that I have just17    described, and which if the statute is unconstitutional18    does it render the school district in fact, in this19    respect, does it render the school district incapable of20    drawing any distinction whatever that has any reference to21 religion?22              MR. MARCELLE:  I believe Widmar answers that23    question, Justice Souter.24              QUESTION:  I would like Marcelle to answer that25    question.  What position, what's your argument?17               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. MARCELLE:  My argument is religious worship 2    is inherently a religious viewpoint.  In other words, when 3    I say hail Mary full of grace and say amen, that's my 4    internal attitude.  If I say ha ha, I'm allowed in the 5    forum, but if I say amen, I'm excluded and it seems to me 6    what makes one worship and the other not worship is my 7    internal attitude. 8              QUESTION:  No.  But -- is, you are saying that 9    the State cannot exclude what's going on -- that the10    district could not exclude what's going on here. But is it11    because the statute is itself unconstitutional in drawing12    a religious distinction?13              MR. MARCELLE:  No.  I believe it's14    unconstitutional under the free speech clause.  That is,15    the State cannot exclude religious viewpoints from a forum16    that otherwise speaks on the subject matter.  For example,17    in this case --18              QUESTION:  Okay.  No.  I don't, I don't mean to19    cut you off, but I just wonder, you answered Justice20    O'Connor's question, as I recall, by saying yes, the State21    could go back and revamp the policy and draw it more22    narrowly, and I understood you to say, or to imply that if23    it wanted to draw a policy that says no religious worship24    involving young kids or something like that, that, that25    would be open to it and I want to know whether your18               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    position on the statute leads you to say no, the school 2    district would not be, even without State, would be 3    without State authority under State law even to do that. 4              MR. MARCELLE:  My position is that the First 5    Amendment prohibits drawing that distinction, if that, 6    whatever you called the worship fits within the otherwise 7    religious neutral boundaries of the forum.  So, for8 example -- 9              QUESTION:  But is that because the State statute10    is simply inoperative to give the school districts the11    authority to redraw a policy more narrowly?12              MR. MARCELLE:  No.  I think the limitation on13    the school board is the First Amendment to the United14    States Constitution.15              QUESTION:  Okay.16              QUESTION:  If there were to be an action, let's17    say you prevailed in this action, there would be an action18    by parents of a 6-year-old attending this school, that19    would challenge the allowance of this group on20    establishment clause grounds, that would in no way be21    foreclosed by this, this decision if the issue is there,22    but not decided by this case, is that right?23              MR. MARCELLE:  I guess that would be correct,24    Justice Ginsburg.  I mean, I guess cases can't stand for25    propositions which aren't decided in them, and I think19               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 that's -- 2              QUESTION:  So the whole question one way or 3    another of whether elementary school students are 4    differently situated than high school students or college 5    students would be open in any case? 6              MR. MARCELLE:  Depending how the court wrote the 7    opinion, yes.  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 8              QUESTION:  Well, I mean the establishment clause 9    has been presented in this case at least as a defense,10    that is to say, it has been alleged that one of the11    reasons that the State could do this is because of the12    establishment clause problems that would arise were they13    to do it, and it is, it is quite possibly for this Court's14    opinion to address that establishment clause argument as15    well, isn't it?16              MR. MARCELLE:  I would assume it's quite17    possible, Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  I'm confused.  I thought you said it19    wasn't raised.20              MR. MARCELLE:  I'm sorry, I said that, excuse21    me, Justice Ginsburg.  I think what I was trying to say in22    response to Justice Souter's question was they hadn't met23    their burden.  It's different between, I think, not24    raising it and not meeting the burden of proof of showing25    a compelling stage.20               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But wasn't there a position below,maybe, maybe I misunderstood what you were saying, but Ithought their position below was that any use for areligious purpose, any, as you were putting it, anyexpression of a religious point of view on the subjectsthat might be discussed could be excluded and that was thereason for excluding this. Is that so?          MR. MARCELLE:  That's correct, Justice Souter.          QUESTION:  And do you, do you believe that, thatif we say no, that's too broad a ground, that they wouldthen be foreclosed from redrawing their policy on anarrower ground based upon avoidance of an establishmentclause problem if they do allow this, would they be --          MR. MARCELLE:  I'm not sure.          QUESTION:  Would they be precluded?  In otherwords, they are saying okay, we can't paint with a broadbrush.  We are going to paint with a narrow brush.  We aregoing to say this would be a violation of theestablishment clause to allow a Sunday school kind ofworship for young school kids immediately after school, wewon't allow it.  Would that in your judgment be precludedby the judgment in this case?to say. QUESTION:  Assuming you know what we are going MR. MARCELLE:  I guess that's --                   21ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  I take it, I take it based on your 2    position it's open to us to say that it's a violation of 3    the establishment clause for the State to scan and to 4    review every single event, every single class in order to 5    purge it of religious content; that that is itself is an 6    establishment violation.  That's open for us to say, so if 7    we said, that would certainly foreclose the line of 8    questioning that, the suggestions that Justice Souter is 9    making about further lawsuits.10              MR. MARCELLE:  Absolutely.  And moreover,11    Justice Kennedy, I think there is also this problem. This12    is a broad community forum, and parents, it would seem to13    me the establishment clause was crafted to defend the14    rights of the religious people to participate in broad15    community forums and to exclude Andrea Fournier from a16    forum because of her religion would seem to be the very17    value that the establishment clause was, was crafted to18    defend, so if she wears her daisy scout uniform, for19    example, she is okay to come in, but if she wears her Good20    News Club uniform, she is not.  And it, I think not only21    the free speech clause protects her right to meet under22    those circumstances, but not to be excluded from a broad23    community forum and the parents not to be excluded from24    the broad community forum also is protected by the25    establishment.22               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1              QUESTION:  All right.  I want to make sure I2    understand your answer.  You are saying that if you win3    this case based upon the ground that the exclusion broadly4    of religious viewpoints is unconstitutional, is it your5    position that if they then redraw the policy more narrowly6    and say we are going to exclude Sunday school type of7    meetings held on the school grounds immediately after8    school, is it your position that they would be foreclosed9    by the judgment of this Court in this case from doing10 that? 111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MARCELLE:  The way you state it, JusticeSouter, absolutely.          QUESTION:  Well, not if we rely simply on, on,on the First Amendment speech clause.  That, that'sanother option that we have.  We say it's simply violativeof the First Amendment speech clause.          QUESTION:  It's almost impossible for counsel tosay what the effect of an opinion is going to be.          QUESTION:  Trust me, Mr. Marcelle.          QUESTION:  Also principles of res judicatainvolved that anything that was litigated or might havebeen litigated in a suit is barred.          QUESTION:  Trust me, Mr. Marcelle, we can writethis opinion so it does almost nothing.          MR.

MILLER                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleasethe Court, the issue before this Court today is whether apublic school district may lawfully exclude a religiousgroup from conducting adult-led, adult-sponsored andadult-initiated prayer and worship services and religiousinstruction immediately at the end of the school day wherethese activities involved the youngest children.          QUESTION:  Well now, what difference doesadult-sponsored make?  I assume the Girl Scout meetingsare adult-sponsored.  What's the purpose of emphasizing          MR. MILLER:  The purpose of emphasizing that --          QUESTION:  All these things are adult-sponsored.          MR. MILLER:  Well, Justice O'Connor, except forthe fact that we have the Equal Access Act which we submitthat if Petitioner's position is accepted in this case,the Equal Access Act will become meaningless because thenyou will be able to have adult-led and adult-sponsoredreligious activities occurring in a school which the EqualAccess Act would prohibit.24         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO10111213141516    that?1718192021222324251              QUESTION:  What Equal Access Act are you talking2    about?3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MILLER:  I'm talking about the Equal AccessAct that was discussed by this Court in Murgens and --          QUESTION:  The New York law?          MR. MILLER:  I'm sorry?          QUESTION:  You are referring to some New Yorklaw?  Some Federal law?          MR. MILLER:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, the Federalstatute known as the Equal Access Act.          QUESTION:  Is that before us in this case?          MR. MILLER:  No, Justice O'Connor.          QUESTION:  I didn't think it was presented to uson that basis.          MR. MILLER:  No, it is not.  It is that, it isthat the Federal law would allow, the Equal Access Actwould allow adult, would not allow adult-led oradult-sponsored religious worship and activity in a schoolunder any circumstances. Whereas, if it werestudent-initiated and student-led at the secondary level,that would be permissible under Federal law and thoserestrictions have been upheld by this court in Murgens.          QUESTION:  Right.  But what are the gradescovered at the Milford Central School?          MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, it's                            25         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1    kindergarten through sixth grade, so it's actually ages 52 to 12. 3              QUESTION:  Well, it would be unusual, wouldn't 4    it, for any meeting after school not to have an adult 5    leader?  He wouldn't have a bunch of fourth graders in 6    there talking by themselves. 7              MR. MILLER:  Oh, absolutely.  Oh absolutely. 8    Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.  I emphasize that point 9    only because of the fact that under Federal law under the10    Equal Access Act, this activity wouldn't be permitted.11              QUESTION:  May I just ask on the equal access, I12    don't really have it in mind.  Does the Equal Access Act13    not require or does it prohibit the activity you are14    describing?          MR. MILLER:  It would prohibit the activity.          QUESTION:  It prohibits it.          MR. MILLER:  At the elementary level, and itwould prohibit the involvement of adult supervision.          QUESTION:  Are you sure about that?  I, Ithought it would simply not compel it.  It doesn't cover,it doesn't cover it except, you know, student-led1516171819202122    activity.2324 25          MR. MILLER:  Justice Scalia, my understanding ofthe Act was that it specifically prohibited adult-led andadult-sponsored activities at the elementary level, which26         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9is the situation.          QUESTION:  Wow.  Well, then it would raise thesame problem as this raises?  So my question would be, wehave a fairly -- no prayer in school is a controversialpolicy, but it has one virtue.  The court's opinion is,the virtue is it's clear.          MR. MILLER:  That's right.          QUESTION:  All right.  So the rule is as thecourts interpreted it, that school activities cannotinvolve prayer.  Well, isn't the corollary of that wherethere isn't school activities, it can involve prayer, andit can involve religious activities, and here we are afterschool, so the same clear rule would say you can't pray inschool, but after school is different, and you can'tdiscriminate against religion after school.  Now, I putthat because that's, I'm putting it squarely.          MR. MILLER:  Right.          QUESTION:  I want to hear your answer.          MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.          QUESTION:  And, and my, my thought is aimed atthe clarity of such a rule that ordinary people canunderstand, in light of the basic principles underlyingestablishment on the one hand and free speech on the          MR.

And 3    what we have attempted to do is consistent with State law 4    we have attempted to exclude the subject matter of5 religion. 6              QUESTION:  Exactly.  And the question is, after7 school -- 8              MR. MILLER:  Correct. 9              QUESTION:  People can talk about any subject10    matter, but not religion.  That sounds to me as if you are11    discriminating in free speech terms against religion.  And12    now my question is, why isn't that contrary to the13    Constitution?  It's after school.   It's not a school14    activity.  And it doesn't help me to talk about open15    forums or not open forums or whatever.  I want, I want to16    know what, what the principle is, what the theory is?17              MR. MILLER:  Well, the theory is, Justice18    Breyer, that we have set limits to exclude on a reasonable19    basis certain activities from occurring in the school.20    Just as we exclude partisan political activities.  We21    exclude commercial activities.  And we exclude various22    other activities, the school system has made a decision23    that it wanted to exclude this activity from its forum.24    Now, consistent with a decision, for example, in Cornelius25    vs. NAACP, where the issue of partisan political speech28               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    was excluded from a limited open forum.  We have acted 2    similarly in this circumstance.  Because of concern about 3    some of these establishments. 4              QUESTION:  What, what do you do about the, our 5    Lamb's Chapel decision?  It seems to me that the Court of 6    Appeals here paid very little attention to Lamb's Chapel. 7              MR. MILLER:  I'm, I'm well aware of that, Mr. 8    Chief Justice.  But I think that in part, and I, I'm not 9    certain why the Second Circuit wrote the majority opinion10    it did, except for the, I can offer the Court this, and11    that is that in footnote two of the majority opinion, this12    Court indicated very clearly that it was not addressing13    the issue of worship services and Sunday school.14              QUESTION:  Well that -- yes, but as I understand15    it, as it has been represented to us, that wasn't the16    basis for the school district's exclusion here.  The17    basis, as I understand it, was what you just told Justice18    Breyer a moment ago, that the district had chosen to19    exclude religious discussion from those which were, were20    open.  And that's, that's a very different criterion from21    saying, we're excluding the use of the facilities just for22    religious worship.  Which was it?23              MR. MILLER:  Well, Justice Souter, I think24    perhaps the actions of the school district have been25    somewhat mischaracterized.  I believe that there is a29               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    letter in the record from the superintendent that had 2    indicated precisely what they were excluding, and the 3    letter from the superintendent to the Reverend indicated 4    that uses consistent with Lamb's Chapel would be 5    permitted, but that religious worship would be excluded 6    under the description of this forum.  So it was not 7    excluded because of a viewpoint.  It was excluded because 8    the entire subject matter of religious worship was 9    excluded from the forum.10              QUESTION:  Where is that letter in the record?11              MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.  Your Honor, please look12    at the joint appendix H-1 to H-2.  There is reference13    there to the Lamb's Chapel decision of this Court14    indicating that the viewpoint, the viewpoint was -- was15    not what was being excluded, rather it was the religious16    worship that was being excluded.17              QUESTION:  And was it religious worship which18    was the ground that you -- you chose to stand on in the19    district court and in the argument before the Second20 Circuit?21              MR. MILLER:  Justice -- Justice Souter, we22    advanced both.  For example, an examination of our answer23    would reveal that we raised the establishment clause as an24    affirmative defense.   But I believe it's the next to the25    last page of the district court opinion, and I could find30               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9it if the Court wishes. The district court, for example,concluded that because we had found that the limited openforum was properly created and properly limited, it didnot need to reach our establishment clause arguments orthe establishment clause issue.          QUESTION:  On that, you think this letter iscorrect that hearing a Bible lesson and memorizingScripture is the equivalent of religious worship?          MR. MILLER:  Justice Scalia, yes, sir, I do.          QUESTION:  And have you memorized theDeclaration of Independence or the preamble of theConstitution, that's something other -- what is that?That's not thinking?  That's not training of any kind?          MR. MILLER:  Justice Kennedy --          QUESTION:  That's not, that's not imparting aview on what our history means?          MR. MILLER:  Oh, of course it is.          QUESTION:  We, we don't want you to know -- beable to recite the First Amendment?          MR. MILLER:  We don't certainly contend thatthat was a full description, Justice Kennedy, ofeverything that was occurring.  Rather we have a fullrecord that the district court and the court of appeals inboth instances concluded that this was indeed religious31         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO10111213141516171819202122232425    worship.12345678    dances.9QUESTION:  Well, suppose it was.MR.

Now, my question isgiven Lamb's Chapel, why would that be constitutional?          MR. MILLER:  Well, Justice Breyer, the premiseof the question operates under the assumption that theonly thing that we excluded was religious, were religiousactivities, I believe.          QUESTION:  Well, that's what seems to be whatyou're saying.  What you excluded here, there is aseparate section and it says the separate section, use fornonreligious purposes.  It says school premises shall not32         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPOresponse.

MILLER:  Yes, sir. 4              QUESTION:  So it seems to me that what you have 5    on one side of the page is use it for anything, and on the 6    other side of the page, there is an exception, religious 7    purposes.  Now, my question, which has been throughout is, 8    how do you square that with Lamb's Chapel, i.e., since its 9    after school, and isn't a school activity, why isn't it10    discrimination against religion under the First Amendment?11              MR. MILLER:  Your Honor, we have excluded the12    entire subject matter of religion as we --13              QUESTION:  Well, doesn't that make it worse?14    Every other subject matter is there.15              MR. MILLER:  No, Your Honor, because that is16    not, that is, in fact, not the case as this particular17    forum was created.  This particular forum also excluded18    partisan political speech and various other activities19    that I believe we enumerated in our brief and I think are20    enumerated elsewhere in the record, particularly the21    deposition of the school superintendent identifies a22    number of those.23              QUESTION:  But, but it didn't exclude24    discussions of morals -- the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts25    teach that.33               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.          QUESTION:  What it really excluded was adiscussion of morality that had a religious perspective.          MR. MILLER:  Well, Your Honor, that -- the factsin the case really don't spell that out.  And in fact,there is no development of the record in terms of whatprecisely the Boy Scouts did, other than recite the BoyScout motto.  In fact, the record doesn't reflect thatthey actually held their typical club meetings on schoolpremises.  What they actually held on school premises wereleadership meetings and not actual Cub Scout --          QUESTION:  Well, the very oath of the Boy Scoutsis moral.          MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  And our positionhas been that that's essentially an incidental mention ofthose issues.  It is different from or distinct fromreligious worship.          QUESTION:  And so someone who spoke of, wantedto teach about how to be a good citizen from aparticularly, especially secular point of view could nothave done so under your program?          MR. MILLER:  Your Honor, they could have. Ibelieve that --          QUESTION:  They could have done it.          MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.34         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  But someone who wanted to speak about 2    exactly the same subject from a religious point of view 3    could not have? 4              MR. MILLER:  I don't -- I don't agree with the 5    Chief Justice's statement of the question.  Your Honor, we 6    would have allowed them to express their viewpoint on a 7    secular subject, I believe consistent with Lamb's Chapel. 8    We would not have, however, permitted religious worship 9    services, which is essentially what this was.10              QUESTION:  You say this is essentially a11    religious worship service.  Now, I think people might12    quarrel with that.  You can have, I think one of my13    colleagues here described it as more like Sunday school,14    and I think that's probably an accurate description, but15    it certainly isn't religious worship in the sense that16    most people think of it.17              MR. MILLER:  Well, except for the fact, Your18    Honor -- Your Honor that the Sunday school is generally19    the way that religious worship is presented to children of20    this, of this age group.  They are typically not required21    to attend the full service and so forth.  They typically22    attend a Sunday school-type service.23              QUESTION:  Another way to put it would be that24    children of that age don't engage in religious worship.25    They go to Sunday school.35               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. MILLER:  Well, Justice Scalia, they go -- 2              QUESTION:  I mean, just because they go, you are 3    going to suddenly convert Sunday school into a Mass? 4              MR. MILLER:  No.  Justice Scalia, except for the 5    fact that what they do is that they, they engage in an 6    activity that's age-appropriate, and for those children -- 7              QUESTION:  That's right. 8              QUESTION:  Don't they pray -- 9              QUESTION:  Religious worship is not part of it.10              QUESTION:  Don't they pray?11              MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir, they do.12              QUESTION:  May I ask to you clarify now13    something that Mr. Marcelle addressed as well.  You have14    said that you raised the establishment clause as an15    affirmative defense.16              MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor.17              QUESTION:  And that the district court said I'm18    not going to deal with it because I decide the case in19    your favor on another ground.20              MR. MILLER:  Correct.21              QUESTION:  So it was raised, you raised it, but22    it wasn't decided.23              MR. MILLER:  That's correct.24              QUESTION:  It seems to me that that's got to25    remain open.36               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              MR. MILLER:  Yes, Your Honor, I believe that it 2    does.  I believe it's very much involved in this case. 3              QUESTION:  Your position is that saying a prayer 4    is religious worship and I assume then that any group 5    which sought to meet on your school's property which 6    opened its meeting with a prayer would be excluded, and 7    you think that's in accord with Lamb's Chapel? 8              MR. MILLER:  Religious worship would be 9    excluded, Justice Scalia.10              QUESTION:  And you said in response to Justice11    Souter that saying a prayer is religious worship, right?12              MR. MILLER:  Justice Scalia --13              QUESTION:  Right?  So no group admitted to this14    school program can say a prayer to open its meeting?15              MR. MILLER:  I wouldn't necessarily say that,16    Justice Scalia.17              QUESTION:  You just did say it.18              MR. MILLER:  Well, I -- the point I'm getting19    across is that the activities of the Good News Club were20    more than merely reciting one prayer. There was much more21    involved in that which is fully developed in the record,22    and those activities were much more religious and much23    more in the nature of a religious worship service.24              QUESTION:  They were more religious, but they25    were not necessarily the same thing as a church religion37               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9-- as a church worship service, teaching the Scripture,teaching what the Scripture has to say about morality.  Imean, I think it's a great distortion to call that aworship service.          MR. MILLER:  Justice Scalia --          QUESTION:  Even if you throw in a prayer or two.          MR. MILLER:  Justice Scalia, for children ofthis age group, that is the religious worship service thatthey would typically engage in.          QUESTION:  Well, if that's so --          QUESTION:  And that's what you want to litigate,if on the broad ground you lose, you say we have raisedthat, and we should be allowed to litigate that go back todistrict court, is that it?1011121314151617181920    --21              MR.

MILLER:  Correct.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on the assumption that this is pure prayer, which I knowit isn't, because the other alternative you could arguewhether it is or isn't, but assume it was, how do we getat that issue?          MR. MILLER:  Well, several ways.  Number one, Ithink that even if it's not a -- technically anestablishment clause violation, I think the schooldistrict had a reasonable basis to conclude that it mightpotentially be disruptive, it might potentially bedivisive of the community to allow this type ofutilization of the school building, and out of concernthat perhaps religions which did not predominate in thearea might be unrepresented and unable to use the schoolfacility for similar purposes.          QUESTION:  This is divisive in the community?  Idon't understand.  What would the community get upsetabout?  I don't understand.          MR. MILLER:  Well, Justice Scalia --          QUESTION:  You would let all religious groups dothis, right?          MR. MILLER:  Presumably, if you ordered it.          QUESTION:  Religious groups that didn't want todo it would get upset that other religious groups did wantto do it?          MR. MILLER:  Well, actually, Your Honor --                            40         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  You must have a very divisive 2    community down there.  I'm glad I don't live in New York 3    anymore. 4              MR. MILLER:  Actually it isn't terribly 5    divisive, Justice Scalia.  What we are concerned about is, 6    is that there may be religious groups that do not have a 7    substantial representation in this small town community, 8    and that the majority religion, such as Reverend Fournier 9    represented would be able to run a Good News Club, but the10    other groups that didn't have the numbers or the personnel11    couldn't run a similar club, and that would show a12    favoritism to this particular club.13              QUESTION:  Why would it be a favoritism? I mean,14    presumably if they met the standards for, if you have to15    have a certain number of people come to the meeting, any16    religious group that met that standard would have been17    granted the same right, wouldn't they?18              MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.  But it's --19              QUESTION:  Well, then what you're saying20    basically, it's kind of a heckler's veto, that if people21    don't like what the school is doing and are unhappy about22    it, that is a reason for excluding religion.23              MR. MILLER:  I don't believe that to be the only24    basis upon which we've determined that it is appropriate25    to exclude this.  We have also relied, to some extent,41               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    upon the mandate of State law that the school is bound to2    follow, and may I point out, please, that in the complaint3    there is no challenge to the constitutionality of section4    414 of the education law.  That relief was not asked for5    at the district court, it was not asked for at the court6    of appeals, and it is not, in my judgment, at least from7    what I read in the complaint, it is not before this Court.8              QUESTION:  No, but are you contending that the9    State statute required this policy?10              MR. MILLER:  Justice Stevens, I believe that11    that's essentially what the State statute mandated.  The12    State statute, education -- New York education law 41413    prohibited use of a school building for religious14    purposes.151617181920212223242542               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  Well, but you don't say that theschool couldn't adopt some different policy and say we'renot going to allow any use of our buildings at all?6 p.m..MR. MILLER:  That is correct, Justice O'Connor.QUESTION:  The State law does not prohibit that?MR. MILLER:  That is correct.QUESTION:  And the school could say, we're onlygoing to allow after-school use for athletic purposes.          MR.

It only sets a ceiling,whatever that State law is.          MR. MILLER:  That is correct, except one of thethings that they do not permit, along with otherprohibitions, such as a political -- partisan politicalactivities, commercial activities, and so on.  One of theother excluded areas is a religious activity.          QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Miller, you can't have itboth ways.  If you say that the State law requires this --          MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.          QUESTION:  -- then certainly theconstitutionality of the State law is at issue in thiscase.  There is no difference whatever between saying thatwhat the State law requires is unconstitutional and sayingthat the State statute is unconstitutional.  That's oneand the same.  You can't have it both ways.  If you saythe State statute requires this, we are passing upon theconstitutionality of the State statute, isn't that right?          MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir.  Just as you were inLamb's Chapel, but the same statute was before the courtin Lamb's Chapel, and --          QUESTION:  By the way, the Federal Equal AccessAct does not prohibit what was done here.  It does notcontain any prohibitions.

I thoughtwe just went over this.  There is nothing in the worldthat prohibits the school from saying we're not going tohave any activity before 6 p.m. or 3:30 or 4:00 or 5:00,whatever it is.          MR.

It just says Federal law does notrequire you to do it at the elementary level.          MR. MILLER:  That is correct.  That is correct.The -- we contend that the establishment clause argumentis very much involved in this case. We did raise that asan affirmative defense in our answer, and we contend thatif this particular use is permitted, we will have Sundayschool on a Tuesday in a public school occurring at 3o'clock immediately upon the end of the official school1              QUESTION:  You told me the school can do that.2              MR. MILLER:  The school can do that.3              QUESTION:  So why would you complain about 34    o'clock?  That must be something the school itself set up.5              MR. MILLER:  That is correct, Justice O'Connor,6    it is something that the school set up and allows, but7    they didn't specify specific times, and when they examined8    this particular circumstance, they determined that it was9    religious worship and chose not to exclude it -- or,10    excuse me, chose to exclude it.11              QUESTION:  But --12              QUESTION:  But that's all that's before us is13    the religious worship.  The school obviously can set the14    hours and the days and the opportunities for all these15    groups.1617181920212223242545               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOMR. MILLER:  That is --MR. MILLER:  That is correct.  That is correct.          QUESTION:  And your position is they can't do itat any time of day, and that's the way the case has beenpresented to us here.          QUESTION:  And the school, in fact, nevercomplained about the time, none of this correspondencesaid the problem is you're doing it right after school andthese other kids will think that -- right?  That was neverin any of this stuff? 1              MR. MILLER:  That is correct, Justice Scalia, 2    the original denial was based on the fact that it was 3    religious worship, not based upon the specific time of 4    day, that is correct. 5              QUESTION:  And you defend that position? 6              MR. MILLER:  Yes, sir, I do.  I believe we have 7    the right to limit the forum to certain activities that 8    the school believes have a reasonable basis consistent 9    with the mission of the school system, and under the10    circumstances, as they have excluded other activities,11    such as political activities and commercial activities and12    similar activities, they are permitted to exclude these13    activities as well.14              QUESTION:  Now, why would it violate the15    establishment clause?  I mean, let's take an extreme case,16    a local church, which doesn't have a building, says, we17    would like to use the school for worship services two or18    three times a week at 4:00 in the afternoon to 6:00, all19    right?  So they do it.  And the school district says, no,20    this is a school, it's not a church.21              MR. MILLER:  Correct.22              QUESTION:  Even after school.  Now why, I want23    to understand why -- it may well.  Why does it violate the24    establishment clause, in your view? After all, you could25    turn it into a gymnasium. That's not the -- this is not a46               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO1    discrimination point. This is an establishment point.2              MR. MILLER:  Correct.3              QUESTION:  Why?4              MR. MILLER:  Because under those circumstances5    that you just posit, I believe that the school is then6    lending support to a particular religious exercise or a7    particular religion.  Under the circumstances of this8    particular case, our case, we have an increase in active 9    attendance at the meetings, we have the school being10    utilized in effect as a church.  And the same activity was11    conducted only months earlier at the church.  And under12    the circumstances, we submit, to permit the utilization13    for a church service, for a worship service, would involve14    the school in endorsing and supporting the that particular15    religion.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But the state provides, for example,crossing guards on Sundays at church services, and that isnot thought -- to facilitate people going to the churchservice, there's no other reason for it.  So long as itprovides crossing guards wherever else there is need forcrossing guards, this is not considered to be anestablishment of religion.MR. MILLER:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.          QUESTION:  So why if public facilities -- and Idon't -- I know many schools that do it.  If they're47ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.  1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.            SUITE 400     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005          (202)289-2260         (800) FOR DEPO 1    willing to let their facilities be used for any public2 purpose -- 3              MR. MILLER:  Uh-huh. 4              QUESTION:  -- why must they exclude a religious 5    purpose so long as they're doing it evenhandedly, all 6    religions, all other purposes, just like crossing guards? 7              MR. MILLER:  The example of the crossing guards 8    you gave, I presume, is on a public street. That would be 9    an open forum where restrictions and limitations would be10    very difficult to justify.  In the case of a limited open11    forum, such as the school district where you've previously12    -- this Court has previously indicated we have to have13    special sensitivity to the age and so forth of the14    children, we believe that it's appropriate to make those15    judgments to exclude from the forum those activities that16    the school officials may believe are not inconsistent with17    the mission.18              QUESTION:  On sundays?  On Sundays and after the19    kids are gone?  The building's just lying there.  Actually20    the community can make money, it rents it out to any group21    that wants it.  The church needs it.22              MR. MILLER:  Well, they wouldn't -- if they were23    doing it for a for-profit purpose under New York law, that24    wouldn't be permissible.25              QUESTION:  Oh, you can violate the establishment48               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1    clause for money? 2              MR. MILLER:  Well, no, no, it wouldn't be a 3    permissible use was my point.  It would not be permitted 4    under the school use policy or under New York education 5    law 414.  It's simply not permitted. 6              QUESTION:  To prohibit the use of public 7    facilities for religious purposes shows the State is 8    neutral as to religion, is that your point? 9              MR. MILLER:  Justice Kennedy, I believe that we10    are required to be neutral and permit the schoolhouse to11    be used as a house of worship would violate, I believe,12    the principle of neutrality.13              QUESTION:  Why would it do so if, unlike this14    case, there's no particular involvement of schoolchildren15    involved, and the district allows the, let's say the16    auditorium to be used for a meeting of the Elks, for a17    meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Baptists18    have had their church burned, and they want to use it.19    Why would -- what would the theory be that would explain20    why it would be a violation of the establishment clause to21    let the church group use it on the same terms as the VFW22    and other secular organizations?23              MR. MILLER:  Is Justice Souter's question in24    reference to this specific record or is this a25    hypothetical?49               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPO 1              QUESTION:  No, no, I'm going back I think to 2    Justice Breyer's question, and I understood you to answer 3    his question in such a way that would say, yes, it would, 4    in my example, it would be a violation to let the church 5    group use it at the same -- on the same terms as the VFW, 6    and I don't understand what your reasoning is.  What's the 7    establishment clause theory that leads you to say that? 8              MR. MILLER:  Because you would be permitting 9    then a schoolhouse to be used as a house of worship.  In10    the case of -- in our particular case, at 3 o'clock there11    are lots of other educational activities going on.12              QUESTION:  Well, if that was the case, in -- the13    facts in Widmar, then, would have been an establishment14    clause violation because in Widmar you had a state15    university property that was being used for purposes of16    worship, so that would have violated the establishment17 clause.18              MR. MILLER:  Well, Justice Souter, I believe19    that Widmar is a totally different case. Number one, it's20    an open forum as opposed to a limited open forum.21              QUESTION:  But you're talking about the First22    Amendment, and now we're talking about the establishment23    clause.  I take it, then, that given your answer to my24    question and Justice Breyer's, you would say that the25    student worship service in Widmar on university property50               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.                 1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                           SUITE 400                    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                         (202)289-2260                        (800) FOR DEPOwas a violation of the establishment clause.          MR.

We're talking about establishment clause          MR. MILLER:  Uh-huh.  Yes, sir, I understand.          QUESTION:  In other words, I'm going from thespeech clause to the establishment clause.  Was the Widmarworship service on public property a violation of theestablishment clause?          MR.

In this circumstance --          QUESTION:  In this particular district, thisschool district, we're dealing with elementary grades?          MR.

MARCELLE:  If the Court -- if it wouldplease the Court, I have two quick points to make onrebuttal.  First, I believe there is a slight misstatementof the record.  At the cert petition, appendix H, page 6,it describes Milford School as a housing -- building ofboth elementary, junior high, and high school.  The schoolbuilding contains grades K-12, not just elementary school.          Second, with respect to the Equal Access Act, I                            52         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO          QUESTION:  Does the record show that there are alot of other children who were hanging around the schoolwhile this service is conducting -- conducted?  Is that inthe record? 1    believe Justice Scalia is right, it is only a mandate that 2    Congress passed it.  If a high school did certain things, 3    they would have to allow certain other high school groups. 4    There is nothing in the statute that makes it a 5    prohibition to it, even in the absence of the law, to 6    allow other groups. 7              QUESTION:  Can I ask as long as -- I would like8 you to -- 9              QUESTION:  This is on rebuttal.10              QUESTION:  I thought he was finished.  Do you11    have something else?12              MR. MARCELLE:  No, I'm finished, Justice.13              QUESTION:  I thought he was.  If you have an14    extra minute, I'd like just to get your view on what I'm15    finding is the most difficult part of this, which we may16    not reach.  To take the opponent's point on the17    establishment clause, suppose the city hall says every18    Sunday we can use the city hall as a church, we'll let19    church groups use it.  So every Sunday the city hall20    becomes a church.  Does that violate the establishment21 clause?22 23 24 25          MR. MARCELLE:  Not if it has a broad forum.  Itwould violate the statute --          QUESTION:  No, what they'll say is any group canuse it.  Now, what happens is that every Sunday the city53         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1    hall becomes a church and all the community goes there and2    gathers and prays.

I believe as long as the forum is open, the --and the State is neutral, that a reasonable observer wouldbe aware of the policy and the history and the context ofthe situation and wouldn't view that the State wasendorsing the religious ceremony, but, rather, theadherents who chose to avail themselves of the forum, theendorsement belongs really to the people who attend andnot be accredited to the State as long as the State didn'treally encourage or promote or recognize the --          QUESTION:  May I ask you a factual question?Does the record tell us how big the group was of thechildren involved in this club?          MR. MARCELLE:  How many, Justice Stevens?          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. MARCELLE:  Initially, at the time of makingthe application, there were 20, and we had opportunity touse the school for a year and a half, and at theconclusion of that, at the time we made our motion forsummary judgment, I believe, it was the same number.          QUESTION:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  You used it for a year and a half.54         ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.           1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.                     SUITE 400              WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005                   (202)289-2260                  (800) FOR DEPO1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9You actually did use it before the prohibition was issuedor what?          MR.

At what timedid you use it?          MR. MARCELLE:  At 3 o'clock, the high schoolresource room.1011121314151617181920    room?2122 23 24 25          QUESTION:  At 3 o'clock.  And was there anyevidence about whether other grammar school students werestill milling about when you were using it, lookinglongingly at the classroom where this was going on?          MR. MARCELLE:  No, Justice Scalia.  In fact --          QUESTION:  Go ahead.          MR. MARCELLE:  In fact, in the district court'sopinion, and for the preliminary injunction, it says sucha case would be unlikely.          QUESTION:  You say this was the high school          MR. MARCELLE:  Yes, a high school resource room,Justice Kennedy.          QUESTION:  Is the high school and the elementaryschool one facility?          MR.
