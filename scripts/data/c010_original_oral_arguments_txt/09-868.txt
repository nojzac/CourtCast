Kholi. Mr. Weisman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WEISMAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The issue before the Court today is whether a State court sentence reduction motion which is a pure plea for leniency qualifies as, quote, "an application for post-conviction or other collateral review" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2). The State respectfully argued there are at least three reasons why such a term as "collateral review" refers only to a legal challenge, refers to those recognized post-direct appeal applications in which constitutional, jurisdictional, and other such fundamental errors may be raised.First, as this Court has said, it is presumed -- Congress is presumed to have known the language that this Court used in its decisions, and the term "collateral review" has been used by this Court, certainly when referring to Federal 2255 applications,Official - Subject to Final Review3￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review41 as those type of independent civil inquiries testing the2 validity of a conviction and/or sentence -­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Weisman, the4 phrase is "post-conviction or other" -- "or other5 collateral review." And certainly the Rule 25 -- 356 motion is postconviction.7 So it's postconviction. It's not direct8 review. Why isn't that responsive?9 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I think both parties are10 in agreement, Your Honor, that the postconviction review11 is a part and parcel of the other collateral review.12 That's not -­13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Or" usually means it's14 something in addition.15 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, but it's -- with respect,16 Your Honor, it is "or other collateral review," and the17 "or other" -- and I think both parties are in agreement18 as to this -- "or other" embraces that State19 postconviction review must also be, quote/unquote,20 "collateral review."21 Also, I think importantly, it would be22 anomalous in a tolling provision, in which we are23 talking about the direct appeal already having been24 concluded, to embrace things that don't -- that don't -­25 that come prior to the direct appeal. This is a tolling￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review51 -- obviously, 2244(d)(1) speaks about the finality of a2 State court judgment of conviction. At that point,3 obviously -­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the -­5 you said -- you said "prior to." I thought the Rule 356 motion is made after the conviction.7 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it can be made -- it can8 be made prior to when the conviction becomes final. For9 example, it can be made within 120 days of the10 imposition of sentence. Or it can be made within11 120 days after the affirmance of the conviction on12 direct appeal of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. So it13 can be made prior to when the conviction becomes,14 quote/unquote, "final."15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't that true16 regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal17 relief or discretionary relief alone? That both can be18 made prior to the finality of the judgment?19 MR. WEISMAN: That is true, Your Honor.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and if I understand21 your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions22 that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2)23 language. It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek24 discretionary relief do not.25 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I'm not sure we conceded￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that point, Your Honor. I think clearly we're all in agreement that postconviction vehicles and habeas vehicles, which obviously all traditionally occur after the direct appeal has been concluded, obviously qualify as what this Court -- and everybody, we would suggest -­ recognizes as, quote/unquote, "collateral review."In terms of a Rule 35 motion that says, for example, the sentence is outside of the -- outside of the proper boundaries, it's unlawful as a matter of law, I don't think we've actually conceded before this Court that that would qualify. But certainly this Court -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would Rule 35 permit aOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewchallenge for a Federal violation? example of an illegal sentence that discretionary; am I correct?MR. WEISMAN: Not in -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Butpermit a legal challenge of the kind that Justice Kagan was asking?MR. WEISMAN: Correct. Our Rule 35 contains within the same provision a challenge to the legality of the sentence, to the manner in which it was imposed -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's assume a pure legal challenge.MR. WEISMAN: A pure legal challenge,Alderson Reporting CompanyYou've given an you think is6￼does Rule 35(a)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would Rule 35(a) be other collateral relief -­MR. WEISMAN: We would -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as designated by thestatute?MR. WEISMAN: We would suggest that this Court doesn't have to answer that question here. There are good arguments why it would not, again, because in a tolling provision that speaks about collateral review and, again, 2255 -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain again why you don't think this is collateral?MR. WEISMAN: Well, certainly when all you're doing, as the First Circuit recognized, is making a pure plea for leniency, sentence leniency, you'renot -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. Why is Rule 35, assuming it's a -- a challenge to an illegal sentence on a legal ground -­MR. WEISMAN: Well, it could be argued -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would it not be collateral review?MR. WEISMAN: Well, it could be argued that we're talking about vehicles that challenge the validityOfficial - Subject to Final Review7￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of a judgment that has already survived scrutiny under direct review. And a Rule 35 vehicle, even one that raises a legal challenge -- and a tolling provision simply would not begin to run at that point.JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't understand your argument at all. It seems to me the phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review" means postconviction collateral review or preconviction collateral review. Isn't that what is added? "Post-conviction or other"; what's "other" from "post-conviction"? I guess it would be preconviction, wouldn't it?MR. WEISMAN: Well, we would suggest, Your Honor, that the "collateral review," as explained by this Court, is referring to the difference between collateral review and direct review. And the case in -­JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. And is this direct review?MR. WEISMAN: This would not -- this is clearly not -- this is not in the direct review process. No, it's not.Official - Subject to Final Review8￼So-­JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's collateral review?MR. WEISMAN: Well -­JUSTICE SCALIA: So you lose.Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review91 MR. WEISMAN: This -- this Court, though,2 Your Honor, has said that, speaking about when Congress3 enacted 2255, it simplified the procedure for making a4 collateral attack on a final judgment entered in a5 Federal criminal case, but it did not purport to modify6 the distinction, again, between collateral review and7 direct review.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that if -- if9 there's anything to the point you're making, it -- it10 hinges not on the "post-conviction or other collateral"11 phrase, but rather on the word "review."12 I suppose it could be argued that you're not13 reviewing the judgment if you're asking for mercy.14 Whether a judgment was good or bad, you're -- you're15 asking for mercy. And I would -- you know, perhaps it's16 not review. Is that your point?17 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we go forward and use18 that -- even -- we would suggest, Your Honor, even more19 strongly that the phrase "collateral review," as that20 phrase has been used by this Court consistently,21 recognizes that this is a procedure that occurs after22 the completion of a direct review process.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only because24 all the cases we've had involved that. We've never had25 a case like this before. So in all those other cases,￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review101 we've used the natural term "collateral review." That2 doesn't mean it couldn't apply to this. It just means3 we've never had occasion to inquire whether it applies4 to this.5 MR. WEISMAN: But, Your Honor, respectfully,6 in State v. Addonizio itself, it contrasted the Rule 357 motion, for example. Many jurisdictions, including8 obviously the Federal courts, had this very -- almost9 exact Rule 35-type proceeding. It has never been10 referred to, it has never been understood in thousands11 of cases, as collateral review. It always had been12 understood as a -- sort of a quasi-civil inquiry, after13 the -­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weisman, I think that15 that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the16 Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the17 Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and18 that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about19 that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review. Am I20 wrong about that?21 MR. WEISMAN: We don't believe so, Your22 Honor.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: U.S. v. Robinson,24 Bartone v. United States. And I might be wrong about25 it.￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. WEISMAN: We don't believe it ever referred to a sentence -- a plea for sentence leniency, Your Honor, no, not -- not as a plea, a pure plea for leniency under Rule 35.rule -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the current FederalMR. WEISMAN: Yes.Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- provides for -- it's Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency? That's Rhode Island's?MR. WEISMAN: That's correct -- correct, Your Honor. We're just speaking about the pre-1987 guidelines rule, which is the same.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that we adopt your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and we could even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, it has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency, parole review boards, and so forth.I don't see why you don't lose anyway, because the allegation here, the complaint, theargument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion, and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal ground to set aside the -- the sentence.MR. WEISMAN: I think, Your Honor, we have11￼Alderson Reporting Company56 in a court,7 State.8 910 that that's11 standard is12 law. We've13 extra-legal.14JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a motion made reviewable by the appellate courts of theMR. WEISMAN: Well, it -- but -- but -­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd to say not legal. If -- an abuse of discretion something we're quite familiar with in the never thought of that as being somehowOfficial - Subject to Final Review121 to differentiate between a legal ground and the vehicle.2 Again, the vehicle, the reduction, the plea for leniency3 vehicle, is not a legal vehicle. It's simply, I think,4 as the Kholi panel recognized -­￼MR. WEISMAN: Well, to the extent it's abuse 15 of discretion, it's really shorthand for the appellate16 court takes a look; if the sentence is within the proper17 bounds and if there was, quote,18 the imposition of the sentence,19 just like on the -­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:21 justification, what do they do?22 MR. WEISMAN: If there's no justification --23 I mean, I can say it hasn't happened so far in our24 State, and I think -- you know, I don't know what25 happens in other States, but, essentially, that's allAlderson Reporting Company"some justification" for then it's affirmed. AndAnd if there's no25MR. WEISMAN: It's not much different atOfficial - Subject to Final Review131 the inquiry is. They take a look at the sentence; if2 it's in the legal bounds, the filing of the motion3 itself, as to pre-'87 guidelines, presumes the validity4 of the conviction and sentence, and it simply says:5 Give me a second chance; take a second look; look at the6 offender, look at the characteristics, look at what -­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those different8 than the characteristics that the sentencing judge looks9 at in the first instance?10 MR. WEISMAN:11 could be other. There is12 CHIEF JUSTICE13 these -- you've obviously14 haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions15 typically say -- do they typically concede the legal16 validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what? I17 mean, I assume the sentencing is -- is completely open18 and you can put in anything at all, like the -- the19 deprived childhood, the unique situation, the age,20 whatever.21 MR. WEISMAN: Correct.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In what sense is23 Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at24 sentencing?They could be the same.

It is -­2 it is simply -­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's bad for4 you, isn't it, I mean for the very point that Justice5 Kennedy was raising? If it's the same sort of arguments6 that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the7 imposition of sentencing, why should they not be8 considered legal matters when they're raised under Rule9 35?10 MR. WEISMAN: Because we don't believe they11 are legal matters, Your Honor. What they're asking for12 is sentence leniency based on pure factual matters like,13 as you indicated, Your Honor, Chief Justice, the history14 of the individual, the various -­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those issues16 that can be -- that are typically raised on direct -­17 direct review?18 MR. WEISMAN: No, they're not, Your Honor.19 We have a procedure whereby generally sentence reduction20 and sentencing issues must be raised pursuant to21 Rule 35.22 If I could -­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you quarrel with a24 statement in Mollicone, a Rhode Island 2000 decision25 that says we will interfere with the trial court's￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242515 discretion, vis-à-vis sentencing, only in rare instanceswhere the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from the other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses?standard?MR. WEISMAN: No.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that the reviewMR. WEISMAN: Correct, correct. What the -­Official - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is the standard of review, correct?MR. WEISMAN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please explain to me why that is not what Justice Kennedy described as a review for abuse of discretion and why a review for abuse of discretion is not a legal challenge?MR. WEISMAN: Well, what we suggest is the abuse of discretion that that is talking about is if there's no justification. They look -- again, they look at the sentence, and if there's no justification for it, then it will be an abuse of discretion. If there's some justification -- and, again, it hasn't happened. If there's some -- if the sentence is within the legal limits and there's some justification for it, it will be affirmed. That's -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Am I￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425misunderstanding you?MR. WEISMAN: That's the shorthand.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you saying that the Rhode Island appellate courts never change a sentence under Rule 35?MR. WEISMAN: We have not -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or are you saying that they do find some lack of justification in somesentences?MR. WEISMAN: No. What we're -- what we're saying, Your Honor, is if there's some justification for it and if it's within the legal sentencing bounds, the denial of the Rule 35 motion is affirmed. And that happens all the time.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then think you're saying that it only gets reversed for abuse of discretion, right?MR. WEISMAN: Well, Your Honor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a legal ground, it seems to me. And I don't know how you could say that that's a plea for leniency. It's a plea that -- that the sentencing court abused its discretion and should have given a lesser sentence. How is that leniency? It's abuse of discretion.MR. WEISMAN: Because the inquiry is simplyOfficial - Subject to Final Review16￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review171 -- I understand the words "abuse of discretion" are2 used, but the "no justification and manifestly excessive3 standard" simply, as the cases explicate, looks at the4 sentence; if it's legal and if there's some5 justification for it, the appeal is denied.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to7 figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by8 jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion9 review or a leniency review or this or that. And10 that -- that makes me inclined to say we should treat11 your Rule 35 as coming within the tolling provision, so12 we don't have to grapple with -- I mean, I'm not having13 very much success understanding the distinction that14 you're telling me. I don't want to have to do this for15 50 States.16 MR. WEISMAN: I understand. But certainly,17 Your Honor, just -- just using the formulation that18 everything that's filed in a State court post a judgment19 of conviction qualifies would certainly be an odd way20 for that Congress to have expressed that.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you read the -- the22 relevant provision of the Rule 35? I mean, there are23 two categories, the ones about legal challenges, at24 least as I read the rule, and -­25 MR. WEISMAN: Yes.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review181 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Read the relevant part of2 Rule 35.3 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, certainly, Your Honor:4 "The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time."5 Period. "The court may correct a sentence imposed in an6 illegal manner, and it may reduce any sentence when a7 motion is filed within 120 days after sentence is8 imposed or within 120 days after receipt by the court of9 a mandate."10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're talking about11 reducing -­12 MR. WEISMAN: We're talking -- this case13 involves only a motion to reduce sentence. And14 certainly the policy considerations for what Congress15 would have intended -­16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry.17 Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce18 sentence is very short. It just says that the man19 "prays that the sentence imposed with respect to the20 above matter be reduced in accordance with the21 provisions of Rule 35." Would it make a difference to22 you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he23 prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to24 the above matter be reduced in accordance with25 provisions of Rule 35?￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. WEISMAN: It might be.JUSTICE KAGAN: If he had put in that word, "illegal," would that have made the difference?MR. WEISMAN: It might, Your Honor. And under our system, it might -- that might have been characterized, not as a sentence reduction provision or sentence reduction vehicle, but as a legal motion to correct an illegal sentence, or challenging the sentence.JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- but that does suggest the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we're going to have to look at the particular rule of the State, we're going to have to look at the particular motion, we're going to look at any -- we're going to have to look at any State law regarding how motions are construed.MR. WEISMAN: Sure.JUSTICE KAGAN: And this is going to be a very difficult determination.MR. WEISMAN: Sure. If I could just address that, Your Honor. The problem is -- it's simply because a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, these are matters that already are going to have been concluded in the State court. Before anyone files for 2254, the State's court's going to have findings.Official - Subject to Final Review19￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review201 They're going to -- it's either going to be a motion for2 sentence leniency or it's going to be a motion to3 correct an illegal sentence.4 These matters -- and they have to be pled by5 the State as well. So when an applicant goes to Federal6 court, district court, and files a 2254, if we want to7 raise the affirmative defense of the time bar, which8 will save the Federal court a lot of time, obviously,9 because there is no case at all -- and if we can10 contrast it with exhaustion, for example, which, as this11 Court obviously is familiar with, presents very12 complicated questions of whether, you know, State13 procedures were exhausted and claims were exhausted,14 this is very straightforward. If somebody raises a15 motion which challenges the legality of the sentence, it16 will be characterized in State court in the run of the17 mine -- in the run of the mine cases, as an18 illegal sentence.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a petitioner in the20 future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says:21 I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal22 sentence -- make something up -­23 MR. WEISMAN: Right.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or for leniency. And25 then are district courts supposed to figure out whether￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the legal challenge was frivolous or not or had a basis in law or fact -­MR. WEISMAN: Well -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and then decide whether they would toll or not toll based on that now side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just a plea for leniency? That's what you are proposing?MR. WEISMAN: Well, what we suggest actually is very straightforward, Your Honor. If somebody captions their document, you know, "Motion for sentence" -- "for sentence reduction and motion to correct an illegal sentence," that's not this case, obviously, because then the court -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what if they say "correct the illegal sentence because it was an abuse of discretion"?MR. WEISMAN: If it's -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is the magic words "illegal sentence" or is the magic words "abuse of" -­ what are the magic words?MR. WEISMAN: Well, it may not so much be magic words, but it's what the -- as this Court has said, it's what the substance of the motion seeks, and that will already have been determined in State court.JUSTICE SCALIA: Either -- either yourOfficial - Subject to Final Review21￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review221 victory will give you absolutely nothing, or you have2 truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island. I mean,3 why would anybody not caption the 35 motion that way?4 MR. WEISMAN: Because -­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's to lose? You say it6 doesn't matter if your claim of an illegal sentence is7 frivolous or not. What's to lose?8 MR. WEISMAN: Because, Your Honor, they9 actually want to reduce their sentence. It's not -- we10 don't suggest it's not a matter of playing games. They11 -- you know, they feel they were sentenced for 30 years12 and maybe they want 20 years, and if they want to13 challenge the legality of the sentence, they recognize14 the established collateral attack vehicles.15 JUSTICE ALITO: There is another argument16 that you could make, other than the one you've been17 pressing, which is that collateral review means18 something other than a step in the criminal case. But19 you've chosen not to make that; is that correct?20 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we've spoken about the21 words "collateral review" as embracing a case that's22 already -- upon looking -- a proceeding that occurs23 after the finality of the judgment, which obviously24 includes this Court's denial of cert or the time -­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you've said that this￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 could be done before finality. I thought -- I -­2 MR. WEISMAN: No.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure you said that4 earlier, that this motion can be made before the5 judgment is final. Didn't you say that?67 Your Honor. And we would suggest -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what you9 just said.10 MR. WEISMAN: No -­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: What you just said is after12 the finality. Which is it?13 MR. WEISMAN: We would suggest, Your Honor,14 that that furthers our argument. A Rule 35 motion is15 not collateral review because it is not a motion -- you16 could say even in a legal sense, motion. It's not a17 motion that occurs after the judgment becomes final.18 And we're looking at a tolling provision, and the19 congressional intent of the tolling provision was20 finality and exhaustion of State remedies.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not sure22 I understand that. There's nothing in this rule that23 bars a litigant from filing after the conviction is24 final. They have 120 days.25 MR. WEISMAN: They have 120 days. It can beMR. WEISMAN: It can. It certainly can,23￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review241 filed after the sentence is imposed, 120 days of that2 date, or 120 days after the conviction becomes final.3 And we would suggest that the term "collateral review"4 embraces, as Justice Alito indicated, sort of that5 concept that, obviously in a tolling provision, it6 begins to run when the conviction becomes final.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia's8 suggestion -­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that it says -­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that perhaps11 the leniency review is -- is not review of the12 conviction or sentence.

And that's21 undoubtedly true in the sense that it's not -- it's not22 part of the direct review process. It's -- it's clearly23 not. But that doesn't mean it's collateral review.24 It's not either/or. It could be -­25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what -- is itMR. WEISMAN: It's clearly not, Your Honor, think, as everybody here recognizes, the and the Respondents in this case as wellAlderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something in between? It's not direct and it's not collateral?MR. WEISMAN: It's -- it's neither fish nor fowl, Your Honor. I mean, simply because it's not part of a direct review process doesn't mean that it's, quote, our argument would be, "collateral review," because, again, "collateral review" has this sort of meaning in the law, using this Court's decisions, using this Court's cases, referring to a post-judgment vehicle in which fundamental jurisdictional and other types of errors can be raised.JUSTICE ALITO: What about a motion -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we need a new adjective then, because I'd always thought that there are two kinds of review, direct and collateral. You say there's a -- a tertium quid. What do you want us to call that?MR. WEISMAN: Well, I don't know that it needs to be called anything, Your Honor. I think the only question with respect -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that maybe it doesn't need to be called anything because it doesn't exist. I -- I can't -­MR. WEISMAN: Well -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- imagine anything thatOfficial - Subject to Final Review25￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 isn't either direct or collateral.2 MR. WEISMAN: -- it is certainly -- it is3 certainly an interesting vehicle because, it can be4 filed prior to the finality of the judgment and it can5 be filed -- and it can be filed after the judgment6 becomes final.7 And, again, going -- going back to the8 policies, the 2244(d)(2), very clearly, two big9 policies, again, are finality, which obviously it10 promotes -- these cases would not be in Federal court if11 they were time-barred -- and exhaustion of State12 remedies. To have a motion that seeks leniency only,13 there's no purpose that could be accomplished by14 bringing that motion into Federal court, and therefore15 it doesn't serve that purpose.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Weisman, that's17 true also of State habeas claims that are based only on18 State law. But six circuits have said that 2244(d)(2)19 applies to those claims. Are you contesting that?20 MR. WEISMAN: We're not. But the -- but the21 important element there, Your Honor, is that those22 vehicles can be raised to bring -- those are the23 vehicles, the collateral vehicles, through which the24 States have channelled constitutional, jurisdictional,25 and other fundamental claims.26￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242527The Rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle doesn't -- can't do it, can't do that service. So, sure, you could have -- you could have a habeas, and the only issue, the only claim raised in habeas could be, you know, it's in violation of -- of my State rights, which couldn't be heard in 2254, but -­JUSTICE KAGAN: Where the exhaustion policy does not come into effect.MR. WEISMAN: Exactly. But Congress may have well said we're not going to be in the business of looking at the individual claims. Look, this is a collateral review vehicle. This vehicle is a recognized vehicle for bringing, for channeling in these claims.So that's going to toll.But this other vehicle, this Rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle -- it can never be used for a claim that could go to Federal court. It's pointless.I mean, it wouldn't serve the purpose, and of course it would undermine the State's interest in getting the State prisoners into Federal court within 1 year.Official - Subject to Final Review￼Honor.I'll reserve my time if that's okay, YourCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR. WEISMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mizner.Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. MIZNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The First Circuit here correctly held that Khalil Kholi's motion for a reduction of sentence under Rhode Island Rule 35 was an application for State postconviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim. As such, it tolled AEDPA's 1-year limitation period, and Mr. Kholi's petition was timely filed.We look to the common usage and ordinary understanding of the words of the tolling provision in the context of the statute. Collateral review is a proceeding occurring after final judgment that could affect that judgment.JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct that you think "post-conviction or other collateral review" means anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct review?MS. MIZNER: Yes, for purposes of the tolling provision.JUSTICE ALITO: Then what does the phrase "or other collateral review" add? Why -- why wouldn't Congress just say "post-conviction review"?Official - Subject to Final Review28￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242529MS. MIZNER: In Duncan, this Court talked about the possibility of civil commitment or contempt in custody that could be part of the Rule 2254 proceeding and that that would not be postconviction. So that postconviction is a form of collateral review but is not the only form.In Duncan, the Court also discussed the fact that many States may call what other States call"post-conviction review" something else, and that that would also then be collateral. The collateral is just a -- an umbrella that encompasses postconviction and other forms of review after a judgment.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you just call your motion a motion to correct an illegalsentence? Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I gather.MS. MIZNER: Under the State's theory, there would not be. I did not file this motion.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not one of the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before.(Laughter.)MS. MIZNER: I may be in other respects, Your Honor, but not this one.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure of that. But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoeverOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review301 files these motions had simply said that, there would be2 no problem, right?3 MS. MIZNER: From the State's perspective.4 I don't think that there's a problem with omitting the5 word "illegal," because -­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's because7 you want something other than legal review, right? You8 want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court.9 You've got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality10 of the sentence, but this is something different, right?11 This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but12 you say but it should still be reduced for a lot of13 reasons.14 MS. MIZNER: Yes. It is a request for the15 court to -- to review, to take a second look, to16 reexamine the sentence to determine whether or not it17 was unduly severe at the time that it was imposed. You18 are asking the court to -- to take a second look, either19 based on factors that were submitted at sentencing or20 additional information that -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can raise all of22 those -- all of those claims under the normal State23 collateral postconviction, State habeas, all those other24 things, right?25 MS. MIZNER: You can raise those issues￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review311 under the postconviction review. You can also raise2 them -- in Rhode Island, there is a provision of the3 postconviction review statute that speaks of the -- any4 facts that would require a new proceeding in the5 interests of justice.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess I'm7 having trouble. You can -- the various grounds on which8 the sentence should have been lower than it was,9 including the fact that setting the sentence at that10 level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can11 raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on12 direct review, right?13 MS. MIZNER: In Rhode Island, you cannot14 challenge your sentence on direct review.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you challenge it16 on -- in State habeas?17 MS. MIZNER: You challenge it by way of the18 Rule 35 motion.￼1920 vehicle you 212223 vehicle you 2425 is used forCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the only have -­MS.

You can't say that on direct review?MS. MIZNER: Under my understanding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions, the answer to that is no.JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can challenge only the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review? MS. MIZNER: I believe that that is theholding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -­CHIEF JUSTICE: In what -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that Rule 35 is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before seeking Federal habeas?MS. MIZNER: Exhaustion for Federal habeas32￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review331 is limited to exhaustion of the claims that are going to2 be presented in the Federal habeas petition. And since3 a -- the denial of a request for a sentence reduction on4 the grounds of abuse of discretion is not going to be a5 claim that is cognizable in Federal habeas corpus6 jurisdiction, then you would not need to exhaust it.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is the whole8 purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal9 statute, the purpose to give the petitioner an10 opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?11 MS. MIZNER: Exhaustion is one of the12 purposes of the tolling provision, but this Court has13 recognized that AEDPA's purpose was to further the14 principles of comity and finality and federalism, and15 had a clear purpose of encouraging litigants to pursue16 claims in State court prior to seeking Federal review.17 So, tying the tolling provision to State18 applications shows congressional concern for comity,19 which at its core is a -- is a respect for the State20 processes that are used in reviewing the claims of State21 prisoners.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I may have23 asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want24 to make sure of the answer. Your -- you have a client25 who is convicted of a particular offense that results in￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242534a sentence of, what, zero to 5 years, okay? And the judge, in imposing the sentence, engages in racial discrimination. It turns out that he sentences African-Americans to 5 years and Caucasian defendants to 2 years. That, you're telling me, is a claim that you cannot raise on direct review or on -- in State habeas?MS. MIZNER: It would be raised in the State Rule 35, a motion to correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say it "would be raised." Are you saying it can only be raised under Rule 35?MS. MIZNER: It could be raised under the State postconviction review proceedings as well.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what I would have thought. So Rule 35 is not the only vehicle for challenging a sentence?MS. MIZNER: No.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- your adversary saidthe contrary, and I was -- you're flip-flopping. Can this be brought on a direct appeal or not?MS. MIZNER: No, not -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A non-legal sentence? MS. MIZNER: Not on direct appeal. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what did you meanOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 when you answered the Chief Justice2 brought in collateral proceedings?3 MS.

MIZNER: The -­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so your adversary,8 when he gets up on rebuttal, can confirm or not this9 point, any challenge to an illegal sentence has to be10 brought first in a Rule 35(a) motion, regardless of what11 the grounds of the illegality are?12 MS. MIZNER: Yes, or perhaps in a motion for13 postconviction relief under section 10-9.1.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I return to the question15 Justice Ginsburg asked a couple of minutes ago? We have16 -- let's say we have a case in which a defendant17 convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal18 claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal19 habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of20 sentence based purely on a request for leniency, a21 sentence within the range prescribed by the statute.22 What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the23 Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for24 leniency in the State court? Now, you say comity, but25 in concrete practical terms, what purpose is served?35￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MS. MIZNER: A prisoner2 adequate relief in the State court,3 vehicle, may choose not to pursue a4 corpus claim.5 JUSTICE ALITO: In your6 that happen a lot? You have somebody who is sentenced7 to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also8 has legal challenges that would result in no conviction,9 no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction -- that10 person decides to give up on the legal challenge because11 the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1?12 MS. MIZNER: I would say that would be13 unlikely, but there are many Federal habeas cases that14 are -- raise questions of, for example, ineffective15 assistance of counsel at sentencing. A State resolution16 that reduces the sentence would obviate the need for a17 Federal habeas petition in that context.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain -­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you look at 2255 -­20 that's the Federal postconviction review, and it also21 has a 1-year statute of limitations. That limitation22 would not be tolled for a Federal Rule 35 motion. So23 why should it be tolled for State?24 MS. MIZNER: 2255, Justice Ginsburg, has no25 tolling provision at all, and the reason for that maywho receives through whatever Federal habeasexperience, does36￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review371 perhaps be the respect for comity that Congress2 recognized when you are addressing a 2254 petition filed3 by a State prisoner.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think, Ms. Mizner, the5 amicus brief in this case asserted that, in Rhode Island6 or in other States with a rule like this, many judges7 sit on these Rule 35 motions. They just let them stay8 pending for a considerable period of time, in order to9 retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when10 they feel like doing so. Is that your understanding of11 what happens to these motions, that they just sit, that12 they are not denied?13 MS. MIZNER: I don't practice in Rhode14 Island, but in this case the Rule 35 did not sit. It15 was resolved by the trial court within 3 months. The16 issue, the potential for abuse from sitting on motions17 is not limited to a Rhode Island Rule 35. It's not a18 peculiar concern.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the20 question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not21 that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good22 thing. The idea is you've got a motion for reduction of23 sentence because of mercy, and the judge might say:24 Well, I'm inclined to exercise mercy if you come out of25 the rehab program in a good way, if it turns out after￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review381 the first several months that you're a model prisoner.2 In other words, it's not a question of abuse, it's a3 good thing; and if we start saying that the time for4 Federal habeas is tolled, judges might be inclined not5 to exercise such charity based on the prisoner's conduct6 after conviction.7 MS. MIZNER: Well, the Rule 35 also provides8 that the decision must be made within a reasonable time.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 120 days, right?10 MS. MIZNER: No, 120 days is the time11 frame -­12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For filing?13 MS. MIZNER: -- within which the motion must14 be filed.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.16 MS. MIZNER: The rule also provides that it17 must be decided, resolved, within a reasonable time. So18 there is a -- a limitation in that respect.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any indication20 in the case law what a reasonable time consists of?21 MS. MIZNER: I have not found any Rhode22 Island cases discussing that particular question.23 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you go back for a24 second? Imagine a defendant is convicted of robbery and25 he's sentenced to 10 years. He thinks there is an error￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in my conviction of a legal nature, and he thinks there is another error in my -- in my sentence of a legal nature. Now, I take it in Rhode Island he files an appeal to consider the first.MS. MIZNER: Yes, Justice Breyer.JUSTICE BREYER: And as to the second, he files a Rule 35 motion.MS. MIZNER: That's my understanding of Rhode Island -­JUSTICE BREYER: And when does he file the Rule 35 motion? Because it says at any time.MS.

MIZNER: I'm sorry.JUSTICE BREYER: It has nothing to do with mercy. I want to know how it works. He says there's a legal error in my sentence. When -- how does he get that corrected?MS. MIZNER: A defendant would have an interest in getting it corrected as soon as possible.JUSTICE BREYER: I have -- I'm not -- don't take what I have as my view. I just want the fact. I'mOfficial - Subject to Final Review39￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242540 asking you a fact. When -- how and when does the personcorrect the legal error in his sentence?MS. MIZNER: He could correct it by filingthe motion at any time, and -­ JUSTICE BREYER: Where?MS. MIZNER: In the trial court.JUSTICE BREYER: And if the trial court says no, what does he do?MS. MIZNER: He appeals that.JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Okay. So now we have two appeals. One is from the judgment ofconviction; another is from the judgment imposing the sentence. Now, the Federal statute says a 1-year period of limitation shall apply from the date on which the judgment became final. Correct?MS. MIZNER: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. When is the date on which the judgment of the sentence became final?MS. MIZNER: If both appeals are pending at the same time, the practice would be to consolidate them, so you would have a ruling from the Rhode Island Supreme Court -­JUSTICE BREYER: And if they are not appealing -- they are not -- they are not at the same time, then what?Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. MIZNER: Then the judgment would become final when the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and either this Court -­JUSTICE BREYER: Why not the sentence?MS. MIZNER: You may have two time frames -­ JUSTICE BREYER: In April, they affirm theconviction. In June, they affirm the sentence. Do those 2 months -- does the date on which the judgment became final by conclusion of direct review, does that run from April or from June?MS. MIZNER: I would say June.JUSTICE BREYER: June. Okay. Now, suppose he doesn't -- suppose that there were no appeal fromthe -- I see. Our problem is that there is no appeal from the judgment -- from the sentence where he asks for correction as a matter of mercy and not law.MS. MIZNER: There may be an appeal -­ JUSTICE BREYER: There may be?MS. MIZNER: -- from such -- from the denialof a Rule 35.JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to figureout is why, if you're willing to call, for purposes of one -- the 1-year statute begins to run from the time the direct appeal becomes final. Why is it a direct appeal of a sentence where you appeal the matter of lawOfficial - Subject to Final Review41￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242542 and it isn't a direct appeal of a sentence where you askfor mercy? It's the same rule. It's the same procedure.MS. MIZNER: It -- the Rule 35 -­JUSTICE BREYER: This would help you just as much, I imagine. I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind.MS. MIZNER: Rhode Island's manner of addressing the Rule 35 seems to be somewhat unusual in terms of -­JUSTICE BREYER: I know. You see, my basic question is: Why -- look, two appeals; one judgment, one sentence. Okay? January, June. You're prepared to say the 1-year statute does not begin to -- to run until June. Fine. The Rule 35 motion, when you took an appeal, became final for purposes of the Federal habeas statute in June.So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever that's decided finally? Why is it collateral at all? Why isn't it direct, just as your first one was direct?MS. MIZNER: If the Rule 35 motion is filed after the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirms thejudgment with -­JUSTICE BREYER: Wait a minute. Judgment ofOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review431 what? Judgment of conviction -­2 MS.

The5 Rule -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: That's not the same reason7 that it doesn't become final when you haven't appealed8 your sentence yet, or when they haven't -- they didn't9 consolidate.10 I am quite confused, as you see, as to how11 this all works in Rhode Island. I -- Rhode Island -- I12 used to be on the First Circuit. I know it has some13 special ways of doing things that are sometimes14 different, and this is different.15 MS. MIZNER: It is, Justice Breyer. And I16 have not seen any Rhode Island cases addressing a17 Rule 35 motion that was not filed after the judgment of18 conviction had been affirmed in the context of looking19 for a discretionary reduction of sentence.20 JUSTICE BREYER: There must be in Rhode21 Island some complaints about the sentence.22 MS.

They would say you have to go back and make a Rule 35 motion in the trial court? Maybe that's the procedure.MS. MIZNER: That is -­JUSTICE ALITO: It seems odd. Is that it? MS.

MIZNER: I do not have that with me.JUSTICE ALITO: Could I return you to something more basic? Do you think the term "collateral review" is a legal term of art, or is it a term that we can -- we should interpret simply by looking up the word "collateral" in a dictionary?Official - Subject to Final Review44￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242545MS. MIZNER: Well, this Court has discussed the -- has used the term "collateral review" in a -- a number of different contexts, in civil cases, in habeas cases, in the -- in the manner of distinguishing between direct review and something that is outside direct review.JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't -- if I look up "collateral attack" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I find a definition there? And won't it tell me that this is something other than the proceeding? This is an attack on a judgment outside of the proceeding that led to the entry of that judgment. Isn't that what the term generally means?MS. MIZNER: "Collateral" generally means supplementary, as defined in Black's, and "collateralOfficial - Subject to Final Review￼attack" in Black's is defined as an attack on a in a proceeding other than direct appeal.JUSTICE ALITO: Right.MS.

Is that collateral, or is -­5 is that part of the -- the criminal proceeding?6 MS. MIZNER: The motions for new trial -- a7 motion for a new trial that has to be filed within 10 or8 14 days of the conviction would be part of the direct9 appeal and therefore would be -- would not be10 collateral. But a motion for a new trial that is filed11 after the judgment is affirmed by a court of appeals and12 the time for cert has passed would be collateral.13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's wrong with the14 argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case15 itself is collateral? What Congress had in mind when it16 spoke about collateral review was something like habeas.17 Let me give you an alternative18 interpretation of this, and maybe it's completely wrong,19 but you'll tell me why it's wrong.20 "Post-conviction" is a term of art. Many21 States, including Rhode Island, have postconviction22 review statutes. So Congress wanted to have that time,23 the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were24 pending tolled. But not every State uses that phrase.25 Not every State uses that term. They have other names￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review471 for the proceeding, and that's what's meant by "other2 collateral review." "Collateral review" is a term of3 art. It's not something that you understand by looking4 up the word "collateral" in a dictionary.5 What's wrong with that?6 MS. MIZNER: There is no indication that7 Congress was limiting the use of the term "collateral8 review" to a postconviction legal challenge. Congress9 could have said that if it had wished.10 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not saying it has to do11 with whether it's legal or something else. It has to do12 with whether it's in the criminal case or not in the13 criminal case.14 MS. MIZNER: Traditionally, motions that are15 filed -- motions for a new trial are -- may be filed16 after the judgment has been affirmed and have been17 viewed by the courts as collateral, as collateral18 review. So there is -- the tradition doesn't limit the19 use of the term "collateral review" to a proceeding that20 is completely separate and apart.21 Indeed, a 2255, while it may be separately22 filed, is then consolidated with the original23 proceeding, and there's an entry in the docket -- you24 shall not file any more pleadings in that separate case.25 It all goes back to the original case. The 2255, which￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is collateral, is heard by the trial court.So there is a -- there is no reason toassume that Congress was limiting collateral review to something outside of the original proceeding.JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -­JUSTICE ALITO: 2255 is -- is in the original case, but it's a habeas substitute. It was adopted by Congress as a substitute for habeas; isn't that right?MS. MIZNER: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that a petition for clemency that's presented to the governor would toll the limitations period?MS. MIZNER: No, I do not, Justice Kagan. JUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why is thatdifferent?MS. MIZNER: Because 2244(d)(2) is tolling an application for review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim. And a -- an application for clemency doesn't produce any change in the judgment that is rendered by the court. It's not a request that is related to the legal reasoning behind a judgment; it doesn't challenge the basis for the judgment. And it's an executive branch function, in some cases with advice and consent of a legislative body. And there's noOfficial - Subject to Final Review48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 judicial review. So it is -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be right,3 but I don't think that's the reason. I -- I thought we4 had held that the word "filed" in the petition means5 filed in a court, not filed with the governor. It's -­6 it's the word "filed" in -- in the tolling provision7 that -- that does the work.8 MS. MIZNER: I would agree.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You think it doesn't10 matter that -- I mean, a Rule 35 motion is a motion made11 in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of12 it. So isn't a collateral attack a sort of -- another13 proceeding to the side of the main proceeding, but the14 Rule 35 motion is filed in the criminal proceeding15 itself?16 MS. MIZNER: Yes, it is, Justice Ginsburg,17 as is a Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on newly18 discovered evidence, which courts have held to be19 collateral. It's a question of -- of when these motions20 are filed that makes them collateral. They are not part21 of the direct review process.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if this was -- if this23 motion had been filed before judgment, which can happen,24 before the judgment is final, then there would be no25 tolling?49￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review501 MS.

WEISMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WEISMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'll begin -- if I could just clarifyregarding the scope of Rule 35. The reporter's notes to Rule 35 do make it very clear that an illegal sentence is one which has been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under law. It includes, e.g., a sentence in excess of that provided by statute, imposition of an unauthorized form of punishment, a judgment that does not conform to the oral sentence.And our supreme court has gone on to explain this provision by saying: We have never -- we have never countenanced a challenge to the constitutionality of a penal statute in the context of a Rule 35 motion, nor have we declared that a sentence imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional statute is illegal as contemplated by Rule 35.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, I -- you were speaking so fast, I didn't follow you.Official - Subject to Final Review52￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. WEISMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Perhaps we can go back to the simple question, which is, can a defendant who has been sentenced bring a challenge to a sentence in a direct appeal or not? Or do they have to go by Rule 35(a)?MR. WEISMAN: Although there is dicta and some language where our supreme court says essentially file challenges to your sentences pursuant to Rule 35, it is clear that only certain types of challenges can be brought in a Rule 35 motion. In the run of the mill cases, they have to be brought if there is an appellate record in direct appeal, or most commonly they're brought pursuant to the State's postconviction relief.Official - Subject to Final Review53￼get to can't.directJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So now we the point where some can go under 35(a) but someMR. WEISMAN: Right.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they should go on appeal, correct?MR.

And our -­JUSTICE BREYER: Which is the judgment pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became final by conclusion of direct review?MR.

Then there's the conclusion of direct review in respect to the judgment in respectto which he the statuteis being held in custody. I'm just reading -­MR.

WEISMAN: Well, under Jiminez v.

That's contradictory.MR.
