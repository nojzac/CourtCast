Rubina Mr. Harakas. Am I pronouncingcorrectly?ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERHusain. your namethe Court:the Warsaw Convention created a treaty which set forth the circumstances under which air carrier liability should be created in the event of passenger injury or death. The legal regime they created recognized there's circumstances where the passenger should be entitled to a cause of action, but it also expressly recognized the need to limit that liability and set forth certain conditions when that limited liability would apply. Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention creates a presumption of liability but onlyMR. HARAKAS: Yes, Your Honor.Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please Over 70 years ago, the drafters of(11:04 a.m.)￼when three conditions precedent are satisfied.One, there has to be an accident in which the passenger suffers a bodily injury or dies and the accident took place on board the aircraft or during the course ofembarking or disembarking.3Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425The issue before the Court here today -- we're dealing with the accident condition precedent. Was that satisfied in this case?Of course, the -- the Court in Saks in 1985 specifically addressed the issue of what is an accident, and the Court defined an accident as an unusual and unexpected event that's external to the passenger.Of a particular importance to this case is where the Court declined to extend the accident and encompass an injury that results from the passenger's own internal condition and -- and in response to the normal and expected operations of the aircraft.Thus, until recently, the courts have held that injuries arising out of the passenger's preexisting medical conditions do not satisfy the accident condition precedent even if there were allegations of air carrier negligence.QUESTION: I take it you don't take the position that -- that, let's say, any death resulting in part as a result of one, but not the only, cause of the preexisting conditions is thereby excluded from the -- the class of liability.MR. HARAKAS: I think you have -- Justice --QUESTION: Every -- in other words, having a heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against4Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 liability if somebody dies of a heart attack per se.2 You're not taking that position.3 MR. HARAKAS: Our position is that if somebody4 is on board an aircraft and they die of a heart attack,5 that is -- that is not an -- that's a -- the passenger's6 own internal reaction and it just happened to be -- the7 passengers happened to be on board the aircraft.8 QUESTION: Sure, if -- if they're simply sitting9 in the seat and nothing unusual happens and they have a10 heart attack and die, sure, there's no liability. But if11 there are other conditions -- and the argument here is12 that there are other conditions -- and the heart attack13 was merely a contributing cause -- it was a condition upon14 which those other conditions acted -- that does not -- the15 existence of the heart condition does not immunize Olympic16 Airlines against liability. That's -- I don't think17 that's your argument, is it?18 MR. HARAKAS: Well, no. What the argument is --19 and in this case here, you have to look to what is the20 injury-producing event? The injury-producing event21 here --22 QUESTION: And -- and they say the injury-23 producing event is -- or one of the -- the analyses is the24 unexpected refusal of the airline personnel to allow this25 individual to get moved into a smoke-free zone. And that5Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 unusual and unexpected event, combined with the smoke and2 the heart condition, caused the death. But it was the3 unexpected refusal to remove from a smoke zone that is the4 unexpected event or occurrence that is the accident. What5 is your answer to that?6 MR. HARAKAS: I respectfully disagree with the7 characterization, which was adopted by the court below, in8 that in this case you have to -- you -- you can't just9 simply look to the fact that you had the flight attendant10 saying we're not going to move you. He was assigned a11 non-smoking seat. He --12 QUESTION: He was assigned a non-smoking seat13 which happened to be in a zone with smoke.14 MR. HARAKAS: Well, in -- on board any aircraft,15 when smoking is allowed, you have ambient cigarette smoke16 throughout the aircraft, and in this case you have to look17 to -- it can't be disputed that this passenger reacted to18 the cigarette smoke and the injury-producing event19 indirect --￼2021 row 48. 2223 Ginsburg.24 aircraft when you -- when they used to allow smoking on25 the aircraft, as at this time, you could be 10 rows away6Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: But less in -- less in row 15 than inMR. HARAKAS: That's -- that's correct, Justice However, when you have -- when you -- in any1 and you would still be exposed to that ambient cigarette2 smoke.3 But the point we have to look to is with respect4 to the Warsaw Convention is what type of liability did5 they want to create. You know, when we get into issues of6 straying away from the direct cause -- because when we7 look to almost every single Warsaw Convention accident8 case, the focus has always been on what is that direct9 injury-producing event. When we start inserting common10 law concepts of --11 QUESTION: Well, you say direct, are -- are you12 trying to make the -- the act omission distinction?13 MR. HARAKAS: Well, the act and -- in one14 respect, but -- but in the broader sense, you have to look15 to is what has always been the event the courts have16 looked to, what did the drafters intend the event -- the17 -- the cause to be? It's not -- I don't think it's proper18 to inject full-blown common law notions of proximate19 causation.20 QUESTION: No -- no one is -- no one is making21 the common -- I don't think is making the common law22 argument here. They're saying it was unexpected as a23 matter of fact that somebody who wanted a -- a smokeless24 seat, who found there was smoke in the area of the seat25 and who was asked to be moved, would be refused by the7Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 airline. That is the unexpected event.2 MR. HARAKAS: But -- but that's what courts have3 done after the Supreme Court's decision here by the Court4 in Tseng because at that time, before Tseng, courts used5 to find that it didn't matter whether you had allegations6 of true negligence because we do have to look to --7 QUESTION: The -- the point is the allegations8 are not of negligence, which is a legal and normative9 conclusion.10 MR. HARAKAS: Yes.11 QUESTION: The allegation is simply, as a matter12 of fact, it is not to be expected that a stewardess would13 stand there and say, no, you can't move him. Whether it14 was negligent or not negligent, it simply was unexpected15 as a matter of fact, and they're saying that satisfies the16 unexpected event.17 MR. HARAKAS: I -- I disagree. I don't think18 that satisfies the unexpected event.19 QUESTION: Well, it could and it is different20 from ordinary negligence. I mean, it is conceivable at21 least that to have an airline stewardess say no when the22 policy of the airline and the standard generally is to the23 contrary and to say, no, I will not consider moving you24 even though there were seats further away from the smoke25 origin.8Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HARAKAS: I don't believe in the -- for purposes of the article 17 accident analysis, you -- you -- your -- you should or should be allowed or it's proper to go beyond looking to asking what is that injury- producing event.In this instance here, we have to remember too that, yes, there were three requests to be moved. However, the passenger himself never asked to be moved. It was always through his wife. He was a doctor. He knew his own condition. I mean, we can all get into the whole reasonableness issue, but what happened --defense.QUESTION: Which -- which is a matter ofQUESTION: Yes.MR. HARAKAS: Yes, it's a matter of defense. QUESTION: But Justice O'Connor's question and￼my question is -- is the question that goes to whether you get into court to defend. And you're -- you're giving us a -- an argument that, in effect, we weren't negligent.MR. HARAKAS: No.QUESTION: But our questions were wasn't it unexpected in fact that somebody would be in the position that this passenger was in.MR. HARAKAS: I don't -- well, I think that's where the courts below and where you get -- where you can9Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 cross the lines and confuse the concepts of negligence and2 causation in this case because here you could say was it3 unusual, unexpected for a -- for a -- when a passenger4 makes a request to be moved. In a certain sense, yes, you5 could say that it was -- it could unusual, unexpected, but6 I think you have to come back to is but is that the7 injury-producing event. And that's what the courts look8 to.9 QUESTION: Were there other seats available in10 the economy section?11 MR. HARAKAS: There were other seats available,12 Chief Justice.13 QUESTION: In the economy section?14 MR. HARAKAS: In the economy seat section. I15 think when you -- it was very difficult to determine16 because the plane was -- there were approximately 11￼17 seats. Some of those 11 seats were in the18 section, but the --19 QUESTION: And in addition, there were20 revenue people who could have been asked to leave.21 MR. HARAKAS: There were the non-revenue22 but when you look to the record, the only way you could23 determine the non-revenue people -- in fact, we had to24 submit post-trial submissions after the trial to -- for25 somebody to testify to interpret the codes that were on10Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005smoking the no- people,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the passenger manifest to determine who were revenue and who were non-revenue.QUESTION: This doesn't have anything to do with the case, does it?MR. HARAKAS: No, it doesn't, Your Honor. It doesn't have --QUESTION: So what are we talking about it for? I mean, it -- it -- the issue before us is not negligence.MR. HARAKAS: It's not --QUESTION: The issue before us is whether it was an accident.MR. HARAKAS: Exactly. It is whether it was an accident.QUESTION: May I ask this question? I know you didn't argue about negligence, but you do seem to draw a distinction between affirmative conduct on the one hand and failure to act on the other hand. And my question to you is, supposing that without asking the stewardess, the passenger had gotten into a -- a non-smoking seat seven or eight rows ahead of where he was sitting and then was ordered to return to his seat. Would that have been an accident?MR. HARAKAS: Under the circumstances, no, I don't think under -- for purposes of the Warsaw Convention, that would have been an accident.11Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: That would have been.2 MR. HARAKAS: It would not have been an3 accident.4 QUESTION: It would not have been.5 MR. HARAKAS: Because again, the injury --6 QUESTION: So then -- then you don't rely on a7 distinction for the action and non-action.8 MR. HARAKAS: Well, because -- well, I do rely9 on the distinction between action and non-action because10 you could have an omission which in and of itself cannot11 be an accident. I -- I really gave a lot of thought to12 this. I looked at the cases and I could never find a pure13 omission being an accident. A omission can result in an14 accident.15 QUESTION: Well, why is this a pure omission?￼16 It seems to me she misrepresented that the plane17 twice when that wasn't true. That doesn't sound18 omission to me. She told the wife to sit down.19 well, how do you treat that she was supposed to report20 such incidents to her supervisor and she didn't do that?21 MR. HARAKAS: The -- the bottom line of the22 allegations here were that the -- the flight attendant23 should have taken action to move Mr. -- Dr. Hanson to24 another seat, and failure to do so would be --25 QUESTION: And part of what -- part of what she12Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005was full like an She --1 had--2 MR. HARAKAS: -- in itself an omission.3 QUESTION: Part of the picture is things that4 she affirmatively did do, and part are things she didn't5 do. And I don't understand that the law makes a6 distinction between doing what one should not have done or7 not doing what one should have done.8 MR. HARAKAS: Generally in -- under negligence9 law -- under negligence law a negligence can be an act or10 omission. But here, when you're looking to the treaty of11 an accident defined as an unusual, unexpected event or12 happening, you basically have a non-event, something that13 did not happen. You -- you see that I think in the --14 QUESTION: Yes, but you -- you say you wouldn't15 draw the distinction I suggested. So assume the case was16 the other way around, that the stewardess told him to get17 back to his seat. Now, why would that not be an accident?18 MR. HARAKAS: Because at that point, when he got19 back to his seat, he would be back to his normal assigned20 non-smoking seat. While in close proximity to the smoking21 section, again, you have to see that smoke on a smoking22 aircraft, a known smoking aircraft, nobody -- you know,23 there was no surprise here when he got on board on this24 aircraft that there was a -- there was going to be smoke25 on this aircraft -- is not an unusual, unexpected event.13Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But I want to be sure I understand2 your position. If the stewardess had gone to the captain3 of the plane and said, we've got a guy in the back seat4 who said he's going to die because he can't stand smoke,5 he wants to sit in the front seat, and he's grabbed a seat6 up there, should I order him back to the old seat, and the7 captain says, yes, send him back, would that be an8 accident?9 MR. HARAKAS: Under the Warsaw Convention, I10 don't think it would be an accident, and here's why. It11 -- these are extreme examples that -- with respect to that12 where -- the passenger in this case -- don't forget too,13 the flight attendant did give the option to this passenger14 to move. He could have taken self-help to remedy the15 situation, but he opted not to. But in those type of16 situations, you have instances where they're very extreme17 examples, but -- and the convention doesn't necessarily18 provide a remedy for all those types of situations.19 QUESTION: I -- I take it -- I take it you think20 -- is it Abramson in the Third Circuit where they -- the21 -- the passenger can't lie -- lie down.￼222324 wrong? 25MR. HARAKAS: Exactly, Justice Kennedy. QUESTION: You take the position that case isMR. HARAKAS: No. That -- that position -- that14Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case is -- is 100 percent correct and to our case because in the Abramson -- QUESTION: That's -- that'sthere's an accident in that case.MR. HARAKAS: In that case,it's very analogous -- it seems to me the -- the court ofappeals found there was not an accident.QUESTION: I understand, but it seems to me thatthere is.MR. HARAKAS: Well, Abramson followed the --almost the exact criteria set forth by the Court in Saks. Was it an unusual, unexpected event? And they found that being seated in an aircraft seat -- you're assigned an aircraft seat -- is not -- and sustaining an injury due to your own internal reaction was not an accident because they, again, focused on what was the precise factual event that led to the injury.QUESTION: Of course, there it seems to me that the -- the internal cause is -- is much greater than it -- it is here.Let -- let's -- can we take the case on the assumption -- I think we must take the case on the assumption, based on the -- on the findings of the district court, that if they had moved the passenger, the event would not have occurred.MR. HARAKAS: We have to --15Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Now --MR. HARAKAS: Yes. We have to take -- QUESTION: -- if we take the case on thatassumption, it's -- it seems to me it's got to be an accident.MR. HARAKAS: I disagree, Justice Kennedy, because again, I -- I just come back to when I was looking at all the cases and looking at the treaty and the text of the convention, you always do have to look to the injury-producing accident come downevent because the text of the treaty says an which causes the damage. And I think it does to showing what is the direct event.I think when you look at the Krys case, I thinkthe Court -- the Eleventh Circuit in Krys clearly set forth, I think, a very workable standard. They say let's look at the -- we ask let's look at the precise event. We look at what were the precise events that caused this injury, not the actions of the air carrier that they could have taken to avert that injury.QUESTION: But was it determined here that the passenger died from smoke exposure?MR. HARAKAS: There was at the -- there was a -- a legal finding that it was the smoke that killed the passenger even though --QUESTION: And do we take the case on that16Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425understanding?MR. HARAKAS: You would have to take the case onthe understanding because we didn't raise the factual issue that he would have died from the food poisoning.QUESTION: And is it the case that there would have been seats possibly available more removed from the smoke so that it wouldn't have been as heavy an exposure to smoke?MR. HARAKAS: I don't -- I don't think there was any evidence to establish the concentrations of the cigarette smoke. There were seats that were further removed, but then you come down to, again, factual issues or determinations as to, well, how far do you remove the passenger. Is three further rows further ahead, five rows further ahead enough?￼to-- a--QUESTION: But here there was a total refusal MR. HARAKAS: There was a -- well, there wasQUESTION: -- to provide any help.MR. HARAKAS: There was a refusal to -- there was a refusal to move him because the flight attendant believed the flight was full, and it was, other than the 10 seats. But the -- the flight attendant did give this passenger the option to reseat himself.17Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: Well, you -- you say you have to2 consider just very precisely what caused the injury. What3 is your view here of what caused the injury?4 MR. HARAKAS: What caused the injury was his5 exposure to the cigarette smoke under the facts of this6 case and on the findings. And then we have to determine7 was cigarette smoke in that area, ambient cigarette smoke,8 unusual, unexpected, and even the lower court found that9 cigarette smoke on a smoking aircraft is not an unusual,10 unexpected event.11 QUESTION: When you say the -- the airline gave12 the passenger the option to reseat himself, wasn't it the13 option to -- to request another passenger to change seats14 with him?15 16 1718 he could19 locate an2021 direct communications with Dr. Hanson. It was always22 through his wife. There were two requests made to move on23 initial boarding.24 QUESTION: Well, but does that make -- does that25 make any difference in -- in this case, the fact that hisMR. HARAKAS: To change seats with him. QUESTION: Yes.MR. HARAKAS: Or he could have -- what the -- or have moved through the cabin to see if he could empty seat.But mind you, the flight attendant never had any￼18Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 wife was speaking for him?2 MR. HARAKAS: No. I mean, it would have made a3 difference in the lower court as to the issue of4 reasonableness and things like that, but for purpose of5 the legal issue before the Court, no, it doesn't make a6 difference because, again, when you look at -- when you7 look at all the various cases, when you come through Krys,8 Abramson, and the other pre-Tseng cases -- and I draw that9 distinction before Tseng -- the courts universally had10 held that a passenger's injury arising out of his own11 internal reaction to the conditions on the aircraft is not12 an accident.13 And when you look to the history of the14 convention itself, here the lower courts, in effect --15 while we say they didn't use negligence, they, in effect,16 imported concepts of negligence, reasonableness,17 reasonable alternatives, things like that, those types of18 concepts.19 QUESTION: How about other courts? I mean, we20 do look to see what our treaty partners do in this area.21 The two other courts that were cited in the brief that￼22 addressed23 the Ninth2425 one courtthis question seem to agree with the decision of Circuit in this case.MR. HARAKAS: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The was an Australian court in Povi, a lower court19Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case, which that case has been appealed and argued on appeal. And that case -- that was in the DVT context. I think that court suffered from the same fundamental errors that the courts here below did in viewing what the --QUESTION: What about the court of appeals in England --MR. HARAKAS: -- that --QUESTION: -- that disagreed on the -- on the -- whatever that --MR. HARAKAS: Yes, the DVT litigation.QUESTION: Disagreed on that, but did say, went out of its way to say, it thought that this case was the right way to go about it.MR. HARAKAS: Well, the -- on the DVT litigation case, the court found that -- he disagreed with the reasoning of the lower courts, but he said that he could certainly understand the result. But he was, again, focusing in on the facts because if you applied the --￼mean --QUESTION: Well, that's surely dictum anyway. IMR. HARAKAS: Yes, well --QUESTION: -- the dictum in that case that -- that he thought that this case came out right below. We wouldn't even -- we wouldn't even give dispositive effect to our own dictum much less to the dictum of a court of20Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

And what happened was in that case, I think he had a misperception of the facts at the end of the day, and if you applied the rationale that he used for his opinion in dismissing those cases, the facts of this case would inevitably lead to the dismissal of this case and a finding of no accident.QUESTION: I don't think so, having read his decision and the other members of the court of appeals.QUESTION: misperception?MR. HARAKAS: As cigarette smoke because --What was Lord Phillips'to the enforced exposure to thebecause the passenger here was given the option to relocate, and he could have relocated￼himself.QUESTION: The option being -- the option being the one that was mentioned a moment ago.

HARAKAS: Well, the -- the second inquiry13 was just before -- shortly before takeoff on -- on a14 flight delayed for 3 hours, and they're trying to take15 off, and she says, I can't help you right now. And one16 thing -- and then the third one was shortly after takeoff.17 QUESTION: Well, but the -- I wouldn't think18 they allowed smoking before takeoff.19 MR. HARAKAS: No, they did not allow smoking20 before takeoff. It wasn't until the third incident21 shortly after takeoff when smoking was allowed, and then22 she said, can you please move my husband now? And the23 request was denied.24 But I think with -- with respect to the whole25 accident inquiry issue here, we also have to look to, when22Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005is coming on board the plane.QUESTION: But by the time the second and third were asked, it should have been evident that￼1 you start bringing in the definition of what is an2 accident, when you start equating with issues of3 negligence and common law, I think we go astray and go4 contrary to what the drafters intended as to what the5 Court here in Tseng held, that you don't -- accident is6 not a common law concept. It's a self-contained --7 QUESTION: If Tseng had held nothing on this8 point, in fact, it -- it said that the Second Circuit's9 conclusion that that wasn't an accident was doubtful. In10 Tseng, it was an academic question. What barred her from11 getting recovery under the treaty was she didn't suffer12 from a physical injury or from a psychological injury with13 -- with physical manifestations. She didn't die and she14 didn't have the kind of injury that would qualify. Tseng15 -- I think you are quite wrong in saying that that16 decision passed on the concept of accident.17 MR. HARAKAS: No. I agree with you, Justice18 Ginsburg. I may have misspoke because you're absolutely19 right. There was only that one footnote that -- where the20 Court did express concern as to whether the court in the21 Second Circuit flexibly applied the Tseng decision. But I22 was talking about the -- what I meant was the broader23 context of Tseng with respect to importation or allowing a24 parallel state cause of action in light of the exclusivity25 of the convention and the uniformity principles set forth23Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 in the convention.2 And if you start importing concepts of3 negligence back into the convention -- because, in effect,4 what the courts are doing below is they're saying, fine,5 we can't go to State law, but what we'll do is we'll --6 we'll define an accident to make it equivalent to a7 negligence cause of action. So there's really no8 difference. What the courts are doing is nullifying the9 exclusivity holding by equating any act of negligence as10 an accident.11 QUESTION: But are -- are you saying here that12 the court of appeals really wrote an opinion about -- in13 negligence and saying that's an accident?14 MR. HARAKAS: When you read the -- the language15 of the court of appeals, it's -- it's pure negligence16 language.17 QUESTION: But -- but it seems to me whatever18 you think about what the flight attendant did, it -- it19 can't be classed as negligence here. It was a refusal to20 do something.21 MR. HARAKAS: It was a refusal. It was a -- it22 was a -- in my view, it was an omission, and I think at --23 when you take omissions and put it in the context of what24 is -- is that an unusual, unexpected event, that an25 omission cannot in and of itself be the accident.24Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: I don't know if we really have to get into the act versus omission question here because this was more than that. It was a refusal to take action in the face of an alleged severe medical problem and in -- in contravention to the rules of the airline at the time. So you could characterize this, I think, as some kind of positive action, in effect.MR. HARAKAS: Well, I -- when I think of an event, I think of some type of positive action, and in this instance, when -- when I look at a refusal to do something, I look at it as -- as an omission.But even if you did look at it as a positive event here, Justice O'Connor, I think you -- although -- everything leads us back to trying to identify was the event that caused the injury here unusual, unexpected. And that -- there's only one injury-producing event. For example, let's say nobody asked the airline in this case to move Dr. Hanson. There was no request made, and he remained in his non-smoking seat.QUESTION: No request made? I thought the wife made a request.MR. HARAKAS: I'm sorry. QUESTION: Excuse me.MR. HARAKAS: A hypothetical. QUESTION: Oh.25Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. HARAKAS: Let's assume no request had been2 made, and he would have remained in that same non-smoking3 seat and he would have died because of the exposure to the4 ambient cigarette smoke, according to plaintiffs' theory.5 What would be the injury-producing event there? What6 caused that death? His internal reaction to the cigarette7 smoke, the normal -- which was normal and expected.8 Now, the fact that they asked -- somebody asked9 for him to be moved doesn't change the injury-producing10 event. The injury-producing event is the same. It's the11 exposure to the cigarette smoke.12 QUESTION: Well, but of course, the exposure13 might have been substantially reduced if the passenger had14 been able to get seated in an area further removed from15 the active smokers.16 MR. HARAKAS: There -- he still would have had17 -- there still would have been ambient cigarette smoke18 throughout the cabin, as we all well know.19 QUESTION: Well, suppose there were five rows of20 empty seats in front and a -- a stewardess -- and there21 are stewardesses like this sometimes that we don't people22 wandering around the plane. We're serving food. You must23 sit down in your seat. A different case?24 MR. HARAKAS: No, not a different case because25 you are assigned to your assigned seat, and again, it's26Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425one of those extreme examples that if I believed there were five empty rows here, he probably would have gotten up and found it himself. But in that case, I don't feel there would be a different case because, again, I -- I focus in on this injury-producing event here, and the injury-producing event is the exposure to cigarette smoke which was normal and expected.QUESTION: So your -- your submission is if the airline requires you to sit in the no-smoking seat for no particularly good reason, there's still no accident.MR. HARAKAS: Oh, I -- I disagree on that one because if they required you to sit in a non-smoking seat and you had --QUESTION: Well, that was my hypothetical.MR. HARAKAS: Okay. If they -- if you -- if they require you to sit in a smoking section?QUESTION: No. One -- just one -- one rowahead.MR. HARAKAS: There would be no difference in the situation from this -- from our scenario. There still would not be an accident. He was assigned a non-smoking seat and you -- again, you look to was his own internal reaction here to the normal and expected operation of the aircraft.And I think when -- when you look at the27Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425convention, the structure of the convention, and what they had in mind by the term accident, you have to -- you can only come back to that one basic conclusion, that you look to what is that injury-producing event.I'd like just to reserve the remaining -- my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Harakas. Mr. Farr, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:There are basically two reasons why we think that article 17 imposes liability when an airline knowingly leaves a passenger in medical jeopardy without taking basic measures to alleviate the harm.First, because that kind of action violates normal industry safety practices and thus, under Saks --QUESTION: Well, that's the question. Is it an accident? You assume it. You say that kind of accident. Well, I think that's the issue. Is it an accident?MR. FARR: I'm sorry if I said that kind of -- I meant to say that kind of action under Saks is contrary to -- to the normal industry safety practices.QUESTION: Let me ask about Saks. It's -- it28Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 seems to me that the fallacy in the argument that -- that2 you -- you run and that the Government runs is that it3 accepts the language of Saks as the totality of what is4 necessary to be an accident.5 Now, Saks involved a fellow who had some problem6 with his ear which was -- caused him harm because of the7 normal depressor -- pressurization of the -- of the8 cockpit. And in denying relief under the -- under the9 convention, the Court says, no, that wasn't an accident10 because the cockpits are pressurized all the time, and if11 it-- ithas -- tobe anaccident, it hasto be an12 unexpected or unusual event or happening. Okay.13 Saks was not saying that that is a sufficient14 condition to be an accident. It was just saying that that15 is a necessary condition.16 Now, let me -- letme give -- give youa17 hypothetical and you tell me why -- why this would be an18 accident. It seems to me the hypothetical closely19 parallels what happened here.20 A man hurls himself into the sea intending to21 commit suicide. There is right nearby to where he hurled22 himself into the sea a dock with 30 people on it and 3023 life preservers at their feet, and not a single one of24 them picks up the life preserver and throws it to the25 drowning man. I don't know why. Maybe they're 3029Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 libertarians who think people should be able to kill2 themselves. Whatever.3 (Laughter.)4 QUESTION: Certainly -- certainly an unexpected5 and unusual event. Who would imagine that with 30 life6 preservers within reach of the man, nobody would throw7 one.8 Now, would anybody in his right mind say that9 this man died because of an accident? Of course, not.10 Unexpected and unanticipated is a -- a necessary condition11 for -- for saying that something was caused by an12 accident, but it's surely not a sufficient condition.13 And it seems to me what happened in this plane14 is exactly like that. It is an event after the person was15 endangered. I -- I don't think that this person died16 because of an accident. It just doesn't make it. And17 that's the language of the convention, not Saks.18 MR. FARR: Well, Justice Scalia, it seems to me19 that -- that the point that you're making, which in one20 sense I think is a correct one, is that the language of --21 of article 17, if one looks at it in purely colloquial22 terms, may not exactly correspond with the definition in23 Saks. But the language in article 17 isn't used -- the24 term accident isn't used purely in the colloquial sense.25 What we know from the context of the convention as a whole30Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 and the liability system as a whole and from Saks is that2 sometimes it actually captures less than the colloquial3 sense of the term accident, sometimes it's more.4 For example, the mere fact that somebody has a5 heart attack typically would be, in the colloquial sense,6 thought of as an accident. But we've learned from Saks7 that it is not itself going to be considered the accident8 because of the context of article 17 and the -- the9 language about accidents causing death or bodily injury.10 By the same token, the deliberate refusal to11 help somebody, as the Chief Justice pointed out in his --12 his earlier question I think,13 colloquial terms, not thought of14 inadvertent. It's deliberate.15 17 that deliberate conduct can,16 If a flight attendant strikes a17 throws coffee on the passenger in a fit of rage, that is18 an accident for purposes of article 17.is -- is normally, in as an accident. It's not But we know under article in fact, be an accident. passenger in the face or￼19 QUESTION: I'm willing to say that negligent20 conduct such as occurred here can be an accident. Of21 course, it can. If -- if the flight attendant spills some22 hot liquid on the passenger causing the passenger to be23 scalded, of course, that -- that's an accident.24 MR. FARR: Well, Justice Scalia --25 QUESTION: That fits the normal -- the normal31Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 concept of accident.2 MR. FARR: Of course, but -- but --3 QUESTION: What happened here does not fit the4 normal description of accident.5 MR. FARR: But my example is not a -- an6 accidental spilling. I'm -- I'm actually talking about it7 just to try to get at the colloquial sense, which I think8 is what disturbs you, that -- that if -- if in fact the --9 the flight attendant purposely throws the coffee on the10 passenger, just become irritated with the passenger, that11 would not normally be thought of as an accident, if you're12 asking people around the coffee shop whether there's been13 an accident.14 But in terms of article 17, it is an accident15 because we know article 17 covers instances of willful16 misconduct. Article 17 is the gateway by which you get to17 any liability, and willful misconduct includes certainly18 the kinds of -- of things that I'm talking about,19 deliberate conduct.20 QUESTION: Can this be said to be that kind of21 conduct where it's contrary to the policy of the airline?22 MR. FARR: Yes, it can, Justice O'Connor. I23 mean, one of the things that's a little bit curious in --24 in tying the two questions together with Justice Scalia's25 question, this is a -- this is an incident which in fact32Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 is to some extent intentional.2 QUESTION: Yes.3 MR. FARR: I mean, the -- it was not inadvertent4 that -- that the passenger was left in his seat. For5 example, just -- just to take a different, slightly6 changed analogy, if in fact the passenger had -- had asked7 to be moved in -- out of the vicinity of the smoke, and8 the flight attendant had said, let me wait until everybody9 is seated, I'll come back and get you in half an hour, and10 she forgot to do that, that would actually in colloquial11 terms seem more like an accident. Somehow negligently she12 forgot to come back. But in fact, in this particular13 case, she was asked three times and knowing in fact what14 she was doing, she said, no, I'm not going to move you.15 QUESTION: What if she -- what if she'd been16 asked to move him, and she said I'll be back, and then17 another passenger gets very ill and she has to take care18 of him right away, and then the facts are the same.19 Accident there?20 MR. FARR: The question then I think -- the --21 the proper way to answer that, Justice Kennedy, is to look22 at what would happen in the normal flight under the normal23 circumstances. Obviously, under the circumstances we had24 here, it's unusual and unexpected that she didn't move25 him. If in fact the reason was that there was some other33Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 enormous problem on the plane and all of the flight2 attendants had to deal with that particular problem, then3 it seems to me the -- the action here would not be unusual4 and unexpected.5 QUESTION: Well, that's --6 QUESTION: Your -- you stated in your opening7 that the airline's conduct here was contrary to industry8 policy, and I think Justice O'Connor premised an earlier9 question on saying it was against the policy of -- of this10 particular airline. Spell that out a little, will you?11 What was the policy of -- of the airline and why did this12 action violate it?13 MR. FARR: The policy of the airline and the14 policy generally, because I think they're in this case the15 same --16 QUESTION: They're the same.17 MR. FARR: -- was when a passenger requests a18 move for medical reasons, that the policy is to19 accommodate that request if it's possible to do so. And20 it was possible here because there were empty seats in the21 coach cabin, so we don't have to get into the complicated22 questions of whether you have to move someone to first23 class or to -- to alleviate the problem.24 QUESTION: Would -- would it have been any more25 or less of an accident if that practice had not prevailed34Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 in the industry?2 MR. FARR: I think it's possible that it would.3 I mean, I -- our position is not that essentially the4 industry can give itself immunity by lowering its5 standards so much that -- that acts that -- that clearly6 are unusual, but nonetheless within the -- the industry7 standard are -- are immune from liability. But I think8 the general idea is in trying to evaluate things that9 aren't obviously accidents, we have to have some sort of10 benchmark to judge whether what's happened is unusual.11 The natural place is to look -- is -- is at the industry12 practice. And if in fact what they've done is consistent13 with industry practice, I would think in the usual case14 certainly15 event.16 17that would suggest there hasn't been an unusualQUESTION: Well, but it was unusual here.MR. FARR: Absolutely.QUESTION: So why isn't this an accident in the￼1819 same sense that having an attendant throw hot coffee on a20 passenger would be?21 MR. FARR: It is.22 QUESTION: Supposing the airline's defense to23 throwing hot coffee on the passenger said our stewardesses24 do that all the time.25 (Laughter.)35Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: There's unexpected about it.2 MR. FARR: I mean, the -- the fact is as I say,3 that I don't think that necessarily having a very low4 standard in the company itself or in the industry will, in5 fact, give you immunity, although I have to say I think6 that in fact that's an unlikely thing to happen because7 when we talk about the Warsaw Convention, there's a8 natural --9 QUESTION: Mr. Farr, can I interrupt for a10 second? It seems to me that in the question of whether11 you move a passenger or not, you could have a situation12 which for security reasons, as they have around13 Washington, every passenger must remain in his or her --14 her seat for 500 miles or 30 minutes or so, and refusal to15 move during that period could not possibly be an accident.16 MR. FARR: That's correct, Justice Stevens. I17 think -- but -- but the analysis would be the same. I18 mean, one of the instructions that Saks gives, I think19 correctly, is that you have to look at all the20 circumstances. What is unusual or unexpected under21 certain circumstances would not be unusual or expected --22 unexpected under other circumstances like the one --23 QUESTION: What -- what role does fault play?24 It -- it seemed to me, as I was reading the Ninth Circuit25 opinion in Saks, that negligence is probably not a36Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 requisite. I don't know if that makes it necessary for us2 to send it back. Suppose we think that's true. Would we3 send it back to the court of appeals and say, no, no,4 negligence is -- is not the standard, go ahead and find5 fault on their -- or whether or not there's an accident6 under some other standard?7 MR. FARR: Justice Kennedy, I -- I don't think8 that's necessary. I mean, what the Ninth Circuit9 basically said was this is an unusual or unexpected event10 under Saks because it violates industry policies, industry11 standards, the company policy, and particularly given the12 nature of the request. If the Ninth Circuit had stopped13 there, it seems to me that their decision would be14 absolutely correct.15 QUESTION: Well, it didn't. It went on and got16 a bunch of negligence language in there.17 MR. FARR: Well, it's the following sentence18 that obviously raises at least some questions. And I19 should say I'm not sure that -- that language in itself20 should be as troubling as it perhaps appears to some21 because the -- the situations that -- that the court22 describes there very often will be, it seems to me,23 unusual or unexpected situations.24 But nonetheless, it seems to me that -- that25 following the adage that the Court sits to review37Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 judgments and not opinions, that the Court can simply say,2 as we -- we suggest would be sufficient, that you do have3 an unusual and unexpected event when you fail to help a4 passenger in violation of the standard industry practice.5 Now, if the standard industry practice would be6 not to help a passenger under certain circumstances and7 the claim is still made that it's unusual or unexpected,8 one would need another benchmark for reference, but the9 Court doesn't need to reach that in this case.10 Now, I would like to -- to also point out that11 in -- in -- when we're talking about the language of -- of12 article 17, while I think it's -- it's proper to -- to13 focus on the language itself and discuss it in -- in the14 context of Saks, that it's also I think proper to look at15 the context of the convention as a whole and whether, in16 fact, competing interpretations of the term accident would17 lead to absurd consequences.18 Here I think if in fact the definition or the19 application of the definition that Olympic tries to -- to20 urge on the Court is accepted, that one is going to find21 that -- that this convention, which is intended to be the22 exclusive means of remedy for passengers who suffer death23 or bodily injury on an international flight, is -- is24 going to have essentially a hole in it where it doesn't25 cover situations even, as in this case, whether it's38Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 willful2 injury.34 whether5 the parties to the convention under the circumstances, it6 seems to me when you -- when you say a positive act would7 be an accident, an omission that would cause an accident8 would be -- you know, would -- would involve an accident,9 but there's liability whatsoever for situations in which10 the -- the conduct itself is the contributing factor, the11 failure to do something is the -- is a strong contributing12 factor, doesn't really make any reasonable sense as a13 construction, and particularly because one of the things14 that the -- the parties must have understood is that15 during the time that the passenger is -- is covered by16 article 17, if you will, from the time of embarkation to17 the time of disembarkation, the passenger is largely inmisconduct by the airline crew that causes theAnd the focus that -- you know, in terms of that is a reasonable understanding to attribute to￼18 the control of the19 the passenger sits.20 engage in self-help21 And in that situation, the idea that the -- that22 the parties thought that airlines could simply say we have23 passengers on our plane who need our help for medical24 reasons, and we're not going to provide any help25 whatsoever and that either causes greater injury -- causes39Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005airline. The airline determines where So the passenger's opportunities toare greatly reduced.1 injury in the first place, causes greater injury, or in an2 unhappy case like this one, actually causes a death, their3 theory would say there's still no liability. And it would4 seem to me you would need a very, very clear indication5 from the text, which doesn't exist here, to reach that6 result.7 QUESTION: Well, what if someone suffered, say,8 a heart attack on the plane and it was 3 hours from its9 destination and the doctor there said, you know, you've10 really got to -- in -- in order to avoid this guy probably11 dying, you're going to have to land somewhere en route?12 Now, would an airline be obligated to do that in order to13 avoid this sort of accident?14 MR. FARR: It depends on the circumstances, but15 I think the general industry practice would be, in fact,16 that an airline would be -- would -- would normally divert17 to a nearer airport in fact to -- to save the -- the18 passenger from death or from much more severe injury.19 That in a sense is the Krys case, the Eleventh20 Circuit case, that Olympic says is in conflict with the21 decision in this case. That was a case in which the22 Eleventh Circuit said, well, the -- the failure to divert,23 which it -- it was agreed would -- would have made a24 significant difference to the passenger's health, was not25 unusual because the plane just did the normal thing. It40Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 just flew to its regular destination. But the problem2 with Krys is that if you look at all the circumstances, as3 Saks says, it's not the normal thing just to fly on to4 your intended destination when a passenger has had a heart5 attack and the medical indication --6 QUESTION: Well, then -- then you're saying7 basically it depends on airline practice whether something8 is expected or unexpected and whether it's the normal9 practice.10 MR. FARR: In this context. I mean, obviously,11 sometimes it's -- it's -- if -- if the context is the --12 the failure to help a passenger in -- in medical distress,13 then it seems to me that the usual practice of -- of the14 airline or the industry in general is -- is the proper15 benchmark, at least initially, for determining whether16 something is usual or unusual.17 Now, obviously, there are other kinds of18 accidents, crashes and hijackings and all, where -- where19 common knowledge tells you what happened is unusual, but20 where common knowledge doesn't necessarily tell you the21 answer, then it does seem that reference to industry22 standards is a useful benchmark.23 QUESTION: Would you comment on the distinction24 between an event and an accident?25 MR. FARR: Well, the event is under -- under41Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Saks -- I mean, the difference is that an accident has to2 be an unusual event, that not every event is an accident.3 You have to demonstrate that it's unusual, and -- and much4 of what we've talked about this morning, obviously, is --5 is why this would be unusual by reference to industry6 standards. But an event, if one looks at a dictionary7 definition, is simply something that happened on the8 plane.9 QUESTION: I think it would affect the liability10 for loss of baggage and so forth. That's triggered by an11 event, as I understand it.12 MR. FARR: That's correct. It is now. It was13 at one time triggered by an occurrence, and under the 199914 Montreal Convention it's triggered by an event. Yes.15 QUESTION: Do you think the Abramson case in the16 Third Circuit was properly decided?17 MR. FARR: I don't -- I am not sure the result18 was wrong. I don't think the approach was correct. I19 think the court should have asked what the usual industry20 practice would have been in that case, and if the usual21 industry practice would have been to make an accommodation22 along the lines that -- that the passenger requested, then23 I think that might have well have been an accident. I24 think it's a -- it's a difficult question as to whether25 that would have been true because that particular42Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 passenger needed to be moved into first class, needed two2 first class seats, and in fact part of the solution was he3 was perhaps going to introduce self-induced vomiting as a4 cure, which obviously would affect other passengers in the5 cabin. So, you know, on the facts, one ultimately might6 have said -- the -- the judgment that was made there7 actually comported with -- with the usual industry8 standards. However, we don't know the answer because the9 Third Circuit didn't ask the right question.10 QUESTION: But you do think the Eleventh Circuit11 Krys case was wrong in both reasoning and result.12 MR. FARR: Well, Krys -- we have an additional13 piece of information because the court went on to decide14 the case. This was pre Tseng. So it actually decided the15 case as a common law negligence case, and when it did so,16 it found that what the airline had done by not diverting17 in that particular case was a violation of industry18 standards. So in that case I think what should have19 happened in Krys is that the court should have made that20 inquiry as part of the Warsaw Convention analysis, and if21 it had done so in fact, it would have limited the recovery22 in Krys, which was many millions of dollars, to the limits23 of the Warsaw Convention, supplemented by the agreements.24 If the Court has no further questions, thank25 you.43Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

McDOWELL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTSMS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 7 please the Court:8 A flight attendant's refusal to assist an ill9 passenger can amount to an accident within the meaning of10 the Warsaw Convention. The analysis focuses on whether11 such conduct is, objectively speaking, unusual or12 unexpected, taking into account the ordinary practices in13 the industry and other indicia of what would be expected14 in the circumstances.15 At a minimum it's reasonable to construe the16 convention's term accident, as the United States construes17 it, to encompass the aberrant conduct of the flight crew,18 and this Court has ordinarily accorded weight to the19 United States' reasonable construction of treaties to20 which it is a party.￼2122 the text23 term is a24 crashes or explosions or equipment failures. As the Court25 recognized in Saks, it can encompass a wide array ofOur reading of the term accident comports with structure and purposes of the convention. The broad and inclusive one. It's not confined to44Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 unusual and unexpected events external to the passenger2 potentially --3 QUESTION: Ms. McDowell --4 MS. McDOWELL: Yes.5 QUESTION: -- assuming that it could have6 happened somehow in an airline context, would you say that7 Justice Scalia's hypothetical was an accident?8 MS. McDOWELL: I think that a failure of an9 airline employee to come to the assistance of a passenger10 can, indeed, be an accident. One must recall that even11 under the common law, common carriers such as airlines12 have been understood to have special obligations toward13 their passengers, not expansive obligations to act as14 physicians to them, but to provide reasonable first aid15 until they reach the destination. So I think that -- that16 this particular context is -- is quite different from the17 context when one is dealing with just a bystander.18 And I think under the common law as well, there19 have been other situations that might well be viewed as20 accidents that involved omissions when one is under a duty21 to act.22 QUESTION: Okay. Let's say it wasn't a23 bystander. Let's say that, you know, they were -- they24 were relatives. They're the parents of -- of the person25 who jumped. You still wouldn't call that an accident,45Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

Some States do impose a duty on -- on bystanders, by the way, and let's assume that happens in a State where there is a duty.MS. McDOWELL: Well, I think the inquiry here --QUESTION: You still wouldn't call it an accident, I don't think. I mean, nobody would use the English language that way.MS. McDOWELL: Well, I think here under the Warsaw Convention, the term accident has been understood to refer to an unusual, unexpected event.QUESTION: Okay. But wouldn't you -- Warsaw Convention or not, wouldn't you call it an accident if the bystanders had put up an advertisement saying, swim with us for $500, and then they stood there?MS. McDOWELL: Yes, that would -- that would seem to be an accident.QUESTION: That would get a little closer to our situation, wouldn't it? And that --MS. McDOWELL: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: -- and that might well be an accident.MS. McDOWELL: Other circumstances -- medical malpractice cases, for example, might be those where an omission of some sort, because the doctor is under a duty46Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to act, could be viewed as an accident. For example, a failure to diagnose or to treat a particular medical condition until it's too late, if that was negligent, could be an accident.QUESTION: Would -- would you say that we ought to write the opinion so that if there is negligence, that is evidence that normal airline practices were not being followed, and that's an accident? So that negligence is important to the analysis, not necessary, but it -- it can be helpful.MS. McDOWELL: We would say that --QUESTION: Or -- or should we write the opinion without talking about negligence?MS. McDOWELL: We would say that the test is objective reasonableness which connotes some of the same concepts as negligence does in the common law.QUESTION: Well, how does -- how does that differ from -- from the common law at all? If you say objective reasonableness, you're really just changing accident into common law negligence, aren't you?MS. McDOWELL: Well, not in all circumstances because negligence isn't a necessary condition for an accident to occur. An accident could be an act of God and an event that did not involve negligence.In this particular case, yes, the inquiry into47Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 due care and the inquiry into an -- whether an accident2 has occurred are quite similar, but they're still focused3 on a different question. The accident inquiry asks4 whether something unusual or unexpected has happened, and5 the due care inquiry under article 20 asks whether the6 airline has acted with due care.7 QUESTION: Well, negligence is a proxy for the8 fact that normal airline operating rules were not being9 followed.10 MS. McDOWELL: Correct. Now, there may be11 isolated instances where although ordinary practices were12 being followed, those practices were so deficient that,13 nonetheless, an accident might be found. Normally,14 however, I think that -- that airlines' practices are to15 treat passengers reasonably. So I think that asking the16 reasonableness question would be the same as -- as seeing17 whether there was a deviation from standard policies and18 practices.19 In construing the --20 QUESTION: You know, I think there may be a21 public policy reason for construing accident contrary to22 its normal meaning to embrace in this context intentional23 acts whether by the airline employees or by pirates or --24 or terrorists or anybody else. But I don't -- I -- there25 -- there's a problem in my mind about interpreting it to48Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- to embrace especially negligent omissions. It seems to2 me that's so far away from the normal meaning of accident3 that I don't -- I don't see the justification for doing it4 especially where it converts the convention into5 essentially what it was not intended to be, liability for6 negligence. That --7 MS. McDOWELL: Well, of course, in this case we8 don't have a mere negligent omission. We have what the9 district court found to be willful misconduct. We also10 found -- this case also involves a -- a refusal to act, a11 series of refusals to act, and -- and provision of12 misinformation about whether the flight was completely13 full or not. So it's -- it's difficult to characterize14 this particular case --15 QUESTION: No, the misinformation didn't bear16 any causality. I mean, the -- the -- what caused the17 injury here was -- was not the misrepresentation about the18 other seats. It was simply the failure to move the person19 to another seat, and that is totally an -- an omission, it20 seems to me.21 MS. McDOWELL: I don't think it's properly22 characterized as an omission when there were three23 increasingly desperate requests to reseat the passenger24 and the flight attendant responded on each occasion --25 QUESTION: I take it back. Three -- three49Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 omissions.2 MS. McDOWELL: I think that this sort of case3 can be contrasted, for example, from a -- a simple failure4 to warn case where the question is whether an airline5 should have warned about a particular medical condition6 that a passenger might have in response to ordinary7 flight. This seems to involve much more. Certainly Lord8 Phillips in the English court of appeals thought that this9 case involved much more than -- than just a failure to10 act.11 The drafters of the Warsaw Convention certainly12 didn't intend that airlines would be insurers for any harm13 that befell a passenger during flight. They did intend,14 however, that airlines would be held liable when their own15 fault caused a passenger's death or bodily injury.16 Indeed, they eliminated the caps on damages in cases when17 that fault rose to the level of willful misconduct. This18 would seem doubtful that the drafters intended simply by19 their choice of the term accident to exempt airlines20 entirely from liability in cases where passengers died or21 suffered bodily injury because of the airline's fault,22 including willful misconduct in this case.23 QUESTION: Well, is airline's fault even24 required? Supposing that before the plane took off, there25 was a big fire in the area and smoke filled the -- filled50Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the aircraft while it was on the runway and then he died from that smoke, would that be an accident?MS. McDOWELL: It could well be an accident, Your Honor. It might not be an accident for which liability would -- would be properly --QUESTION: Why wouldn't it be?QUESTION: There's going to be an accident within the meaning of the convention is what I'm asking you.MS. McDOWELL: Yes, it probably would.QUESTION: So then the smoke doesn't have -- the -- the -- whatever the accidental cause is, it doesn't have to be fault of the airline.MS. McDOWELL: That's correct because the airlines have the opportunity under article 20 of the convention to come back and say that we cannot be held responsible for this accident because we did not act negligently.The understanding --QUESTION: I thought they had to show more than￼that. I thought they had possible to prevent -- toMS. McDOWELL: all necessary measures.QUESTION: Yes.to show that they did everything prevent the --Well, the term in the treaty is51Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 MS. McDOWELL: But it's been construed to mean2 all reasonable measures. So it's essentially been3 understood as a -- a due care defense. And that's4 reinforced in the Montreal Convention, the new convention5 that has just come into force, that -- that uses the term6 negligence in its own words.7 The understanding that the accident requirement8 can be satisfied in cases like this one serves the9 convention's purpose of balancing the interests of air10 carriers and passengers. Such cases do not pose a threat11 of particularly expansive liability to airlines. Cases12 such as this one where air carriers do something that is13 unusual and unexpected and thereby cause a passenger's14 death or bodily injury can be expected to remain15 relatively few under the convention, as they are under16 U.S. domestic law. Imposing liability, meanwhile, enables17 passengers and their families to receive some measure of18 compensation for their injuries and provides appropriate19 incentives for airline supervision and -- and training of20 their personnel.21 For all of these reasons, we'd ask the judgment22 of the court of appeals be affirmed.23 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.24 Mr. Harakas, you have 3 minutes remaining.25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS52Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER2 MR. HARAKAS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think when3 you -- when you look at the arguments that were made both4 by the respondents and the Solicitor General, it all comes5 back to the issue of negligence, wanting to equate an6 accident with negligence.7 The Warsaw Convention wasn't an all-encompassing8 treaty. There were certain holes left in the convention9 where there wasn't going to be recovery. For example, if10 there's no bodily injury, there's no recovery under the11 Warsaw Convention, as set forth by the Floyd decision, no12 matter, let's say, how egregious the air carrier's conduct13 may have been. It set forth certain things, and the14 convention wanted to define the liability based on the --15 by using that term accident not making reference to16 various common law notions.17 I think one of the problems that we're seeing is18 that confusing what is the accident -- and that's why I19 always come back to the injury-producing event. In the20 hijacking situation, for example, the accident there isn't21 the failure of the airline to conduct proper screening and22 allowing the hijackers to come on board the aircraft. The23 accident is those hijackers get on the -- on the airplane24 and they injure a passenger. And that -- the injury25 itself is the accident. Just like in the smoke example,53Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 if there was a fire someplace and the cabin filled up with2 smoke, the smoke itself injuring the passenger is the3 accident. Why the smoke got there is completely4 irrelevant.5 So when you -- when you start injecting the6 whole concepts of negligence, I think you upset the whole7 balance of the convention, and -- and one of the principal8 goals of the convention was to have a uniformity and to9 limit the liability of the carrier. In fact, the Montreal10 Convention of 1999, which just -- which just entered into11 force last week here in the United States, retained the12 term accident. The issue of whether the carrier should be13 liable for the state of the health of the passenger has14 always been a very special and unique issue in the context15 of the convention's history. Post-ratification conduct16 from 1945 all the way through the -- all the way to the --17 the Montreal Convention of 1999, the contracting states18 were very careful and very reluctant to make the carriers19 liable for injuries arising out of their -- out of the20 state of health of the passenger.21 And the -- with respect to the policy arguments22 where they say -- where the respondents and Solicitor23 General say that the -- there are certainly policy reasons24 should be considered in weighing in favor of the25 passengers in this instance, I think when you look to --54Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 you have to apply the strict terms of the convention. And2 each time this Court has been confronted with similar3 policy arguments, they have been rejected. In Saks, the4 -- the passenger was left without a remedy because they5 couldn't -- because the passenger couldn't satisfy the --6 the accident condition precedent. The same thing in7 Floyd. There they couldn't satisfy the bodily injury8 requirement. And in Tseng, where the -- there was no9 remedy allowed under State law when they couldn't satisfy10 the accident or the bodily injury conditions precedent.11 Focusing on what the injury-producing event and12 whether that event is unusual, unexpected, and external to13 the passenger -- thank you, Your Honor.14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.15 Harakas.16 The case is submitted.17 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the18 above-entitled matter was submitted.)1920212223242555Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
