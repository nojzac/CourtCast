Lee Bollinger. Mr. Kolbo.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERTHE WITNESS: Mr. Chief Justice and May please the Court:itBarbara Grutter applied for admission to the University of Michigan Law School with a personal guaranteed by the Constitution that she would notrace counted against her. That race -- that the application would be considered for free from the racial discrimination. The law school intentionally disregarded that right by discriminating against her on the basis of race as it does each year in the case of thousands of individuals who apply for admission.The law school defends its practice of race discrimination as necessary to achieve a diverse student body. With the loss -- with the diversity that the law school is committed to ensuring and meaningful numbers or critical mass, is of a narrow kind defined exclusively by race and ethnicity.The constitutional promise of equality would notright have hertaint of￼31 be necessary in a society composed of a single homogenous2 mass.3 It is precisely because we are a nation teeming4 with different races and ethnicities -- one that is5 increasingly interracial, multiracial, that it is so6 crucial for our Government to honor its solemn obligation7 to treat all members of our society equally without8 preferring some individuals over others.9 QUESTION: Well, of course, you -- I mean, a10 university or a law school is faced with a serious problem11 when it's one that gets thousands of applications for just12 a few slots. Where it has to be selective. And inherent13 in that setting is making choices about what students to14 admit.15 So you have an element here that suggests that16 there are many reasons why a particular student would be17 admitted or not. And a lot of factors go into it.18 So how do you single this out and how are we19 certain that there's an injury to your client that she20 wouldn't have experienced for other reasons?21 MR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor, first of all, race22 is impermissible because of the constitutional command of23 equality. The university is certainly free to make many24 different kinds of choices in selecting students.25 And to look for all kinds of different￼41 diversity, experiential diversity, prospective diversity2 without regard to race, but race because, Your Honor, of3 the constitutional command of equality, must be beyond the4 bounds --15 instance,16 contexts.17 18to remedy prior to discrimination in otherMR. KOLBO: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. QUESTION: All right.MR. KOLBO: And I want to be clear about that.QUESTION: You say that's not -- it can't be a all. Is that it? Is that your position that it one of many factors?MR. KOLBO: Our view, Your Honor, is that race56 factor at7 cannot be89 itself should not be a factor among others in choosing10 students because of the Constitution.11 QUESTION: Well, you have some -- some12 precedents out there that you have to come to grips with,13 because the Court obviously has upheld the use of race in14 making selections or choices in certain contexts, for￼1920 We are -- 2122 absolutes23 recognition to the use of race in a variety of settings.24 MR. KOLBO: And we absolutely agree, Justice25 O'Connor.QUESTION: Well, but you are speaking inand it isn't quite that. I think we have given51 QUESTION: Is it cause for concern with your --2 if you're the dean of the law school or the president in3 the university or the Governor of the State that minority4 students,5 community6 according7particularly from the Black and Hispanicare underrepresented by a large factor,to their -- their share of the population. Suppose you have a law school with two or three8 percent Hispanic and -- and black students, is that a9 legitimate concern for the university and for the State10 officials?11 MR. KOLBO: We believe not, Your Honor, for the12 reason that we need to get away from the notion that13 there's some right number for each racial group.14 QUESTION: So if year after year after year15 there's an underrepresentation, there is no cause for the16 State or the Government or its educational experts to be17 concerned whatsoever?18 MR. KOLBO: I wouldn't say not to be concerned,19 Your Honor, I think the mere fact of underrepresentation,20 that is that say, blacks are not represented as they are21 in the population is not a concern that would justify22 racial preferences. It certainly would justify perhaps23 broad social and political concerns.24 QUESTION: Well, it's a broad social and25 political concern that there are not adequate members of￼61 -- of a profession which is designed to protect our rights2 and to -- and to promote progress. I would -- I should3 think that's a very legitimate concern on the part of the4 State.5 MR. KOLBO: The current concern there, Your6 Honor, ought to be addressed by -- by addressing the7 problem. If there is some reason that -- that particular8 minority groups are not participating as fully in the9 fruits of our society such as being represented at the10 schools, we need to address those problems.11 But racial preferences don't address those12 problems.13 QUESTION: Mr. Kolbo, may I call your attention14 in that regard to the brief that was filed on behalf of15 some retired military officers who said that to have an16 officer corps that includes minority members in any17 number, there is no way to do it other than to give not an18 overriding preference, but a plus for race. It cannot be19 done through a percentage plan, because of the importance20 of having people who are highly qualified. What is your21 answer to the argument made in that brief that there22 simply is no other way to have Armed Forces in which23 minorities will be represented not only largely among the24 enlisted members, but also among the officer cadre?25 MR. KOLBO: Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe we￼71 have an adequate record in this case from which to2 conclude that we wouldn't have representation of3 minorities. The military in the absence of --4 QUESTION: Suppose that were true. Let's take5 that as the fact, would you still say nonetheless even if6 it's true that there will be very few, if any, minority7 members admitted to the military academies, still you8 cannot use race?9 MR. KOLBO: I believe race could not be used,10 Your Honor. I think that other solutions could be looked11 at addressing the problem why they are not minorities in12 the military. I note that the United States has not taken13 a position. We have the brief as Your Honor has mentioned14 from several individuals, the United States has not taken15 a position in this case, the military academies have not16 taken a position.17 QUESTION: Yes, they have, if the brief is18 accurate about the regulations, the academies have taken a19 position?20 MR. KOLBO: As I understand it, Justice Stevens,21 the briefs are filed on the behalf of individuals.22 QUESTION: I understand that. But they are23 quoting material that the academies have distributed,24 which indicate they do give preferences.25 MR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor --￼81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Do you challenge the fact -- that that is a matter of fact?MR. KOLBO: We don't challenge what they say, Your Honor. We're just suggesting -- we don't have athis case. QUESTION: are giving MR. KOLBO:QUESTION: Are you serious that you think there is a serious question about that? That we cannot take that green brief as a representation of fact?MR. KOLBO: I just don't know, Your Honor, what the facts are with respect to the military because this case was --QUESTION: It depends on what factor you're talking about, doesn't it? You accept the fact that they're giving preferences, but that doesn't convert to the fact that if they didn't give preferences, there is no other way to get an officer corps that includes some minority people, does the brief say that?MR. KOLBO: It does not, Your Honor. We have no evidence as to what the extent of representation is.QUESTION: The issue as I understand it is not whether without preferences there can be a militaryrecord inthat theyit to know whether --No, but do you challenge the fact the preference?We don't have enough information on￼91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425academy population with some minorities, the question is whether without the -- the weighting of race that they do in fact give, they can have an adequate number of minorities in the academies to furnish ultimately a reasonable number of minorities in the officer corps, that's the issue, isn't it?MR. KOLBO: Well, Your Honor, again, the -- the terms you've used, reasonable and adequate, we have no information in this record on which I can make those --QUESTION: More than what would happen if they did nothing?MR. KOLBO: And that number, Your Honor, I don't know what it is. Again, because it wasn't part of this case. I think it's more --QUESTION: More than what would happen if they did something else, such as making special provision for all people of economically disadvantaged background. We don't know whether that would have produced the same number, either.MR. KOLBO: That's correct, Your Honor. As theCourt --QUESTION: Do you believe that that would be an adequate -- at least means of experimenting here -- take it as an alternative?MR. KOLBO: Taking race neutral alternatives￼101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425into consideration?QUESTION: Well, taking for example economicdisadvantage?MR. KOLBO: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: Do you seriously believe that that would be anything but a surrogate to race? It would take the word race out of the categorization of the label that we put on it, but do you believe it would function in a different way but as a surreptitious approach to race?MR. KOLBO: It certainly functions differently, Your Honor. Race controls --QUESTION: Do you think it would?MR. KOLBO: Certainly, yes --QUESTION: Is there any reason to believe thatit would?MR. KOLBO: I do, Your Honor, because it's not just minorities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged in this country. That happens with respect across racial lines. So race neutral alternatives --QUESTION: The object -- but the object I would have assumed given the dialogue, the object is to increase the racial number of the percentage of minorities. If that is the object, than whatever it is, it's not a race neutral measure.MR. KOLBO: Well, I would disagree, Your Honor,￼111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because I think if you have a race neutral means that accomplishes many purposes, and one of them is race, that is not necessarily under this Court's precedents unconstitutional. The Court --QUESTION: Well, let me ask you this, it's about the military brief that you didn't come here to argue about, but it will maybe get you back to your case.MR. KOLBO: Sure.QUESTION: The military brief tells us -- the green brief -- that there are preparatory schools that the academies have and 40 percent of the registration in those preparatory schools are racial minorities.And they -- suppose the Government does this and expends money for the purpose of recruiting and helping racial minorities apply to the academies and succeed there.Is that a proper constitutional purpose?MR. KOLBO: I see no constitutional objection there, Justice Kennedy. For the reason I think it -- it's quite permissible in principle to draw a line between casting a wider net, recruiting and -- and the point of competition where people -- where people -- where the decision must be made whether people are going to be treated on the basis of the same --QUESTION: Would you allow recruiting targeted￼121 at minorities?MR. KOLBO: I don't see the constitutional with that, Your Honor.QUESTION: Fine. If you can use race as afor spending money, I take it one argument on side, which I'd like you to address, is that we world where more than than half of all the23 objection 45 criterion6 the other7 live in a8 minority -- really 75 percent of black students below the9 college level are at schools that are more than 50 percent10 minority. And 85 percent of those schools are in areas of11 poverty.12 And many among other things that they tell us on13 the other side is that many people feel in the schools,14 the universities, that the way -- the only way to break15 this cycle is to have a leadership that is diverse. And16 to have a leadership across the country that is diverse,17 you have to train a diverse student body for law, for the18 military, for business, for all the other positions in19 this country that will allow us to have a diverse20 leadership in a country that is diverse.21 Now, you're familiar with that argument. But if22 it is reasonable to use race as a criterion, as a plus for23 spending money, why isn't it also reasonable to use it as24 a plus to see that -- to obtain that set of objectives25 that I've tried to summarize in a second that you're very￼131 familiar with.2 MR. KOLBO: Because very simply, Justice Breyer,3 the Constitution provides the right of -- individuals with4 the right of equal protection. And by discriminating on5 the basis of race at a point of competition, innocent6 individuals are being injured in their constitutional7 rights. That's the distinction between that and simply8 trying to cast a wider net, recruiting spending money on9 outreach efforts, a very principal line it seems to me can10 be drawn between those two things.11 QUESTION: The reason that the injury is more12 severe to the white person who doesn't get in when that13 white person doesn't get in because she's not an athlete14 or he's not a -- he's not a alumnus or he's not any of the15 other things that fits within these other criteria? What16 is the difference there is?17 MR. KOLBO: The difference is the Equal18 Protection Clause, Your Honor. It does not apply to19 alumni preferences in scholarships. It applies to race.20 QUESTION: That's the legal conclusion. But the21 reason if I thought, for example, that there is a22 difference under the Equal Protection Clause, between a23 system that says to the discriminated-against people, the24 law does not respect you, and a system that says the law25 does respect you, but we are trying to help some others,￼141 suppose I thought that that is a sound legal distinction2 as reflected in this Court's cases, you would reply that?3 MR. KOLBO: Sound and reasonable, Your Honor, is4 not enough when it comes to race. It must be a compelling5 purpose. And that is the difference. There are many6 policy choices a university can make that I may disagree7 or agree with, and that I have no legal standing or no8 client has a legal standing to challenge, because they9 don't implicate important constitutional rights. There is10 something special about race in this country. It's why we11 have a Constitution about it. It's why we have a12 constitutional amendment about it.13 QUESTION: Why -- why do you draw the line at --14 you said you can recruit -- you can use a race criterion,15 if I understood you correctly, to recruit, you could have16 minority students only given the benefit of scholarships17 to go to these preparatory schools. You were surely18 recognizing the race criterion there. Why is that19 permissible?20 MR. KOLBO: Because it doesn't prevent someone21 from applying. The key is to be able to compete on the22 same footing at the point of competition.23 QUESTION: These preparatory schools -- do you24 concede that they're only for minority students? I'm25 familiar with those preparatory schools, familiar or not?￼151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KOLBO: Certainly not --QUESTION: The majority of the people that attend them are young men and women who really want to get into the service academies, but don't have the grades for it. And the service academy tells them whether they're black, white or anything else, go to these preparatory schools and you'll have a better chance next time around.MR. KOLBO: That --QUESTION: It isn't just for minorities.MR. KOLBO: They're not, Your Honor. They areopen to -- accessible to all.QUESTION: I was asking you about your answer tothe question, not -- the fact may very well be, but I thought you had answered the question, yes, you could have special preparation for minorities only, yes, you could have recruitment for minorities only. I thought that that was your answer.MR. KOLBO: I believe you can -- as part of a broad program, I believe you could. You could seek outreach for minority students, because it's very simple it seems to me to draw a principal distinction between outreach, casting a wider net and applying the same standard at the point of -- at the point of competition.QUESTION: Including at the point of giving the benefit of going to one of these preparatory schools. You￼161 wouldn't allow one of these preparatory schools to be for2 minority only, would you?3 MR. KOLBO: No, of course not, Your Honor. And4 I'm not suggesting that outreach would be limited to5 minorities only. I'm just suggesting that -- I don't6 understand why there would be a constitutional objection7 to trying to cast a wider net by focusing as part of a8 broader effort of outreach in recruiting minority students9 and it can be quite -- it's quite easy to draw the line10 between that and -- and the point of competition.11 QUESTION: May I ask --12 QUESTION: If you're right -- if you're right13 about what equal protection requires and we have also two14 statutes that incorporate the equal protection principle,15 then there could be no affirmative action, I take it, in16 employment?17 MR. KOLBO: There could be, Your Honor, to18 remedy past identified discrimination, but not to exceed19 diversity and there is not today as I understand it any20 compelling interest in the employment context with respect21 to--22 QUESTION: So, for example, if we have a prison23 that was largely minority population and the state wanted24 to give a preference so that it would have a critical mass25 of correction officers of the minority race, that would be￼171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425impermissible?MR. KOLBO: It would be impermissible, YourHonor, unless based upon a compelling interest and the only one that has been recognized in the employment context is identified discrimination. And I don't see that in your hypothetical.QUESTION: No, it's not in my hypothetical. MR. KOLBO: Mr. Chief Justice.QUESTION: Can I ask you one question about theextent of your position? There's a brief applied, I think it's by the Potawatomi tribe. If Michigan had made -- the governor of Michigan many years ago had made a commitment to an Indian tribe to allow three persons into the University of Michigan every year, three tribemen, and nothing else, would that be constitutionally permissible?MR. KOLBO: I don't believe so Your Honor. Again, it's a distinction drawn on the basis of race.QUESTION: Or just one, still would be a -- that would exclude an impermissible number of slots for --MR. KOLBO: If it's slots on the basis of race, Your Honor. And if there are no further questions, if I may reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chief Justice.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kolbo. General Olson, we'll hear from you.ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,￼181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425IN GENERAL please the Court:AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONEROLSON: Mr. Chief Justice and may itThe Michigan law school admissions program fails every test this Court has articulated for evaluating governmental racial preferences.First, it is --QUESTION: General Olson, just let me get a question out and you answer it at your convenience. I'd like you to comment on Carter Phyllip's brief. What isyour viewabout theof the strength of that argument?GENERAL OLSON: Well, I'm not sure --QUESTION: That's the one about the generals and military academies.GENERAL OLSON: I understand -- the -- our￼position with respect to that is we respect the opinions of those individuals, but the position of the United States is that we do not accept the proposition that black soldiers will only fight for -- black officers or the reverse that race neutral means should be used in the academies as well as other places.And that to the extent that there's any difference in analysis, the Court might consider its position, the position it articulated in connection with191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the military in Rostker v. Goldberg. But our position with respect to that brief is that --QUESTION: Your suggestion is that the military has broader latitude than the private university?GENERAL OLSON: No, I'm suggesting that --QUESTION: Well, you're pointing to Rostker suggests that.GENERAL OLSON: Yes, I'm suggesting that the Court will want to look at each of these individual situations according to the circumstances and that may be a factor in that context. But I started my answer, Justice Stevens, by saying you do not accept the proposition that race neutral means should not be used and employed fully to -- to make sure that the academies are accessible and open and -- and offer opportunities for as many people as possible.QUESTION: But you recognize, General Olson, that here and now, all of the military academies do have race preference programs in admissions?GENERAL OLSON: The Coast Guard does not. It's prohibited by Congress from doing so. I do acknowledge, Justice Ginsburg that the other academies are doing so. It's the position of the United States --￼doing?QUESTION: Is that that's illegal what they're201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425GENERAL OLSON: Pardon me?QUESTION: Is it -- that it is illegal, a violation of the Constitution?GENERAL OLSON: We haven't examined that and we haven't presented a brief with respect to the specifics of each individual academy. And we would want to take into consideration any potential impact suggested by the Court in the Rostker case.QUESTION: What do you -- what do you think is the -- is the principal race neutral means, that the academy should use?GENERAL OLSON: Well --QUESTION: Without criticizing necessarily what they're doing now, what would be the -- in your judgment, the best race neutral way for them to go about reaching your objective?GENERAL OLSON: Well, there are a variety of race neutral means and narrowly tailored methods by which academies and universities can reach out to people of all backgrounds to make sure that they've eliminated --QUESTION: No, no. I realize your position. But specifically, which -- which of the race neutral suggestions that have been considered do you think would be, you know, most adaptable to the academy situation?MR. KOLBO: Widespread recruiting, making sure￼211 that there's opportunities for education and advancement2 in the -- in the academies.3 QUESTION: Recruiting with an objective of4 minority students?5 GENERAL OLSON: Not limited, a race neutral6 system of broad scale recruiting that this Court has7 always supported the proposition that efforts may be made8 by governmental institutions to eliminate barriers that9 have existed where artificial barriers --10 QUESTION: Okay. But my question is, if they11 don't do it with a racial objective, how does the12 recruiting respond to the position taken in -- in Mr.13 Phillips's brief that without the kind of -- of racial14 weighting and admissions that is given now, they simply15 will not reach a -- a -- a substantial number of -- or be16 able to attain a substantial number of minority slots in17 the class?18 GENERAL OLSON: That is the opinion of certain19 individuals. It is -- we do not accept that conclusion20 based upon those opinions. And this Court has repeatedly21 held that race neutral means must be demonstrated and will22 be accepted, and will not -- and the Court will not accept23 the proposition that race neutral means will not be24 successful unless they've been attempted and demonstrated.25 These -- this program at the University of Michigan Law￼221 School fails every one of the Court's tests. First, it's2 a thinly disguised quota which sets aside a significant3 portion of each year's entering class for preferred ethnic4 groups.5 Secondly, it overtly employs stigmatizing and6 divisive racial stereotypes, what the law school calls7 diversity-relevant characteristics. It identifies persons8 by diversity-relevant characteristics.9 QUESTION: Well, what they do is they use race.10 GENERAL OLSON: Exactly.11 QUESTION: I know. But they have a reason for12 it. The reason for it is they want to produce a diverse13 class and the reason they want to do that, using it asa14 plus, they say, is to do the things I said before. They15 think it breaks down stereotypes within the class. They16 think it's educationally beneficial. They think it17 supplies a legal profession that will be diverse and they18 think a legal profession like business and the military19 that is diverse is good for America from a civics point of20 view, et cetera, breaks the cycle. Those are the21 arguments which you well know.22 So what is your response?23 GENERAL OLSON: Well, a response to those many24 arguments is that they've -- they're using stereotypes to25 in an effort, they say to break down stereotypes, they're￼231 using race as a -- a surrogate for experience. And if2 they want to look at experience, they can look at3 experience. If they want to improve the educational4 opportunities of minority groups, one of the biggest5 problems --6 QUESTION: That's not what they say. They say7 they're not using race as a surrogate for anything,8 because if you have a person who went to Exeter who's very9 rich and happens to be black and is a conservative10 Republican, it's great for the class to know that, too.11 And that's why they want a certain number.12 GENERAL OLSON: But that person -- that person13 if he went to Exeter and he has a great GPA and so forth14 gets an extra opportunity either a portion of the class is15 set aside for that individual solely on the basis of race,16 irrespective of his experience. And the -- and the17 application isn't examined for the type of experience or18 the type of viewpoint that race-diversity characteristic19 is used as a substitute for any examination of the20 individual on the individual.21 QUESTION: General Olson, do you -- do you agree22 with the articulated proposal of Justice Powell in the23 Bakke case of using race as a plus factor as he -- as he24 saw the use of it. Do you disagree with that approach?25 GENERAL OLSON: We disagree with that approach￼241 in the sense that we -- we -- in the first place, contrary2 to what our opponents have said, we would not believe that3 that single opinion, which was the only opinion, to4 examine the issue of diversity under a compelling argument5 --6 QUESTION: I don't think it commanded a court.7 I'm just asking if you agreed with that approach.8 GENERAL OLSON: We're reluctant to say never,9 Justice O'Connor. But this test -- every test that10 Justice Powell applied in that opinion, the law school11 program here fails. It's a stereotype.12 QUESTION: But General Olson, is race different13 from sex in that regard? I thought we have -- we have14 disapproved using sex as just a plus factor? That is one15 factor among many, but, you know, when you get down to it,16 this is -- this person is a male and therefore we'll put17 that into the mix and that'll favor the person. We've18 disapproved that with regard to sex discrimination,19 haven't we?20 GENERAL OLSON: I don't disagree with that.21 QUESTION: Why would race discrimination be any22 different?23 GENERAL OLSON: I'm suggesting that the programs24 here, without getting to the point of whether are there25 any other circumstances whether they be remedial, which￼251 this Court -- a factor of the Court has recognized before,2 or something else in an unusual situation, where it could3 be appropriate. I don't know what that might be. But4 this test --5 QUESTION: I think Santa Clara -- I think what6 Justice Scalia said bears modification, because in fact in7 Santa Clara, the highway dispatcher, there was a plus for8 sex, although there was no proven discrimination against9 that particular woman and this Court approved that.10 GENERAL OLSON: I would also say that it's11 conceivable if you're constructing -- the National12 Institutes of Health is constructing this study of13 diseases that focus on particular races, the race may be a14 factor but the fact is that the law school program here,15 notonlyisasetasideandaquota,butit--butit--16 --17 QUESTION: General Olson, I'm not sure you18 answered Justice O'Connor's question.19 Do you agree with Justice Powell's suggestion20 that race could be used as a plus in something like the21 Harvard program?22 GENERAL OLSON: No, the Harvard program A wasn't23 examined according to to any compelling governmental24 interest. It was examined only --25 QUESTION: So your answer is no, you would not￼261 agree with that?2 GENERAL OLSON: We would not based upon any what3 we see in that opinion, which is --4 QUESTION: Would you disagree with his use of5 the term diversity as being a permissible governmental6 goal?7 GENERAL OLSON: Well, the only way to answer8 that Justice Kennedy is that the word diversity means so9 many things to so many different people. It means both a10 means to get experience and a diversity of experience. It11 also means, I think what the law school has done, it's an12 end in and of itself. If it's an end in and of itself,13 obviously it's constitutionally objectable that this Court14 --15 QUESTION: So is the Texas plan constitutional?16 If it's designed solely in order to have a diverse mix in17 the colleges they take 10 percent, but their motive stated18 and their purpose is to have diversity in the college?19 GENERAL OLSON: Justice Breyer, I don't believe20 that that is the stated motive of the Texas plan or the21 California or the Florida plan. Those are intended to22 open up those institutions to a broader selection, one of23 the ways in which this Court has accepted the institution24 such as universities may operate is to make sure that25 barriers are broken down, accessibility is made more￼271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425available and that is one very race neutral means of accomplishing that legitimate objective.QUESTION: General, what do you say to the argument that the only reason accomplishes it is because it depends on segregation at the lower level of the schools, otherwise it would not accomplish that?GENERAL OLSON: No, there is no evidence that it depends upon segregation of the schools in Texas or in any other place.It is a diverse selection of the high schools in that state.QUESTION: Thank you, General Olson. Ms. Mahoney, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEYON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The Solicitor General acknowledges that diversity may be a compelling interest but contends that the University of Michigan Law School can achieve a diverse student body through facially race neutral means.His argument ignores the record in this case.QUESTION: I'm not sure -- in his brief does he acknowledge that can be a compelling interest?MS. MAHONEY: The brief says that it is one of￼281 the paramount interests of government to have diversity in2 higher education. And it has certainly been the3 consistent position of the Department of Education for the4 past 25 years that Bakke is the governing standard, that5 schools are encouraged to use programs to achieve6 diversity, because of the important interests it serves7 for students of all color.8 QUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, supposing that after our9 Bakke decision came down, whereas Cal. Davis set aside 1610 seats for disadvantaged minorities, and Cal. Davis said11 we're going to try to get those 16 seats in some other12 way, we're going to try high school graduates, we're going13 to try socioeconomic and none of the -- none of those14 methods get the 16 seats that they want.15 Can they then go back and say we've tried16 everything, now we're entitled to set aside 16 seats?17 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. I18 think what the Court's judgment in Bakke said and19 certainly what Justice Powell's opinion said is that it's20 simply not necessary to do a set aside because a plan like21 the Harvard plan, which takes race into account as one22 factor can be used as an effective means to --23 QUESTION: But my hypothesis was, they wanted 1624 seats and that plan just won't give it to them?25 MS. MAHONEY: Well, if -- if the program was￼291 designed to have a fixed 16 seats, no matter what the2 qualifications of the applicant pool, no matter what the3 disparities between the minority and majority students4 would be, then I think it's fair to say that that would be5 a quota.6 If that is the nature of the program. But here7 the record indicates that the -- the law school's program8 is nothing of the kind.9 That what has occurred over the years with this10 program is that there have been offers that have ranged11 from 160 to 232 over the course of eight years there have12 been enrollments that went from 44 to 73. It has been a13 very flexible program.14 QUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, I -- I find it hard to15 take seriously the State of Michigan's contention that16 racial diversity is a compelling State interest,17 compelling enough to warrant ignoring the Constitution's18 prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race.19 The reason I say that is that the problem20 problem of Michigan's own creation, that is to say,21 decided to create an elite law school, it is one of22 best law schools in the country. And there are few23 law schools that -- that get to that level.24 Now, it's done this by taking only the best25 students with the best grades and the best SATs or LSATs￼30is a it has the State1 knowing that the result of this will be to exclude to a2 large degree minorities.3 It is -- it's not unconstitutional to do that,4 because it's -- that's not -- not the purpose of what5 Michigan did, but it is the predictable result.6 Nonetheless, Michigan says we want an elite law school.7 Now, having created this situation by making8 that decision, it then turns around and says, oh, we have9 a compelling State interest in eliminating this racial10 imbalance that we ourselves have created.11 Now, if Michigan really cares enough about that12 racial imbalance, why doesn't it do as many other State13 law schools do, lower the standards, not have a flagship14 elite law school, it solves the problem.15 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think there's16 anything in this Court's cases that suggests that the law17 school has to make an election between academic excellence18 and racial diversity. The interest here is having a --19 QUESTION: If it claims it's a compelling State20 interest. If it's important enough to override the21 Constitution's prohibition of racial discrimination, it22 seems to me it's important enough to override Michigan's23 desire to have a super-duper law school?24 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the question isn't25 whether it's important to override the prohibition on￼311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425discrimination. It's whether this is discrimination. Michigan -- what Michigan is doing benefits --QUESTION: No, no. No. The question is whether or not there is a compelling interest that allows race to be used.MS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: And Justice Scalia's question is designed to put to you the fact that this isn't a compelling interest, because it's a choice that the Michigan law school has made to be like this.MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the issue is whether it is sufficiently compelling to allow Michigan to take race into account in this limited fashion in order to provide a much better education for students of all races. The benefits are race neutral, Your Honor, and the burdens are really quite limited.What we're talking about here --QUESTION: But the question put to you is Michigan has designed its school in a particular way and it doesn't have to do that.MS. MAHONEY: But Your Honor there is a compelling interest in having an institution that is both academically excellent and richly diverse, because our leaders need to be trained in institutions that are excellent, that are superior academically, but they also￼321 need to be trained with exposure to the viewpoints, to the2 prospectives, to the experiences of individuals from3 diverse backgrounds.4 QUESTION: But -- but that brings us to the5 question of the use of race, which is being used here.6 Let me ask you this: Suppose there's a7 reasonable disagreement as to whether or not the so-called8 critical mass is, in fact, a disguised quota, you would9 say it is not. Suppose there's a reasonable disagreement10 on that point, if that's so, you lose, is that not11 correct.12 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, because the13 district court did not make any factual findings that14 would support the conclusion that this is a disguised15 quota.16 QUESTION: Is it beyond this Court's capacity to17 say that? It certainly at a minimum a mixed question of18 law and fact. You're arguing here that it isn't. I'm19 certainly -- at least open the possibility that we can20 disagree with you.21 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, the -- there has22 to be evidence in the record that would support the23 conclusion that it's a quota. And what this Court has24 said that means is a fixed number -- that is sufficiently25 rigid that no matter what the qualifications of the￼331 applicant pool, the law school is going to adhere to a2 fixed minimum and I think it's important to say what the3 judge found on this issue, at 230A of the position of4 appendix, the judge says in conclusion, the Court finds5 that the law school wants, 10 to 17 percent of each class6 to consist of African Americans, Native Americans and7 Hispanics. Wants. That's an aspiration.8 QUESTION: It says wants or wants Maureen?9 MS. MAHONEY: Wants. Wants.10 QUESTION: Wants. Okay.11 MS. MAHONEY: Wants, Your Honor. That's an12 aspiration, that is not a fixed minimum. He made no13 findings that there was a fixed minimum.14 QUESTION: Is there in fact a difference between15 the Michigan plan and the Harvard plan that the Harvard16 plan is tauted in Bakke, it seems to me, that they were17 pretty close and is there any suggestion that Michigan is18 looking for critical mass that Harvard didn't look for?19 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely not, Your Honor. The20 evidence indicates that the Harvard plan works in exactly21 the way the Michigan plan does. In fact, Harvard's brief22 in this case indicates that under their plan over the last23 four years, they enrolled eight to 9 percent African24 Americans which is a stable range. In the last four years25 of the record evidence here, the University of Michigan￼341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Law School enrolled 7 to 9 percent African Americans. QUESTION: Excuse me. Did Bakke hold that theHarvard plan was constitutional?MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: If adopted by -- by institution?MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: It held that it wasMS. MAHONEY: Yes. What we --QUESTION: We didn't even -- we didn't even havethe details of the Harvard plan before us?MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in fact, the Courtappended -- or Justice Powell appended the Harvard plan to his opinion in this case and there were five votes that the reason that the mandate of the California Supreme Court should be reversed was because there was an effective alternative for -- for enrolling minorities and that effective alternative was a plan like the Harvard plan.And the -- the dissenting --QUESTION: Did -- did the Court know what -- what social scientists have later pointed out and many people knew before it that when the Harvard plan was originally adopted, its purpose was to achieve diversity by reducing the number of Jewish students from New Yorka Stateconstitutional?￼351 that were -- that were -- that were getting into Harvard2 on the basis of merit alone?3 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think that was4 --5 QUESTION: Did that come up in the course of the6 case?7 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think that's8 the purpose of the Harvard plan that was attached.9 QUESTION: Not today, I'm sure. But -- but --10 but that was its origin.11 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, there is -- there is12 certainly a major difference between an educational policy13 that is motivated by an intent to exclude people based on14 racial animus and one like the Law School's policy and the15 Harvard plan, which is designed to include students of all16 races, so that the education of all students will be17 enriched as a result.18 QUESTION: But not too many of any race?19 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor --20 QUESTION: Or not too many of any religion, I21 assume?22 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor it is not a question of23 not too many. It's that the law school has attempted to24 take race into account in a very modest limited fashion,25 no more than necessary to achieve the goal of trying to￼361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have sufficient numbers of minorities that there can be an excellent educational experience for everyone.QUESTION: But -- but without a quota? Just sufficient numbers, but that's not a quota?MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor it is not a quota.QUESTION: When you say sufficient numbers, you're -- I mean that suggests to me that there is -- there is some minimum. Now, you don't name it. But there has to be some minimum. But you say there isn't a minimum?MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor there is not a minimum.QUESTION: Well, then you have to eliminate the word sufficient.MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, it -- it can be related to numbers without being a quota. In fact, the Department of Education in 1979 after Bakke came out, issued a policy interpretation at 44 Federal register 58510 which specifically says authorizes schools to￼establish and pursue numerical goals, end as they don't set aside a fixed number of race the sole criterion for eligibility. Department of Education's interpretation.QUESTION: Certainly they don't Constitution?quote, as long places or make That was theinterpret the MS. MAHONEY: No, they don't Your Honor, but371 that is what Bakke held. That was -- that was the -- what2 was at issue in that case, that that was the difference3 between the program that U C Davis had used and the4 program that was at issue in the Harvard plan.5 QUESTION: Is it fair to say that the -- what6 the -- what -- what Justice Powell and the five who agreed7 or the four who agreed on the Harvard plan were getting at8 was that there is a permissible zone between a purely9 token number and a quota or a set aside and you can shoot10 for something in that zone? Is that a fair --11 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely Your Honor. What12 Justice Powell's opinion says when paraphrasing the13 Harvard plan is that there needs to be an awareness of the14 necessity for more than token numbers. And that's because15 the educational benefits of diversity can't be achieved.16 QUESTION: It's hard to see that that's --17 that's true here, when every day the admission staff looks18 to see what the numbers are based on race?19 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that's not correct.20 The -- there is a report which is called The Daily. But21 it is not looked at everyday. The evidence was clear that22 it is simply something that can be printed out.23 QUESTION: You just have a daily report that24 they look at once a week?25 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the reason it's called￼381 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a daily is that it is a running database that allows for the report to be printed at any time.And -- and the evidence indicated that --QUESTION: To show how well they're doing in getting the so-called critical mass which is just a synonym for a number?MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the dailies actually track a whole variety of admissions information including deposits, they're trying to see how they're doing in terms of whether --QUESTION: They -- they don't track, as I understand it, the other pluses that the University talks about?MS. MAHONEY: Well, they track -- they track residency, they track gender, they don't track, for instance, socioeconomic status which is a plus or, in fact, the evidence is uncontradicted that the University takes any racial background, any ethnic background, any unusual characteristic that would add to the diversity of the class into account, but it doesn't find a need to track that, because of the nature of the applicant pool.￼Mahoney?QUESTION: Is two percent a critical mass, Ms.MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. QUESTION: Okay. Four percent?391 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, what --2 QUESTION: You have to pick some number, don't3 you?4 MS. MAHONEY: Well, actually what --5 QUESTION: Like eight, is eight percent?6 MS. MAHONEY: Now, Your Honor.7 QUESTION: Now, does it stop being a quota8 because it's somewhere between 8 and 12, but it is a quota9 if it's 10? I don't understand that reasoning. Once you10 use the term critical mass and -- you're -- you're into11 quota land?12 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, what a13 this Court's cases is a fixed number. And14 fixed number here. The testimony was that15 the characteristics of the applicant pool.16 QUESTION: As long as you say between 8 and 12,17 you're okay? Is that it? If you said 10 it's bad you but18 between 8 and 12 it's okay, because it's not a fixed19 number? Is that -- that's what you think the Constitution20 is?21 MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, if it was a fixed22 range that said that it will be a minimum of 8 percent,23 come hell or high water, no matter what the qualifications24 of these applicants look like, no matter what it is that25 the majority applicants could contribute to the benefitsquota is under there is no it depends on￼401 of diversity, then certainly that would be a quota, but2 that is not what occurred here. And in fact the testimony3 was undisputed, that this was not intended to be a fixed4 goal.5 QUESTION: Ms. Mahoney may I shift focus away6 from this to another point before you're finished, that I7 am concerned about. In all programs which this Court has8 upheld in the area of -- you want to label it affirmative9 action, there's been a fixed time period within which it10 would operate. You could see at the end -- an end to it,11 there is none in this, is there? How do we deal with that12 aspect?13 MS. MAHONEY: What the policy says, of course,14 is that it will only take race into account as long as it15 is necessary in order to achieve the educational16 objectives.17 I don't think that this Court should conclude18 that this is permanent, because there are two things that19 can happen that will make this come to an end. The first20 is that the number of high-achieving minorities will21 continue to grow and that law school will be able to22 enroll a sufficient number to have a critical mass or23 meaningful numbers or substantial presence without having24 to take race into account.25 The second thing that can happen, Your Honor, is￼411 that we could reach a point in our society where the2 experience of being a minority did not make such a3 fundamental difference in their lives, where race didn't4 matter so much that it's truly salient to the law school's5 educational mission.6 While that I can't say when that will happen, we7 certainly know that as a nation, we have made tremendous8 progress in overcoming intolerance. And we certainly9 should expect that that will occur with respect to10 minorities.11 QUESTION: We approved any other affirmative12 action program with such a vague distant termination base?13 MS. MAHONEY: Well, in Bakke itself, Your Honor.14 In Bakke itself, there were five votes to allow the15 University of California Davis to use a plan modeled on16 the Harvard plan. It's been in effect for about 25 years.17 It has reaped extraordinary benefits for this country's18 educational system.19 And I think it's far too soon for this Court to20 include that --21 QUESTION: Can -- can we tell from the22 statistics whether things have been improved say, more and23 more minorities are getting in on their own to the24 University of Michigan Law School without the quotas?25 MS. MAHONEY: Yes.￼42123 Honor. 45678 there has9 to a study, it was done by Manning it's in footnote 50 of10 Justice Powell's opinion and it gives the number of11 minorities who had achieved a 165 and a 3.5 on the LSAT.12 QUESTION: How about say the last 15 years, at13 the University of Michigan, which wasn't being under14 consideration which Justice Powell's opinion?15 MS. MAHONEY: I think the answer would be that16 we do know that in 1964 when there was a race-blind17 policy, there were no blacks admitted, and under a18 race-blind policy today, probably six blacks would be19 admitted without consideration of race.20 So there has not been enough progress to allow21 for meaningful numbers at this point, but there has been22 progress.23 QUESTION: Do we know what's happened in the law24 schools in California since it was determined by State law25 affirmative action?QUESTION: Or whether --MS. MAHONEY: Yes, they're not quotas, YourQUESTION: The critical mass?MS. MAHONEY: We do know -- aspirations -- QUESTION: Aspirations.MS. MAHONEY: -- but we do know Your Honor that been improvement, in fact, Justice Powell cited￼431 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor. We know that for2 the first -- I think, 4 or 5 years, both only enrolled3 about -- between I think zero and 7 African-American4 students. They do better on Hispanics because of the5 demographics of that State, where it's virtually 506 percent Hispanic at the college-age level. But what we7 have learned is that in the -- they changed their program8 2 years ago and this fall they succeeded in enrolling 149 African-American students, but what we know from talking10 to the law school admissions counsel with Boalt's11 permission is that the African-Americans who were enrolled12 under that program have a 9 point LSAT score gap from the13 whites who have been enrolled, so the same gap --14 QUESTION: Well, there are other law schools in15 California, too, are there not?16 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, UCLA, well, this is mainly a17 problem Your Honor for the highly selective schools18 because of the nature of the pool.19 QUESTION: You have some good law schools, you20 have UCLA, you have USC?21 MS. MAHONEY: UCLA.22 QUESTION: SC is private?23 MS. MAHONEY: Yes.24 QUESTION: But UCLA?25 MR. KOLBO: UCLA -- UCLA had -- the class that's￼441 graduatiing this year, for instance, I believe had five2 blacks in it. So I believe last fall they did better and3 we have been told that that's because they were able to4 recruit some additional numbers of black students because5 of a special critical race studies program they're6 offering but that's not a solution to the pool problem,7 Your Honor.89 ranges of10 students,11 country, three or four per top 10 schools.12 So some kind of, you know, race-conscious13 recruiting that schools are using doesn't solve that14 problem.15 And if I could go back to Boalt for just another16 minute, because that is something that the petitioners17 raised in their reply brief, is that given that we know18 that they have exactly the same nine-point LSAT gap that19 Michigan gets under its program, there is no reason to20 think that what they are doing would satisfy the21 petitioner's conception of the Equal Protection Clause.The pool problem is that if we look at the LSATs where the University of Michigan takes its there are literally about 30 in the entire￼2223 record. 2425QUESTION: That's difficult when it's not in theI do have one more question on this quota point. I don't think the answer that you gave to451 Justice Scalia was in -- in all respects complete. You2 said well, if -- if there were a program that no matter3 what you used a somewhat different phrase, no matter what,4 there would be people taken regardless of qualifications5 -- that would be a quota.6 Suppose the pool is large enough so that you can7 find minorities to fill your 15 percent aspiration. Why8 isn't that a quota even if they're qualified?9 MS. MAHONEY: Because, Your Honor I think --10 QUESTION: It seems to me that that wasa--a11 really a false -- or an improper qualification that you12 gave to your answer?13 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.14 Because I think -- certainly if it's a fixed number that15 you're going to take no matter what, then that is a quota,16 but I think the difference between a quota and a goal is17 the flexibility.18 And what this Court, for instance, said in19 Johnson when talking about, they authorized the use of a20 goal and they said that the line between a goal and a21 quota is in fact whether or not you have to automatically22 and blindly promote people in order to meet the goal or23 whether it is a factor that is taken into account and24 that's exactly what occurs here.25 QUESTION: How does the University determine￼461 from one year to the next, you say some years it'll come2 out eight3 conscious45 --percent, some year nine percent, do they make a decision?MS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, the evidence showsQUESTION: Just toss a coin?MS. MAHONEY: No, it's not tossing a coin, but a fixed number. What they do is, they look --6 78 it is not9 it's responsive to the applicant pool. They look at the10 applicants, they are looking at a variety of factors on a11 holistic basis and they find the applicants that they12 think are going to bring the most in toto to the law13 school class, but it is not measured against a specific14 numerical target. And the district court did not find15 otherwise.16 It is simply looking at that pool and what17 Michigan is --18 QUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, do you know any quota19 program that would take somebody to fill the quota no20 matter what? All the quota programs I know start off by21 saying we will only take qualified applicants, but then22 setting the level of qualified low enough that they can23 fill the quota. I don't know any program that said no24 matter what we're going to fill this quota.25 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor --￼471 QUESTION: To establish that kind of a standard2 for quota is -- is to -- is to just eliminate the -- the3 whole purpose of -- of that aspect of our law.4 MS. MAHONEY: Actually, Your Honor, the way that5 in Bakke it worked, it wasn't the situation that they6 would take someone no matter what, but they did have a7 rule, that you could not be considered for the spaces that8 had been set aside if you were white. And so it works in a9 very different way, Your Honor.10 There -- Bakke applied, there were four spaces11 available in the special admissions program, but he12 couldn't be considered for them, because of his race.13 That doesn't happen at the University of14 Michigan. When someone applies, whether they're white, it15 doesn't matter how many minorities have been accepted or16 rejected. They are considered on their merits just like17 every other applicant. That's the defining difference18 between what happened in the UC Davis program.19 QUESTION: But they aren't just like every20 applicant. Some applicants are given a preference because21 of their race.22 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, they are given extra23 weight in the process, because they have something unusual24 and important to bring to the class. That's what every --25 that's the way every applicant is considered and --￼481 QUESTION: Which you say automatically follows2 from race?3 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, they also write essays4 about diversity. Every applicant is given the chance to5 write an essay about diversity. The law school does --6 QUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, how does the Michigan7 plan differ or the Harvard plan, for that matter, from8 what was familiar, that is, highly selected schools will9 reject a certain number of people, take a number of people10 as automatic acceptance and in the large middle will say,11 well, we'll -- we'll take people because they're12 different, because they play the bassoon, because they13 belong to a minority race? Because in the days that when14 I went to law school, they are female, because we want the15 class to be diverse and so they used race, they used sex,16 they used --17 MS. MAHONEY: That's exactly what the University18 of Michigan Law School plan does. It looks at all19 potential contributions to diversity. And what the20 evidence shows in this case is that it is common for white21 applicants to be admitted with lower grades and test22 scores than even minorities who are rejected because --23 QUESTION: Does the Constitution prohibit24 discrimination against -- against oboe players as opposed25 to flute players?￼49123 the basis 456 the basis 78 is prohibited discrimination. And the answer that we9 would ask this Court to give is that a minority applicantMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor.QUESTION: Does it prohibit discrimination on of alumna status?MS. MAHONEY: No,QUESTION: But itof race?MS. MAHONEY: But10 brings something special. They are not similarly situated11 to the white applicant who has the exact same grades and12 test scores.13 QUESTION: Ms. Mahoney, may I ask you a question14 that is really prompted by Justice O'Connor's question15 about the terminal point in all of this? And we're all16 hoping some day race will be a totally irrelevant factor17 in all decisions. One of the arguments on the other side18 of your case is that there's actually -- these programs19 actually generate racial hostility particularly on the20 part of the excluded members. And that in turn delays the21 ultimate day we are all hoping for.22 What is your comment about that?23 MS. MAHONEY: The record certainly does not24 support that inference under this program. And the reason25 is this: The program -- one of the ways to prevent thatYour Honor.does prohibit disrimination onthe question is whether this￼501 from happening is to have a narrowly tailored program to2 have very limited consideration of race and not to, for3 instance, have two great a disparity between the4 qualifications of the white students who are admitted and5 the minority students who are admitted under the program.6 Here it's actually quite limited. In fact, you know, the7 vast -- the most -- the most of the minorities who are8 admitted are in the top 16 percent of all LSAT takers in9 the country. So we're talking about a really exceptional10 group of students.11 By keeping the relative qualifications fairly12 close, like that, you really minimize the potential for13 any kind of stigmatizing or hostility, that sort of thing.14 And what the record shows is that in the Orfield15 study which was done of Harvard and University of16 Michigan's students, it's in the record at Exhibit 167,17 that there is overwhelming support by the students at18 Harvard and Michigan Law Schools for maintaining the￼19 diversity20 That's --21 22program, because they regard it as so positive.QUESTION: Sure, they're in already.MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor that's for the -- QUESTION: The people you want to talk to are2324 the high school seniors who have seen -- who have seen25 people visibly less qualified than they are get into511 prestigious institutions where they are rejected. If you2 think that is not creating resentment, you are just wrong.3 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, certainly the4 minorities who have been admitted under the program are5 not feeling stigmatized by it. If they continue to6 support the program in the ways that they do. In7 addition, the whites who are seeing their performance in8 the class and who are confirming that they find it highly9 beneficial to have the -- the chance to share the10 experiences of the minority students when they are11 learning about the law, has to be given substantial weight12 in considering whether this is somehow stigmatizing or13 perpetuating historic stereotypes, which is really the14 test that this Court used in VMI to determine whether or15 not something really should be condemned because of its16 potential to stigmatize.17 QUESTION: If Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke18 can be viewed as, yes, you can use race as a plus factor,19 where the program is not against anyone, but you cannot go20 too far, and it says individualized consideration is21 necessary there, what in your opinion would be going too22 far, other than quotas? How would this be maintained23 within limits?24 MS. MAHONEY: I think there are really three25 things other than a quota to look for. The first is￼521 whether there is flexible consideration of the diversity2 contributions of every potential student, which Michigan3 program clearly satisfies, whether the minorities who are4 being admitted are well qualified, because you don't want5 to have a situation where they can't contribute to the6 class and can't succeed, and the third is the degree of7 the burden on the rejected applicants, that's certainly8 relevant under any narrow tier learning program. And9 here, what the record tells us is that 95 percent of all10 the admissions decisions that are made each year are not11 affected by the consideration of race.12 That the chance -- that there are about 250013 students who are rejected each year probably only 80 of14 them would have been -- would have gotten an offer of15 admission from Michigan under a race-blind system.16 That is a very small and diffuse burden. It's17 not one to be minimized. It's certainly something that18 the Court has to pay attention to, but this is extremely19 limited in scope and relative to the benefits to students20 of all races and to our Nation. It has to be weighed in21 the balance and this Court certainly should conclude that22 the interests that are being served, the legitimate23 interests that are being served are sufficiently24 compelling to allow this kind of limited consideration of25 race.￼531 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Do we know what would be the increase of the named Plaintiffs, the increase in their chance of admission, were there no affirmative action programs?MS. MAHONEY: I don't know what the increase for the -- for Barbara Grutter would have been, for instance, we do know that across the class, it would have been approximately 5 percent.One might say that that could vary, you know, by individual. The record evidence would indicate, however, that Barbara Grutter would not have been admitted under a race-blind program, although that issue has not been litigated to conclusion.QUESTION: I don't know any other area where we -- where we decide the case by saying well, there are very few people who are being treated unconstitutionally.I mean, if this indeed is an unconstitutional treatment of -- of this woman, because of her race, surely, it doesn't make any difference whether she is one of very few who have been treated unconstitutionally.QUESTION: I think you can regard that as a statement rather than a question.MS. MAHONEY: Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Kolbo, you have two minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK KOLBO￼541 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERTHE WITNESS: Thank you, if I may follow-up onthe last question.Counsel's answer to the last couple ofquestions, I think, really crystallizes the difference between their position and ours. The University of Michigan sees this as a question of group rights. There are rights on the part of minorities. And there are rights -- there are rights on the part of whites and Asians and other -- other groups.We see it very differently. The Constitution protects the rights of individuals, not racial groups.The Bakke case opening up 16 spaces in the class when that system was struck down meant that about 2,500 students, 2,500 to 3,000 students who had previously been discriminated against now had an opportunity to compete for those seats.So it seems to me the question is not answered by how many have been discriminated against.The question is whether in fact discrimination is occurring against the individual and it certainly is in this particular case.Counsel was asked some questions about the open-ended nature of the policy at issue here. And I think it's very critical that we understand that if the￼551 interests that they are asserting here to be compelling is2 upheld as compelling by this Court, we have in fact the3 first indefinite, ongoing, unlimited compelling interest.4 The Court previously has confined its analysis5 to remedying -- remedying identified discrimination. A6 remedy based on societal discrimination or a role-model7 theory for example in Wygant. A couple of the reasons8 that the Court struck down those rationals was because9 they were so unlimited, so amorphus, indefinite with10 respect to time.11 That certainly is the case with the interest12 that is being urged here today.13 And it seems to me that that is -- it becomes14 very clear in the University's argument that what they've15 done -- and they didn't argue so much this in16 court, but they made it very clear that their17 justification for the preferences is based inthe lowereffect on￼18 remedying 1920 Court has21 it will come someday, we hope that it will, that someday22 that we will be able to stop using race for these23 purposes.24 And the opinion that accepted that rationale it25 seems to me would be a dramatic step backward from thissocietal discrimination.Their argument and their briefs andbeen that when the day comes, someday and maybe56in this1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court's precedents which have rejected the notion that something as amorphus as societal discrimination would be sufficient.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Kolbo. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼57
