Colorado.            General Six.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX               ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFOfficial - Subject to Final Review            MR. SIX:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:10111213141516   jurisdiction.17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's an extremely18   sensitive clause in Article III.  We can decide this19   case without relying on the distinction you just20   discussed, can't we?21               MR. SIX:  Well, I think can you, and the22   Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even23   reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and24   avoid that constitutional conflict.  And I think the25   stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very3            Article III makes a clear distinctionbetween the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction,and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptionsand regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congressis not granted the same power over originalAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   result. 2               The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28 3   U.S.C. section 1920, states:  "A judge or clerk of any 4   court of the United States may tax as costs the 5   following."  And it lists six subparagraphs, including 6   subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for 7   Printing and Witnesses. 8               The statute has two terms in it that are 9   defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and,10   importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is11   defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and12   that is "Justice of the United States."  "Justice of the13   United States" is defined as "the Chief Justice and the14   Associate Justices of the Supreme Court."  The cost15   provision says "a judge."  "Judge of the United States"16   is defined as including judges on the court of appeals,17   the district court, the Court of International Trade,18   essentially the listed courts and the Article III19   judges.20               JUSTICE:  But, on the other hand, "court of21   the United States" is defined specifically to include22   the Supreme Court.  So you have a contradiction no23   matter which way you flip it.  On the one hand, it says24   "judge," which does not include the Justices of the25   Supreme Court.  On the other hand, it says "court of the4Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   United States," which does include the Supreme Court.2   So why should we pick one -- one answer to the3   contradiction rather than the other?4               MR. SIX:  You don't have to pick.  And5   you're correct, "the court of the United States" is6   defined to include the Supreme Court.  But the strongest7   reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words8   in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who9   appears in the court of the United States.  And if you101112131415161718   "clerk."  We may not be judges, but we certainly have a19   clerk.think about it, there's a circle of judges that aredefined here and a circle of courts that are definedhere, and where the two overlap, where you are both ajudge and in the court of the United States, the statuteshould apply.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about --MR. SIX:  And that --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It also says20               MR. SIX:  You do, and 28 U.S.C. section21   1911, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals22   with the Supreme Court Clerk.  And throughout title 28,23   the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower24   courts.25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is 1911 a stand-alone5Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   provision that would justify relief for you, or do we 2   have to also refer to the general cost statute? 3               MR. SIX:  I don't think the Court would 4   refer to the general cost statute in its original 5   jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from 6   Congress.  28 U.S.C. 19 -- 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but let's assume 8   that we think Congress can control this, this issue, 9   this question.  Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a10   stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without11   reference to 1920.12               MR. SIX:  I mean, I would -- if your13   assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has14   done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant15   of the discretion the Court already has.  They are16171819202122232425turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have theclerk set costs.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I think this case iscontrolled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?            MR. SIX:  No.  I don't believe you have torefer to 1920.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why can't you rest yourcase just on 1911?            MR. SIX:  Because in the originaljurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given6Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   power to make exceptions or regulations over original 2   jurisdiction.  And in the 219 years of the Court's 3   original practice, they have never referred to a 4   congressional cost provision, and -- 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying that 1911 6   doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not 7   included within the term "other necessary 8   disbursements"? 9               MR. SIX:  I believe the expert witness fees10   in this case were vital to the resolution.  They were --11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were they within 1911?12               MR. SIX:  I don't believe they were other13   incidental disbursements.  That's not our position.14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Other necessary15   disbursements.16171819202122232425            MR. SIX:  Other necessary disbursements.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Incidental to the case.You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?            MR. SIX:  If -- if this Court determinesthat Congress has the power, and it's done so through --since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, Icertainly would accept that position as the result.However, I would point out to the Court that I think theexpert witness costs and the work was vital to theresolution of the case here.7Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   fees.  Is that correct?5               MR. SIX:  Absolutely.6               JUSTICE ALITO:  If that's so, why shouldn't7   we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert8   fees that are available in case of the original            JUSTICE ALITO:  If you're reading of thestatute is correct, then I take it we would have thediscretion to decide what would be appropriate expert 9   jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the10   expert fees that would be available in a district court?11   Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why12   should there be -- why should we as a discretionary13   matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically14   different fees depending on the court in which the case15   originates?16               MR. SIX:  Clearly the Court has the power to17   make that rule for original cases.  However, the18   original jurisdiction was developed when the States19   agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit20   their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original21   jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the22   sovereign States.  And as the Court said in Florida v.23   Georgia in 1854, "The analogies and rules and24   foundations of law that apply to private parties are not25   necessarily a good fit for sovereign States.8Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but Justice Alito is 2   saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have 3   guidance from Congress.  They have adhered to the $40 a 4   day limit in very important cases; why don't we just 5   say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that 6   this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it? 7               MR. SIX:  Because what Colorado's position 8   is that they are telling you that the Special Master's 9   hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even10   exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that11   would save $40 a day.12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We are saying it's our13   discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress14   has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and15 so forth.1617   power to do that.  However, there has only been18   approximately 200 original jurisdiction cases in the 21919   years of the Court.  To suggest that the rules --20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In all those -- in all21   those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's22   witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's23   expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a24   witness?  I mean, courts of the United States, district25   courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses9MR. SIX:  Clearly, the Court would have theAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   as distinguished from party's witnesses.  Do you know if 2   that's happened in Special Master situations? 3               MR. SIX:  I can tell you it didn't happen in 4   this case.  I certainly can't speak to whether it's 5   happened in other cases involving special masters, so I 6   don't know the answer to that.  Certainly 1920 makes a 7   distinction for court- appointed experts rather than the 8   expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920. 9               I think the important point to consider,10   though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its11   219 years of developing essentially an interstate common12   law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of13   cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford14   Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position:  You15   have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have16   the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920,17   which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only18   after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you19   you're limited to $40 a day.20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do Special Master fees21   work?  The Special Master always has fees and the22   parties I think usually divide them.  How does that --23 24 25how is their authority to order them --            MR. SIX:  Sure.  Rule 53 of the FederalRules of Civil Procedure deals with special masters in10Alderson Reporting Company￼202122232425            MR. SIX:  To appoint a Special Master?            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.            MR. SIX:  It's an inherent authority theCourt has in original jurisdiction cases.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that the authority tocompensate is inherent?11Official - Subject to Final Review1   the lower courts.  It has no application here and wasn't2   used.  The Special Master's fees, which total3 4 5 6 7 8 9approximately a million dollars, just shy of that, wereresolved by the parties after the Special Master wasallowed to exercise discretion on that area of cost.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what if they hadn't-- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?            MR. SIX:  If they hasn't resolved theSpecial Master's --10111213   dollars?14            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.  How would the -- howwould the Special -- what would be the authority of thisCourt to make an order that the Special Master be paid X            MR. SIX:  Well, I think the authority of theCourt comes from the order appointing the Special Masterto handle the case and to do the specific things thatwere --1516171819   regressed one step.  Where does the authority come from?JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  We just, we justAlderson Reporting Company￼16171819202122232425always been carefully preserved to the discretion of theCourt to apply each unique case.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  General Six, under yourreading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would theCourt have authority to charge your fees to youradversary, shift attorney's fees?            MR. SIX:  Yes.  In the original jurisdictionthe Court would have the inherent authority to dofee-shifting if the --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Did you make such a12Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. SIX:  The authority to compensate is2   inherent.  In the Judiciary --3 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Are you making -- would youmake an inherent authority argument here?MR. SIX: Yes.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Regardless of originaljurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you saythat this Court simply has the inherent authority to, toin effect to decree these sorts of claims.            MR. SIX:  Well, again there is a distinctionbetween appellate and original and, focusing onoriginal, I think the Court has entirely the authority.The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Courtexclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set101112131415   forth any procedures to govern the disputes.  That'sAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   request in this case?  Why should -- why should2   attorney's fees be treated differently from expert3   witness fees?  Let me put it that way.  Or should it be4567   circumstances of the case.  In this case we chose expert8   witness fees --treated differently?            MR. SIX:  The Special Master should have thediscretion to consider all the costs and unique 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  We should have the10   discretion.  Why do you keep talking about the Special11   Master?  He's just -- he's just our amanuensis.12   Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?13               MR. SIX:  It is, and the benefit of having14   the Special Master make a recommendation is we could15   have gone through these different categories of costs16   and come up with a recommendation.  The Court certainly17   could have learned --18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it the usual19   practice is for the parties to settle this matter and20   submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that21   correct?22               MR. SIX:  The way it's worked in this case23   is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the24   Special Master's fees.  The Special Master suggested it25   wouldn't be unfair to award them two-thirds Colorado,13Alderson Reporting Company￼19202122232425fees be treated differently from attorney's fees?            MR. SIX:  Well, in this case they should betreated differently because the model at issue that theexperts for Kansas developed, the HI model, was used toprove our claims at trial, which would have --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  You used lawyers to proveyour case, too.Official - Subject to Final Review 1   one-third Kansas.  After that the parties resolved it, 2   just like we resolved every other issue of cost where 3   the Special Master was allowed to apply that discretion. 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So why didn't -- - 5   then are we here?  We are talking about limited amounts. 6   So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't 7   the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special 8   Master fees this is what we are going to agree to.  It 9   doesn't have to be limited to $40.  You can agree as10   part of a global settlement to whatever you want.11                MR. SIX:  Well, the Special Master's fees12   we resolved.  The experts fees at issue here, of course13   that bright-line rule was drawn by the Special Master14   and he never was allowed to make a recommendation to the15   Court to consider that.  In balancing -- the remedies in16   these cases are highly equitable remedies.17               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you just answer my18   question of a moment ago.  Why should expert witness14Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. SIX:  Excuse me?2               JUSTICE STEVENS:  You used lawyers to prove3   your case, too.  Why should they not be compensated?4               MR. SIX:  Because we considered the special5   circumstances of the model.  It proved the claims at6   trial.  It was adopted by the Court in 2004 in Kansas v.7   Colorado to monitor compliance in the Arkansas River8   Basin.  It's the water use -- it's applied by the9   Colorado State water use rule.  So it was special10   features like that that we wanted to present to the11   Special Master to explain why the fees should be fairly12   balanced and divided in a way other than he did.13               JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't understand that to14   be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's15   fees.16171819   appropriate.  In this case we felt the expert model we20   developed was so vital that it would be persuasive to21   the Special Master and fair and equitable to award it to22 us. 23242515            MR. SIX:  Well, in a particular case whereperhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed orsome other situation developed, fee shifting may be            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know whether anyother -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question,what the practice had been, but with respect to expertAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911   in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the12   Delaware River.  And the Court pointed out in that13   opinion that a mass of evidence was presented to the14   Special Master, and on costs the Court said:  "The cost15   of the cause shall be divided 35 percent to New Jersey,16   35 to City of New York," and so on.  The "cost of the17   cause" I would argue is the cost to get the case to the18   point where it was resolved.  In the boundary dispute --fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Courtever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?            MR. SIX:  In original cases the Court hasnever referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutesdiscussed in Crawford Fitting.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But have they everapproved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate forthe expert witness that deviates from the $40?                 MR. SIX:  I think the answer to that is yes10   and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v.  New York19202122   opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is.  However,23   from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you know -- do youknow whether there were expert witnesses in that case?            MR. SIX:  It does not say in the published24   issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do25   that without experts.  But I would point the Court to16Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed 2   the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers, 3   historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes 4   equally between the States -- not each State to bear 5   their own cost, but divided them equally. 6               And the -- the experts that are involved in 7   resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different 8   than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of 9   experts that we used in this case.10               JUSTICE BREYER:  You're right.  They are all11   different.  They did a lot of work on that.  I -- I know12   they did a lot of work on this.  Congress has a statute,13   and the statute is:  We don't care if the witness is14   Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local15   zookeeper.  Okay.  We don't care.  We don't care if they16   did a lot of work or a little work.  We want them to be17   paid $40 a day, period.  It's too much trouble to figure18   out how much work they did.  That's what we want.19   That's the law.20               Now, Justice Alito said:  I agree with you21   for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule.  But22   I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is:23   Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law;24   still, why shouldn't we follow it?25               MR. SIX:  Because in the original cases the17Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   Court has always tried to reach an equitable balance -- 2               JUSTICE BREYER:  Have do you any example 3   where Congress had a statute which says every court in 4   the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that 5   number is; it's $382.50, okay.  Now, despite that clear 6   statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a 7   different amount.  Is there any such case? 8               MR. SIX:  I'm not aware of that. 9               JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And is there10   anything in the -- in the nature of litigation?  And11   there might be.  I'm not asking it as a rhetorical12   question.  Is there anything in the nature of original13   jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would14   call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to15   make a distinction between expert witnesses and others,16   or to do other things that would complicate it?17               I'm not speaking of your case.  You have a18   wonderfully strong case in your case.  I want to know19   about in general, in original actions.20               MR. SIX:  I would suggest the only21   difference is the parties.  And the Court in its 21922 years --23               JUSTICE BREYER:  If anything, the parties24   are in a better position to pay the money than the25   average person.18Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I assume -- I assume 2   your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and 3   we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may 4   think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert9 105   Einstein is ridiculous.  And, therefore, if it's up to6   us, we would adopt a different rule.  Isn't that your7   answer?8                 MR. SIX:  That's exactly my answer.  And if     you think -- if Congress can adopt a congressional --                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm not sure that11   answer is -- is at all adequate.  Number one, what is12   there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so13   different about this case?14               Let's say one landowner secretly and15   intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and16   -- and he has no legal right to do that.  And the only17   way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very,18   very expensive expert, a hydrologist.  And by the time19   he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit20   of the damages.  Congress has said too bad.  That's the21 way it is.22               Why isn't it that way with States,23   especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can24   really afford the -- afford it better than the25   landowner.  What's the difference?19Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. SIX:  The difference is the Court has2   indicated for original cases:  These are such disputes3   of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations4   that the model case for even taking a case is where the5   acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type6   of thing that would lead to war.7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I haven't seen -- I8   mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does9   it?  I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to10111213   repeating Justice Scalia's question.  The fact that14   Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in15   reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.16               MR. SIX:  I would agree.  The special17   master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he18   was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million19   dollars.  The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas20   had amounted to approximately $30,000.  So that21   different there, I think, demonstrates the very22   unfairness --23               JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not unfair to have a24   rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or25   lose.  That's the rule, isn't it?20spend the day appearing in court worth being called an"expert" for $40.I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm justAlderson Reporting Company￼23 24 25            MR. SIX:  Because in the originaljurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties orlitigious cases, the Court has traditionally and21Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. SIX:  I don't think that's the rule in2   original jurisdiction cases.  At least the Court has3   never said that.  The Court has --4567   own experts.  Is that right or wrong?8               MR. SIX:  I think that's correct, but we9   didn't lose.  And the Court found that Kansas proved            JUSTICE BREYER:  If you lose this case, ifwe were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rulewhere, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his10   that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 5011   years by clear and convincing evidence.  But one pointI'd like to make --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, can we do this then?121314151617181920   too?  If we are going to have them pay the experts, why21   don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers'22   fees?  That would be quite a revolution.I think maybe in many cases that are technical in natureit might be quite a good thing for the losing party topay the winning side's lawyers.            MR. SIX:  The Court would have that abilityto do that in original jurisdiction --JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, should we do that,Alderson Reporting Company￼ 910111213141516171819202122distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court whenthe Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what itcan say, and has said, for the lower courts.            MR. SIX:  Yes, It could say that for thelower courts.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?            MR. SIX:  Because --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think that, so long asCongress could not create the lower courts at all, onceit creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to anysort of absurd rules?            MR. SIX:  I think they could pass a rulelike they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for specialmasters, and they could through the Rules Enabling ActOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   historically awarded the prevailing party costs.  And if2   Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost,3   Congress could pass a statute that says:  You have to4   take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use5   special masters, or you can't use certain special6   masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas.7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you save that for the8   lower courts?  I mean, you are -- you are trying to23   pass a rule that says you can't use special masters.  I24   think you get into whether that's --25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I just don't agree22Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   with your assumption that just because Congress need not2   have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal3   court required by the Constitution is this Court,4   therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever5   it wants with them.  I -- I don't agree with that.6               MR. SIX:  Well, I would certainly focus more7   on the original jurisdiction issue here and haven't8   focused as much on that issue, but --9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When we award the --10   the special master's fees in original cases, do we11   specify who will bear those fees?12               MR. SIX:  Yes, you do.  In -- you do in the13   cases that have discussed costs.  For instance, in14   boundary dispute cases you have suggested that the cost15   -- the costs will be divided equally; in litigious16   cases, that they will be awarded to the prevailing17   party.18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we include the19   special master's fees as part of the costs that are20   allocated?2122232425   the parties agree to it if we do it?  In other words, if23            MR. SIX:  Yes, and in this case the partieshave agreed to that and never made an issue about that.And there is no --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why -- why didAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1234   misheard your question.  The order appointing thewe say in our orders who bears the special master'sfees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?MR. SIX:  Well, in this case -- maybe I5678   that ahead of time.  It was an issue to be determined9   and decided at the end of the litigation.special master did not resolve the issue of fees.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.MR. SIX:  And the parties did not agree to10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it -- isn't it11   customary for it to be divided 50/50?  I mean, we12   periodically will approve the fees that the special13   master charges and then they are divided between the14   parties.  And I thought that they were divided 50/50.15   Is that not so?16               MR. SIX:  Well, as the case progressed, the17   special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50.18   At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested19   reasons and special circumstances that should allow the20   special master to apply discretion.21               He then suggested it wouldn't be unfair to22   award the special master fee costs two-thirds Colorado,23   one-third Kansas because of the unique features of the24   case.  And the parties then settled the special master25   fees with that guidance.24Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, I think you 2   gave the answer earlier.  Rule 53 allows for the -- an 3   order to say that one or both parties shall pay the 4   special master fee.  So if we are going to follow other 5   analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert 6   witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. 7   It's under Rule 53. 8               Of course, you say we don't have to follow 9   that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were10   to look to congressional and -- and to other rules.11               MR. SIX:  It is a model; however, the Court12   has always carefully preserved its discretion to treat13   each dispute between the sovereign states as a unique14   dispute.  And the Court never even enacted an original15   action rule until 1939, so after 150 years.  And in 193916   the Court enacted Rule 5, which just set up the bare17   minimums of commencing the action.  And Rule 17 today1819202122232425   original actions?  I mean, what -- what is magical ishas essentially the same framework that tells theparties how to start the action but reserves all theother rules to the discretion of the special master.            It does point to the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure and the Rules of Evidence as guides but notbinding, mandatory rules that tie the Court's hand.JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is magical about25Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   that we are the only court that is required by the2   Constitution.  But we are -- we are not just the only3   court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals.4   Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in5   the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal6 courts? 789            MR. SIX:  Well, the Court has, in 1913,determined that -- excuse me, in 1912, that when a caseis affirmed, the Supreme Court can adjudge costs for10   damages and delay.  So they have directed, I think, a --111213141516171819202122232425   direction from the statutes and rightly so.  Section26a regulation at the appellate jurisdiction, but never atthe original jurisdiction.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean Congresshas done that?MR. SIX:  Congress, I'm sorry.            I would like to reserve the remainder of mytime for rebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.General Suthers.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SUTHERS   ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTMR. SUTHERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            The special master in this case found clearAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   1821 of Title 28 is unambiguous.  It provides that a2   witness in attendance at any court of the United States3   shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in4   addition to travel and accommodation allowances.5               Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of6   the United States" to include this Court, the Supreme7   Court of the United States, and that definition has been8   part of the statute since 1948.  Because witness fees9   are only at issue in the Supreme Court in cases of10   original jurisdiction, it's apparent that Congress11   intended the limits set forth in 1821 to apply in such12   cases.1314151617181920212223   price.24               MR. SUTHERS:  It would not be the first time25   that you've allowed Congress to legislate some aspects27            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what if they saidin original actions no fees shall be allowed to anyspecial master appointed by the Supreme Court?            MR. SUTHERS:  Chief Justice, it would thenbe up to the Court to decide whether that's somehow anintrusion into your --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we allow -- if weallow Congress to regulate fees in our originaljurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we'vegiven up the principle and we are just negotiating overAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   of your original jurisdiction.  Congress has told you in 2   what is now Section 1251 that your original jurisdiction 3   is not entirely exclusive.  Only State versus State is 4   exclusive, and all the rest of your jurisdiction is 5   nonexclusive. 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't this an area, 7   though, where we should be particularly sensitive?  In 8   other words, one reason that we were given original 9   jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were10   afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the11   courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution.12               I think it would be surprising if you told13   the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate14   this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can15   sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would16   be surprising.  It would not be regarded by them as a17181920212223   original jurisdiction cases?  Maybe it hasn't come up24   because other special masters have said, we'll give the25   expert witness a reasonable fee for services28significant safeguard.            MR. SUTHERS:  Chief Justice, if it was sucha sensitive issue, why is it we are now in 2008 and thisCourt has never decided to enact any kind of rules --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we don't know -- -General Suthers, do we know what has happened in pastAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   commensurate with the qualifications and the work that2   the expert has done.  We don't know if that has or3 4 5 6 7 8 9hasn't happened in the past, do we?            MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Ginsburg, we -- welooked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult toresearch -- but we could not find an originaljurisdiction case where there was an award of witnessfees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you find any caseswhere the special master had appointed his own witnessas distinguished from the parties?101112131415161718   determined was appropriate.  That's correct.19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, in a -- in a case20   like this one, where the nature of the work that the21   expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides,22   isn't it odd that the special master chose the court23   expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if24   you have one party calls an expert who renders great25   service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get29MR. SUTHERS:  No.  We did not.  But --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- but yourecognize that if a special master appointed a witness,or the court, that that witness would be paid acompensatory fee?MR. SUTHERS:  Whatever the special masterAlderson Reporting Company￼1   compensated?  Isn't that an anomaly?1516171819202122   it.2324 25            Do you happen to know whether at the timethe original jurisdiction of this Court was established,there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness30Official - Subject to Final Review2345   you're talking about the unfairness of it.  Number one,6   this situation here is no more unfair to Kansas than any7   litigant in Federal court.  And number two, it's            MR. SUTHERS:  The special master, JusticeGinsburg, found clear direction from the statute and didnot believe that he had an option in the matter, if 8   appropriate matter to take to Congress. 9               The last time they changed it was 1990 from10   $30 to $40.  I think it's time to revisit it.  But it11121314   unfairness to Einstein anyway.  I mean, you know, theis, in fact, what Congress has dictated should be thecompensation --JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a matter ofexpert witness is going to get his money.            MR. SUTHERS:  That's correct, Justice.  Theycertainly did in this case.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The question is --MR. SUTHERS:  Both sides can vouch for that.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The question is whether oneside can get some money from the other to help pay forAlderson Reporting Company￼1 fees? 2MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Scalia, I do not.  WeOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewdo know --            MR. SUTHERS:  -- that it's 1853 when for thefirst time Congress, desiring to have uniform fees,34567   began the structure of expert witness fees.  It started89 10at $1.50 a day, in 1853.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you -- may I ask you aJUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't either.     statutory question just about the application of the11   statute.  As -- as you have pointed out, if the $4012   applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a13   determination of a particular item under section 1920:14   Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may15   tax its cost.  My question is this.  One of the items16   covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk17   may tax, is fees of the clerk.18               Under section 1911, which relates entirely19   to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the20   Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its21   clerk.  That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the22   Supreme Court of the United States.23               Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section24   1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the25   United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was31Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn'tit follow from that that either the Supreme Court'sauthority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to becharged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that thereis no statute on it at all?            But the main point is unless 1911 is totallyredundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to becharged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover theSupreme Court.Official - Subject to Final ReviewMR. SUTHERS:  Justice Ginsburg, 1920 --JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm greatly flattered.(Laughter.)MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Souter, Justice1011121314   Souter, sorry.  Justice Souter.151617181920   1911.  It talks about court reporter fees, printing --21               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, we didn't -- no22   question about that.  I recognize 1920 goes a lot23   further.  But there is no -- there is no need in 1911 to24   say to that the Supreme Court may -- may fix the fees to25   be charged by its clerk if the Supreme Court is already32            JUSTICE SOUTER:  You're not the first tohave done that.(Laughter.)            MR. SUTHERS:  1920 there may be someredundancies in it, but it's much more expansive than isAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   covered by 1920.2               MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Souter, I think if you3   look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the4   same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that5   applies to the court of appeals and to the district6   courts.  I think it's like 1913 and 1914.  So I -- I --7 8 9I don't think that you can --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, if it'sredundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?            MR. SUTHERS:  Yes.10111213141516   disbursements.  It does not address witness fees in --171819202122232425            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think it includesprinting fees?            MR. SUTHERS:  1911 does not, unless --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You don't -- you don'tthink that --            MR. SUTHERS:  Incidental disbursements?            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- what number here?  Youdon't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to chargefor printing fees?33JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.            MR. SUTHERS:  I think the important thingabout 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question,it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Courtclerk, cost of serving process and incidentalAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. SUTHERS:  As an incidental disbursement,2   it may.  But it clearly does not address witness fees.3 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the reason I ask isbecause printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees arein -- in the same sentence.            MR. SUTHERS:  And I -- I don't know whetherprinting would be considered incidental disbursements.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if you allowedprinting, then I think it would allow witnesses under1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clearthat no statute will be construed to authorize taxingwitness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly towitness fees.101112131415161718   the other fees, right?  Okay.  So the thing is, you19   can't pay money in the United States unless have you20   some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court21   some authorization to fix fees.            JUSTICE BREYER:  It is -- I mean, if youwant to really get a little complicated, the -- youhave -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the SupremeCourt fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all22               Now we look back at 1821.  And 1821 tells23   you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be.24   It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per25   day.  Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more.  Just says34Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   that's what he is entitled to.  Now of course, in the2   lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no3   authority to pay him more.  But in the Supreme Court,4   there is authority to pay him more.  That comes out of5   1911.6789   original jurisdiction rules and so forth.  Just -- there            I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'mactually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problemof whether Congress can start legislating the details of10   is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent11   ourselves from going down that road.  That's -- I'm12   deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of13   this gimmick?14               MR. SUTHERS:  Well, not much.15               (Laughter.)16               JUSTICE BREYER:  That's fair.17               (Laughter.)18               MR. SUTHERS:  This Court -- this Court19   decided three cases regarding the application of 1821.20               JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Yes.21               MR. SUTHERS:  Cases in which litigants, like22   Kansas, were trying to get around, in Federal court,23   this witness fee limitations, starting with Crawford24   Fitting.  In that case you held that the prevailing25   seeks -- who seeks reimbursements for fees paid to its35Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   limited it?  Was it 1821 they thought limited it? 5               MR. SUTHERS:  Yes.  And by the way, there is 6   a contract here.  It's the compact between, the 1949 7   compact between Kansas and Colorado, and -- 8               JUSTICE BREYER:  In an ordinary case, if a 9   witness -- doesn't -- never does go to court, but just10   goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to11   a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars?  He goes12   to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a13   court.  But Do they count that as being in attendance at14   a court?own expert, is limited by the statute unless we'retalking about a contract or express statutory --JUSTICE BREYER:  Which part did they think1516   Breyer.1718192021   don't have to --22               JUSTICE BREYER:  If that isn't attendance at23   a court, where did these witnesses show up?2425 trial.MR. SUTHERS:  These witnesses show up for36MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe so, JusticeJUSTICE BREYER:  Then where is his --MR. SUTHERS:  It's liberally construed.JUSTICE BREYER:  What?MR. SUTHERS:  It's liberally construed.  YouAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE BREYER:  Where?  Where do they have2   this proceeding?  I don't know; it wasn't here; it3   wasn't in this --4567 days. 8 910   Appeals.  They show up; they are in attendance; it's not11   just on the stand; all they time they're there, all the12   time they're travelling back and forth; it is liberally13   construed.14               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask.  Just to put15   one thing on the table if I could.  How do you deal with16   the problem that Justice Ginsburg raises:  If a court17   wants to appoint an independent expert and pay him more18   than $40 a day?  Do you say that's flatly prohibited?19   And if it's not flatly prohibited, what is the authority20   for doing so, other than 1911?21               MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Stevens, nothing22   prevents higher compensation for a court-appointed23   expert.  We are talking about --24               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what authorizes it?25   Doesn't 1911 authorize it?37MR. SUTHERS:  It was in California.JUSTICE BREYER:  Where?MR. SUTHERS:  Pasadena, California, for 272JUSTICE BREYER:  In the courthouse?MR. SUTHERS:  Yes.  Tenth Circuit Court ofAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1               MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe 1911 does.2               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, then what does?3               MR. SUTHERS:  The inherent authority of the4   Court.56789   that.  It does not address --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then why don't you havethe inherent authority to pay expert witness fees alittle more money, then?MR. SUTHERS:  Because the statute addresses10               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Constitution says that11   no money shall be -- shall be withdrawn from the12   Treasury except by appropriations made by law.  I think13   -- I think you need a law to spend -- to spend the14   government's money.15               JUSTICE STEVENS:  You're not spending the16   government's money; you're spending the litigant's17 money.18               MR. SUTHERS:  Well, in the case of the -- of19   the Court appointing an expert, it is typical at the20   conclusion of the case as part of the cost for the judge21   to determine what was an appropriate award the losing22   party -- what they should pay as part of that expert's23   expense.  But that's not what we are dealing with in24   1821.25               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about -- I mean38Alderson Reporting Company￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9now, as long as I'm starting down the road to outerspace, why not -- could we say, look, they were veryimpressive models these people did; on both sides theyhad terrific experts, very expensive; and would we havethe authority to say to the master, although you didn'ttreat them as your experts, you should have done, forpurposes of paying them.            MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Breyer, you are theSupreme Court and if you found that this statute --(Laughter.)(Laughter.)Official - Subject to Final Review10111213141516   you know, authority as a Court, you could do that.  But17   why would you want to get into the business -- going to18   Justice Alito's point -- you have so far refrained from19   enacting your own rules on this highly procedural matter20   of expert witness fees.            JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to beunreasonable about this.            MR. SUTHERS:  Yes.  If you found that thisstatute was an intrusion which somehow violated your,21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we would want22   to get into the business because it's our business; and23   it seems to me that if you yield on a basic point like24   this, that you're giving up, who knows how much?25               MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Roberts, I'm not --39Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1   you have done it before in -- in highly procedural 2   matters where you do not -- no one here is doing 3   anything that prevents your exercise of original 4   jurisdiction, that expands your exercise of original 5   jurisdiction.  The cases also say that your original 6   jurisdiction is self-executing, doesn't need any 7   statutory implementation; but this is a -- a totally 8   procedural matter, much as -- in fact, I think less of 9   an intrusion, when the -- when the Congress said to you10   these cases will not be exclusive jurisdiction.  Even11   though they are part of your original jurisdiction.12               This is a very procedural matter.13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could I ask you what --14   what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred15   to in 1911.  "Supreme Court may fix the fees to be16   charged by its clerk," and then the next paragraph says17   the fees of the clerk.  Is that what the first paragraph18   refers to, the fees of the clerk?  Or does it mean other19   fees that the clerk charges which could include costs?20   Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the21   clerk?22               MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe so, Justice23   Scalia.24               JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are not?  Fees of the25   clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but40Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   that could be taxed as costs.  Right?  A judge or clerk2345   include costs.  Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of6   statutes, don't you think?can tax as costs the following.            1911 says Supreme Court may fix "the fees tobe charged by its clerk," and you say that doesn't 7               MR. SUTHERS:  Not -- not a whole lot more so 8   than others I've seen. 9               (Laughter.)10               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --11               MR. SUTHERS:  By the way --12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's some comfort.13               MR. SUTHERS:  -- it has been pointed out to14   me in this compensation of court-appointed experts that15   that is specifically addressed in section 1920,16   paragraph 6, compensation of court-appointed experts is17   covered there.  So there is that statute authority which18   you indicated there should be.19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that taxes costs,20   and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs.  May21 22 23 24 25fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you saydon't include costs.            MR. SUTHERS:  I don't believe they do.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that wouldn't allow tous fix that.41Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Except 1911 may do two 2   things.  Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court 3   to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk.  And then in 4   the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the 5   cost of serving process and other necessary 6   disbursements; so it does two things. 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it tells you how they 8   are to be taxed.  It doesn't say what their level is to 9   be.  May be taxed against the litigants as the court10   directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them --11   fix the amounts.  It's not a very good statute, really.12               MR. SUTHERS:  If I may, once again going to13   the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in14   original jurisdiction cases, is because so many of the15   cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in16   fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this17   Court has not chosen to issue a conflicting rule, I18   think is very significant.19               If in fact you had set an appropriate fee20   for expert witness fees in case original jurisdiction,21   and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't22   be that, you should be stuck with $40, then we might23   have some kind of a constitutional issue here; but24   absent that, I simply don't --25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- what if42Alderson Reporting Company￼8 9101112131415            MR. SUTHERS:  Your inherent authority overoriginal jurisdiction cases.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if we haveinherent authority over original jurisdiction cases, howdoes it -- how come it disappears whenever Congressdecides to legislate in the area?            MR. SUTHERS:  Because Congress isentitled -- you've recognized their right to deal withOfficial - Subject to Final Review1   Congress had done nothing?  In other words, let's say2   they haven't addressed costs at all.  Would we be able3   to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?4               MR. SUTHERS:  I would concede that you --5   you probably could.  But --6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Pursuant to what7   authority?16   certain types of issues.  I find it very interesting17   that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says18   Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the19   process and mode of proceeding in original jurisdiction20   cases as fully as in other Federal courts, but that the21   omission to legislate such process does not deprive the22   Court of its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction.23   If this is something you have historically --24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is a substantive25   level of fees a mode of proceeding?43Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review            MR. SUTHERS:  Chief Justice, I would arguethat the setting of fees is a procedural matter; and itis -- and has to do with the mode of proceeding in a1234   case.  That's correct.5 6 7 8 9            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any -- doyou think $40 a day for an expert is a realisticassessment of what experts charge?            MR. SUTHERS:  Absolutely not, Chief Justice.And in fact, of course, as I think Justice Breyer10   pointed out, Einstein does not only get $40 a day.  We11   pay them a lot of money; but Congress has decided $40 is12   what they -- what they get.  Congress ought to revisit13   it.  There is no question about it.14151617181920   Ginsburg.  They certainly do not.  Experts in this case21   were paid lots and lots of money, and they don't even22   get that when the court has -- it's not -- at least the23   trial courts --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Parties pay a lot -- alot of expenses and then they may be -- may or not bereimbursed to the prevailing party; but the prevailingparty in our system certainly doesn't get anything likethe full cost of the litigation.2425 more.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe lawyers get even44MR. SUTHERS:  That's correct, JusticeAlderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. SUTHERS:  That's right. 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you don't get that back3 either. 4               MR. SUTHERS:  That's exactly right. 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I just get clear on 6   your view of inherent power?  As I understand it, you're 7   -- when you answered it, in a situation in which the 8   slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, 9   you're using "inherent power" in effect to be a kind of10   default power.  If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has11   got to do something.  That's got to be us, so -- so we12   would have the authority.  But you are not using the13   term "inherent power" in the sense of being a power14   which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress15   in any respect.  Is that correct?16               MR. SUTHERS:  That's correct, Justice17   Souter, to the extent that there was nothing applicable18   to this and it came before you, should expert witnesses19   get compensated some -- some amount, Congress hasn't20   spoken on it, I would think, as a matter of default, you21   could say yes.  And -- but --22232425   not eliminate?  For example, if Congress passed a            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you think there is --there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court --just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could45Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review12345678   slippery slope then that you're on?  Because if in fact9   parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kindstatute saying the Supreme Court of the United Statesshall not have authority to punish direct contempt,would that statute be constitutional in your view?            MR. SUTHERS:  No, Justice Souter, it wouldnot be because then it's interfering with your abilityto do what courts do as a central matter.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that a pretty10   of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at11   the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an12   equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that13   starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of14   business that the Court ought to be engaged in.15               MR. SUTHERS:  Justice Souter, it's not16   telling you how to decide cases.  And there is another17   case before the Court in which Congress reinstated18   time-barred cases.  That's the kind of thing that19   intrudes on your judicial function.  Setting witness20   fees doesn't come close to doing that.21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if Congress -- really22   you think Congress could set any -- there's not some23   point at which it is so destructive of the process here?24   What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the25   winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party?46Alderson Reporting Company￼202122232425to deny Kansas's exception to the final report, and thatthe Court should enter the proposed judgment and decree.            Mr. Chief Justice.  If there are no otherquestions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.            General Six, you have four minutes47Official - Subject to Final Review1   Can Congress do that?2               MR. SUTHERS:  It's -- I think the question3   would be, Justice Scalia, is that a fundamental4   interference with the Court's ability to decide cases?5   I would suggest it might be to the -- did they do6   something wholly irrational like that.7               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that would be a matter8   of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take9 it.10111213   Littleworth spent a lot of time on this case.  He has14   been fair, competent, and conscientious in resolving all15   the issues before this Court, including this issue of16   expert witness fees.  It was the plain language of the17   statute and the clear direction of the case law that led18   him to his conclusion that the expert witnesses' fees19   were limited by statute in this case.  We would ask you            MR. SUTHERS:  I believe that's correct.That's correct.Members of the Court, Special MasterAlderson Reporting Company￼1   remaining.234REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX  ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFOfficial - Subject to Final Review                MR. SIX:  1920 didn't appear in 19485   magically.  It came from the 1853 Fee Act.  And the 6   language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs." 7   "A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge 8   or clerk of the court."  I'm sorry.  And 1920 says, "A 9   judge or clerk of any court of the United States."  In10   1853, as the Court has discussed in Alyeska Pipeline,11   the Fee Act applied to the circuit courts.  It says that12   in its title.  And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court13   judge.  In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a14   judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition15   that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing.16               Under Colorado's reading "court of the17   United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of18   the statute, and it would make the statute apply to19   "magistrate judge," for example, which is not included20   in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe21   and presides over a court of the United States, and it22   would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 2823   defines "Justices" as a separate group.  So that's not24   --25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Constitution uses48Alderson Reporting Company￼Official - Subject to Final Review1   the word "judge."  A "judge of the United States" is a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   same.  The only thing they have added is a definition of10   "court of the United States."  And if after 168 years,11   Congress is going to tread on the Court's original12   jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express13   language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the14   Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement15   rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going16   to do this now.  We've never done it in our history, butSupreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.            MR. SIX:  And certainly Congress isn't tiedto the way the word is used in the Constitution, no morethan the paper I got on my way in here told me not torefer to any of you as "judges."            The point, I think, is that the Fee Act wascarried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the17181920212223   on my dates.  The words "in any court of the United" --24   what the words are now is "in any court."  It says25   "court of the United States includes" in 451 courts.49now after 168 years we are."            Not only that, Colorado's position relies onthe fact that they did this in 1948, and it's goneunnoticed by the Court, any major treatise, orcommentary --JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.  I got mixed upAlderson Reporting Company￼10111213   --14When did that language come in?            MR. SIX:  In 1948.Official - Subject to Final Review123456   there till then.
