OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please7 8 9                                              (10:13 a.m.)          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argumentnow in Number 01-1491, Charles DeMore versus Hyung Joonthe Court:          Based upon years of experience, study, hearings,101112131415   control its borders.  Detention of these aliens during16   removal proceedings was considered vital by Congress to17   effectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade18   removal, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal19 aliens.and overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concludedthat the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committingserious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to￼202122232425          This is a facial substantive due processchallenge which cannot succeed unless there are no setsof -- no set of circumstances under which thecongressional policy would be constitutional.          As this Court has repeatedly --          QUESTION:  General Olson, do -- do we have3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   authority to entertain this challenge?  As you know, an 2   amicus has raised a jurisdictional question, and I think 3   did it maybe in the court of appeals stage as well.  It 4   certainly did it early on here. 5             The problem is section 1126(e) which says, no 6   court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney 7   General under this section regarding the detention or 8   release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial 9   of bond or parole.  Now, is that provision, number one,10   inapplicable or, number two, unconstitutional?  And if11   neither of those, why doesn't it mean that we have no12   authority to entertain this case?13             MR. OLSON:  Justice Scalia, it's the14   Government's position, as held by three courts of appeals,15   that that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus16   challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself,17   that the language of that provision relates to challenges18   to an action by the Attorney General or administrative19   action and does not preclude a challenge.20             QUESTION:  No.  It doesn't -- doesn't say the21   challenge -- no.  It says, no court may set aside any22   action by the Attorney General.  And -- and what is asked￼23 24 25for here is that we set aside the Attorney General'saction in detailing -- in detaining this alien.          MR. OLSON:  It's -- it's our submission, after4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   careful examination -- the Government originally took that 2   position that you've suggested in court proceedings.  It 3   was rejected by three courts of appeals.  We studied it 4   further.  The Government studied it further and came to 5   the conclusion that those decisions were correct and it 6   would not preclude -- and we're not contending here7 today -- 8             QUESTION:  And -- and you're relying on what 9   language to --10             MR. OLSON:  Well, we're relying on the language11   that it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the12   statute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the13   Attorney General or immigration -- administrative action14   by administrative officials, and this Court's construction15   of statutes against precluding constitutional challenges16   to other statutes.17             QUESTION:  Oh, but all of those other statutes18   had some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just19   is no wiggle room here.  It doesn't refer to judicial20   review.  It simply says, no court may set aside any action21   by the Attorney General under this section.22             QUESTION:  Even in the Quirin case where the --23   the presidential order said that the people shall have no24   access to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear25   whether that sort of a provision was constitutional or5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 not.2             MR. OLSON:  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,3   and while it would be in the Government's interest to4   preclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of5   the Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the6   decision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to --7   would be to construe that statute as not to preclude this8   action in this case.  Of course, that would lead -- your9   construction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the10   Government in this case, but we've carefully examined it,11   and we think that we're not advocating that position here12 today. 13          QUESTION:  Well, I appreciate your carefullyexamining it, but I'd still like to know what language init leads your careful examination to conclude that it does141516   not cover this case.  I mean, if it's unconstitutional,￼that's another matter.          MR. OLSON:  Well, we -- we may be --17181920   reason.  But my goodness --QUESTION:  Maybe we'll strike it down for that          MR. OLSON:  We -- we may be wrong, JusticeScalia, but we're referring to and relying on the secondsentence which says, no court may set aside any action or21222324   decision by the Attorney General under this section.  It25   does not state -- and -- and we think the Court would6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   construe it as not precluding a challenge to the2   constitutionality of the -- of the policy made by the3   Congress itself in enacting --4             QUESTION:  It doesn't refer to the issue.  It5   doesn't refer to the basis on which the setting aside is6   done.  It doesn't say, may set aside, you know, on grounds7   other than -- it doesn't even refer to the basis.  It89 10says, no court may set aside any action by the --          MR. OLSON:  I understand, Justice Scalia, and     the Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that11   position in early proceedings in this case.  It was12   rejected by three courts of appeals.  We came to adifferent conclusion after reexamining it, and that's ourposition here today.13141516171819   you said a facial challenge.  I've been assuming that it's20   a challenge brought by a resident alien who himself has a21   plausible claim that the statute doesn't apply to him22   because he's saying two -- you know, petty theft with a --23   petty theft with a prior is not -- doesn't fall within the24   category of crimes.  I don't know if that's right or25   wrong, but shouldn't I consider the case of a person who7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005As this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress￼has exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens,immigration, and the Nation's borders.QUESTION:  Can I have a quick answer just to --1234   beginning.  I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint5   appendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section,6   articulates the requested relief by the -- by the7   respondent in this case.  Petitioner seeks a declarationhas a -- an arguable claim that he's outside the system?          MR. OLSON:  Well, Justice Breyer, the -- thecase has not been litigated on that basis from its very     that this provision is unconstitutional on its face as     violative --               QUESTION:  It uses those words, I know.  I just11   don't know how to consider it that way.  I mean, a person12   who had no claim whatsoever -- am I supposed to consider13   it on the basis of a person who has -- well, he would get14   the removal order entered in 24 hours if he had no claim15   whatsoever.16             MR. OLSON:  Well --17             QUESTION:  Is that who I'm supposed to consider?18             MR. OLSON:  Well, it --19             QUESTION:  -- or somebody like the plaintiff20 here? 2122   petition for habeas corpus that the individual was23   challenging on its face, the district court considered it24   on that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that25   basis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 2000589 10￼MR. OLSON:  If this -- not only is it in the 1   the -- by the respondent on that basis.  If there was to 2   be an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of 3   other considerations. 4             And -- and this -- as this Court has said, the 5   facial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set 6   of circumstances under which the congressional policy 7   would be upheld. 8             QUESTION:  General Olson, didn't -- 9             MR. OLSON:  There -- there's been no --10             QUESTION:  -- didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow11   the group somewhat?  I thought that in the district court,12   the district court said the whole thing falls.  I thought13   the Ninth Circuit said only as to lawfully admitted --14   what was it?  Lawful permanent residents.  And so that wasnot taking the whole thing at its face, but only a part of15161718   of the petition for the appendix.  The court of appeals,19   in the paragraph at the bottom of 6a, says we stop short20   of affirming the holding that it's facially21   unconstitutional.￼22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Right.          QUESTION:  We affirm the grant of habeas corpuson the ground the statute is unconstitutional as appliedto him in his status as a lawful permanent resident of the9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the total group.          QUESTION:  I had the same question.  It's at 6a 1 2 3 4   on page 30a.  But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was 5   issue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality 6   of the statute with respect to a broad class of 7   individuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent 8   residents.  That's the equivalent of a facial decision as 9   to unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the10   people covered.  And -- and --United States.          MR. OLSON:  Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- theNinth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and          QUESTION:  So it's your position, in effect,that although the Ninth Circuit said it was an appliedchallenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it11121314   facially.15             MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice --16             QUESTION:  It just narrowed the description of17   what it did.  Is that right?￼18             MR. OLSON:  That's -- that is correct, Justice19   O'Connor.  That's --20             QUESTION:  But it -- but it struck it facially21   only with respect to the permanent resident aliens.22             MR. OLSON:  That's correct.23             QUESTION:  To permanent resident aliens.24             MR. OLSON:  That's correct.25             QUESTION:  Sort of half-facial.10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1             (Laughter.) 2             MR. OLSON:  Mostly facial. 3             QUESTION:  Mostly facial. 4             (Laughter.) 5             MR. OLSON:  That's -- that is what the Ninth 6   Circuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case 7   must be considered under those circumstances as a facial8 challenge. 9             As I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said10   that in connection with immigration and protecting the11   Nation's borders, there is no power at which there is more12   deference to congressional judgment, no authority under13   the Constitution granted more to the political branches,14   particularly to Congress.  Congress regularly makes rules,15   this Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be16   unacceptable if applied to citizens.17             QUESTION:  Is there a regulation or -- or is18   there a policy with -- in the Department of Justice or the19   INS which says that there has to be a conviction before20   you utilize this section?  Or if the Attorney General just￼21 22 23 24 25has information that a felony has been committed, is thatsufficient to detain?          MR. OLSON:  Well, the statute --          QUESTION:  Here there was a conviction.          MR. OLSON:  Here there was a conviction, and11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   that is specifically what is said in the statute itself. 2   It's my understanding -- 3             QUESTION:  Well, the statute itself talks about 4   a conviction. 5             MR. OLSON:  Absolutely.  And -- and what happens 6   in practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal 7   proceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if 8   possible, during the period of incarceration of the 9   individual, or immediately upon release from10   incarceration.11             So we were talking, to summarize, a -- this --12   this provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of13   the removal proceeding itself, which was carefully14   distinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of15   2 years ago.  This is on -- compared to that Zadvydas16   decision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent17   detention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a18   distinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago19   in the Carlson case involving members of the Communist20   Party, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of21   keeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had22   a full panoply of due process, having been convicted23   beyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --24             QUESTION:  Yes, but General, it is true, is it25   not, that there are people in the class who might have12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   been convicted even before the statute was passed.  So2   you're not just -- just continuing detention.  You have to 3 4 5 6   was passed.  I may be misunderstanding that, and if so, 7   I'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal.  But 8   that to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that 9   that might be true and I might be mistaken, that would10   only illustrate why this is a facial challenge.  The11   statute itself should not be declared unconstitutional,12   particularly in connection with individuals convicted13   afterwards.14             QUESTION:  What -- what about this particular15   individual?go out and find them and -- and put them under detention.          MR. OLSON:  It's my understanding, JusticeStevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute￼16171819202122232425          MR. OLSON:  This was after the statute waspassed, Mr. Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  General Olson, you've -- you've putin statistics about the number of -- of aliens who don'tshow up for the hearings and the -- the rather lowpercentage of those who are ultimately deported from theclass that don't show up and so on.          On your view of the Government's authorityover -- over aliens and the deference that the Court owes,would our -- in your judgment should our decision be the13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   same regardless of those statistics?  If you had told us 2   nothing about the -- the probabilities of catching people, 3   should we, on your view, or would we, on your view, be 4   obligated to defer and simply say it's up to the 5   Government? 6             MR. OLSON:  Well, I think Justice Souter, the 7   answer to that is that the test that the Court has 8   consistently applied in this area is there -- is there a 9   rational basis, is the congressional objective rationally10   likely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose.11   Those statistics that we set forth in our brief and which12   were before Congress when Congress enacted this statute,13   provide the purpose for which Congress acted.14             QUESTION:  Well -- well, is that rational basis15   review the one we would employ in reviewing legislation16   passed by Congress concerning immigration policy?  And17   have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means18   of effectuating those policies?  Are -- are there separate19   questions?  I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law20   and to say what it does versus the implementation of it.21             MR. OLSON:  Well, under certain circumstances,22   the Court has used that language.23             QUESTION:  Right.24             MR. OLSON:  The -- the means to achieve the25   objective --14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1             QUESTION:  Yes.2             MR. OLSON:  -- will be looked at possibly3   separately.4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. OLSON:  But it seems to me -- and it seemsobvious particularly in this case -- that the means arewrapped up in the objective itself.          What -- it is clear Congress is dealing with avery difficult problem of a certain category or groups ofaliens that were committing serious crimes in this1011   country.12             QUESTION:  Well, does -- is -- does that -- do13   your statistics define that category as the -- the legal14   permanent resident aliens or all aliens?  I think it's the15   latter.1617181920212223242515Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. OLSON:  Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter,it's all.          QUESTION:  But if it -- if it is the latter,then I don't know that the statistics tell us anything oneway or the other about the legitimacy of the ends, i.e.,the -- the automatic detention, with -- with respect tothe class that we've got under consideration here.          MR. OLSON:  What the statistics tell us is thatthere were large numbers of aliens committing seriouscrimes and that those -- those individuals committing 1   those crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that 2   they were -- that class of individuals or those groups of 3   individuals were cultivating a criminal class that was 4   engaging in organized -- 5             QUESTION:  But, General Olson, those statistics 6   go to the likelihood of entry of the order of deportation, 7   not of the likelihood of flight which this statute is 8   directed at. 9             MR. OLSON:  Well --10             QUESTION:  As I understand the statistics --11   correct me if I'm wrong -- that as to the likelihood of12   showing up at the hearing itself, which this statute13   protects, 80 percent of the people do show up.14             MR. OLSON:  Well, 80 percent --15             QUESTION:  Is that correct?16             MR. OLSON:  Well, the -- the statistics have to17   be looked at very carefully because that 20 percent --18   20 percent of the --19             QUESTION:  Eight out of 10 of these criminals20 show up.21             MR. OLSON:  Well, no.22             QUESTION:  That's very comforting.23             (Laughter.)24             MR. OLSON:  In that -- that -- well, actually25   the -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia,16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   because that figure of 20 percent who absconded were2   people that had been, during this period of time, been3   given individualized hearings.  They were the ones that,4   after a hearing, the authorities thought were probably5   likely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did.  When6 7 8 9you look at --          QUESTION:  But -- but they include all aliensand not just the -- the permanent resident aliens.          MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice Souter, but there's noquestion that there were large numbers of lawful permanent101112   proceeding itself.  Once the deportation --resident aliens that were evading the deportationbut --QUESTION:  Well, I presume there was some,13 14 1517   understand the -- the Government's position on it.  We're18   focusing on the percentage who show up for the hearing.19   Am I -- and that's correct.  That's what this statute is20   directed at.  And am I not correct that 80 percent of the21   aliens in the class did show up for the hearing without22   being detained?23             MR. OLSON:  No.  The figure jumped to 40 percent24   for people who were never detained at all, Justice25   Stevens, and that's explained in the brief.  The17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005               QUESTION:  Yes, but, General Olson, I wish you16   would answer this question.  It's very important to￼1   20 percent to which you're referring are people to which2   an individualized hearing was -- was given.  In 19923   alone, we're talking about 11,000 aliens, criminal aliens,4   who had absconded.  And we're not talking just about5   showing up for the hearing because if that alien isn't in6   custody, he won't -- and -- and the figure jumps to7   90 percent of people that will escape the deportation8   order itself if there -- 9             QUESTION:  But the statute doesn't -- the10   statute is not directed at the consequences after the11   deportation order has been entered.  Am I not right on12   that?1314151617181920212223   the process works, Justice Stevens.  There is a potential24   appeal that the individual can take --25             QUESTION:  No, but this statute is not directed18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MR. OLSON:  I -- I respectfully disagree in thissense, that if you have the alien in custody during the --the removal period itself, he will be in custody at thetime the order is issued.￼QUESTION:  Oh, I'm sure.          MR. OLSON:  If he's not, it's very difficult forthe Government --          QUESTION:  But if he's at the hearing, at theconclusion of the hearing, you say, lock this guy up.MR. OLSON:  Well, that -- that is not the way1   at the time during potential appeal.  It's directed at2   the -- as I understand it -- now, you correct me if I'm3   wrong.4              QUESTION:  As I understand the statute, it's    directed at the time before the hearing starts.              MR. OLSON:  Yes, it is, and the Government --    and the Congress --5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  So why can't the immigration judge atthe end of the hearing say, A, you're going to be removed,and B, you -- you go in the clink until your -- you goMR. OLSON:  No.101112   away?13             MR. OLSON:  Well, but this -- let me answer it14   this way.  That 20 to 40 percent -- and the statistics are15   difficult in this area.  There are such large numbers of16   individuals.  We're talking about 15,000 criminals17   convicted of serious crimes per year that are -- go18   through this process.  If -- if we're losing 20 -- even￼20 percent of those individuals that are absconding fromthe process and not available for deportation or removal,that is the -- that is what Congress regarded as a veryserious problem.19202122232425   necessarily lose them.  All you're being asked to do is toQUESTION:  I grant that --QUESTION:  But, General Olson, you don't19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4   Stevens -- and it's explained in the brief.  That 5   20 percent were the individuals for which there had been 6   an individualized hearing given during that period of time 7   when that process was taking place.  If you don't have an 8   individualized hearing, of course, the numbers go up 9   higher.10             QUESTION:  But why can't you deal with that11   problem with a standard that's tough, that's different12   from having the hearing?  After all, we give bail pending13   appeal to criminals who have been convicted.  We give bail14   to alien terrorists who are about to be deported.  Why15   couldn't you have a tough standard but, nonetheless --16   like bail pending appeal, but, nonetheless, give the bail17   hearing to the person who's willing to come in and he'd18   have to show, you know, he's not going to run away, he's19   not a danger, and he has a good issue on the merits?20             MR. OLSON:  One of the -- one of the problems21   that Congress had is that it had experimented with that22   process.  It was not being successful.  The individuals23   were absconding notwithstanding --have an individualized hearing as to each member of that20 percent.MR. OLSON:  But that 20 percent, Justice￼2425   standard.QUESTION:  I don't think there was a tough20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1             MR. OLSON:  Well, it -- it appeared -- it 2   appeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration 3   authorities to be a reasonably tough standard. 4             The problem with criminal aliens is that once -- 5   once they enter this process, once they've been convicted 6   after due process of having committed a serious crime and 7   once they're in that process, which is virtually certain 8   to lead to removal -- I mean, this is -- removal is 9   automatic --10             QUESTION:  What I -- what I'm worried -- I see11   that, and what I'm worried about on the other side of12   it -- I'm -- I can see also how you could limit it like to13   bail pending appeal, a tough standard.  The other side of14   it is the alien who's there and who's the wrong person or15   the -- or the statute doesn't apply to him or there's a16   crime that they say he committed which he didn't.  I mean,17   there could --￼QUESTION:  Isn't he able to challenge those1819 points?20             MR. OLSON:  Pardon me?21             QUESTION:  I thought those points can be22   challenged.  I thought he can get a hearing as to those23   points.242521Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. OLSON:  That's -- that's correct, Justice --QUESTION:  We're only talking about people as to1   whom it's acknowledged that they committed the crime, it's2   acknowledged that they're deportable.  And the only reason3 4 5 6 7 8 9they may not get deported is the Attorney General mightexercise discretion to let them into the country.          MR. OLSON:  That's -- that's precisely correct.          QUESTION:  That is correct.  So if, in fact, Ihave a good claim, I'm let out on bail while they'reconsidering it?          MR. OLSON:  If -- no.  If you have a -- if you          QUESTION:  You can take it to court.10   as --111213          MR. OLSON:  -- and I think it's on page -- pages26 and 27 of the Government's brief sets forth the -- theregulations of the -- of the Immigration andNaturalization Service that provide that you may have animmediate hearing if it is not you, if you are a citizen,if you contend that you didn't -- weren't convicted of acrime --14151617181920212223   prompt individualized hearing.  I'm not positive of the24   answer to that question, but there is the hearing that the25   Ninth Circuit talked about --22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

OLSON:  It's my understanding that whathappens is that there's an immediate, or a relativelyQUESTION:  Yes.1234567   regulations.8             QUESTION:  Given that, General Olson, that we're9   only talking about people who have acknowledged -- you          MR. OLSON:  -- an individualized hearing,which -- which would have applied all the way across theboard --QUESTION:  Well, given --MR. OLSON:  -- in those cases under those10   know, who have no claim that they didn't commit the crime,11   who have no claim that they are not deportable, why do we12   have to rely upon whether 80 percent of them will flee or13   90 percent, or even -- you know, or none of them will14   flee?  Why is it -- does the Government concede that it's15   unreasonable to say, look, somebody who has no right to be16   at large in this country -- he's here illegally, has no17   right to be at large.  And besides that, on top of that,18   he's already committed a crime in this country.  He should19   leave the country, and we're going to hold him in custody20   until he leaves.  If he wants to fight that -- that21   departure, that's fine, but he will be in custody until he22   departs.  What is -- what is wrong with that?￼23 24 25          MR. OLSON:  Well, we're -- I'm not quarrellingwith your characterization of what --          QUESTION:  No, but you're -- you're fighting it23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   on the -- on the ground that somehow we have to prove --MR. OLSON:  No.  No, Justice --QUESTION:  -- that a large number of them will234 flee. 56 7   them would flee, if they have no right to be here, if 8   they've committed a crime, why cannot -- they cannot be 9   held in -- in custody until they leave?10             MR. OLSON:  This -- we may well be here on11   another occasion defending a broader policy.  But let me12   emphasize the facts that distinguish what you're13   suggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas14   case, an immense difference that exists between the15   circumstances here, and the circumstances under those16   circumstances.MR. OLSON:  No.  I'm simply --QUESTION:  It seems to me that even if none of￼          QUESTION:  Before you get to -- to Zadvydas andthe distinction, you -- you make, I take it, nodistinction between lawful permanent residents and people17181920   who are excludable.  People who are lawful permanent21   residents have many rights in common with citizens.22   Indeed, this Court once said that they were a suspect23   classification.  But as far as this case is concerned, it24   seems to me you're making no distinction at all.25 MR. OLSON: The statute makes no distinction. 24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   The Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to2   excludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens,3   the statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning,4   the statute was constitutional.5             What we -- the statute doesn't make that6   distinction, but what it does do is it provides for a7   brief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not8   potentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress'9   authorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable10   doubt with --11             QUESTION:  But it might be of a crime that12   they -- one of the claims here is that this is not a13   qualifying plot -- crime.  I don't get into that box.  Now14   that may be wrong or right, but suppose -- on your15   reading, or under this statute, someone would not be able16   to get bail despite a good claim that they are counting a17   crime that doesn't qualify as one of these serious18   offenses.19202122   Government's brief.  The -- the regulations provide for23   someone claiming who is claiming that they are a citizen24   as opposed to an alien, or claiming that the crime for25   which they've been convicted was not a covered crime,25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. OLSON:  That's the question that I believe Iaddressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations --and I hope I'm correct -- at pages 26 and 27 of the1   may -- may have an accelerated hearing, which is -- which2   is --              QUESTION:  In other words, for the class that    we're talking about, it's rather artificial to talk about    lawful resident aliens because they can get a hearing on3456   whether their continuing residence is lawful.  They --7   they are determined to be deportable.  They are no longer8 910111213141516171819202122232425lawful resident aliens.          MR. OLSON:  That -- that is correct.          QUESTION:  Well, General Olson, aren't theylawful resident aliens until an order is entered that theybe deported?          MR. OLSON:  What they are is what -- they are --they are lawful resident aliens until there's an order ofdeportation, but --          QUESTION:  All right.  So at the -- at the pointof the -- we'll call it the preliminary hearing, theJoseph hearing, when they can bring these challenges,there is no order that they be deported, and they,therefore, have got to be considered, as I understand it,as lawful resident aliens.          MR. OLSON:  They -- however, they have -- theyhave been convicted after due process of a crime thatCongress considers serious, and they're being held for alimited period of time --26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

OLSON:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.          QUESTION:  Well --          MR.

I mean, it'sMs. Rabinovitz, we'll hear from you.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDY RABINOVITZ      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. RABINOVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The question in this case is whether Congressauthorized and, if so, whether the Due Process Clausepermits a statute that requires that lawful permanentresidents like our client be imprisoned throughout theduration of removal proceedings.￼23 24 25possible that despite the Government's failure to raiseit, that we could do so.          And why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a7 8 9(Laughter.)keep hands off?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree with1234   not --5             QUESTION:  I have to tell you I don't understand6   it.  I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there.the Solicitor General's explanation for why this Court did          MS. RABINOVITZ:  This -- this statute containsno express language that repeals habeas jurisdiction.That's one answer that I could give you, Your Honor, andbased on this Court's decision in St. Cyr and Calcano,absent that -- that language, the habeas -- there's stilljurisdiction in --101112131415   habeas jurisdiction?  No court may set aside any action by16   the Attorney General under this section.  How can -- how17   can that -- I mean, what can you do in habeas corpusQUESTION:  How could that language not repeal￼18   unless you're setting aside action by the Attorney General19   under this section?  How can that possibly not set aside202122232425habeas corpus?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  But this Court has said --          QUESTION:  I mean, now, maybe you want to argueit's unconstitutional, but gee, to say that it doesn't dothis is -- I mean, it's -- it's incredible.          QUESTION:  Well, the Court in St. Cyr, with28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9which both Justice Scalia and I disagreed, said somethingvery much like that, didn't it, that you had to be veryspecific if you were going to repeal habeas jurisdiction?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Try Johnson v. Robson too.          MS. RABINOVITZ:  The point is that this statuterequires the Government to detain individuals like ourclient who are lawful permanent residents not becausetheir detention is necessary to protect the public fromdanger of flight risk, but merely because they wereconvicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimesthat the Government believes may render them deportable.1011121314   believes it.  The Congress believed it, did it not?15             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Well, Your Honor, the question16   that remains to be determined in all these cases isQUESTION:  Can -- you say the Government￼17   whether an individual is, in fact, deportable.  Congress18   did decide that certain kinds of crimes should render an19   individual deportable and these individuals have been20   convicted of crimes.  But the fact --21             QUESTION:  What more do we need?22             MS. RABINOVITZ:  The fact that they've been23   convicted of a crime, Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't mean that24   it's a crime that renders them deportable under the25   statute.  And I think that this addresses, in part,29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Justice Kennedy's question about have they been -- is thisjust that they're suspected of committing crimes or havethey been convicted of crimes.          QUESTION:  Well, but in -- in this case, your --your client was convicted, was he not?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --          QUESTION:  So --          MS. RABINOVITZ:  He was convicted, but there202122232425case, that question is especially relevant because in ourclient's case, the conviction that he was --          QUESTION:  Well, did -- did you -- but the NinthCircuit didn't go off on that basis, did it?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor.  The NinthCircuit --30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005still is a question about whether his conviction actuallyrenders him deportable.10111213141516171819   whether a conviction is an aggravated felony.  And in this          QUESTION:  And what question is that?  DoesCongress in the statute set forth the crimes?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor.  Congress setsforth a -- a broad category of crimes that can rendersomebody deportable, and one of those is -- is a broadcategory that are labeled aggravated felonies.￼          The question, though -- and this is a questionthat has been very hotly litigated in the courts -- is 1             QUESTION:  So are you going to -- are you going 2   to defend the Ninth Circuit's basis here? 3             MS. RABINOVITZ:  We're defending the Ninth 4   Circuit's ruling, Your Honor. 5             I'm -- I'm just explaining that this issue about 6   whether somebody is deportable is an open issue, and 7   that's precisely what the -- that's precisely what a 8   deportation proceeding is to determine. 9             QUESTION:  Now, Ms. Rabinovitz, I had -- I had10   understood from General Olson -- and please, you know, if11   it's wrong, I -- I want to know it -- that -- that your12   client could get a hearing on that particular issue,13   whether the crime he's being -- he has been convicted of14   is one of the crimes that entails deportation.  Is -- isnot true that he can -- that he gets a hearing on that?15161718192021   convicted of a crime that renders him deportable.  All￼MS. RABINOVITZ:  He gets a hearing --QUESTION:  Individualized hearing.MS. RABINOVITZ:  He gets a hearing, Your Honor,but it's a very limited hearing to the extent that thathearing does not determine that he has, in fact, beenthat it --          QUESTION:  In other words, it's a hearing that22232425   of X.  It's not a hearing that says that X renders yousays you were convicted of X or you weren't convicted31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   deportable.  Is that the point? 2             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, although, Your Honor, it 3   does say that the Government is not substantially unlikely 4   to prevail on its charge, so -- that you are deportable. 5   So -- and essentially it -- 6             QUESTION:  So it -- 7             MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- it says that there is 8   reason -- there's a possibility.  It's not impossible that 9   you will be found deportable.  You -- that it's not --10   since the Government is not substantially unlikely to11   prevail on the charge.12             I think it's important to recognize that there13   are many individuals who are subjected to mandatory14   detention under this statute who cannot satisfy that15   standard.  In fact, that that -- they've had that hearing16   and the court has held the Government substantially -- you17   know, we can't show that the Government is substantially18   unlikely to prevail.19             QUESTION:  I mean, I have a reason.  I mean, now20   I am -- I'm confused on this and I'd appreciate it.  I --21   I assume there is someone in prison.  He's detained like22   your client.  There's a class of people.  There are two23   subgroups.  Group 1 is a group that has no non-frivolous24   argument that they shouldn't be deported.  It's virtually25   conceded they're -- they should be deported.  Their only32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   arguments against it are frivolous.  Group 2 are people2   who have a real non-frivolous argument -- a real non-3   frivolous argument -- that they aren't -- it's the wrong4   person, this crime doesn't fall within the statutory5   definition, I probably will get asylum, something like6   that.  They have a real non-frivolous argument.7             Now, I thought that what we were talking about,8   at least in part, was that people in this group 2 were9   being held without bail.  Now, am I right?  Because Ithink what I heard the Solicitor General say is I'm wrong.We're only talking about people in group 1.1011121314   Scalia was concerned about.  That's just what I'm15   concerned about, and I'd appreciate some elaboration on16   it.17             MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor.  You're18   absolutely right.  We are talking about the second19   category of cases.20             QUESTION:  But aren't there one-and-a-half or --21   there's this Joseph hearing.  It's not just that either22   you have a hearing or you don't have a hearing.  You have23   the hearing that Justice Souter was referring to where24   your burden is enormous because you will not succeed at25   that hearing if you show it's more likely than not that33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MS. RABINOVITZ:  No --QUESTION:  That was just, I think, what Justice￼ 1   this crime is -- doesn't qualify as serious.  You have to 2   show overwhelmingly that the Government will win on that 3   issue in it.  So -- but there is something other than -- 4   There's this Joseph hearing, which you say is not 5   adequate, is it? 6             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 7   It's exactly -- 8             QUESTION:  You're -- you're not asking just for 9   individualized hearings on those items, are you?10   You're -- you're not just asking for individualized11   hearings on whether you are the person that did the --12   that -- that was convicted and whether the -- the crime of13   conviction causes you to be deportable.  You want ahearing on whether, if you are let go, you will show upfor -- for a later hearing.141516171819202122   leave.23             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Let me try -- let me try to24   explain how the statute works and why we believe that it's25   a problem.  The -- the proceeding that you're asking for,34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼And I don't see why -- why that is necessary --MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes --QUESTION:  -- so long -- so long as you get ahearing on those other substantive points, it seems to methe Government ought to be able to hold you, an alien whohas no right to be at large in this country, until you 1   a determination about whether, in fact, an individual is 2   deportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is 3   for, and that kind of decision is not made the first time 4   you come before an immigration judge.  It's often a very 5   protracted process, and we have individuals who have -- 6   who have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration 7   judge hearing to determine that exact question, Justice 8   Scalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which 9   is why we say that the relevant question is whether10   pending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in11   detaining that individual.  And we're not --12131415   of holding them.  So that certainly is a regulatory16   purpose.          QUESTION:  Well, and the -- the Governmentanswers that there's a substantial number of people whodon't show up for these hearings, and that's the purpose￼17             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is18   a regulatory purpose.  But this Court looks to the19   regulatory purpose in an individual's case when you're20   talking about depriving somebody of a significant liberty21   interest, which is what's here.  We don't allow people to22   be locked up based on averages.23             QUESTION:  Well, but you -- look -- look at the24   immigration cases.  Look at Carlson against Landon.25   I mean, that certainly was a class, not an individual.35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051             MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief2   Justice.  I respectfully -- I read Carlson differently.3   In Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney4   General's discretionary decision that five individuals5   could be detained because there was -- that -- the6   decision to detain them was with not -- was not without7   reasonable foundation.  It was a discretionary decision.89 10It's wholly different from this case.          What makes this statute so unique and so     unprecedented is that the Government is prohibited.11   There's no discretion here.  The Attorney General isprohibited from releasing individuals like our client, alawful permanent resident who has a legal right to behere, even when --1213141516171819   not clear that this conviction makes him deportable.  In          QUESTION:  Well, who has the legal right to behere, although he's been convicted of a crime which makeshim deportable.￼fact --MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's2021222324   deportable.  That's precisely what a deportation25   proceeding is for.QUESTION:  Well, it's clear he's been convicted.          MS. RABINOVITZ:  He's been convicted of a crime,but it's not clear that this conviction renders him36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

RABINOVITZ:  Both --          QUESTION:  -- is not an aggravated felony?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Not necessarily, Your Honor.That remains to be determined, but --          QUESTION:  Well, how could a first degreeburglary not be an aggravated felony?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  That's a good question,Mr. Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  Well, it's a very good question.          (Laughter.)          MS. RABINOVITZ:  But -- but -- yes.  But let me101112131415   by Citizens and -- and Immigrants for Equal Justice.  It's16   one of these green briefs.  And it's on page 12 of their17   brief.  They referred to a case, the Solorzano-Patlanpoint out -- I refer you to the -- the amicus brief for --￼18   case, where an individual was convicted of entering an19   automobile with intent to commit theft, and the Board of20   Immigration of Appeals said -- or the -- the -- excuse me.21   The immigration judge said exactly what -- what you have22   said, which is that how could this crime not be an23   aggravated felony?  It's a burglary, entering an24   automobile with intent to commit theft.25             One-and-a-half years after our client -- after37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

RABINOVITZ:  No.  QUESTION:  Are we talking about this person as38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

RABINOVITZ:  That's a good point, YourHonor, but the Government did not petition for cert inthat case.￼          QUESTION:  Well, it sounds like you're -- you'restill seeking some kind of facial invalidation of thestatute rather than as applied to your client.          MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor, we're notseeking --          QUESTION:  Because you're relying on aconviction of someone else for a different kind of a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9     an as-applied challenge, or do we have a facial challenge?               MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, this is definitely     an as-applied challenge, and I refer you to page --               QUESTION:  So we are talking about the first     degree burglary --               MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, we are.               QUESTION:  -- not entering a car with intent to     commit theft.               MS.

First degree19 felony --20             QUESTION:  Well, but --21             MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- because you need to look at22   the precise --23             QUESTION:  Justice Breyer's classification of24   people who have really serious claims and people who have25   frivolous claims -- surely a claim that first degree39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          My point with raising that example was just topoint out that the question of what constitutes anaggravated felony is very contested.10111213141516   burglary.17￼               MS.

To decide whether5   this is -- is an aggravated felony, the Court is going to6   need to look at the specific language of the statute.burglary is not deportable under the statute would vergeon the frivolous.MS. RABINOVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, I need to -- 7   The -- the specific crime that our client committed was he 8   broke and entered into a tool shed and he was convicted 9   under California State law.  This is a very complicated,10   technical area of the law.11             And all that I can tell you is that if you refer12   to our brief at page 5, note 6 -- oh, no.  Excuse me.13   That's not the place.  To our brief at -- our brief atpage 30, note 27, we note numerous examples where thequestion of whether something is an aggravated felony hasbeen contested and decided --14151617181920212223   still -- haven't heard you really answer.  Look, on24   appeal, somebody who has been convicted of a crime, in25   order to get out on -- on appeal -- have bail on appeal,40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  Do you -- you consider whether hebroke into an inhabited tool shed, I guess, to be notwithin the statute, and the other side thinks it is.MS. RABINOVITZ:  Right.  Right.  Right.          QUESTION:  In your opinion, would -- would --and this goes back to my initial question which I'm 1   he has to show not only he wouldn't run away, not only he 2   isn't a danger, but also that he raises a substantial3 question. 4             Now, suppose that we were to say at least those 5   people who show that they raise a substantial question -- 6   a substantial question -- and it says not for purposes of 7   delay -- that as to those people, you have to have an 8   individualized hearing. 9             MS. RABINOVITZ:  In this case, if we're talking10   about somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like11   our client, that would satisfy this case because this12 is --          QUESTION:  Well, I'm not saying if it'd satisfythe case, though I take it from what you say it wouldsatisfy you and your position.131415161718   challenge.  It's a -- it's a challenge about whether this19   statute as applied to our client who's a lawful permanent20   resident, who has bona fide challenges that he is not￼          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, I misspoke.  What Imeant is that in this case, this is an as-applied21   deportable and is eligible for relief from deportation,22   that in this case, applying the statute to him is23   unconstitutional.24             QUESTION:  So to keep someone in prison without25   bail, after they've been convicted of something, pending a41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1   deportation order is not constitutional without an 2   individualized hearing at least if -- or don't say at 3   least -- if, among other things, he shows there is a 4   substantial question not for purposes of delay.  Imagine 5   an opinion that said that.  Would you argue for or against 6   that opinion? 7             MS. RABINOVITZ:  I would argue for that opinion 8   in this case because it would resolve this case.  I 9   believe that there also might be -- there would be a10   constitutional issue that even somebody else -- due11   process requires that they have an opportunity to show12   that they're not a danger and a flight risk because that13   is the purpose of regulatory detention.  And as the --14             QUESTION:  I -- I note that you have redefined15   substantial question as non-frivolous.  Anything that's￼16171819202122232425not sanctionable raises a substantial question forpurposes of -- of this new rule?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor --          QUESTION:  Wow.          MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- and -- and it has to be thatway because there are so many examples of circuit courtsfinding that the board's decision about what constitutes adeportable offense is wrong and yet, that those were caseswhere the individual could -- where their -- their claimmight have been considered bordering on the frivolous,42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   enacted, it seems to me that they are on notice.  If you 8   get convicted of a felony, your -- your welcome in this 9   country is at an end if it's an aggravated felony, and you10   will be held until it is -- it is finally determined11   whether that is, indeed, an aggravated felony or not.12   I don't know that that's terribly unfair.13             MS. RABINOVITZ:  But your question presupposes14   the answer.  You're saying --15             QUESTION:  No, it doesn't.  It -- it's just one16   of the risks you take when you commit a felony.  Your --17   it's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your18   admittance to this country.  Once this statute is passed,even though it wasn't.          And let give you a very --QUESTION:  That -- that is true but all --MS. RABINOVITZ:  Let me give you an example.QUESTION:  -- all of -- at least for people whohave committed their crimes after this statute was￼19202122232425any lawful resident alien knows that if he commits afelony and it's an aggravated felony, he will be deported.          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Two points.          QUESTION:  And -- and until the question ofwhether it is an aggravated felony, assuming it's at leastarguable, is decided, he will be held in custody and notpermitted to be at large in this country.43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051             Now, that doesn't strike me as terribly2   unreasonable.  Just don't do the felony.          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Well, two points, Your Honor.First, in this case, the conviction that is now beingconsidered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed3456   before the statute took effect.  So even under Your7   Honor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him.8             In terms of what you're suggesting, though, if9   Congress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an10   issue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to11   condition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that12   individuals who are facing deportation, particularly13   lawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair14   hearing.  To say that those individuals must give up their15   right to physical liberty --16             QUESTION:  Well, but there's no question that17   these people are going to get a fair hearing eventually.18   The question you're challenging is whether they should19   be -- be incarcerated pending that hearing.  So we're not20   talking about a fair hearing.21             MS. RABINOVITZ:  You're right, Your Honor,22   Mr. Chief Justice.  But the -- the point is that if23   somebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they24   can't get the evidence for their case, because being25   locked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   present their cases, there's no right to appointed2   counsel.  It means they can't work.3 4 5 6 7 8 9          There are -- and this is, again, where I wouldlike to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief bythe Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which pointsout other cases where individuals gave up their claimsbecause otherwise they were going to be in detention forso long.          And let me just point out one other --               QUESTION:  Well, you -- you've got someone who11   is an alien here.  The alien has committed a felony.12   I mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they13   should have all these additional benefits so that somehow14   they can avoid deportation.15             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Well -- well, first of all,16   Mr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who17   are convicted of felonies.  Even the definition --10￼          QUESTION:  Well, but that's with the case we'redealing of here.181920212223   You're right.  In this case, the initial conviction --24             QUESTION:  What -- what do you -- what do you25   mean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony?45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Okay, but the -- the questionis what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony.Misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well.12345678   degree burglary is not a misdemeanor.  So, in our case,9   that's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  I know it's somewhat shocking,Mr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravatedfelony has been defined so broadly --QUESTION:  Well --          MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- the courts have held thateven misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies.QUESTION:  But there's no question that first10             MS. RABINOVITZ:  But let me return to the point11   about whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by12   requiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout13   the process of their deportation proceeding, a process14   which, as I said, can be months, often years, without any15   individualized determination of danger and flight risk.16             And the example that I wanted to give ties back17   with this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that18   212(c) relief was available to individuals whose19   convictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the20   statute having taken effect.  All of those individuals21   were subject to mandatory detention under the statute.22   Their claim would have been considered close to frivolous23   until the Supreme Court ruled differently.24             QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's -- I mean,25   your argument to me rings true for people who have real46Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   claims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who 2   has an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed 3   for purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a 4   very good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't 5   have any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and 6   if he wants to be deported quickly, he can be. 7             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, that's -- 8             QUESTION:  But if he has a substantial claim, 9   it's different.10             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, I think it's11   important to recognize that that's precisely the kind of12   factors that the Immigration Service and the immigration13   judge looks at when they make a determination whether14   somebody should be released on bond.  They -- when they're15   determining flight risk, that's precisely what they look16   at.  They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a17   frivolous claim.  We're not going to release this person18   on bond because they're not going to show up.  And we're19   not saying that individuals in that situation should be20   released from detention.21             All that we're saying is that an individual22   needs to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look,23   I was convicted of this crime, but I have claims for24   relief.  I'm not a flight risk.  I'm not a danger.25             QUESTION:  Would you say that --47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. RABINOVITZ:  And I think it's important tolook at --          QUESTION:  Would you agree that the alien hasthe burden of showing that?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, we have no --          QUESTION:  In your -- in your regime, youwould -- would there be any problem putting the burden onthe alien to show that?          MS. RABINOVITZ:  We have no problem withCongress creating a presumption that individuals who arecharged with these kinds of -- with being deportable forthese kinds of crimes are a danger and are a flight risk,and that they need to come forward to show that they're1011121314   not.  And in fact --15             QUESTION:  Well, but I -- I'll get to that in a16   minute.  But insofar as the substantiality or -- or the17   likelihood of prevailing -- forget about flight risk for a18   moment.  Insofar as the likelihood of prevailing and the19   substantiality of the -- of the issue, that's almost what20   the statute already provides for in a bail determination21   hearing, as set forth on page 26 of the Government's￼22   brief.  A person in INS custody is -- is entitled to a23   bond determination hearing.  And the standard is whether24   or not the Government is -- he has to show the Government25   is substantially unlikely to prevail.  That's very --48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051   forget flight risk for a moment.  That is very close to2   the regime that you propose.  So I don't see what we're3456   quite different.  And I would -- and I would doubt the7   latter, but --arguing about here as to that.          Now, if you want to say that you're entitled torelease if you're not a flight risk, that's something8             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Let me try to clarify what I 9   believe is some confusion about what that hearing does.10   The hearing essentially just shows you need to show that11   the Government has no frivolous claim.  That's essentially12   what you need to show.  I mean, you have to show that the13   Government had -- that the Government's charge is14   frivolous.  And I would assume that the Government is not15   putting people into proceedings if they have no possible16   argument.  But to require that an individual be locked up17   throughout the whole deportation process just because they18   cannot show that the Government has a -- has a frivolous19   claim, that doesn't satisfy due process.20             In terms of burden, Your Honor, what I was21   referring to -- what I thought you were referring to is22   whether an individual is going to have an obligation to23   show that they're not a danger of flight risk.  But24   even --2549Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION:  Well, perhaps that's why I asked you 1   that question first.  It -- it does seem to me that if you 2   concede that he has the burden, that that is really very, 3   very close to what the -- the statute already provides, 4   forgetting about flight risk for the moment, or -- or -- 5             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  I don't -- 6   I don't see it that way.  I see that the question about if 7   you need -- if an individual has to prove that the 8   Government's argument is frivolous, that's not the same 9   thing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim.  And10   that's all that we're saying.  I think that they're11   completely different.  One is showing that the12   Government's argument is frivolous.13             I don't -- most of the cases where individuals14   were found not deportable, it wasn't that the Government's15   claim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in16   their proceedings.  And that's the issue here, whether --17   whether an individual can be detained for a substantial18   period of time without any opportunity to show that --19   that there's no purpose that's served by their detention.20             And I think that -- that this case is a perfect21   example because in this case, once the district court --22   our client was detained for 6 months without any23   individualized determination.  The district court then24   said due process requires an individualized determination,25   and the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   he poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar 2   bond.  And he's been out for the past 3-and-a-half years. 3   He's now getting his college degree.  He's working. 4             If the Government prevails in this appeal, it 5   will have no choice but to re-incarcerate him throughout 6   his proceedings.  It's not a question of discretion like 7   Carlson, where they can make that determination. 8             And going back to your question about burden, I 9   think it's important to recognize that the regime that was10   in place prior to this statute, and that is now in place11   in those circuits where they've said that the statute12   needs to be interpreted to -- or that the statute -- due13   process requires an individualized determination, still14   requires that an individual show that they are not a15   danger of flight risk.  They bear that burden.  And so16   under this system, no individual who's a danger of flight17   risk is going to be released except for those cases where18   there's, you know, obviously going to be error.  But in19   general, individuals who are a danger of flight risk20   aren't going to be released.21             I think it -- there's one last point that I22   would like to make because I realize my time is short,23   which is that this case poses a serious constitutional24   problem, and we believe that there is a way that this25   Court can avoid that problem by construing the statute to51Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4   mandatorily detained.  An individual who is deportable on 5   one of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention. 6   As we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of 7   whether he is deportable remains very much to be decided. 8   He doesn't have any order of deportation. 9             QUESTION:  Ms. Rabinovitz, why wasn't Judge10   Fletcher absolutely right in rejecting that claim?11   Because the language is when the alien is released from12   criminal custody.13             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Because --14             QUESTION:  The statute directs custody when the15   alien is released from criminal custody, and not at some16   later time, not at the time of the issuance of a removal17 order.18             MS. RABINOVITZ:  Because I think that what Judge19   Fletcher was not aware of is that the whole regime right20   now that the Immigration Service has is to conduct21   deportation proceedings while individuals are still22   serving their criminal sentence, which makes complete23   sense, because then you do not have this problem.  People24   are already ordered deported, determined deportable while25   they are still in jail.  And so the --52Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

RABINOVITZ:  There's two different issues,6   Justice Ginsburg.  One is when -- is deportable.  It says,7   when released.  Our point is only that there are          QUESTION:  But still, if the statute says whenreleased from criminal custody, even before release, butit doesn't say at the later time of the final removal 8   individuals who have deportation proceedings while they're 9   in prison, and there will be an immigration judge decision10   or a BIA decision that says they are deportable.11             Now, they may still be seeking review of that12   decision in the Federal courts, in which case, that13   decision is not final and they would not fit under the14   next statute, the statute that you -- that this Court15   construed in -- in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they16   would -- or excuse me -- 1231.  But they would still have￼171819202122232425an order of deportation, and then, that would be a way tosay that individual is deportable.          Whereas, here you have a situation where anybodywho the Government charges with being deportable -- inthis case, our client, even though he may not actually bedeportable -- is subject to mandatory detention forpossibly a year, 2 years, however long.          I see my time is up.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Rabinovitz.53Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

Assuming I disagree with you as to the reading of the 9   statute as to whether there is jurisdiction in this case,10   if there is no jurisdiction, is that provision of the11   statute in the view of the Government unconstitutional?12             MR. OLSON:  No.  Now, we haven't briefed and13   studied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that14   I gave before.  But I think that that would be a correct1516171819202122232425with -- it would be within the power of Congress to dothat under certain circumstances.          QUESTION:  Well, you can rely on the presumptionof constitutionality if you haven't briefed it.          (Laughter.)          MR. OLSON:  Well, then I would've have to answerthe question differently.          Well, if -- I guess no, I guess I would --that -- that's a good answer.          Let me -- let me --          (Laughter.)54Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          QUESTION:  General Olson, I don't want tointrude upon your rebuttal time, but I have one questionthat's very important for me and you can answer it yes or￼12345   statute.  On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is6   asserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors7   and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997.  That was89 10when that conviction took place.          Secondly -- and I think a lot of time has been          MR. OLSON:  Let me just deal with a few thingsthat were raised during my colleague's argument.          First of all, the date of the offense that'sinvolved in this case was after the enactment of this     expended with respect to the question that focused in11   large part by Justice Breyer.  What happens if it's not12   the individual?  What happens if he's really a citizen?13   What happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime14   was one that should be covered?15             As we said on page 26 -- and we cite the16   relevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types17   of things can be challenged in an individualized bond18   hearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit19   was talking about and which is what our opponents are20   talking about here, and that those issues may be raised at21   that point, which is precisely what the respondents are22   talking about.  So that's already built into the statute.23             Now, one might quarrel with whether -- what the24   burden of proof is, and where it should be and how it25   should be written, but that's a -- this is a determination55Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   by the executive branch with respect to the statute.  If 2   the alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely 3   to prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then 4   the individual may be released on bond.  If the decision 5   goes against the individual, that can be taken to the 6   Board of Immigration Appeals.  So there's a process that 7   takes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you8 put it. 9             Now, that does not deal with the question of10   dangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress11   was concerned about when it -- when it enacted the12   statute.  Congress was concerned about a situation in13   which large numbers of individuals who commit serious14   crimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what15   it thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes.16             Now, if there is some question about that in an17   individual case, or if there's some question about an18   aberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to19   this Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge.20   The respondent is saying here today that this is an21   as-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this22   case has been litigated from the petition, which I cited23   as a facial challenge, through the district court's24   decision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial25   challenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit.56Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1   This has been a challenge to the congressional2   determination that people who commit serious crimes are3   to -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible.4             They -- and -- and to the -- in order for that5   policy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected,6   to avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in7   the United States that's operating freely, for a limited8   period of time, that individual will be detained during9   that process until the final order of deportation is10   entered.11          85 percent of the aliens that are brought intothese procedures don't even challenge the immigrationdecision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half121314   of those cases are resolved within 30 days.  The1516171819202122232425statistics are in the brief.          QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.          MR. OLSON:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼57Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
