Janet Chandler.Ms. Lach.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACHON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. LACH: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:The question today -- presented today turns onwhether Congress intended to include local governments within the meaning of the False Claims Act's undefined term, person, which this Court determined in Stevens has remained unchanged since the original enactment in 1863. The indications are that Congress did not subject local governments to liability under the 1863 act,As this Court observed in Stevens and in Hubbard versus United States, the 1863 act was enacted as a criminal statute. It imposed criminal fines or imprisonment in addition to civil damages and forfeitures. As this Court noted in Marcus v. Hess, any language that the civil portion shares in common with the criminal portion must be given careful scrutiny lest those not intended are brought within the act's reach.3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

This Court, in City of Newport, noted that municipal corporations were not considered capable of doing a criminal act or a malicious or willful wrong -- excuse me.The -- the criminal nature of the statute in itself is a strong indication that Congress did not include local governments within the purview of the statute.QUESTION: Ms. Lach, on that point, am I correct in thinking that the Sherman Act does apply to municipalities?MS. LACH: This Court determined that the -- the antitrust statutes, under the antitrust statutes the term, person, does include municipalities, local governments.QUESTION: And isn't it true that in the original Sherman Act, imprisonment was authorized for every person who violates the act?MS. LACH: That is true, but we are unaware of any case in which a local government has been prosecuted as a criminal.QUESTION: But the interpretation of the law on4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the civil side --MS. LACH: Yes.QUESTION: -- was not nullified because there was a provision that said, every person is subject to imprisonment.MS. LACH: That is correct, Your Honor, and this Court in the City of Lafayette and City of Boulder, in analyzing the term, person, and determining that municipalities were included within that term, were also faced with the treble damages of the -- of the Clayton Act, and subsequent to those two decisions, Congress enacted the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, in which Congress specifically took local governments out of the range of the treble damages, and now local governments are subject to injunctive or declaratory relief.QUESTION: My -- my simple point is that by putting a clearly penal provision in the statute, that did not make municipalities out of the act, and I thought that's what you were arguing, that the 1863 act is penal in part --MS. LACH: Yes.QUESTION: -- and therefore, it could not have in -- covered municipalities.￼arguing.MS. LACH: Yes, that is -- that is what we're5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: But that's not true of the Sherman2 Act.3 MS. LACH: It does not appear to be true of the4 Sherman Act, but again, we are not aware of any case in5 which a local government was prosecuted under that act.6 QUESTION: Any more than this is a case of7 prosecution.8 MS. LACH: Any more -- that's true, but now,9 ever since 1878, the False Claims Act has been bifurcated.10 The criminal provisions are separately codified from the11 civil provisions.12 Also, as this Court noted in Stevens in 1863,13 the False Claims Act was enacted to combat fraud during14 the Civil War by private contractors, and there is no15 indication that in 1863 the Federal Government was buying16 anything from local governments, or that there were any17 Federal contracts with local governments, and without a18 practice of Federal funding to local governments, Congress19 would have no reason to envision a local government20 submitting a false claim for payment, nor were local21 governments firmly established as persons in 19 -- excuse22 me, in 1863.23 QUESTION: Well, Ms. Lach, you don't dispute24 that the word persons extends to some corporations under25 the act, do you?6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. LACH: Not at all. Not at all, and in fact,2 in -- in 1863, the term, person, presumptively included3 private corporations, and there is language in the 18634 act, and given the context of the act, it is reasonable to5 assume that private corporations were included in the6 provisions.7 QUESTION: Well, but there -- there are also8 cases from about that time that say that a -- a9 municipality is included in the -- in the term,10 corporation, at any rate.11 MS. LACH: The -- the cases at that time were --12 came from State courts, and the State courts were not13 consistent throughout -- throughout the Nation as to when14 local governments could be held liable. Some State courts15 held they could be held liable in contract, others in16 tort, and even when held liable in tort, there was17 sometimes the distinction between proprietary and18 governmental function.19 QUESTION: Well, what about Louisville and20 Letson?21 MS. LACH: Louisville and Letson, though, only22 applied to private corporations, and private corporations23 were established by that 1844 case, but in -- this Court24 did not extend that principle until the 1869 decision in25 Cowles, and that was the first time --7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

We -- we quoted Sir Edward Cook in including municipal corporations as -- as persons.MS. LACH: Yes, but still, in terms -- thisthe Cowles decision in 1869, believed that it not a settled issue and -- and settled the issueCourt, instill wasonce and for all. In the Amity case, it was not -- it was not -- the issue that was before the Court that needed to be decided, whether local governments were persons unlike in the Cowles case --QUESTION: Oh, we -- we thought otherwise in -- in Monell, certainly. We said in Monell, and I'm quoting it, the Letson principle in 1869 was automatically and without discussion extended to municipal corporations.MS. LACH: Yes, but by saying that, this Court in Monell dated the presumption as firmly established as of the 1869 Cowles decision, rather --QUESTION: So you think there was a -- a major change between, when, 1863 and 1869?MS. LACH: I think that --QUESTION: In that 6-year period, there was suddenly, whap, it applied to municipal corporations, before that it didn't? It seems to me most implausible.MS. LACH: Well, it doesn't -- it wasn't an automatic or a dramatic change, but nonetheless, there was8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

There was -- there was a transition in law within the States.QUESTION: In 6 years?MS. LACH: Those 6 years, of all 6 years in this country's history, of course, were the most significant, but -- but in terms of dating a presumption that one can firmly rely on, there is no firm date, other than 1869, in which acts of Congress were determined to include person as a -- include municipality within the word, person.QUESTION: Ms. Lach, the decision, the opinion in Cowles was very brief, right?MS. LACH: Yes, it was.QUESTION: And it was sort of like, well, of course. If this was establishing something that hadn't been just taken for granted, don't you suppose the Court would have engaged in a little more reasoning?MS. LACH: Perhaps, but nonetheless the Court did decide the issue, and made -- made it clear that for once -- once and for all, this issue was being decided, and it was at that point that no ambiguity was left.The first case that ever -- that -- in which a local government was ever brought before this Court was in 1861, in the Aspinwall case, and there the issue did not arise, and subsequent to the 1863 act, yes, there were other cases in which local governments were brought before9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

It wasn't until 1869 that we can firmly date when, in -- in Federal --in -- in congressional enactments, we can presume that the word person included local governments.And this Court in Monell observed that it took years of judicial conflict before corporations of all sorts, including municipal corporations, were establishedas persons that could sue and be QUESTION: Ms. Lach -- QUESTION: Well, if we word, person, includes municipalsued in Federal court.think that it -- that thecorporations, as, indeed, I think I do, based on Cowles and Monell, then whatchanged it in your view? Why would we now have a different view? Just because of the change in the punitive damages, the treble damages provision?MS. LACH: If this Court determines that theword, person, in 1863 did, in fact -- QUESTION: Yes.MS. LACH: -- include local government, that --QUESTION: Yes, on that assumption, then what would change that?￼Congress' Court hasMS. LACH: The -- the -- what would change it is imposition of treble damages, which thisnoted --QUESTION: But without an accompanying change in10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 the definition of person, right?2 MS. LACH: Exactly. Exactly, and the 19863 amendments were just that. They were amendments. What4 was not changed in 1986 remained the same. Nonetheless,5 when Congress provided for treble damages, which this6 Court has determined to be punitive, Congress knew what7 this Court said in City of Newport. This Court reiterated8 a presumption that local governments are immune from the9 imposition of punitive damages unless Congress10 specifically indicates otherwise.11 QUESTION: Well, it seems to me you would have a12 better argument if you simply said, the 1983 change does13 not impose punitive damages on local corporations, than to14 say it suddenly proscribes an entire escape hatch from any15 sort of liability at all.16 MS. LACH: Well, under the 1863 act, there were17 only double damages, which this Court concluded were18 remedial, and they were not punitive, but there was a big19 step made in 18 -- 1986, when Congress changed the remedy20 to mandatory treble damages and, in addition to that,￼21 increased 2223 time that24 the Stevens opinion that we decided they were punitive.25 MS. LACH: But there were indications prior to11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the statutory fines.QUESTION: But it didn't make it clear at that the change made them punitive. It was only in1 that that -- that -- from which Congress understood that2 the damages were punitive. In 1981, this Court, in Texas3 Industries, a case that was cited in Stevens, stated that4 treble damages are meant to punish, and also in 1981, in5 City of Newport, this Court cited an 1877 a Missouri6 supreme court case that held that a municipality was not7 subject to treble damages under a trespass statute,8 notwithstanding that statute's general authorization for9 such damages against any person, and the reason was,10 treble damages were exemplary, and --11 QUESTION: Ms. Lach, didn't12 I think in the context of the Clayton13 treble damages as, quote, remedial?14 MS. LACH: The Court -- the15 The Court said in -- in aspect, they are remedial, but16 then, also they did have an intent to punish as well, but17 as I stated, the -- the Clayton Act no longer applies to18 local governments because Congress took affirmative19 steps --20 QUESTION: Nonetheless, it used the word,21 remedial to characterize treble damages, and one of the22 difficulties that your -- your argument that you're now23 making encounters is that this change in 1986, wasn't it a24 dramatic expansion of qui tam liability?25 MS. LACH: It was a dramatic expansion, but as12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005the Court also, Act, characterizeCourt noted both.￼1 this Court --2 QUESTION: And then -- then you think that at3 the same time that Congress expanded it, it also cut back,4 without any indication at all?5 MS. LACH: Well, we believe that Congress did6 not cut back, that -- that local governments were never7 subject to the act, but with this dramatic expansion,8 there was also the dramatic increase in damages, and this9 Court has made it clear that local governments have an10 affirmative defense when punitive damages are at stake,11 and in order to abrogate that immunity from punitive12 damages, Congress has got to really say that it intends to13 impose those punitive damages, treble damages in this14 case, treble damages plus statutory fines in this case on15 local governments, and there's no indication anywhere on16 the face of the 1986 amendments that Congress intended to17 impose such damages on local governments.18 Local governments are mentioned twice in the19 1986 amendments. In one provision, it's the20 jurisdictional provision, 3732(b), which allows local21 governments and States to bring State court claims in22 Federal court when -- when the transaction arises from the23 same transaction as a False Claims Act action. That24 indicates that Congress was interested in -- in preventing25 frauds against local governments, not in -- in imposing13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 punitive damages on local governments, and the other2 provision is the CID provision which, as this Court noted3 in Stevens, has a -- has a definition. That definition4 includes States and political subdivisions of States, but5 that is for the purpose of investigation --6 QUESTION: I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't fully7 grasp the point you were just making. Were you suggesting8 that Congress was worried about fraud against9 municipalities, but it didn't think that fraud would be10 engaged in by municipal units? I mean, I remember -- I'm11 from New York, and I remember Tammany Hall. I don't think12 it was altogether so different in Cook County, was it?13 (Laughter.)14 MS. LACH: But the -- but the point is that15 where local governments are mentioned in the -- in the16 False Claims Act in the 1986 amendment, there is no17 indication that Congress was mentioning them because18 Congress was intending to abrogate the immunity from19 punitive damages.20 QUESTION: May I ask whether you think that Cook21 County could bring a qui tam action?22 MS. LACH: Well, that's less clear under the23 False Claims Act. This Court -- I -- I know that Your24 Honor, in the dissenting opinion, suggested that the term,25 person, is different in 30 -- 3730(b) from 3730(a). It's14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 less clear, I think, perhaps, but that was an issue that2 this Court expressly declined to address in Stevens3 because there was no need to discuss it or to decide it at4 that point.5 QUESTION: And there's no -- there's no need to6 decide it here. I -- I was just curious if you did have a7 position on it.8 MS. LACH: I think perhaps local governments9 could bring qui tam actions, but -- but it is not clear.10 There are also the -- the policy considerations11 with respect to the imposition of punitive damages on12 local governments. Local governments apply for and use13 Federal funds for the benefit of their residents and, as14 this Court noted in Stevens, in City of Newport, the Court15 was concerned with the imposition of punitive damages on16 local taxpayers under any circumstances, and here we have17 a statute that imposes three times the amount of damages18 and imposes statutory fines, which get very hefty.19 Punitive damages against a local government have20 got to come from someplace, and there are only two places,21 reduction in services, or an increase in taxes, and the22 victims of punitive damages are not the wrongdoers.23 They're -- they're the innocent, and some of those24 innocents are not even taxpayers or voters, such as25 schoolchildren or homeless medically indigent.15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The United States significantly -- significantly2 has other means to stop fraud by local governments, and to3 deter local governments from committing fraud. The United4 States has common law causes of action to be made whole,5 and the most effective deterrent is the threat of6 debarment from participation in Federal funding.7 With no indication that Congress ever intended8 to include local governments in the -- in the 1863 act,9 and with the Dictionary Act not being enacted until 1871,10 where Congress for the first time created a statutory11 presumption that the word, person, includes bodies politic12 and corporate, this case is in a very different posture13 from the Monell case.14 In Monell, this Court did not just look at the15 word, person. This Court looked at the historical16 environment in which section 1983 was enacted, it looked17 at the legislative history, and it also looked at the18 Dictionary Act, which was enacted just 2 months prior with19 the same -- by the same Congress that enacted section20 1983.21 A review of the circumstances around the 186322 enactment, together with the text and the historical23 context, leads the other way. There was no concrete24 presumption. There were -- there were indications, yes,25 but does that lead -- does that add up to a presumption?16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 There's no concrete presumption until this Court said so2 in Cowles in 1869, and then we have Congress in 1871.3 There were changes. There were articulations at that --4 at that point in time.5 If there are no further questions, I'll reserve6 the remainder of my time.7 QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Lach.8 MS. LACH: Thank you.9 QUESTION: Mr. Miner, we'll hear from you.10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H. MINER11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT12 MR. MINER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the13 Court:14 I really can't contribute much more to the15 discussion of what Congress meant by a person in16 section -- in 1863, other than to point out, as we did in17 our brief, that in fact, the law in the States prior to18 Letson -- and -- and indeed, Letson is the origin of19 the -- of the doctrine, because in Letson, what the Court20 actually said was, a corporation is a natural person for21 purposes of the suit where it's incorporated or where it￼22 does business, and the Court then23 that doctrine also applies to all24 politic.2517Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Before that,goes on and says, and corporations and bodythey looked at the1 citizenship of the individual shareholders to decide2 whether or not there was diversity jurisdiction?3 MR. MINER: The -- that's right. They -- they4 defined corporations by the -- by the members, and -- and5 they could have jurisdictions all over. That then gets6 cleared up, and -- and the law was absolutely clear in all7 of the States as we -- that we could find. We found no8 dissenting opinions that -- that held, that didn't hold9 that a local government, whether it was a corporation,10 whether it was a quasi corporation, a city, a county,11 wasn't held responsible for any obligations it had,12 whether by contract, whether by charter, whether --13 whether by statute, wherever they came from, and they were14 also responsible for all their wrongful torts.15 So that then brings us to really what was16 Ms. Lach's starting point, this whole question of the17 implications of the criminal provisions and, in fact, not18 only the Sherman Act, but the Elkins Act also includes19 criminal provisions, and this Court has recognized that20 person, in that act, includes municipal corporations, but21 the -- the question of what is the significance of22 including criminal penalties in 1863 has to be answered in23 the context of what was -- what was the -- the view in24 1863.2518Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼Unfortunately, this argument really doesn't1 surface until the reply, and so we haven't had a chance2 really to brief it, but the simple reality is, in -- in3 the period of 18 -- in the era of 1863, indeed in the 19th4 Century, local governments were treated just like private5 corporations, and they were, indeed, subject to6 indictment, and they were subject to criminal punishment7 on the same terms as local governments, and they were8 often found liable for acts that involved both fraud and9 deceit.10 Since -- since this was -- now, I'd like to read11 to the Court from Dillon, who is cited repeatedly as -- as12 one of the -- the scholars of the era, although we -- we13 have not cited this passage because the issue hadn't come14 up before, but in his treatise on the law of municipal15 corporations he states, English law, and in this16 country -- in the English law and in this country, quote,17 all corporations, municipal as well as private, which owe18 duties to the public are liable to indictment for19 malfeasance as well as nonfeasance in respect to their20 duties. And, in fact, he goes on to explain that they're21 responsible for palpable omissions, they're responsible￼22 for willful and corrupt acts, and23 at the turn of the century called24 Commonwealth, 56 S.W. 2d 958, the25 clear that the purpose of holding19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005in a -- a leading case Ludlow versusState supreme court made cities liable criminally1 was, indeed, to punish them and to deter future acts.2 That really was the law and, in fact, in a3 leading case from our own State, the Illinois supreme4 court, in upholding a criminal conviction against the City5 of Chicago for employing women for more than 10 hours,6 states in the case of People versus City of Chicago,7 100 N.E. 194, the municipality is held to the same degree8 of responsibility as an individual.9 In securing performance of specific duties10 imposed upon municipal corporations, the State has the11 same power of coercion and the same method of redress in12 the case of individuals or purely private corporations.13 That was the law in that era. That was the law when the14 False Claims Act was passed and, in a battery of cases15 which I can bring to this Court's attention, a case called16 Howard versus Crawford County, 12 F cases 637, Chaplain17 versus The Corporations of the City of New York, 3 Paige,18 P-a-i-g-e, Chapter 573, or the Town of Plymouth versus the19 Town of Windsor, 7 Vermont 325, all cases that predate the20 1863 False Claims Act, local governments were sued in21 lawsuits for fraudulent and deceitful conduct usually22 involving bond issues, or trying to avoid bond23 obligations, often in terms of their responsibilities to24 take care of their indigent citizens, and they would then25 engage in schemes to get their indigents into another20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 jurisdiction so the other jurisdiction would have to pay2 for the wrong, sometimes they in fact had paid, gotten3 paid, but 45 were sued6 theory, I7 question of whether statutory language using the word,8 person includes them.they --QUESTION: Well, the fact that local governments in these cases under some sort of common law take it, does not necessarily answer the9 MR. MINER: Oh, I'm simply using these as10 examples. I understand it's part of the argument that was11 made in the reply briefs by my opponent that local12 government simply cannot have the mental state of showing13 either fraud or intent to deceive, and -- and my point is14 simply, it was not uncommon in those days for local15 governments to be perceived as doing fraudulent or16 deceitful acts.17 QUESTION: Well, I'm sure that's true, but18 why -- why do you -- why is it that, in your opinion,19 nobody apparently with -- just, perhaps no exceptions, or20 one or two, has ever sued a local government before under21 this act?22 MR. MINER: Oh, I think -- there were suits that23 were brought, and we brought --24 QUESTION: I mean, a handful, virtually no --25 none. It's --21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼MR. MINER: I think the answer is two-fold.as this Court recognized in Hess, it's really the 1940s that money starts --QUESTION: Since 1986, that's already 16 years, are billions and billions of dollars worth of12 Number 1,3 not until45 and there6 Federal programs that go to cities, and --MR.

MINER: But I think the answer is that the789 there are10 1112 money doesn't start coming in until 19 -- until the 1940s13 and thereafter, and in -- in 1943, after this Court's14 decision in Hess, the False Claims Act gets emasculated,15 in the sense that it becomes very difficult to bring false16 claims, particularly qui tam cases. The damages are17 substantially reduced, and there is dramatic fall-off in18 false claims litigation, and that's the whole purpose of19 the 1986 amendments, to generate new life into it --20 QUESTION: Why since 1986 have we seen virtually21 no suits brought against municipalities?22 MR.

MINER: Oh, sure.3 QUESTION: See, what I'm worried about in the4 back of my mind is, if the -- assuming that the history in5 the 1860s is fairly inconclusive, which is the impression6 the briefs have left me with, you can make a good argument7 one way or the other, then I'd be worried about suddenly8 unleashing potentially billions of dollars of liability as9 lawyers comb through the vast number of Federal programs10 that give aid to cities, looking for someone, somewhere,11 who has made a false statement, and I'm sure there are12 quite a few, at -- at which point the cities would13 suddenly discover vast liability for treble damages that14 their -- their citizens can't avoid. You can't sell a15 share in a city, and -- and so that's the kind of thing16 that worries me practically, and I wish you'd talk about17 it a little.￼MR.

Just in case, though, I'm left24 absolutely uncertain about what the right result is on the25 basis of what happened in 1863, I want to, just in case23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 it's relevant, to have in my mind what's likely to occur2 in the year 2003.3 MR. MINER: Oh, I -- I think what is going to --4 first of all, let's understand that these cases are not5 now brought on the basis of negligent statements, or6 slight misrepresentations, but these cases involve -- this7 is a statute unlike section 1983 or the Sherman Act, that8 really does not involve itself in imposing any new9 obligations, any new or unanticipated responsibilities on10 local governments.11 It merely says, when you entered into a contract12 with us, we're going to hold you to the deal that you13 made, and if you breach that deal in material ways, we're14 going to try to get our money back, so there is -- there15 are protections in the sense that it's not any statement16 that gets litigated here. It's got to be a serious,17 essential misrepresentation about how that money was used18 that is at the core of these lawsuits, so that --19 QUESTION: All right. I mean, if that's the20 only answer, though, I -- I begin to think -- I don't know21 how much money is involved, but I was trying to make a22 guess and say, leaving out social security, food stamps23 and that kind of thing, which are individuals, my guess is24 there -- probably it's in the range of hundreds of25 billions of dollars that go to cities, leaving those24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 things out, and you have a few bad actors in every program2 that maybe purposely make a lie in a statement3 MR. MINER: Well, I think --4 QUESTION: -- to help preserve their5 don't know why they do it, and -- and there we6 suddenly a huge liability imposed on citizens.7 Now, I'm overstating this perhaps, but I want8 you to tell me what the true dimension of that problem is.9 MR. MINER: Well, I don't think that -- first,10 as part of that answer, Congress has made a decision by11 the -- by increasing damages from double to treble, there12 will be a deterrent effect, and that one response of this13 is going to be, in fact, less fraud. There's going to14 be -- the money will be used for the purposes for which it15 was given to the states, and there will be a deterrent16 effect in terms of government officials not actually17 engaging in fraud and -- and a related interest in the act18 is, in fact, promoting representative, responsive19 democracy, and by disclosing frauds to the public, you can20 correct them. But the reality still is the contract, the21 lawsuit is only brought if, in fact, there's been an22 essential misrepresentation, something really basic about23 what was done by a local government that has actually24 misused the money.25 Local government has gotten the money, and, in25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005--job, I have￼1 fact, all the local government is giving back is, it's2 giving back the money it wrongfully got, if it's shown3 that it got it by -- got it falsely or -- or fraudulently.4 It's giving back prejudgment interest and, within the5 statute of limitations of 10 years, that is always6 virtually going to exceed the basic laws, and it's going7 to have to pay back the -- give a share to the relator,8 which is an important piece of this, because Congress has9 also recognized that, in this area, where you do have10 large amounts of fraud out there, there are no private11 victims.12 There is nobody who steps forward and says, I13 was hurt, and therefore I'm going to bring a lawsuit to14 protect myself and the Government will benefit, and the15 Government, the Court -- the Congress recognized, doesn't16 have the research -- the resources to deal with all this,17 so it desperately needs the -- the private Inspector18 Generals who are willing to step forward oftentimes, not19 as bounty hunters, but as -- as really offended citizens20 who, like Dr. Chandler, who brought it to the attention of21 the county and said, you're not doing what you're supposed22 to do, and they took responsibilities from him and he said23 again, and you're not supposed to -- you're supposed to be24 providing these services, and suddenly she wasn't25 responsible for that.26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 They need these people to come in and blow the2 whistle, because otherwise, the Government's not going to3 find it, and they -- they recognize that oftentimes4 they're -- they're terminated, so we've got to pay them5 something for coming forward, so what the Government is6 really paying in many of the claims is not much more than7 what, in fact, the government -- what the -- the local8 government is paying is not much more than what the -- the9 Federal Government paid in this case --10 QUESTION: Don't paint too rosy a picture. I11 mean, if qui tam actions were as desirable as you assert,12 they would not have been eliminated in England totally,13 and vastly reduced in the United States, because they are14 an invitation to shakedowns. That's -- that's why they've15 been largely eliminated from our law.16 MR. MINER: That -- that's a --17 QUESTION: So you know, if -- if loving qui tam18 actions is -- is what you need to win your case, you're --19 you're --20 MR. MINER: No, I don't -- I don't want to21 suggest that, and -- but I -- to be honest, I'm a little22 offended, but the treatment their -- plaintiffs in here23 are no different than plaintiffs in antitrust cases, or24 securities cases. Many are truly wronged and are25 outraged, and there are always some who will take27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

It's6 really money out of your pocket.7 MR. MINER: Oh, I don't --8 QUESTION: So better to pay this fellow9 get on with the business of the city, and -- I mean, those10 are problems with -- with a qui tam action. Let's not --11 let's not minimize --12 MR. MINER: We're here in the United States13 Supreme Court because Cook County wasn't about to simply14 say this is play money, and we're going to pay you. That15 isn't really what happens very often. If they're wrong,16 they agree and they -- they pay, but they -- they also17 fight you tooth and nail, and -- and you have to prove, in18 fact, they didn't do what they said they were going to --19 what they committed themselves to do, but the -- the20 reality is that there are no -- in 1863, I think persons21 clearly included municipal corporations, as it included22 all corporations. There is nothing in -- in the act23 itself that in any way suggests that Congress did not want24 to apply it to -- to municipal --25 QUESTION: Were there any grant in aid -- I28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

MINER: It wasn't, but that doesn't mean that, first of all, again going back to Lafayette, this Court recognized the fact that Congress in 1890 was concerned about private corporations didn't preclude including municipal corporations as persons under the Sherman Act, and -- and the fact of the matter is, local governments in that day did commercial activities. They built bridges, they took care of the indigent at the request of States, and they were held responsible for their actions and, in fact, when they didn't live up to their responsibilities, they were routinely sued, and they could well have been reached by Federal Government.I guess my time is up. Thank you. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Miner. Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM S. STEWARTON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT￼MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief please the Court:The False Claims Act is for addressing deliberate efforts29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005Justice, and may itthe primary mechanism to cheat the Federal1 Government out of money and property. Petitioner has2 identified no legitimate ground for excluding local3 governments from the coverage of the act. Local4 governments receive very substantial amounts of Federal5 money, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the6 same harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private7 party. Moreover, local governments are presumptively8 encompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against9 local governments raise no constitutional concerns.10 Now, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin,11 it's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of12 this Court to the effect that a municipal corporation13 would presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of14 Federal statutes. However, given the materials available15 at that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably16 concluded that municipalities were covered.17 As Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826,18 this Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to19 the effect that the term, person, presumptively includes20 both municipal and private corporations and, again,21 because fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement22 of Federal --23 QUESTION: There -- that -- that case, though,24 was dealing with a private corporation, was it not?25 MR. STEWART: That -- that's correct. There was30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 no square holding to that effect, but certainly all the2 indications in the Court's opinions would have supported3 Congress in its view that the term, person, would include4 local governments.5 The -- the Court in Monell held that as of 18716 a clear understanding to that effect had been established,7 and petitioner has identified no evidence that would8 suggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the9 years between 1863 and 1871.10 It -- it may also be the case that, as Justice11 Ginsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely12 academic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't13 have received a significant amount of Federal money. The14 Congress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion15 so that it would encompass spending programs that were16 adopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863,17 and -- and the Court --18 QUESTION: Now, aren't you gilding the lily a19 little bit to say that Congress in 1863 contemplated that20 there would be massive Federal spending programs in the21 future?22 MR. STEWART: Oh, I'm not suggesting that23 Congress contemplated that. I'm saying Congress wrote the24 statute in a way that would cover whatever spending25 programs came to be adopted in ensuing years, and -- and31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S.2 ex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of3 financial assistance that we're dealing with here would4 not have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the5 act broadly, and these funds are in -- as much in need of6 protection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in7 some significant, some relatively minor respects, continue8 to amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the9 period between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it10 became increasingly apparent that local governments were11 beginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money.12 It also became increasingly apparent that the13 term, person would be construed generally to encompass14 local governments, yet Congress retained the word, person,15 even as it amended other features of the act, and I think16 petitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute17 included municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments18 took local governments out of the act's coverage by adding19 a punitive component to the damages available, and -- and20 this seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons.21 First, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments22 generally was to make the act more effective, to expand23 its coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in24 fighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same25 time Congress would have removed from the act's32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 coverage --2 QUESTION: Well, we do have the presumption in3 the City of Newport situation of not treating punitives as4 applicable to municipal corporations.5 MR. STEWART: That's correct. The City of6 Newport involved a different sort of statute. That is,7 the statute at issue in City of Newport was 42 U.S.C.8 1983, and it provided an express cause of action, but it9 said nothing about the remedies that would be available,10 and essentially this Court's holding was, where the11 statutory directive is for courts to use their own best12 judgment as to what remedies are appropriate, punitive13 damages should generally not be imposed upon14 municipalities, but here, Congress has spoken precisely to15 the remedies that will be applied at the end of a16 successful suit.17 QUESTION: Does it give the Government any18 remedy that -- suppose that you think that the particular19 qui tam action is causing a lot of trouble in a Medicare20 area, or Medicaid area, and there are hospital grants,21 or -- you know, there are vast numbers of grants. Can you22 do anything about it?23 MR. STEWART: Yes.24 QUESTION: What?25 MR. STEWART: The statute does authorize the33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

STEWART: That --QUESTION: You could do it, though.MR. STEWART: That's correct. I -- I don't wantto represent that this is done often, but it is an available --QUESTION: Well, have there been a lot of cases since 1986 against municipalities?MR. STEWART: Yes. The figures I've been given by the Civil Division are that 138 qui tam suits have been filed against local governments since 1986. In 13 of those, the United States has intervened.QUESTION: And settled, or --MR. STEWART: I don't know what the disposition of those -- sometimes we might intervene to settle, sometimes we might intervene because we believe the claim is meritorious and we want to -- to prosecute the suit to its conclusion.34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Do you have some dollar figures in2 those?3 MR. STEWART: I don't have dollar figures with4 respect to municipalities. I know overall since 1986 the5 Treasury has realized a little over $10 billion in6 recoveries from False Claims Act suits. That includes7 both qui tam suits and suits that were initiated by the8 United States.9 QUESTION: You sort of federalized this action.10 I mean, you're going to let the private plaintiffs go out,11 sue all the cities, and if you think there's something12 wrong here, you will step in and deal with it?13 MR. STEWART: Well, I don't -- I don't want to14 represent we will do this on a regular basis. I just want15 to say, it is an available mechanism under the False16 Claims Act in extreme situations, where public policy￼17 concerns18 it's not19 forward.20cause the Department of Justice to conclude that in the public interest for the suit to goThe other point I would make with respect to the21 City of Newport is, again, if -- the City of Newport dealt22 with a statute that didn't specifically address the23 question of remedies at all. Now, if we're correct about24 the law as it existed before 1986, that local governments25 were covered, and that they were subject to the double35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 damages remedy that this Court had held to be essentially2 remedial, if Congress had wanted to exclude municipalities3 from the act's coverage, it -- it really seems outlandish4 to think that Congress would have attempted to achieve5 that objective by leaving the word, person, in the act6 unchanged, and by amending the act's liability provisions.7 If Congress had believed that it was appropriate8 either to take the municipalities out of the scope of the9 act altogether, or at least to subject them to remedies10 less than those available against private corporations,11 the natural thing to do would have been to amend the act12 so to provide. It -- it seems unlikely that Congress13 would have attempted to achieve that objective by so14 indirect a means.15 The other point we would make is that there may16 be isolated situations in which an award of treble damages17 under the act will far exceed the harm that was done to18 the United States, but the alternative that petitioner19 contends we believe is much worse, because it would leave20 the act entirely unavailable for redressing all manner of21 fraud committed by local governments against the United22 States.23 When we have a contract action, when we have an24 ordinary suit of a dispute about money, and we regard it25 as a good faith controversy, even if we prevail at the end36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of the day, it's often the case that the United States2 won't be made completely whole, because we incur costs of3 investigation, costs of prosecuting the suit, we may lose4 the time value of money. When we're dealing with good5 faith disputes, Congress and the executive branch have6 been content to treat that undercompensation simply as a7 cost of doing business.8 QUESTION: Do any Government grants or contracts9 have attorney's fees provisions in them?10 MR. STEWART: I -- I don't know that any do. It11 certainly would not be the norm. I mean, the -- the12 American rule is that each party bears its -- its own13 attorney's fees, and so absent some express statutory14 authority, we would not be able to recover our fees, even15 if we prevailed, and so again, Congress is willing --16 QUESTION: Well, if it's a problem, you can put17 it in your grant.18 MR. STEWART: I don't think with -- certainly as19 to municipalities I think we would have a hard time,20 without express statutory authority, arriving at a21 contractual agreement that municipalities would be subject22 to such an unusual remedy and, as I say, Congress and the23 executive branch are willing to live with that form of24 undercompensation when we're dealing with a good faith25 dispute.37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

STEWART: There -- a false statement is one category. There -- there is a knowing requirement. That is, the individual entity has to knowingly submit a false claim. There -- there are instances in which the claim may be false even if it doesn't contain an express false statement. For instance, if it's very clear that it's necessary, for instance, that medical services be medically necessary in order to be reimbursable, andthe --QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.Ms. Lach, you have 11 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. LACH: Thank you.The first point I'd like to address isMr. Miner's point that local governments were sued in all38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 types of tort actions across the board. Congress'2 understanding of the suability of municipalities, and3 municipalities as persons in 1863 was really dependent on4 State law, because there had been no Federal expression up5 until that time, and across the board in the States, local6 governments were viewed differently.7 Some -- some local governments were viewed as8 quasi corporations and some as municipal corporations with9 different levels of liability and, as I noted earlier,10 some States made a distinction between proprietary and11 Government functions, so Congress' understanding based on12 State law at that time was not consistent enough to be13 evidence that Congress understood person to include local14 governments.15 As for State criminal actions, in some States16 there were misdemeanor actions against local governments17 for nuisance actions such as failure to maintain a bridge,18 but there is no common law with respect to -- to Federal19 statutes. When -- when Congress enacts a criminal20 statute, the States' understanding of -- of who is a21 person subject to State criminal statutes is not22 dispositive of what Congress had in mind, and if it is23 ambiguous and it is inconclusive, as Justice Breyer24 suggested, it might be what -- what Congress was actually25 thinking in 1863.39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.

LACH: The cases that have addressed this3 have noted there -- a local government can be in cahoots4 with another -- another entity that submits false claims,5 the -- the local government is aware of it, and the6 whistleblower is an employee of the local government.7 In that case, it is -- in that scenario, the8 whistleblower is blowing the whistle on someone else and9 yet is employed by the local government and, under this --10 under the Court's reasoning in -- in the Eighth Circuit11 case and in the two cases that we cited, Satalich and Erie12 County, an action can still proceed against a local13 government under 3730(h), even though a local government14 is not necessarily a person subject to suit.15 To get -- to get back to the points, a lawsuit16 under the False Claims Act can be brought if a statement17 is made in reckless disregard. Mr. Miner suggested that18 the statement has to be clearly false, deliberately false,19 and under the 1986 amendments, the standard has been20 reduced to reckless disregard.21 As for deterrent, by the time some of these22 actions are filed, the wrongdoer is not even in office any23 more. It is the local taxpayers, the local residents that24 bear the brunt of -- of any False Claims Act action and25 penalty, not -- not the person that actually perpetrated43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the wrong.2 When -- when in 1986 Congress expanded the3 coverage of the False Claims Act, it did not expand the4 fraudsters. As this Court noted in Stevens, the False5 Claims Act covers just all kinds of fraud, but it does not6 cover all kinds of fraudsters, and there's no indication,7 under our view, that local governments were among8 fraudsters that are included under this act.9 In response to Mr. Stewart, we are not aware of10 any dismissals of False Claims Act actions that are11 brought against local governments. The -- the Government12 has not intervened, obviously, in -- in a number of these13 False Claims Act actions, but we're not aware of any14 situation in which the Government has actually dismissed a15 claim against a local government. These actions proceed16 and, even if -- even if the United States wanted to17 dismiss an action, they would have to justify their18 dismissal before the court, and the same with a19 settlement. It has to be approved by the court.20 In sum, I would like to say that Congress knows21 what language it needs to impose punitive damages. If22 this Court finds that local governments are included in23 the 1863 act, Congress did not use the requisite language24 to indicate that it meant to impose punitive damages on25 local governments in 1986.44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, N.W.
