WAXMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and(11:04 a.m.) Bank versusmay itplease the Court:The complaint in this case alleges that anational bank charged excessive interest. This Court has held repeatedly and consistently since 1875 thatsection 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both the exclusive standards governing the interest that a national bank may charge and the exclusive judicial remedies for any violation.And as a result, any claim that a national bank charged excessive interest necessarily arises under Federal law, whether that claim is brought in State court or Federal court. Any well-pleaded complaint would reflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a national bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or deceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts and may either be filed there by a3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plaintiff or removed there by a defendant.QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, normally when the FederalGovernment creates a cause of action that preempts State causes of action, it attaches an element to that cause of action that does not exist under some of the State causes of action. Let's say, it -- it creates a cause of action against the owners and -- and managers of nuclear facilities, but the cause of action must be based on something more than mere negligence. It has to be intentional malfeasance or gross negligence. Okay?Now, what if somebody comes in and brings a cause of action in State court, alleging mere negligence by the owners of the nuclear facility? Is it your position that that case is removable even though it wouldn't -- it wouldn't survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under -- under Federal law?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, with respect, I don't think that I would concede the premise of your question, that is, that a Federal cause of action ordinarily has an additional element.QUESTION: All right. Well --MR. WAXMAN: But leaving that aside -- QUESTION: Leaving -- in my hypothetical --create one --MR. WAXMAN: Your -- your hypothetical actually4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 is an example of a very peculiar instance in which, with2 respect to nuclear incidents, Congress has imported in --3 has federalized the cause. It created an express Federal4 cause of action --5 QUESTION: Right.6 MR. WAXMAN: -- and said expressly that State7 law standards will apply and it will be the law of8 whatever State the incident occurred.MR. WAXMAN: If -- if any -- I hope I canQUESTION: But take my hypothetical. What do my hypothetical? Is it removable or not? MR. WAXMAN: If -- if --QUESTION: Yes or no.910 you do in 11121314 remember your hypothetical. The --15 QUESTION: The hypothetical is you plead a State16 law cause of action that does not claim all of the17 elements which are necessary for the Federal cause of18 action. So it's clear on the face of it that it is19 dismissable.20 MR. WAXMAN: It is definitely removable. It21 definitely is completely preempted if it comes within the22 scope of a cause of action that has been determined to be23 exclusive. Now, that's --24 QUESTION: It's very strange to say that you can25 remove something that on its face does not constitute a￼5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 Federal cause of action.2 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, there may -- in3 preemption cases, there are line-drawing problems at the4 margins about whether something is or isn't preempted.5 This is a heartland case and the example -- the6 hypothetical you're giving is let's say that State of7 Alabama or the State of Delaware created strict liability8 for excessive interest. The Federal statute says it has9 to be knowingly under section 86. There is no question --10 no question -- under this Court's decided cases that a11 claim that a national bank charged excessive interest,12 with whatever state of mind or lack of state of mind, is13 governed exclusively by Federal standards and an exclusive14 Federal cause of action and that --15 QUESTION: Right, but the question is whether16 the consequence of that is that the State law cause of17 action must be dismissed by the State court because it's18 preempted, or rather, the consequence is that you can19 remove into Federal court a pleading that plainly on its20 face does not -- does not claim a Federal cause of action.21 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the --22 QUESTION: It just seems very strange to me.23 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the pleading -- the24 complaint in this case on its face does satisfy the25 Federal cause of action and --6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: I understand that. I understand2 that. We're -- we're not talking about what happens here.3 But I -- with regard to the general principle that you4 want us to set forth.5 MR. WAXMAN: I think --6 QUESTION: That's -- what's -- what I'm7 concerned about. Is it that all cases automatically come,8 or is it only those that -- that set forth a Federal cause9 of action?10 MR. WAXMAN: It has to be one that if well11 pleaded -- I mean, a -- on a removal -- on a notice of12 removal, the Federal court is obligated, like any court13 determining its own jurisdiction, to read the complaint as14 if it were well pleaded. And if, when the court reads the15 complaint, it says there is a Federal question necessarily16 presented in here which has been inartfully not pleaded,17 the court then proceeds to adjudicate on the merits that18 claim. If the answer is no, if the answer is, hey, this19 guy pleaded a claim under State law and I have well20 pleaded it and it still doesn't raise a Federal question,21 then you remand.22 And it's that -- that's sort of -- I didn't mean23 to quibble with you, but the principle that we suggest is24 very straightforward is simply an application of this25 Court's decided jurisprudence, under arising-under7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 jurisdiction, that removal jurisdiction follows original2 jurisdiction.3 QUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, is what you're4 saying essentially there is a Federal claim or there is no5 claim? Certainly the plaintiff doesn't want there to be6 no claim. If there is a claim, it is necessarily Federal.7 MR. WAXMAN: Yes.8 QUESTION: And that's what makes it removable.9 It is treated as though it were well pleaded, when, in10 fact, it's badly pleaded.11 MR. WAXMAN: Indeed. And the -- the perplexing12 thing about this case is the sort of almost Kafkaesque13 situation that we have that's exemplified by the amicus14 briefs on both sides where this particular instance where15 the plaintiff says usury under State law even though the16 Supreme -- this -- this Court has decided, since 11 years17 after the act was passed in the Civil War, that there is18 no such State claim, we now have a -- a group of19 plaintiffs' lawyers from California urging this Court to￼20 establish21 case they22 23a right to plead something that in their own say is only, quote, defensively preempted. QUESTION: If they had --MR. WAXMAN: And no one has -- I'm sorry. QUESTION: If they had pled it correctly, they2425 could still be in State court, but the defendant could8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 remove. In other words, this is not -- although it's a2 Federal claim -- it arises only under Federal law -- it3 could be brought in State court or Federal court.4 MR. WAXMAN: Correct. There is concurrent5 jurisdiction as there -- as is the norm, as this Court has6 explained. And there are instances in which these cases7 are litigated to the merits in State court and instances8 in which they're litigated in Federal court either because9 they're brought there by the plaintiff, as the plaintiff10 could have here, or they're removed there as the11 defendant.12 And the other principle that this case reflects,13 as I said, is not just the importance of parity in Federal14 question jurisdiction between giving plaintiffs and15 defendants parity in invoking the Federal courts if they16 choose, but the requirement that this Court has stated17 over and over and over again that in -- in determining its18 own jurisdiction, the Federal court will construe the19 complaint as well-pleaded.20 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles21 me about -- about the proposal that you make and that the22 Government makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case23 that established this principle and in the ERISA case,24 which is the only other case that has -- has held to the25 same effect, those cases refer to this as being an9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 extraordinary, an unusual event. But I don't think it's2 going to be an unusual event if we say that whenever there3 is created a Federal cause of action, and at the same4 time, State causes of action are preempted, it may be5 removed to Federal court. I don't think that will be6 unusual at all.7 And I sort of looked upon the -- the Labor8 Management Relations Act case as really sort of a -- a9 platypus, I mean, a very strange case in which the courts10 just didn't want these labor things to go into State11 courts because they didn't trust State courts. And so12 they said, boy, we're going to have Federal courts create13 this whole new law of -- of contracting, of collective14 bargaining. That's how I always regarded it. And now15 you're telling me it's really just a little piece of a16 much broader proposition which is not at all -- not at all17 narrow.18 MR. WAXMAN: No. Justice Scalia, I think it19 actually is very, very narrow. And we can go through in20 detail, but almost all of the statutory schemes that21 the -- the State's amicus brief cites are not, in fact,22 examples of complete preemption. But it -- it comes up23 only in the instance where there is not only substantive24 preemption by Federal law and the creation of a Federal25 cause of action, but the determination that that cause of10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 action is, in fact, exclusive. And that is the difficult2 and close question that this Court --3 QUESTION: Well, was -- was that true in the4 Farmers' and Mechanics' case? The -- the Court certainly5 said that when you're suing for usury, that was all you6 could get with the -- that wasn't, of course, a -- a7 removal case at all, was it?8 MR. WAXMAN: No, it wasn't a removal case. And9 in fact, depending on when in 1875 it was decided, there10 may or may not have been --11 QUESTION: There wasn't Federal -- there wasn't12 Federal question jurisdiction.131415 you, that one.MR. WAXMAN: -- there may not have been removal.QUESTION: But it is not a white horse case for￼MR. WAXMAN: I think it is a -- if I understand17 the reference, I think it is a white horse case in the18 sense -- in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice. We're not19 contending that the 1864 act evinced an intent to make20 these causes of action removable, even if pleaded under21 State law, because there was no general Federal question22 jurisdiction, and it wasn't provided in the law.162324 that this25 the ERISAThe relevant question and the relevant question Court deemed to be close in Metropolitan Life in context is whether -- okay, fine, Federal law11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 has substantively preempted the field or by conflict or2 whatever. Is the creation of the Federal cause of action3 of such force that it should be deemed to be exclusive?4 And that, I think, is what this Court decided5 first in Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank by saying to the6 borrower in that case -- the borrower was maintaining that7 under New York State law, it was entitled to void not --8 to forfeit not just the interest, but the note. And this9 Court said, look, New York State law has nothing to do10 with this. This is a claim of usury by a national bank.11 The Federal standards are exclusive, and the Federal12 penalty expressly will not permit forfeiture of the note.13 Only the interest.14 QUESTION: But -- but certainly under the -- the15 statute itself did not preclude the possibility of that16 action having been brought in State court.17 MR. WAXMAN: Not at all. And in fact, it was18 expressly contemplated. Then as now, these actions can be19 brought and are often brought in State courts. All that20 the --21 QUESTION: So can 3 -- 301 suits. The two cases22 that we have so far where we have recognized that there is23 only a Federal cause of action, that cause of action could24 have been brought just as well in State court, but it's up25 to the defendant to remove it. So we're not talking about12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 an exclusive Federal forum.2 MR. WAXMAN: That -- that's correct, Justice3 Ginsburg. And the same is true for the types of ERISA4 claims that were at issue in Metropolitan Life.5 QUESTION: And -- and I suppose one reason -- I6 was surprised when I went through. I thought there would7 be a whole lot of exclusive Federal cause of action,8 and -- and there are very few. But I suppose one of the9 reasons we don't get it very often is just what Justice10 Ginsburg said. There are other provisions where there's11 an exclusive Federal forum.MR. WAXMAN: Correct. For example, the13 Copyright Act.12QUESTION: Which is -- which is not this case.14 1516 example of complete preemption, but there's a statutory17 provision that --18 QUESTION: Okay, why didn't we express this --19 this principle before instead of -- instead of adhering so20 narrowly? I mean, even the ERISA case, it didn't express21 this -- this broad theory. It says, this is -- this is22 very much like the section 301, and the legislative23 history referred specifically to 301, and therefore we24 come out the same way. Pretty -- pretty narrow.25 MR. WAXMAN: Here's -- here's why, Justice13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005MR. WAXMAN: The Copyright Act certainly is an￼1 Scalia. The very difficult -- this Court made clear in2 Metropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it3 wasn't going to infer from congressional silence very4 lightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of5 action, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would6 displace State causes of action. There's a very strong7 and longstanding presumption to the contrary.8 But that difficult question was decided in the9 context of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning10 in 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's11 opinion and in the Comptroller's report that the12 Government cites that precipitated the enactment of13 section 30, which is that this was war legislation. This14 was a -- the creation of the national banks was hoped by15 Congress and President Lincoln that it would provide the16 means with which the Government could continue to fund the17 war, and national banks would knit the country together18 when the war was finished.19 And the one thing that comes out of the history20 of this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is21 that they feared, based on their experience with the first22 bank of the United States and the second bank of the23 United States, that jealous States, States that were24 jealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing25 paper at the time, would engage in predations against the14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 national banks that were created at the very same time2 that section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this3 important 4567 8 9Federal infant in its crib.QUESTION: I started to call you General Waxman. (Laughter.)MR. WAXMAN: Thank you.QUESTION: Like the old days.MR. WAXMAN: R-18.QUESTION: Assume -- assume that I -- I agree10 with you that -- that on -- on complete preemption,11 this -- this case passes muster.But assume also that in writing an opinion, I -- say something to indicate why we do not have a snowball here. I mean, we -- first, we had the1213 I want to14 gathering15 labor management reporting. Then we got in some ERISA16 cases. Now we recognize this.17 Is there any criterion that you see in -- in at18 least the cases on those three points so far, that --19 that -- or any language that points to a criterion for20 when preemption, particularly field preemption, for21 example, becomes complete and when it doesn't?22 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. There has to be23 substantive -- Congress has to supply the exclusive24 substantive standards. It has to create a cause of action25 to remedy violations of those standards, and this is the￼15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 hard part. And it also has to make clear that that --2 that judicial remedy is, in fact, exclusive, that is, that3 it will not permit the existence or operation of State law4 causes of action, even those that import the Federal5 standards and my --6 QUESTION: Okay. Why in other cases? Again,7 assume you -- you made your point on -- so far as this8 statute is concerned. Why in other cases aren't courts9 going to be, in effect, remitted to doing what the -- the10 Court tried to do here, and that is, say, let's find out11 what Congress had in mind? And we don't find anything in12 the legislative history that makes it clear, and therefore13 it doesn't apply.14 MR. WAXMAN: You -- you have to find out what15 Congress had in mind, but I think this Court has made16 clear in Metropolitan Life that it is going to be the17 rare, rare, rare day when the Federal courts will infer18 from congressional silence that a Federal cause of action19 is to be exclusive.20 And the other examples in -- in which -- in the21 Federal law in which there is, in fact, complete22 preemption, the FELA or the Carmack Amendment as an23 example, Congress has gone ahead and expressly made those24 actions nonremovable.25 May I reserve the balance of my time?16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:For more than 125 years, it has been clear thatthe National Bank Act provides the exclusive cause of action for a claim of usury against a national bank. Because the National Bank Act provides the sole available avenue of relief, any claim that a national bank has committed usury can arise only under that Federal law. The National Bank --QUESTION: Can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Waxman? What if -- what if the pleading makes a claim of usury, but it does not contain all of the elements necessary to make out a Federal cause of action? Is that removable?MR. ROBERTS: A failure to state a claim on which relief is granted does not deprive the Federal court of jurisdiction over the claim. So the simple failure to state a claim wouldn't prevent it from being removable if the -- if the claim was within the scope of the Federal cause of action, if it was a colorable claim.17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Now, if -- if the claim --2 QUESTION: Well, it's not colorable. I mean,3 one of the elements is just not there.45 colorable 67 what they8 the Federal statute.MR. ROBERTS: If -- if the claim was not--QUESTION: It -- it claims usury when -- when charged was 3 percent and that would not violateMR. ROBERTS: Well, here -- here we -- we don't situation, Your Honor.QUESTION: I understand that. I want to know -- MR. ROBERTS: That --910 have that 11121314 set forth15 forth before. We've -- we've treated 301 and ERISA as --16 as distinctive cases. Now you want a general proposition.17 I want to know what does this general proposition cover.18 Is the State court going to have to -- or is --19 before removal is granted, is the court going to have to20 decide whether a cause of action is properly stated, or --21 or, you know, whether -- whether it could be dismissed22 on -- on a motion to dismiss?23 MR. ROBERTS: When it's removed, the Federal24 court decides whether there's jurisdiction under Federal25 law, whether there's arising-under jurisdiction, and18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: We -- you're -- you're asking us to a new general proposition, which we haven't set￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decides whether the -- the complaint is properly pleaded, the true nature of the complaint states a claim under Federal law. And --QUESTION: So if it doesn't, then it stays in State court.MR. ROBERTS: If it doesn't, then it can remand the State -- the case back to State court, but it would have decided, in essence, that the claim should be dismissed at the same time by deciding --QUESTION: What happens -- what happens if the cause of action is for misrepresentation under State law, and the misrepresentation is that the interest rate was lawful and the plaintiff alleges it was unlawful because it was usurious?MR. ROBERTS: Well, to the extent that the State claim requires the decision that a -- a determination that there were excessive interest charges by a national bank, then the claim would fall within the scope of the cause of action. But that wouldn't mean that there couldn't be claims for misrepresentation that --QUESTION: Well, in -- in my -- would this removable? This is the only thing in the complaint.MR. ROBERTS: The complaint --QUESTION: It seems to me this might be like Gully in that it -- the -- the nature of the cause of19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425action was really a State cause of action even though it involves an inquiry into what the Federal law --MR. ROBERTS: The State cause of action is just misrepresentation.QUESTION: That's it.MR. ROBERTS: Then that would not be removable. QUESTION: It's unlawful, and the onlymisrepresentation is it's unlawful and it's unlawful allegedly because it's usurious.MR. ROBERTS: Yes. I don't think that would be removable, Your Honor.QUESTION: There were related claims here that were strictly State claims.MR. ROBERTS: That -- that --QUESTION: But they fell into --MR. ROBERTS: Yes, but the existence of pendentState claims doesn't defeat removal jurisdiction just as it doesn't defeat original jurisdiction. There were pendent State claims in the Metropolitan Life case, yet --QUESTION: And they'd come up under 1367. They would travel with the 13 --MR. ROBERTS: Exactly, Your Honor. The supplemental jurisdiction statute, 1367, expressly provides for Federal court jurisdiction in those instances. They would come with -- with the claim to20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Federal court.2 QUESTION: But if you had this same complaint3 and it didn't have the usury claim and it just had those4 State law claims, then there's nothing removable.5 MR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's right, Your6 Honor. The -- the misrepresentation claim and the7 suppression claim are both species of fraud claim under8 State law. They don't come within the -- the scope of the9 cause of action in the National Bank Act, and they're not,10 on their own terms, arise under Federal law and they would11 not be removable.12 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, can I go back to your13 answer to Justice Scalia's question? I wonder if you14 really meant the answer you gave.15 Assume a case in which the plaintiff alleges16 that 3 percent is usurious as a matter of Alabama law, and17 under Federal law it must be at least 5 percent, say. As18 I understand it, that would be removable because he's19 making a usury claim and would be dismissable, that is,20 under your -- your theory of the case. But I thought you21 said that would have to be dismissed in State court.22 MR. ROBERTS: What -- what -- I tried to23 distinguish between failure to state a claim, which I24 agree the simple failure to state a claim is -- is not a25 ground for lack of Federal jurisdiction, Your Honor.21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: If you fail -- you failed to state a Federal claim, but you do state an Alabama claim.MR. ROBERTS: There is no Alabama claim because the only claim can arise under Federal law. So it -- so it is removable and then the Federal court would assert Federal jurisdiction, which it has over the claim and dismiss it.QUESTION: And the Federal court would dismiss,yes.MR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. But -- but that was the initial question that I -- that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking.But then he said, if it's not colorable on the face of the complaint, what happens then? But I don't think it makes a practical difference.QUESTION: Well, that's my -- my hypothetical. It's 3 percent and the Federal law clearly says anything under 5 percent is not usurious. What happens with that case?￼know --MR. ROBERTS: The critical -- you have toQUESTION: I've given you all the facts.MR. ROBERTS: There still -- there still could be a colorable claim under --QUESTION: Well, is it a colorable claim or22Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425isn't it when it doesn't allege a --MR. ROBERTS: We don't know what the rate -- QUESTION: -- percentage rate that's usuriousunder Federal law?MR. ROBERTS: You don't know what the rate is,Your Honor, under Federal law without -- without more facts about the complaint because the National Bank Act provides the -- the possibility the national bank can charge any of three rates. But the --QUESTION: And one was a State rate.MR. ROBERTS: -- the fundamental -- the fundamental point is that -- that it's removable if there's jurisdiction in the original jurisdiction of the Federal court.QUESTION: Well, I still don't understand your answer. My -- my hypothesis is the Federal law says no cause of action unless it's over 5 percent. He pleads3 percent and he -- and he says this violates State law. He says that and the defendant comes in and says, well, there's no State law cause of action. It's a Federal claim. I want to remove it. Does the judge remove it or not?MR. ROBERTS: If -- if there is -- if the claim properly pleaded states a claim over which there's Federal jurisdiction, if it was pled as a claim under the National23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Bank Act --QUESTION: No, it's -- that is a matter of Statelaw in usury and --MR. ROBERTS: No.QUESTION: -- and you say there is no such animal. But then do you get to remove it or don't you? I don't understand your answer.QUESTION: I don't think there's authority to remove it, if --QUESTION: The answer is yes, isn't it? You can remove it.MR. ROBERTS: You can --QUESTION: He might be able to remove it because he doesn't have confidence in what the State judge will do.MR. ROBERTS: No -- no, Your Honor. You can remove it if there's -- if there's original -- would be original jurisdiction over the complaint. And that doesn't matter whether it's characterized as a -- as a complaint under State law, which doesn't -- doesn't exist because it's been entirely displaced, or if it's properly pled as a -- as a claim under Federal law. You could just as easily ask if they state the claim --QUESTION: I -- I still don't know whether you're telling me yes or no to my hypothetical.24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. ROBERTS: I'm telling you that if the -- if there's no colorable claim --QUESTION: Well, I've told you what the claim is. Is that colorable or not?MR. ROBERTS: Well --QUESTION: He says 3 percent. Federal law is 5 percent, and Alabama says I'll -- I'll do it on3 percent. Can he remove it or not? He -- I would think he could remove it and get it dismissed, but I'm not sure you agree with that.QUESTION: The question -- can I ask you a standard on this? I mean, I thought the standard is to ask this question. Is this -- i.e., the State claim -- the kind of claim in respect to which Congress intended the Federal action to be the exclusive substitute therefor? If the answer to that question is yes, you can remove it even if it doesn't state a Federal cause of action. Now, have I got it right what your argument is or not?MR. ROBERTS: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: Then the answer to Justice Stevens, if I have the right standard, would be yes, because Congress did intend the Federal cause of action to be an exclusive substitute for those State actions which allege that 3 percent is usurious.25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: How does this removal statute read? I mean --QUESTION: Is that right or not?MR. ROBERTS: The -- the removal statute gives the -- gives the -- the Federal courts -- gives the defendant the right to remove to a Federal forum any claim that arises under the laws of the United States --QUESTION: Arises under the law.MR. ROBERTS: -- and so -- so the question is whether it arises under, whether there's original jurisdiction in the Federal court.QUESTION: And could we please answer Justice Breyer's question?QUESTION: I want to know if I'm right or not -- MR. ROBERTS: Yes.QUESTION: -- because I'm not asking just tohear my standard. I'm asking --￼Yes.MR. ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.QUESTION: I'm right, okay, in your opinion. MR. ROBERTS: Yes, you're right.QUESTION: Okay.QUESTION: Okay, and by the same token, ifJustice Stevens' question had been asked about a subject that is not under the banking act or labor management26Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reporting or that part of ERISA which has been held to be complete preemption, I take it your answer would be that if a -- a claim was pleaded that omitted one element of the Federal cause of action in the State court, and you didn't start with the assumption that there was complete preemption for extraneous reasons, it wouldn't be removable.MR. ROBERTS: Yes. If there -- if I understand the hypothetical, it's not a situation where it arises under the exclusive cause of action for usury under the National Bank Act.QUESTION: Right. We don't start with the assumption of complete preemption. What he states is, in fact, a Federal claim but for one element. Is that removable?MR. ROBERTS: Yes.QUESTION: He leaves out an element.MR. ROBERTS: The Federal -- the Federal claimwould be removable to -- to Federal court, yes. QUESTION: But it's not a Federal claim. He'sleft out one element. Would that be removable? QUESTION: Answer yes or no, and then sit down. MR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, it'sremoval.Thank you.27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts. Mr. Clark, we'll hear from --ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN M. CLARK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Federal jurisdiction is necessarily limited jurisdiction. Federal removal jurisdiction is limited by statute to those cases that arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States. Plaintiffs have brought no cause of action on the face of the complaint that arises under the -- the Constitution or laws of the United States. As such, there's no Federal jurisdiction under long-held jurisdiction --QUESTION: Oh, but it's a claim of usurious interest charged by a national bank.MR. CLARK: It is a --QUESTION: So under the theory of the Government, that is a Federal claim.MR. CLARK: Under the theory of the Government, it -- the claim, as pled, is under Alabama Code section 8-8-1. And any interposition of Federal law at all is necessarily interposed by the defendant in this case. And under this Court's decisions in Gully, which was a National Bank Act case, Caterpillar, MetLife, Franchise28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Tax Board, the imposition of a Federal defense does not2 create --3 QUESTION: This is not a Federal defense, Mr. --4 Mr. Clark. This is like -- suppose you have a case in5 State court and the plaintiff says, we're both from the6 State of Alabama. Defendant removes it, says, I was7 from -- I am, was from Georgia. Now, doesn't the8 defendant have a right to remove that case even though9 plaintiff pled it as though it were a case that could be10 only in State court? Said we're both from --11 MR. CLARK: Are you talking about where the --12 wherethe--a--acomplaintispledby--byan--bya13 Georgia plaintiff against an Alabama corporation, it will14 be removed because --15 QUESTION: Plaintiff is from Alabama.16 MR. CLARK: -- because there's diversity?17 QUESTION: Plaintiff says defendant is from18 Alabama.19 MR. CLARK: Right.20 QUESTION: Defendant removes because defendant21 is, in fact, from Georgia.22 MR. CLARK: Right. Well, in that case you have23 a -- you have a -- you have factual inaccuracy in the24 pleading. In this case, we're not talking about their25 basis for removal is not some factual inaccuracy of the29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 pleading, it's that they're saying that your legal theory,2 plaintiff, which you, under the well-pleaded complaint3 rule are allowed to choose your own legal theories, you've4 decided to travel on the Alabama statute --5 QUESTION: You're not allowed to choose a theory6 that doesn't exist.7 MR. CLARK: Well --8 QUESTION: The notion is that there simply is no9 claim under State law for usury against a national bank.10 It doesn't exist. No such claim. If the plaintiff chose11 to stand on such a claim, it would have to be dismissed12 because the only exclusive claim for relief -- although it13 can be brought in State or Federal court, the exclusive14 claim is one under Federal law. That's the argument here.15 MR. CLARK: The argument that they are making is16 that there's no claim is -- is misstating. There is a17 claim.18 What -- what Your Honor is discussing is the19 principle of ordinary preemption. Whether or not that20 Alabama State law claim may proceed is a question of21 ordinary preemption as to be -- to be distinguished from22 complete preemption. And the Court held in -- in23 Caterpillar that -- that a case may not be removed on a24 Federal defense, including the defense of preemption, even25 if the defense is anticipated by both parties.30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Of course. And there's one case -- I2 was surprised you didn't cite it in your brief. It's3 very -- makes that point very nicely. The Rivet case4 against Regions Bank, which was featured on the other5 side -- you didn't mention it at all in your brief.6 MR. CLARK: That's an ordinary -- ordinary7 preemption case -- case also.QUESTION: That -- that distinguishes between a relief and a defense. And that case involved a89 claim for10 defense.11 121314 have in this case, a mere defense in this case. And --15 QUESTION: Because?16 QUESTION: Do you -- do you disagree that17 section 86 of the National Bank Act provides the sole18 source of the cause of action?19 MR. CLARK: It does not provide the sole source20 of the cause of action that the plaintiffs have pled in21 this case, and that's the difference here is -- is the22 source of sort of organic law as to where the -- where the23 complaint comes from.24 Assume there were -- the defendants never25 brought up this -- this claim or this defense of FederalMR. CLARK: Right, and --QUESTION: The defense of preclusion.MR. CLARK: Right, and that's exactly what they￼31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 preemption. The Alabama case would -- the Alabama usury2 claim would go forward under Alabama law and would be3 decided under Alabama law. So it's important to -- to see4 the distinction between -- between what's being -- what's5 being pled and a defense to what's being pled.6 Now, as -- as was stated --7 QUESTION: Wait. Don't leave that point because8 you're -- you win if you're right on that. I mean, you9 win if your particular claim is not preempted by this10 Federal statute, you win -- and they admit it -- if this11 particular Federal statute is not intended by Congress to12 be the exclusive vehicle for bringing the kind of claim13 that you have brought. So now, explain to me. You just14 said it isn't. Why isn't it?15 MR. CLARK: Why isn't -- Your Honor, why16 isn't -- why isn't the -- the cause of action we've17 brought --18 QUESTION: Why, in your opinion, is the State19 cause of action that you brought -- you say it is not true20 that Congress intended the Federal cause of action as the￼21 exclusive 22232425 saying itvehicle, excluding your kind of claim.MR. CLARK: Well --QUESTION: They say it did. You say it didn't. Now, all I want to hear is your arguments for didn't because they pointed to a lot of Federal32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cases going back to 1886 which say usury claims are to be brought under the Federal statute. The State power in respect to a national bank has no power. Okay? Now, your reply to that is what?MR. CLARK: As this Court stated in the Caterpillar case under note 4, the question of the breadth of the --QUESTION: I don't see what Caterpillar couldpossibly have to do with it MR. CLARK: Well,breadth --QUESTION: Is it?to tell me about banking law. MR. CLARK: Right.QUESTION: I want to know is it the case in your view -- you concede it. You seem to contest it. I'll repeat it for the third time.Is it the case that this Federal cause of action is intended by Congress as the exclusive vehicle excluding your State cause of action under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution?MR. CLARK: Under Supremacy Clause -- QUESTION: Is the answer to my question yes or33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005since it isn't a bank case. but the question of thethe remedy provided -- QUESTION: I'm not asking you that. I asked youMR. CLARK: -- of￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425no?MR. CLARK: That is -- yes, that is what those cases hold. However --QUESTION: Okay. Well, then --MR. CLARK: -- however --QUESTION: -- then you can't make the argumentyou just made.MR. CLARK: However, the question of whether ornot a claim is preempted ordinarily is a -- a wholly different question from whether or not there's jurisdiction in the Federal courts.QUESTION: All right. You -- you really want -- you conceded you have no State claim. It's preempted by the Federal statutes. Is that right? Is that what you're conceding?MR. CLARK: We -- it appears that there is no -- there is no State claim on the usury.QUESTION: All right. There is no State claim. So then the question in this case is even though you concede, as I take it you have -- I don't know if you really mean to.(Laughter.)QUESTION: But -- but I take it you just did concede that the Federal cause of action is the only possible cause of action that your client could have.34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CLARK: Well, if the -- if my client -- if we decided to travel under the Federal cause of action -- and what this goes back to is the well-pleaded complaint rule. Plaintiffs in -- in cases are allowed to choose their remedies. And in this case the plaintiffs chose a remedy under the Alabama usury statute, be --QUESTION: The problem with it is your complaint isn't well-pleaded if the only source of law is Federal, which you conceded on your brief and again here. There is no well-pleaded Alabama claim because the Alabama claim or the State law claim doesn't exist. The only claim that exists against a national bank for usury is a Federal claim.MR. CLARK: Well, and again, that is adefense -- the claim -- as the Court said in MetLife, the touchstone is not whether or not preemption is obvious, but the question is whether or not that creates removal jurisdiction.QUESTION: No, but the -- the --MR. CLARK: And that has to appear from the face of the complaint.QUESTION: But I --QUESTION: But the face of a well-pleaded complaint. And there's a difference between preemption as a defense to a claim that is well pleaded and here where35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you have badly pleaded a complaint that can arise only under Federal law that simply can't arise under State law.MR. CLARK: The problem with that test is it's not a -- it's not a test. It adds another layer of -- of litigation to -- to almost any claim. And what you're going to have is, instead of following a well-pleaded complaint rule that for years has served this Court, you're going to have all manner of State law causes of action all of the sudden removed and then you're going to have this litigation over -- over, well, does it state a cognizable cause of action under -- under State law or is it part of --QUESTION: We have one simple question. Has Congress provided for exclusive Federal law to govern this claim? That's not a complicated question.MR. CLARK: Congress has not provided for exclusive Federal cause of action to govern an Alabama usury claim.QUESTION: So then you are not conceding --QUESTION: Then you just withdrew your concession.(Laughter.)QUESTION: -- complete preemption as opposed to ordinary preemption.MR. CLARK: As a matter of ordinary preemption,36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and maybe --QUESTION: You're conceding ordinary preemption,but not complete preemption.MR. CLARK: Exactly. And if I -- if Imisunderstood the question, then I misunderstood the question.QUESTION: I'm sorry. It probably was --MR. CLARK: As a matter of ordinary preemption, it may very well be that -- that --QUESTION: Congress --MR. CLARK: -- the State Law claim and Congress -- and Congress intended that.QUESTION: Let him finish answering the question that somebody else asked.QUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry.MR. CLARK: But as a matter of complete preemption, under -- under what I was saying in the MetLife and the Caterpillar case, those do not jurisdiction make. In the Gully -- Gully case itself, it said a suit brought upon a State statute dues not arise under an act of Congress because prohibited thereby.That is exactly the situation that we have here. We have a State law cause of action. We have the defendant interposing a defense saying, your State law cause of action is prohibited by that -- by that -- by the37Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Federal act, and now we want to create removal jurisdiction because of that.It's interesting. This Court has alwaysfound --QUESTION: Mr. Clark, I'm -- can we go backto -- you just cited Gully and maybe I have it wrong, but I thought that that was a suit to collect a State tax under State law.MR. CLARK: Yes.QUESTION: That the source of law that was applied to the private actor was State law, the State tax.MR. CLARK: Yes.QUESTION: And here, the source of law that would be applied is Federal law, not State law.MR. CLARK: The -- the source of law pled in the complaint is Alabama State law. Now, the fact that it may be ordinary -- ordinarily preempted is something that -- that the defendants can raise and the State courts can decide. And the State courts have often -- often decided matters of Federal preemption.QUESTION: I just --QUESTION: May I ask -- may I ask this one question? It seems to me there's a slight difference in the text of section 85 and 86. And section 85 reads as a defense, and if that's all there were here, I would38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425understand your argument completely.But I think one can read section 86 as creatingan affirmative Federal cause of action, and one can argue that that's the only cause of action that can be prosecuted. Now, if that's true, would there not be -- would it not -- not -- would you not have to say then that the affirmative remedy in -- under the Federal statute is exclusive?MR. CLARK: Well, in -- in -- there are many Federal statutes that would run concurrently with State regulation of -- of business. And if -- if the question is, is the fact that there's a Federal remedy provided, in addition to the State remedy -- does that provide -- provide removal jurisdiction, the answer would be -- would be no to that question.QUESTION: It's not only that there's a Federal remedy provided, but it's been construed to be the exclusive remedy.MR. CLARK: Right.QUESTION: That those are the only remedies that one can get.MR. CLARK: But again, I would --QUESTION: Doesn't that distinguish it from some of these other hypothetical cases?MR. CLARK: Well, again, I would go back to this39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court's concept of federalism wherein the -- the State courts are allowed to make that call. And in Avco, which established the -- this platypus of -- of field preemption or complete preemption is very limited to -- to those actions construing the collective -- collective bargaining agreements. And then it was reluctantly extended by this Court in the Metropolitan Life and Taylor cases, and --QUESTION: Well, the argument of the Government is that this is another one of those rare cases. That's their whole point.MR. CLARK: But if this --QUESTION: And if it is, then you're just wrong about it being only a defensive maneuver.MR. CLARK: This -- if this is another case, it is a wholly separate and -- and distinguished -- distinct way to go because the National Bank Act carries with it none of the indicia of the intent of Congress to completely preempt that the LMRA does.QUESTION: But it's been interpreted by a number of cases to have precisely that effect.MR. CLARK: To have ordinary preemptive effect,which --QUESTION: No. No. That was not the interpretation. You want us to overrule earlier cases about --40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CLARK: Absolutely not.2 QUESTION: -- the meaning of the National Bank3 Act?4 MR. CLARK: No.5 But in the -- in the LMRA context, you have6 specific jurisdictional grant to the district courts of7 the United States. Then when ERISA came along, with8 Taylor you have -- you have specific legislative history9 saying that this is to be interpreted under the Avco rule,10 which is to -- which is to -- to have a body of Federal11 law deciding all cases, no matter where brought, under --12 under ERISA or deciding all cases under collective13 bargaining.14 In this case, there's no -- in National Bank15 Act, there's no -- there is no body of Federal law that16 could ever arise, and it's because the nature of the17 National Bank Act is really more of a hierarchy of State18 laws. It says, National Bank Act, you can -- you can19 charge either the interest rate in the State in which the20 claim is brought, you can charge the interest rate in the21 State in which the bank is located, or you can charge --22 and there's a default Federal interest rate. So what23 you're going to have here is sort of a patchwork of State24 law decisions concerning the State -- State law of25 Delaware versus Alabama versus Kentucky versus Michigan.41Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: I'm still trying to get back to my --2 I'm beginning to see what I think your answer is, but3 please don't agree with me if you really disagree.45 question,6 question,789 right here, but wait.All right. First, if I were to ask theis there Federal law in the area? Yes. Ask the does Federal law preempt State law? Yes.MR. CLARK: Ordinarily.QUESTION: Yes, here. Yes, well, you'll say10 So you -- if I ask this question, is this11 State -- Federal cause of action -- did Congress intend it12 to preempt a State cause of action substituting the13 Federal cause of action therefor? I think now you're14 prepared to say the answer to this question is yes.15 MR. CLARK: Ordinarily preempt.16 QUESTION: But you will answer the following17 question no. Is there an intent here by Congress that18 this Federal cause of action that preempts the State cause19 of action by substituting an exclusive Federal remedy --20 is there an intent of Congress to allow removal when it's21 pleaded? The answer is we have no evidence of that.22 MR. CLARK: The answer to that question is no.23 QUESTION: And what they're saying on their24 side -- and now this is exactly the issue between them and25 the lower courts. And indeed, there's language that's42Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 unclear in the lower cases -- is that we need evidence of2 that latter point. That's what you're saying. And3 they're saying no.4 MR. CLARK: Well --5 QUESTION: They're saying, look, all you have to6 have are the first three things I mentioned. Stop after7 you decide that Congress has created a Federal action with8 the intent that it provide an exclusive substitute for9 this State action. Stop there. Don't ask for any further10 evidence of anything. One, because you'll never get it.11 Congress never thinks of this sort of esoteric issue. And12 second, because there's just no reason.13 Now, okay. Now I get the -- the clash, and now14 I can get the answer.15 MR. CLARK: I'm sorry if I -- I misunderstood16 your question before.17 QUESTION: No, no. It's my fault. I didn't get18 it.19 MR. CLARK: And in fact, in the -- in Justice20 Brennan's concurring opinion in the MetLife/Taylor case,21 he said, you know, that -- that congressional intent is22 the touchstone here, and that this Court would be well23 served not to infer removal jurisdiction unless there is24 some clear evidence of congressional intent to do so like25 in an ERISA case or like in the LMRA case.43Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Mr. Clark, I should perhaps have2 asked this question of the other side, but they're not3 going to have a lot of time left when they get back up.4 I assume that it -- it is a given that merely5 setting forth all of the elements of a Federal cause of6 action in a complaint is not enough to provoke removal.7 That is to say, if there is both a Federal cause of action8 and a State cause of action which has the same elements,9 if you plead those elements, which would constitute a10 Federal cause of action, but you protest that you are not11 asserting a Federal cause of action, you are only12 asserting a State cause of action, that would not be13 removable. Would it?14 MR. CLARK: No, it would not be. And that --15 QUESTION: Okay. So we're -- we're talking16 about a -- a distinctive rule here that where you set17 forth the elements of a -- of a cause of action that you18 do not assert to be a Federal cause of action, we are19 going to allow it to be removed nonetheless. Right?20 MR. CLARK: If -- if what the defendants are21 arguing, it would be a new rule. And it -- it is a22 departure from --23 QUESTION: But may I understand this further24 point? What Justice Scalia's described seems to me quite25 common. You have State human rights laws. You have44Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Federal human rights laws. The same facts that I was2 discriminated against. If I make my choice that I want to3 bring it under, say, New York law rather than Title VII,4 that's my prerogative. And the defendant certainly can't5 remove that case by saying, well, you could have pleaded6 those same facts as a Title VII case. Quite different.7 That's where there's concurrent lawmaking authority, both8 State and Federal.9 Here the argument is there is no State lawmaking10 authority. There is no parallel source of law, State and11 Federal, and that's what makes it different from the12 ordinary case where you plead the facts and they would13 state a claim under either State law or Federal law. The14 pleader has her choice.15 MR. CLARK: There -- there is concurrent16 lawmaking authority. However, because of the Supremacy17 Clause, the courts have held that -- that there is18 ordinary preemption in this case. But that does not19 answer the question whether or not should -- there should20 be removal jurisdiction in the case.21 And it's -- in other words, the Alabama22 legislature certainly has the right to make -- make law23 regulating Federal banks. In fact, this Court decided way24 back in 1870 that national banks are subject to State law25 regulation. And in fact, the quote from the case45Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 something2 regulated34 question of how you characterize this, but I think you5 agree that on the question of usury, the Federallike in their daily activities, they'remuch more under --QUESTION: But not usury. I mean, you -- it's a6 legislation is conclusive and it was done, indeed, for the7 very purpose of having national banks escape from whatever8 jealous, mean legislation the State might pass.9 So the only law -- I mean, the choice would be10 if you want to say, yes, I want to stick with Alabama law,11 no Federal 85, 86 for me, that case must get dismissed.12 You can't get past the door because there is no such13 claim.14 MR. CLARK: If -- if the preemption, ordinary15 preemption, is -- is applied, it -- it would -- applied as16 it has been, it would be dismissed.17 However, that is a wholly separate question from18 whether the case arises under Federal jurisdiction. It is19 a question of ordinary preemption that the State courts --￼QUESTION: Why would a plaintiff want to bring that inevitably must be dismissed?MR. CLARK: Well, and -- plaintiffs have reasons for pleading the things they do.

And I think in answer to the5 question over there, is why -- why go that extra step?6 Well, because this Court has decided in MetLife that that7 extra step is necessary to stop this slippery slope down8 where every case that is removed out of a State court, you9 now have this other layer of -- of litigation over, well,10 is there another cause of action and -- and perhaps that11 we have to find some -- we have to litigate over whether12 it's an exclusive cause of action.13 And the answer to that is this Court has14 provided, for right or for wrong, since 1887 that we15 follow the well-pleaded complaint rule and it follows the16 language in the -- at the end of the Gully opinion saying17 that what you need is a clear bright line limitation. And18 only where we find some clear congressional intent, such19 as in the LMRA situation, such as in the ERISA situation,20 do we make this extreme and extraordinary grant of field21 preemption or complete preemption or whole preemption.￼2223 down. 2425If there are no further questions, I will sitQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clark.Mr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.47Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the answer to your question is yes, if there are --QUESTION: What was my question?(Laughter.)MR. WAXMAN: Your question was if -- if you --you said this would take time, and it will. You pleaded all the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it also -- it also satisfies a State cause of action. If the Federal cause of action is not exclusive except in that rare instance, it is not removable.Justice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop at point 3. That is, you determine whether or not this is the rare instance in which there's not only substantive preemption but exclusive Federal remedies. And the reason you stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction. It says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction, and therefore, the question is, does the complaint well-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action? Justice Holmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and, if it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court indicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action. If the cause of action is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's48Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 under arising-under jurisdiction.2 Justice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the3 most difficult question in this Court's sometimes not4 fully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the5 question that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in6 particular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in7 Merrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action8 misrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a9 necessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law10 was or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise11 under Federal jurisdiction?12 In Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated13 dicta that suggests that the answer is yes. And in Smith14 versus Kansas City Title and Trust, this -- this Court15 seemed to indicate yes. But in Moore versus Chesapeake --16 the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that17 the embedded Federal question has to be central to the18 State cause of action and really important.19 And the result, as I -- as I think things stand20 now, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's21 opinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have22 difficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but23 in the Merrell Dow context, where there was a State tort24 claim that could -- may I finish my --25 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.49Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼50Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005
