Albert Hawkins. Ms. Zinn.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN F. ZINN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMS. ZINN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Sovereign immunity should not bar enforcement of the consent decree in this case for two reasons.First, when State officials ask a district court to enter a consent decree, they submit their rights concerning the decree for judicial determination, thereby waiving any possible claim for objection on the basis of immunity.Second, the decree in this case provides prospective relief to protect the supremacy of Federal law, exactly as envisioned by Ex Parte Young.QUESTION: May I ask on -- on the first point? You say when State officials submit to -- to a decree. It's -- it's immaterial, as far as you're concerned, whether the State Attorney General defended the -- the suit or represented these officials. Is that right?MS. ZINN: No, it's not immaterial. The --3ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Texas' Attorney General is authorized by the legislature2 to represent the State and its employees --3 QUESTION: No. I understand that, but suppose4 he hadn't been and suppose it is just the State officials5 who appeared in an Ex Parte Young suit. They're --6 they're sued. There's no other State official who takes7 part in the proceedings. Nonetheless, they enter into a8 consent decree. Is it your submission that even without9 any other participation by anybody else in the State, that10 consent decree binds not just them, but I gather you say11 future officials in -- in their offices? Right?12 MS. ZINN: Unrepresented by the State Attorney13 General.14 QUESTION: Unrepresented. You would --15 QUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -- wouldn't there16 be a question of fact in that case? I mean, it would be17 odd, I -- I would suppose not to have the State Attorney18 General there, and -- and wouldn't the -- if I were a19 trial judge, I'd say, well, is this the State that is20 submitting this -- this settlement? I mean, wouldn't --21 wouldn't there be, theoretically at least, a fact question22 in Justice Scalia's circumstances?23 MS. ZINN: Fact and a matter of law, Your Honor.24 The question under this Court's decision recently in25 Lapides would be whether those officials are authorized to4ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 represent the State in court, even absent their attorney.2 That would be so unusual in Texas I can't imagine it even3 happening, but --4 QUESTION: No, but that -- but that's a waiver5 theory. I mean, if you're proceeding on a waiver theory,6 you -- you need the State there.7 But let's assume you're not proceeding on the8 waiver theory. You have the second ground, which is just9 if you have authority to enter the decree, you have10 authority to enforce the decree. Now, for purpose of that11 argument, does it make any difference to you whether the12 State Attorney General is there or whether these officials13 have the power to represent the State?14 MS. ZINN: Under our second argument, our15 position is that since the decree is a remedy ordered in a16 valid Ex Parte Young case, it provides prospective relief17 only from alleged ongoing violations of Federal law. The18 -- the remedy is proper.19 QUESTION: And therefore it's consistent with20 the Eleventh Amendment without any waiver.21 MS. ZINN: Correct. The Eleventh Amendment is22 not engaged for that -- for that --23 QUESTION: Can you tell us how it worked? The24 representative of the Attorney General was in court and he25 stands up and he says, we insist on sovereign immunity,5ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 and the judge say, all right, that's act one. It's2 closed. And then did the same officials stay and they3 say, well, now we're here on the Eleventh Amendment? I4 mean, how -- how did this work? And --5 MS. ZINN: In -- in this case --6 QUESTION: And let -- let me just say also7 there's no excerpt of record or docket entry. The only8 thing I have is the consent decree. Was there any order9 saying the consent decree dated so and so is hereby10 entered as the judgment of the court? I mean, can I find11 that anywhere?12 MS. ZINN: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the lodging13 has the -- as its last page, the order to correct the14 consent decree which states that the -- the order was --15 the unopposed motion to -- to correct the consent decree16 has merit and should be granted. The decree was entered17 as the court's order in February of 1996.￼181920 just this2122232425 you can tell me who the -- was there an act one and an actQUESTION: And --QUESTION: There was no separate order. It was consent decree that's in the lodging. That's -- MS. ZINN: That's correct.QUESTION: -- that's it.MS. ZINN: That's correct.QUESTION: Okay. Now maybe we can go back and6ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 two, act one being the State asserts immunity, act two2 being the Eleventh Amendment, or -- or were the same3 parties before the court at all times?456 different 78 Court for9 agencies which were dismissed early on.MS. ZINN: The same parties --QUESTION: Wearing different -- wearinghats or proceeding under some different theory. MS. ZINN: The same parties were before the the entire case with the exception of two State10 QUESTION: Right.11 QUESTION: That's the puzzle in this case. The12 State as State was dismissed at the threshold, and then we13 have an Ex Parte Young case. And now we're talking about14 Eleventh Amendment immunity again. So the State is out of15 the case. It's proceeding as an Ex Parte Young case. How16 did it then become converted back into a case against the17 State so that we're talking about whether the State waived18 its immunity?19 MS. ZINN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our position,20 as well recognized apparently, is that this is an Ex Parte21 Young case. However, the State officials in their22 briefing have urged that that is not correct and that this23 -- this, at least in part, is not a valid order under Ex24 Parte Young.25 QUESTION: The State, if -- if I remember7ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425correctly, came before the judge and urged the approval of this consent decree.MS. ZINN: Correct.QUESTION: Did it not? And there were -- there were several representatives of the State who so testified.MS. ZINN: Correct, and they were unanimous. The -- all of the State officials and their lawyer were unanimous in requesting the district court to enter the consent decree.QUESTION: That -- that's your waiver. That's the waiver side of your argument.MS. ZINN: Correct.QUESTION: I frankly am reluctant to -- to decide the case on that ground if another ground is available simply because that would require a case-by-case investigation as to -- to what extent the participation by -- by other State officials existed, whether they were authorized to participate and so forth and so on. Whereas, your other ground doesn't require that -- that case-by-case investigation, and wouldn't that be a -- a much clearer line to -- to establish?MS. ZINN: In our -- in our view both positions are clear in this case. The -- the --QUESTION: You have to make sure that the State8ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Attorney General was authorized to represent the State in this case or whatever other official you say committed the waiver. That would -- that would be a factual investigation in every case, wouldn't it?MS. ZINN: No. In Lapides, it appeared to -- to be a question of law. The issue --QUESTION: No, but Justice Scalia's question didn't go to waiver. It went to representation. And Lapides says, if you can represent, you can waive. But there would be a question of representation, wouldn't there?MS. ZINN: But in Lapides, it appeared to me that that was resolved fairly simply based on the application of Federal law to the State --QUESTION: Once -- once it was understood that he could represent.MS. ZINN: Yes, which was determined by an examination of the State statutes involved. And the Texas law on that point is almost word for word the same as the -- the Georgia constitutional provisions --QUESTION: Oh, sure. Easy. I mean, I'm -- I'm not saying that this would be a difficult case, but you would have to, I suppose, make that inquiry.MS. ZINN: But --QUESTION: This case might not be difficult, but9ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 I -- I don't like going rummaging around in State law. I2 find Federal law hard enough.3 (Laughter.)4 MS. ZINN: I do too, Your Honor.5 QUESTION: Ms. Zinn, I thought that you said in6 response to my question that this -- this waiver -- that's7 not your preferred ground. You said you're arguing it8 because the State insisted that this was Eleventh9 Amendment and it wasn't waived. But your -- you brought10 an Ex Parte Young suit. You've got a consent decree under11 that heading, and -- and that argument, if it prevails,12 would be -- one would not need to reach the question of13 the Eleventh Amendment in the --.14 MS. ZINN: That's correct. The -- one way to15 look at this is that given the Texas Attorney General's16 argument that this is not an Ex Parte Young case, not a17 valid order under Ex Parte Young, to the extent that the18 Court agrees with that, those points have been waived19 because by asking the district court to enter the consent20 decree, the State officials submitted their rights21 concerning the decree for judicial determination. And by22 doing that --23 QUESTION: Let's put -- put it this way. Are24 you saying that if the State officials negotiate a consent25 decree that goes beyond the Eleventh Amendment -- or that10ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 goes beyond -- pardon me -- that goes beyond Ex Parte2 Young's --345 waiver? 678 without a 91011 immunity at the beginning.12 MS. ZINN: Because13 traditional rules concerning14 disputed injunction need not15 provisions of law for the --16 QUESTION: So you want us to write an opinion17 that says after the State has specifically asserted its18 Eleventh Amendment immunity, its officials may negotiate a19 consent decree which goes beyond the boundaries of20 jurisdiction set forth in -- in Ex Parte Young without21 waiver.22 MS. ZINN: The question of the scope of remedy23 is a different question from the Eleventh Amendment/Ex24 Parte Young question. The Ex Parte Young question is a25 jurisdictional question, but the question of the scope of11ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MS. ZINN: Yes.QUESTION: -- rules, that then there must be aMS. ZINN: No.QUESTION: All right. How can they do that waiver?MS. ZINN: Well --QUESTION: Especially if they've asserted theirunder this Court's equitable decrees, even a be specifically tied to the￼1 proper remedy --2 QUESTION: Well -- well, you introduced the3 point of remedy. That wasn't part of my question. My --4 my question was whether or not, having asserted the5 immunity in a -- in -- under the assumption that the6 immunity has not been waived, the State officials can7 negotiate a consent decree that goes beyond the usual8 rules of Ex Parte Young, it goes beyond the authority9 granted to the courts under Ex Parte Young, without10 relying on the theory of waiver.11 MS. ZINN: For example, damages? Would that fit12 within your hypothetical? Because in that case without13 waiver, no.14 QUESTION: You -- you really can't tell until15 the decree is entered whether or not it complies with Ex16 Parte Young, I would think, because it isn't necessarily17 fought out on the -- in the -- in the trial of the case18 exactly what the remedy will be.19 MS. ZINN: The -- the validity of consent decree20 should be -- as in an Ex Parte Young case, should be21 measured under this -- this Court's decisions, for22 example, in Milliken and Rufo. Milliken says that the23 remedy must tend to or to remedy the violation proven.24 And Rufo says that when you have a consent decree, it may25 aim even higher than that. Because in the course of --12ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But maybe -- maybe there should be a2 special rule for Ex Parte Young cases. In the ordinary3 case, going beyond the mere violation does not offend any4 other provision of the Constitution, but the argument here5 is, oh, once you go beyond holding the officer to6 compliance with Federal law, once you go beyond that,7 you're out of Ex Parte Young and you're moving against the8 State and the Eleventh Amendment is a bar. So maybe9 there's a special rule with regard to remediation in -- in10 Ex Parte Young cases.11 MS. ZINN: Milliken involved a State official,12 and it's one of the key cases about the scope of disputed13 injunctions. And it says that remedial orders may go14 beyond the exact scope, the precise scope of the violation15 at issue.16 QUESTION: Is this outside of Ex Parte Young? I17 -- I mean, the way I was thinking about it, which might18 not be right, is that what you were saying in the second19 part of your argument is that Ex Parte Young permits,20 without the consent of a State, an individual to sue a21 State official in his official capacity, asking for an22 injunction on the ground that the official has violated23 Federal law. That's what Ex Parte Young says.24 MS. ZINN: Correct.25 QUESTION: And now you get that injunction, and13ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that injunction contains provisions that aren't all about2 Federal law. Some of them are about related State law.3 And I thought perhaps the way to look at it was, and that4 injunction does not violate the Eighth -- the Eleventh5 Amendment. You don't need a State to give consent because6 it's all part of an effort to cure the Federal violation7 with related matters thrown in.8 MS. ZINN: Correct.9 QUESTION: Ex Parte Young authorizes such a10 thing.11 MS. ZINN: Correct.12 QUESTION: Now, is that last statement right?13 MS. ZINN: Yes.14 QUESTION: So then it's not outside Ex Parte15 Young. You're giving us an interpretation of what Ex16 Parte Young means.17 MS. ZINN: Yes.18 QUESTION: And what is your authority for saying19 that Ex Parte Young validates the going beyond the Federal20 issues involved? You mentioned Milliken. Is that -- is21 that authority for that?22 MS. ZINN: Milliken. Hutto v. Finney would be23 another example. A district court need not sit back and24 hope that the State officials will comply with its proper25 remedial order. It can enforce that order.14ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, I'm not talking so much about2 enforcement as about entering it in the first place3 consistently with Ex Parte Young.4 MS. ZINN: Well, this Court's decision in5 Firefighters generally sets out standards for entry of a6 consent decree, and a decree is properly entered, as this7 one was found to be, if it furthers -- if it serves to8 resolve a dispute within the court's subject matter9 jurisdiction, which is the case here -- this is a Federal10 question about the Medicaid Act -- if it is generally11 within the scope of the pleadings, which is true in this12 case, and if the remedy in the decree serves to further13 the objectives of the -- in this case, the Medicaid Act,14 which is true about all of the provisions of the decree in15 this case.16 QUESTION: So you're really saying that it17 doesn't go beyond Ex Parte Young. I mean, the -- the18 premises of some of the arguments here that it does go19 beyond it, in your judgment, is -- is in fact a false20 premise.21 MS. ZINN: That's correct. Our position is that22 the district court could have entered this -- this decree23 as a disputed injunction if the State officials had not24 decided to consent.25 QUESTION: When you had --15ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Would you help -- excuse me. May I2 ask one more question?3 Would you help me on one thing? My4 understanding was -- and I -- I may simply be wrong on5 this. My understanding was that the claim that this went6 beyond Young was not a claim that it -- it mandated State7 law -- or mandated the performance of State law8 obligations, but that it went further than it had to to9 enjoin the Federal violation by getting into details about10 what the State officers had to do or had to refrain from11 do -- from doing. Am I correct that it's -- it's not --12 the claim is not that it got into State law but that it13 simply went beyond the scope of a proper remedial order14 under the Federal law? Is that correct?15 MS. ZINN: Well, I'd hate to put words into Mr.16 Cruz's mouth.￼171819 claim. 202122232425QUESTION: I know. I should be asking --MS. ZINN: But I believe that is part of theirQUESTION: Okay.MS. ZINN: May I reserve the rest of my time? QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Zinn.Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN,ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,16ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS2 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and3 please the Court:4 Enforcement of the decree in this case5 violate the Eleventh Amendment for two reasons.6 any Eleventh Amendment objection was waived, and7 enforcement is permissible under Ex Parte Young.8 Now, the waiver issue arises in this case9 because the State officials are arguing that the relief in10 the consent decree that is directed to them violates the11 Eleventh Amendment, and it is that Eleventh Amendment12 objection that those same officials, together with the13 Attorney General, waived when they asked the district14 court to enter the very relief that they are now objecting15 to on Eleventh Amendment grounds.16 And the reason that there is waiver is that17 under this Court's cases, when the Attorney General on the18 -- of the State on behalf of the State invokes a Federal19 court's jurisdiction, Eleventh Amendment immunity is20 waived. Now, when the Attorney General in this case21 entered into a consent decree on behalf of State officials22 in their official capacity and then asked the district23 court to enter that decree, he clearly invoked that24 court's jurisdiction and waived any Eleventh Amendment25 objection to the entry of that judgment against those17ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005may itdoes not First, second,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425State officials.QUESTION: Suppose the Attorney General had notbeen involved and simply the State officials on their own entered into this consent decree.MR. GORNSTEIN: First of all, you would have the question of waiver, and that is answered by the inquiry that Lapides and other waiver cases have -- have instructed, which is do those -- are those officials authorized by State law to conduct litigation on behalf of the State.QUESTION: So that would be a factual inquiry in every case whether the particular official --MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I would say -- I would say it's a legal question --QUESTION: I understand.MR. GORNSTEIN: -- that typically in almost every State, Justice Scalia, it would be the Attorney General who is authorized to represent the State in litigation.QUESTION: Well, Justice Scalia can preserve his own hypothetical.MR. GORNSTEIN: Right.QUESTION: But suppose that there was -- that the officials did not have the authority to waive the Eleventh Amendment, but they did enter into a consent18ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 decree.2 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Then you get to the second3 argument in this case which is an Ex Parte Young argument,4 and the Ex Parte Young issue is that the consent decree in5 this case is permissible under Ex Parte Young because it6 provides prospective relief against State officials based7 on the Federal Medicaid statute. And those are the three8 requirements of an Ex Parte Young suit, that it be --9 QUESTION: This -- this carries you so far10 beyond the theory of Ex Parte Young, and the theory of Ex11 Parte Young is you're not impinging upon State sovereign12 immunity when you are simply requiring State officials to13 adhere to State law. They are acting ultra vires when14 they're -- when they're violating Federal law, and15 therefore, you're not impinging upon the State's sovereign16 immunity.17 But now with the theory that you're expounding,18 you're not only holding them to compliance with Federal19 law, but you're saying even when you're not acting ultra20 vires, when you have a lot of perfectly legal options of21 how to comply with Federal law, you will -- you will22 choose this option. And that -- that is, it seems to me,23 impinging upon State sovereign immunity in -- in a way24 that -- that the mere theory of Ex Parte Young does not25 justify.19ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GORNSTEIN: In an Ex Parte Young action,2 State officials like all other Federal litigants are free3 to enter into consent decrees that go beyond what is4 strictly required by Federal law on one or more issues5 because there is a tradeoff. They then get less relief or6 no relief on other issues that they may care about. So7 this is a system that benefits Federal court litigants8 generally, and it is also one that benefits the State and9 its State officials.10 QUESTION: I'm not worried about the officials.11 Yes, the officials get a good deal. They -- they get of12 the suit. They get a -- a decree. But what about the13 State who on our -- on our current hypothesis, the State14 is out of the proceeding. The Attorney General is not15 there and here are these State officers who are giving16 away a whole lot of -- of options that the State has, and17 they're -- they're saying, yes, bind the State even though18 the suit is just against me.19 MR. GORNSTEIN: First of all, we -- we presume20 -- this Court presumes that State officials, when they act21 in their official capacity, are acting in good faith to￼22 implement 2324 officials 25the best interests of the State.Second of all, the State does benefit when its can enter into decrees that --QUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, is -- is taking the20ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 Attorney General out of it kind of a hypothetical2 question? Do you know of any institutional decree,3 whether it involves schools, prisons, the Medicaid program4 which the State Attorney General isn't there?5 MR. GORNSTEIN: I don't know of any such case,6 and as I was telling Justice Scalia before, all the7 Court's waiver cases up until now have been ones in which8 the Attorney General has represented the State and has9 waived the -- has -- has been authorized by the State to10 represent the State's interests in litigation.11 QUESTION: Might be improper for -- for the --12 for the trial court to go beyond strict compliance with13 Federal law, to -- to approve a consent decree that goes14 beyond that without the presence of the -- I mean, maybe15 waiver is a necessary concomitant of -- of the theory of16 Ex Parte Young that you're giving us.17 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I don't think it -- it is a18 necessary -- waiver is not a necessary concomitant because19 it is a component of an Ex Parte Young case. This Court20 said, for example, in the Rufo case that State -- it had21 no doubt that State and local officials, in order to22 resolve litigation, could agree to relief that goes beyond23 what's required by Federal law.24 QUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, I want to clarify what25 you mean in your argument when you say go beyond. There21ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are -- and here are two possibilities.One, you throw in an entirely new obligation,and you say, you know, by the way, we'll -- we'll also agree to a program of pediatric podiatry, which isn't covered by the statute. We'll do that too just to show you how good our faith is.A second possibility is we'll show you how we will implement our agreement to abide by what we understand to be Federal law. We will throw in a how-to- do-it or a how-we-are-going-to-do-it clause.I understand your argument, when you refer to going beyond the letter of Federal law and agreeing to that in a settlement, to refer to a how-to-do-it kind of agreement as opposed to a new substantive obligation agreement. I assume. Is that correct?￼further.MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, but let -- let me explainQUESTION: I guess my question is --MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes.QUESTION: -- why do you acquiesce in thisphrase, going beyond Ex Parte Young? Have you ever -- MR. GORNSTEIN: No, I --QUESTION: Has anybody seen a consent decree that simply said, we'll obey the law?MR. GORNSTEIN: No. I didn't say it went beyond22ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 Ex Parte Young. I said it went beyond what was strictly2 required by Federal law. And as this Court said in the3 Rufo case, every Federal court remedial order that's4 entered by a Federal court goes beyond what's strictly5 required by Federal law.6 QUESTION: That's all --7 MR. GORNSTEIN: And Milliken permits that as8 long as it's aimed at remedying a violation.9 But there's one step beyond Milliken here, and10 that Rufo says that you can even agree to relief that goes11 beyond what a court would order after a trial as long as12 the relief furthers the objectives of the underlying law13 because there you are operating with the consent of the14 State officials in -- in selecting that relief.15 QUESTION: You should have given a different16 answer to Justice Souter then because certainly pediatric17 podiatry would further the objectives of the law to18 provide the medical care to -- to children.19 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, at some point it has to20 resolve a bona fide dispute within the subject matter21 jurisdiction of the court as well, and if there's no22 arguable violation of Federal law that the relief relates23 to, then it falls outside of what a court should enter as24 a decree under Rufo.25 QUESTION: Well, you really haven't saved us a23ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 whole lot of trouble then. I -- I frankly thought that2 one of the attractive features of your position was that3 once you have an order, that's the end of it. You don't4 have to try the order when -- when you seek enforcement to5 parse out which parts of it go too far and which parts6 don't go too far. You tell me there are some -- some that7 can go too far. We have to look to whether this is8 pediatric podiatry or -- or not.9 MR. GORNSTEIN: In general, once a decree has10 been entered, there's no objection that can be made at the11 enforcement stage other than subject matter jurisdiction.12 But subject matter jurisdiction would include an inquiry13 into whether what was at issue in the case was -- if it14 was an arguable Federal claim or sought to further the15 objectives underlying an arguable Federal claim. That's16 going to be rare that it won't do that, but if it doesn't17 do that, the State has a right to object to that on18 subject matter jurisdiction grounds.19 By the way, the State also has the right always20 to move for modification of provisions under this Court's21 decision in Rufo that are not arguably related to -- that22 are not related to any arguable violation of Federal law.23 If it's just a frivolous underpinning to the suit, the --24 the State could always move for modification and get that25 provision eliminated under Rufo.24ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W.

You said in all of the cases that you know --MR. GORNSTEIN: No, no. I -- no. Rufo itself was a suit against local officials, but what Rufo said is that State and local officials can enter into these -- these kinds of agreements and that State officials and local officials could obtain modifications based on changes in circumstances.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Cruz, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. EDWARD CRUZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:This case presents the basic question whether Federal district courts are immune from the strictures of sovereign immunity and Ex Parte Young when administering Federal consent decrees.In this case, it is clear what Federal law requires. The Medicaid statute is very clear and everything that Federal law requires, the State of Texas is doing.The dispute that the parties are having here is not simply a theoretical dispute about whether -- what25ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425degree of connection there should be between a remedy and -- and an ongoing violation of Federal law. There is no violation of Federal law, and that fundamentally is the problem.QUESTION: But can I ask you this question? You say there's no violation of Federal law now. Does that mean there was no violation of Federal law when the lawsuit began?MR. CRUZ: It does not necessarily mean that and no court has determined that.QUESTION: No, but isn't it -- isn't the -- in order to determine the court's power to act, don't you have to look at the facts at the time litigation started?MR. CRUZ: Well, under Ex Parte Young, the question is not retrospectively was there a violation of Federal law, but -- but --QUESTION: No. I understand that, but still it seems to me your -- your jurisdictional inquiry would focus on the situation at the time the litigation commenced.MR. CRUZ: There is a strong argument that there was not a violation of Federal law at the time the litigation commenced, but that matter was never adjudicated one way or the other.QUESTION: That's right because the State, in26ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 effect, waived its right to adjudicate that.2 MR. CRUZ: What the State did is pursue an3 option to settle the -- the matter and avoid an4 adjudication.5 QUESTION: But doesn't that mean there was at6 least a potential violation of law that would give the7 court jurisdiction to enter a remedy, which might go8 beyond merely saying, don't violate the law in the future,9 that because you may have violated the law in the past, I10 have the power to order you to do some things that may not11 in themselves be illegal?12 MR. CRUZ: We would agree that this case was13 initially properly brought under Ex Parte Young in that14 the complaint, under the terms of the Verizon decision,15 alleged a violation of Federal law. However, Ex Parte16 Young is not simply a formulistic pleading requirement.17 It also is -- is, under this Court's decision in, among18 other things, Green v. Mansour, a restriction on the19 Federal court's jurisdiction that -- that what there would20 have to be for your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, to21 carry through is not simply a determination that there22 might be a violation of Federal law.23 QUESTION: Well, do you think in order to enter24 a consent decree, the judge had to adjudicate that there25 was a violation of Federal law?27ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CRUZ: No, Your Honor. But in order for the court now to exercise the coercive authority of the Federal court and to order the State officials to engage in a very detailed course of conduct, the predicate that justifies the Young fiction in the first place is an ongoing violation of Federal law.QUESTION: So you're -- you're telling us that the effect of this consent decree, what Texas achieved by it, is it comes into court and says, oh, let's -- let's not fight about whether there was a violation or not, we'll accept a consent decree, and the effect of this consent decree is simply we'll fight about this same question later. Right?MR. CRUZ: If the agreement was --QUESTION: And you haven't given up anything else. You've just said, let's -- let's not fight about￼this. Why would the decree? It's crazy.MR. CRUZ:QUESTION:just dismiss this case, and if you want to get us, bring the same case later. Why would I enter into such a consent decree?MR. CRUZ: The consent decree offered the other side a great deal. For one thing, the State, as a28ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005other side ever accept such a consentWell --You're just telling them, you know,1 voluntary2 course of3 record --4agreement, agreed to carry out an extensive conduct. And if you look at the actualQUESTION: Only so long as the State chose to do5 it because on your theory, you -- you create this oddity.6 They had power -- the court had power to enter the decree7 but not to enforce it.8 Would you take the same position if this had9 been a litigated judgment and the exact same decree came10 out at the end of the line? And then the State says,11 well, this was an Ex Parte Young suit and even though we12 litigated and lost, we can still say all bets are off13 because at the enforcement stage, you have to prove the14 case all over again.15 Now, are you making a distinction between a16 consent decree and a litigated judgment, or do you accept17 that this -- if this case had been litigated and that18 decree entered, it could be enforced?19 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, we're -- we're20 making both distinctions. This would be a more difficult21 case if there had been -- it had been litigated and there22 had been a determination of a violation of Federal law,23 but --24 QUESTION: Why? Why would it be more difficult?25 It seems to me this is more difficult. You agreed to it.29ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CRUZ: It would be more difficult because you at least had the predicate for Ex Parte Young in the first place. You had a violation of Federal law.QUESTION: Well, but it seems to me that when matters are in doubt and a consent decree is entered, obviously with the consent of both parties -- that's what it means -- that it is a question of Federal law. It's a Federal judgment.MR. CRUZ: It -- it is absolutely a Federal judgment, but on the terms of the consent decree, there was no concession of liability. No court at any time has ever found the State of Texas was violating Federal law.QUESTION: No. But your argument, as I understood it a moment ago, is that you can't go beyond Federal law because there's no violation of Federal law now. And that would be exactly the same whether the predicate was a -- a litigated judgment or a consent decree.MR. CRUZ: In essence --QUESTION: So we're in -- it seems to me you're in the same boat under Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.MR. CRUZ: The second part of Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical about whether even if this were fully adjudicated, would this content -- consent decree be proper, the answer is plainly no because this consent30ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decree does not enjoin ongoing violations of Federal law. There are a number of provisions in this consent decree --QUESTION: So in other -- I take that to mean, yes, we would be making exactly the same argument --MR. CRUZ: Absolutely.QUESTION: -- if this had been a litigated decree. We would -- we would say that --MR. CRUZ: Absolutely.QUESTION: -- that the order saying, A, you did wrong, you violated Federal law, and B, in the avoid that, you've got to do the followingsomethingfuture tothings, A, B, C -- you would say so long as at the moment of enforcement we are not then violating Federal law in the sense found in the judgment, they cannot order A, B, C, and D.￼MR. CRUZ: Under Milliken, the question would be the relation --QUESTION: No. I want to know under you. (Laughter.)QUESTION: On your theory, isn't that going tobe your answer?MR. CRUZ: Our answer is going to be that the --the jurisdiction that this Court has created under Ex Parte Young and its progeny exists for one purpose, to vindicate the Supremacy Clause.31ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: No, but you're -- you're getting into2 -- into a general answer, and I want a specific answer.3 As I understand it, you would say that in -- that4 following the litigated case with an A, B, C, D order, you5 wouldsaythatif--iftheState--ifthe--ifthe6 other side tried to enforce A, B, C, and D, you could come7 into court and say, we are not now violating Federal law8 in the sense originally alleged. Therefore, A, B, C, D,9 and E cannot be enforced. Isn't that correct, that that10 would be your position?11 MR. CRUZ: If C and D were necessary to ensure12 compliance with Federal law, then they would be13 permissible remedies once there was a finding under14 Federal law.15 QUESTION: Well, all right. Let's -- let's16 compromise on an answer to the question. Your answer17 would be we can always object to A, B, C, and D. We may18 or may not succeed, but we can always object to it, even19 though we haven't appealed it.20 MR. CRUZ: If there's an ongoing injunction --21 QUESTION: We didn't -- we didn't appeal saying,22 look, Supreme Court, they -- you know, they -- they nailed23 us to the wall on liability, but they do not have24 jurisdiction to order A, B, C, and D and E because they25 don't have jurisdiction to enforce it. You didn't take32ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that appeal and yet you feel you can raise that later.2 MR. CRUZ: If the injunction is ongoing, then3 the State officials could come in at any point and say, C,4 D, and E are not necessary --5 QUESTION: Can I ask you what is the purpose of6 doing this? I mean, let's think of the Medicare7 provisions or the Social Security provisions, the8 regulations, the statutes. They cover volumes. Think of9 consent decrees. Yours is only 80 pages. I guess others10 might be hundreds of pages. And so what you're saying is11 that after these have been entered, they've been entered12 because there was a violation of Federal law in the view13 of the plaintiff and the defendant agreed. Okay?14 Now, what you're saying is at any time, we go15 through these hundreds of pages and we try to figure out16 whether each word in these hundreds of pages actually in17 itself reflects the Federal law violation, of which,18 remember, there were 3,000 volumes, or the State law19 violation, of which there were 10,000 more volumes, and20 once we figured that out, then you're going to say you can21 do paragraph 867 but you can't do paragraph 868. Now, I22 just wonder what is the purpose of this exercise?23 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, two responses. First24 of all, there was not an agreement that there was a25 violation of Federal law. It's certainly true the33ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plaintiffs --QUESTION: No. I -- I don't -- that's not -- MR. CRUZ: -- consent decree explicitly -- QUESTION: That's not answering my question atall. So would you please direct yourself to my question? MR. CRUZ: The second response -- your -- yourquestion refers to volumes of Federal law and State law that may or may not have been violated. This case is very simple. It's one short section of Federal law.QUESTION: I'm not asking about this case. I'm asking about the purpose of the exercise that you are suggesting that the Constitution requires us to undertake. My suggestion was that it is -- I was trying to make it look absurd to go through that exercise because it would put everybody to a lot of work for no real reason. That was what I was trying to suggest. Now, I suggested it so you would respond to it because I'm sure you don't agree with that, and therefore, I'd like you to present the response.MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, the exercise of requiring a -- a violation of Federal law derives from this Court's cases beginning with Ex Parte Young and moving on.QUESTION: You're saying the cases require it. Now, if that's so, that's the end of it. You're right.34ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 But I had the impression a different case had a much2 better solution to the problem that you raise, which is3 that there's some provisions in this thing that really4 have nothing to do with Federal law at all. And that's5 called Rufo. And what the -- what -- what you're supposed6 to do in that situation is you can make your argument.7 You go to court. You say rule 60(b). You say, judge, you8 see this provision over here? This has nothing to do with9 anything. And if the judge is right, you win. Now, why10 isn't that a much more practical approach for the problem11 that you're raising?12 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under the Fifth13 Circuit precedent, the means to challenge this sort of14 decree is precisely what we did, to challenge it. Under15 the Lelsz v. Kavanagh case, the means to challenge it is16 to challenge the enforcement and --17 QUESTION: You mean you can never move for18 modification prior to an enforcement action?19 MR. CRUZ: Well, you can, and that's the second20 part which is the Fifth Circuit treated what we did as a21 motion to modify or vacate the decree. That's how the22 Fifth Circuit interpreted what we did. The -- the23 plaintiffs came in at a year and a half --24 QUESTION: The Fifth Circuit -- excuse me. The25 Fifth Circuit said you had to -- you had to segment this35ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 decree into bites, and plaintiff had to prove each one of2 them as a violation of Federal law. That's worlds3 different from saying, here's a decree, time has shown4 that it's not -- that it's too onerous, so court, please5 modify it. 60(b)(5) accepts the decree as valid and6 enforceable, but says that it should be modified in light7 of our experience under it. Now, that's quite different8 from saying you can't enforce it. You have to prove the9 case all over again at the enforcement stage.10 MR. CRUZ: It is true that treating our -- our11 argument as a motion to modify is not purely based upon12 changed facts and law. It is in part because you have the13 2 years of compliance and the tremendous record the State14 has, but another fundamental element of it was a challenge15 that the terms of the consent decree go far beyond what16 Federal law requires. And let me focus just for a￼17 moment --18 QUESTION: Why don't you make a virtue of a19 necessity and say that that is precisely your response to20 Justice Breyer, that you cannot do what you want to do21 under rule 60(b)?22 MR. CRUZ: That --23 QUESTION: Why not? That's --24 QUESTION: For the reason that25 stated, that all 60(b) enables you to do36ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005Justice Ginsburg is to eliminate1 provisions that -- that have been found too onerous, not2 to eliminate provisions that are not indeed terribly3 onerous but go beyond what -- what the court had4 jurisdiction to impose. It's a totally different5 question.6 MR. CRUZ: My -- my --7 QUESTION: Right?8 MR. CRUZ: My hope --9 QUESTION: So that's your answer to Justice10 Breyer.11 MR. CRUZ: My -- my hope would be --12 QUESTION: But that -- that leaves you with13 Justice Ginsburg's problem.14 (Laughter.)15 MR. CRUZ: My hope would be to make virtues out16 of either approach and to say that it could either be done17 on -- under an effort to modify or a challenge of18 enforcement, that either avenue is available. And the19 Fifth Circuit treated it as both. I mean, that's20 precisely what the Fifth Circuit did. The -- the --21 QUESTION: Modification doesn't depend on22 changed circumstances, does it, under that theory? You're￼23 saying we24 agreed to25want to modify it because we shouldn't have it in the first place.MR. CRUZ: Well, we don't know what the37ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 circumstances were when -- when this matter was entered2 because there was no adjudication on the merits. But we3 do know now --4 QUESTION: Well, but there are allegations of5 fact that would have -- the allegations did allege a -- a6 violation of Federal law, did they not?7 MR. CRUZ: If those -- they did, and if those8 allegations were true, then there are changed9 circumstances because the district court was very clear10 that there is absolutely no evidence that even a single11 class member has ever requested services and been denied.12 And that really is the nub of the dispute because13 petitioner --14 QUESTION: Yes, but that's not an answer to all15 -- the statute requires more than waiting for requests to16 be made.17 MR. CRUZ: But -- but that really is the18 critical dispute because the statute, the Medicaid19 statute --20 QUESTION: As I understand the record, you've21 made marvelous and extensive changes in your practices,22 and that's why you're in such wonderful shape now. But23 maybe you wouldn't have been if the lawsuit had never been24 filed.25￼MR. CRUZ: That's possible, and so this could be38ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 fairly characterized as a motion to modify because there2 is not an ongoing violation of Federal law now.3 What the Federal law requires is that whenever4 an eligible member requests screening, they receive it.5 Petitioners don't like that reading and what the6 petitioners convinced the Federal district court to do in7 this case is read the words where they are requested out8 of the statute. And all of this fight about what the9 proper baseline is, is it Federal law or is it the10 consent --11 QUESTION: Well, but I want to know if you could12 go -- could you go through 60(b)? That's interesting.13 Now, imagine -- I'll give a silly example to14 make it clear -- that there's a requirement in the consent15 decree you have to give every child a hair cut. And16 Federal law doesn't require that, but there's a provision17 in State law that the barbers' union got in. All right?18 (Laughter.)19 QUESTION: So every child has to have a hair20 cut. So you find the decree and you go say, judge, I want21 this modified. Look what it is over here. They give22 every child a hair cut. That has nothing to do with23 Federal law whatsoever. We don't want to give every child24 a hair cut. Can you get the decree modified under 60(b)?25 MR. CRUZ: Yes.39ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Yes. All right. Well, then if you could get it modified under 60(b), this isn't really a solution. You don't need your solution. You can go in under 60(b).MR. CRUZ: And that's what the Fifth Circuit treated what we did. So we --QUESTION: All right. So then there's no problem. We're all in agreement.MR. CRUZ: We will prevail either way.QUESTION: So if we think you have in under 60(b), is that the end of the case? MR. CRUZ: If -- if what we did isbecause --QUESTION: Mr. Cruz --QUESTION: You have to assume thatonerous, that everything that goes -- goes awhat Federal law demands is, quote, too onerous. Is that -- is that your theory of 60(b)?MR. CRUZ: It's not a bit beyond and -- and one important caveat of 60(b) is most of this Court's 60(b) cases are in a context where the State or a State official is not a defendant.QUESTION: Well, 60(b) is basically changed circumstances or changed law, isn't it?MR. CRUZ: It is. And --40ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005a right to godeemed that,￼it's too bit beyond1 QUESTION: But beyond that, Rufo said that when2 you're dealing with a State or a municipality, that the3 60(b) is more flexible than it would be if you were4 dealing with a private party.5 MR. CRUZ: It -- it did. Rufo was easing the6 standards for modification, and Rufo did not address the7 Eleventh Amendment. That was not an issue that was8 litigated, and the Court --9 QUESTION: Yes, but we're talking about 60(b).10 And I think the -- the -- you're saying, well, this is11 essentially the same thing. It isn't because what you've12 confronted us with is you said, yes, the court had13 jurisdiction to enter this decree, but it had no14 jurisdiction to enforce it. That was your plain position,15 and that's not a 60(b) position. 60(b) is the court can16 enforce it unless and until you show grounds for17 modification.18 MR. CRUZ: We don't necessarily concede that the19 court should have entered this decree, but the point at20 which we litigated it is the point at which the Federal21 court began to exercise coercive authority of a Federal22 court over the State. And at that point --23 QUESTION: It didn't exercise authority till the24 plaintiffs came in and said, look, they're violating the25 decree. They're not carrying out all their promises.41ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR.

One thing8 petitioners argue a great deal is the unfairness, and that9 was a motivating factor in this Court's Lapides decision.10 But I would point out petitioners did not give anything up11 when they signed this agreement. It's not as if we could12 sign an agreement with them and agree we're going to13 comply with 80 percent of Federal law.14 QUESTION: They gave up their lawsuit, and15 you're -- you're -- and you know, packed up and went home,16 and you're telling them that they -- that they17 accomplished nothing by doing that.

CRUZ: Your Honor, that actually opens the door to yet another reason why we do not believe this Court should hold that Ex Parte Young defendants can engage in commitments that extend far beyond Federal law because that open -- opens a Pandora's box to separation of powers problems.QUESTION: It's -- it's maybe far beyond. I'm -- I'm not sure that it is but it's permissible. Rufo was concerned with requirements that were not permissible under Federal law. And that's -- that's not this case. And you have the obligation, even under 60(b), to show that compliance is burdensome and there's changed circumstances, and you haven't shown that.MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, no body of law, Federal or State law, requires virtually everything that's43ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W.

The consent decree requires data collection, and there's no reference to that in Federal law. The consent decree requires the State officials --QUESTION: These are just necessary procedures to implement the program and to make it work well.MR. CRUZ: I mean, the consent decree --QUESTION: And they were agreed to you by yourclient.MR. CRUZ: The consent decree requires that the State officials train private health care workers in cultural sensitivity. Now, that's not required by Federal law. That's not necessarily to ensure compliance with Federal law. It is something quite simply --QUESTION: Well, suppose it were shown that the failure to do this caused serious flaws in the implementation of the program.MR. CRUZ: The Federal law requires --QUESTION: The court surely has the authority -- and the parties certainly have the right -- to stipulate to provisions that will make the consent decree effective.MR. CRUZ: A State official does not have the right to bargain away his or her constitutional authority or the legislature's. If one might imagine a hypothetical. The legislature --QUESTION: But that's -- that's the issue.44ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, excuse me. Certainly the State2 Attorney General has -- and by the way, I would like you3 to say a few words about the other -- the other basis and4 that is the waiver basis. Certainly the State Attorney5 General does have the power to bargain away the State's6 sovereign immunity if -- if you consider that bargaining7 it away.8 MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia --9 QUESTION: Why -- assuming everything you said10 is true, that this goes beyond what could have been11 imposed under Ex Parte Young, nonetheless, you had the12 State Attorney General who agreed to all of this. It was13 not just these individual officers. The State Attorney14 General who had power to waive sovereign immunity signed15 this consent decree. Why shouldn't that be the end of the16 case?17 MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, the premise of the18 question that the Attorney General had power to waive19 sovereign immunity is not correct under Texas law. Now,20 it is admittedly a question of Federal law, but Federal21 law looks to State law.22 In answer to your question about waiver, we have23 seven reasons why we believe the Court should not find24 that there was a waiver.25 First, that this was waived below.45ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Secondly, there's no clear and unambiguous2 waiver, as this Court's decisions require.3 Thirdly, there has been no waiver by the4 legislature of immunity from liability in State court, a5 critical predicate for Lapides, and in fact, the United6 States in Lapides argued that all the Attorney General7 could waive was forum immunity, not immunity from8 liability -- immunity from suit at all.9 QUESTION: May I stop you at that point? Could10 a State then simply say -- every State say our Attorney11 General has no authority to waive our sovereign immunity,12 and then you would have the highest legal officer13 appearing in Federal court on behalf of the State and14 representations that that person makes count for nothing?15 Is that --16 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, your -- your17 hypothetical is in fact the law in the Texas, in that the18 legislature has explicitly said the Attorney General may19 not waive sovereign immunity in Government Code 402.004.20 QUESTION: Then what was the attorney -- then21 the Attorney General was really deceiving the Federal22 court when the Attorney General said, this is a consent23 decree that we worked out, we urge the court to adopt it.24 Now, if the Attorney General had no authority to enter25 that consent decree, he should have told that to the46ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Federal court, but there was no -- no such representation.2 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, the Attorney3 General didn't deceive the court because the Attorney4 General never represented that this was a waiver of5 sovereign immunity. Those words are not found in the6 consent decree. The consent decree says the defendants'7 defenses are all preserved. This was an effort, unlike8 all of the voluntary invocation of jurisdiction cases,9 where the State makes an affirmative decision, we want to10 be in Federal court. In this case the State was hailed11 involuntarily --12 QUESTION: But nothing required the State to13 agree to this consent decree. I know you distinguished14 the case -- Lapides was -- you said that they -- the State15 made the move to get the case into the Federal court. But16 here, yes, the State is a defendant. Nothing in the world17 compelled it to enter the consent decree, to urge the18 court to accept its consent. So when a State Attorney19 General says to the Federal judge, Federal judge, we think20 this is a sound decree, we want you to enter it, that's21 hardly being hauled before the court. That's a voluntary22 decision.23 MR. CRUZ: The State acted in an attempt to24 avoid a long, protracted litigation. We were hailed25 involuntarily before the Federal court.47ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: In Gunter, the State was also hailed involuntarily before the Federal court.MR. CRUZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but Gunter was an adjudication on the merits and found an ongoing violation of Federal law and then enjoined that ongoing violation. Had that happened, we wouldn't have a dispute. We don't --QUESTION: Well, you prevented it from happening by entering into the consent decree.MR. CRUZ: But that could have happened at the stage of enforcement. Before a Federal court orders a State to do something, this Court has said that Ex Parte Young is a fiction, that -- that the courts will pretend the State official, who is not really a State official, is acting ultra vires for the limited purpose of vindicating the Supremacy Clause. That limited purpose is not served when no court has ever found a violation of Federal law, and when there is in fact not a violation of Federal law.The reasons petitioners are litigating today is because if they had to demonstrate a violation of Federal law, they could not do so. So what they would, instead, like is for the baseline to be the consent decree.QUESTION: Are you suggesting they filed a lawsuit they didn't think they could win?MR. CRUZ: They filed a lawsuit that was filed48ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 before Judge William Wayne Justice --2 QUESTION: It was filed in good faith alleging3 violations of Federal law, was it not?4 MR. CRUZ: It was -- it -- we presume it was5 filed in good faith and it alleged violations of Federal6 law. We don't believe they could have demonstrated then7 and we -- we absolutely don't believe they can demonstrate8 now any violations of Federal law. Both the district9 court and --10 QUESTION: Then why enter a consent decree? It11 just doesn't make sense. I assume that whatever counsel12 was representing the State at that time thought there was13 sufficient grounds to justify entering into a consent14 decree, unless you want to take the position that the15 attorney was acting totally ultra vires.16 MR. CRUZ: It was an effort to end the17 litigation. It was an effort that ultimately failed. I18 mean, there -- there are two additional key reasons why19 there's not waiver.20 QUESTION: No. But you're saying then that the21 consent decree is basically a continuance.22 MR. CRUZ: It is a voluntary agreement and it23 allows -- it agrees that the district court is available,24 it's familiar with the law and facts and can -- the case25 can be brought back to it if there's ongoing dispute.49ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Right. We'll see -- a consent decree2 means we'll see you later.3 MR. CRUZ: Or we'll agree to this and that will4 resolve the matter.5 I will point out if signing a consent decree is6 a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity or sovereign7 immunity, then plaintiffs' argument proves too much. It8 means every consent decree is utterly immune from Ex Parte9 Young. It means once a consent decree is there, the10 requirements of Federal law don't matter.11 QUESTION: Only with the State Attorney General.12 (Laughter.)13 QUESTION: You haven't made another argument14 that -- that I thought you -- you would make, and that is15 not applicable to the waiver argument, which requires that16 the State Attorney General or someone authorized to act17 for the State is there. What -- what troubles me about --18 about the non-waiver argument made by the petitioner is19 that some of these consent decrees are imposed upon --20 upon absolutely willing State officers who want to be21 thrown into the briar patch. A suit is brought against a22 -- a secretary of health and human services in the State23 who absolutely wants to do these wonderful things for24 pediatric care that are not required by Federal law. And25 if the State Attorney General were not in the situation, I50ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 am very reluctant to think that this official can go in2 and say, yes, require me to do these wonderful things that3 State law does not require, that Federal law does not4 require, but that I would like to do, signs the consent5 decree, and then we're stuck.6 MR. CRUZ: That --7 QUESTION: But that's not this situation. Your8 Attorney General appeared and said, this is okay as far as9 we're concerned.10 MR. CRUZ: But -- but that is a fundamental11 problem with these cases. It was a prior Attorney12 General, a prior head of the health department, and those13 prior officers under petitioners' theory had bargained14 away the legislature's authority. It's clear the15 legislature couldn't pass a statute that said, we're going16 to allow the Federal District Court for the Eastern17 District of Texas to run our Medicaid program. That would18 be a fundamental violation of federalism and separation of19 powers. Nor could the Attorney General sign a contract to20 do that. Therefore, they should not be able to sign a21 consent decree to do that unless it is necessitated by an22 ongoing violation of Federal law. It is only the23 Supremacy Clause that justifies that.24 In addition, this course's voluntary -- this25 Court's voluntary invocation of Federal jurisdiction cases51ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 have, by and large, not been Ex Parte Young cases. In2 Lapides, in Gardner, in Clark, they were suits against the3 State. They were not Ex Parte Young cases, and this Court4 would be breaking new ground by saying an Ex Parte Young5 defendant who, under the legal fiction,6 is simultaneously the State for purpose7 waive sovereign immunity by litigating.8 And as was pointed out in the9 the State was a defendant, raised the Eleventh Amendment,10 was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.11 And to say now that ambiguous and conflicting provisions12 of the consent decree, signed by the State officials as Ex13 Parte Young defendants, can waive the sovereign immunity14 is to extend the Ex Parte Young fiction beyond --15 QUESTION: Well, surely they had attorneys,16 State attorneys, representing them, did they not?17 MR. CRUZ: They -- they did, Mr. Chief Justice.18 But those attorneys, just like the State officials, are19 temporary officeholders, and temporary officeholders are20 in effect, as this Court recognized in Alden v. Maine and21 also in Justice Thomas' and Justice O'Connor's opinions in22 Missouri v. Jenkins, there are serious separation of23 powers issues that are raised when one official bargains24 away the authority of another.25 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.52ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005is not the State, of being able toearlier colloquy,￼1 Ms. Zinn, you have 4 minutes remaining.2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN F. ZINN3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS4 MS. ZINN: Some of the arguments made are not5 tethered in -- tethered or tied to the record in this6 case. The district court, before enforcing the consent7 decree, found violations of -- ongoing violations of8 Federal law. That finding is found at pages -- at the9 bottom of page 272 and 273 in the appendix to the cert10 petition. And it -- it refers and relies on the Court's11 earlier extensive findings of fact.12 Second, there has been no contested motion to13 modify filed in this case. There was no contested motion14 to modify pending before the district court or pending15 before the court of appeals, and this is an important16 matter for this Court to consider. Of course, a motion to17 modify would allow State officials to present legitimate18 concerns, if they have any, concerning the consent decree19 to the district court so that the district -- with them20 having the burden of proof, so that they could have their21 best shot to show the district court what's wrong with the22 consent decree under this Court's decision in Rufo. That23 -- that burden of proof gives the district court a full24 record to base its decision on about whether or not to25 modify the decree and it also creates an adequate record53ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425for appellate review of those questions, which is not present at the moment.Indeed --QUESTION: Would a change in administrations be a change of circumstances that -- that justifies 60(b) being invoked?MS. ZINN: No.Indeed --QUESTION: Is there then a way to deal with theproblem that Justice Scalia raised, which is a serious problem I think?MS. ZINN: If a change in -- in administrations results in --QUESTION: Well, what they do is they go examine this decree and there all kinds of things in the decree that may be very nice and really helpful to people, but actually the legislature would never pass them, and they have nothing to do with Federal law. Now, what he's looking for is a remedy for that situation. I'm not saying your decree has that problem.MS. ZINN: Yes.QUESTION: But it's a known problem, and what's your solution to it?MS. ZINN: As has been pointed out, Rufo does create a more flexible standard for modification when54ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425consent decrees are involved in institutional reform litigation of this type. That flexibility, though, does not sink down to the level of mere inconvenience. So just because it becomes inconvenient for a successor administration to comply with the consent decree is not justification for modification. But if the -- the new State officials can bring legitimate concerns to the district court's attention, modification may be appropriate.Unless there are further questions, there's no further reply.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Zinn. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼55ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY1111 14th Street, N.W.
