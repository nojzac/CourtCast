BISHOP 8                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 9              MR. BISHOP:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it10    please the Court, by 1972 the terms navigable waters and11    waters of the United States had a settled meaning after a12    century during which congresses and this Court's13    conception of what those terms meant had expanded14    significantly from an initial strict view that the15    navigable waters were those navigable, in fact, to a16    recognition that they included in addition waters17    navigable with improvements and tributaries of those18    waters, to this Court's statement in the Union Electric19    case in 1965 that the only things excluded were intrastate20    non-navigable waters that did not flow into the navigable21 waters.22              By 1972, when the act was passed, the broadest23    conception of the navigable waters of the United States24    included all waters that form part of a single aquatic25    system with navigable waters in the traditional sense,3P ROCEEDINGS                                    (10:00 a.m.)CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argumentnow on number 99-1178, Solid Waste Agency of Northern CookCounty versus United States Army Corps of Engineers.  Mr.1    that flow into and so can affect the quality of those2    waters.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, the government says thatthe -- while you may be correct about the perception ofwhat the navigable waters of the United States consist of,that there was no practice of referring to that conceptionas waters of the United States.  Do you have instances --          MR. BISHOP:  We do, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- in the statutory text or in ouropinions where that precise phrase that's used in thedefinition here, waters of the United States, is used?          MR. BISHOP:  Well, the traditional phrase thatappears over and over again in the statutes and in theCourt's opinions is navigable waters of the United States,but there are instances where those are broken up, and ineffect the terms are used interchangeably.          In Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of1899, for example, the statute begins by talking aboutprotecting the navigable capacity of the waters of theUnited States, and immediately switches to talk aboutpreventing obstructions to the navigable waters.          In a much more recent statute, 1990, the AquaticNuisance Prevention Act, which I did not cite in my brief,but which I have directed the Solicitor General to, it'sat 16 USC 4702.  That is a statute in which the4 1    jurisdictional term is waters of the United States. 2    What's the definition in the statute? Navigable waters. 3    The phrases have been used interchangeably in statutes and 4    in this Court's opinions, and in our reply brief in a 5    footnote towards the end we cited a number of opinions. 6              QUESTION:  Have we ever used the term waters of 7    the states or has Congress ever used the term waters of 8    the states?  It would seem there might be a dichotomy 9    there; I'm not sure that it necessarily follows.10              MR. BISHOP:  Yes, I think in that same footnote11    we cite a number of cases where the waters of the United12    States is used in contradistinction to the waters of the13    states.  One of the problems with the government's14    interpretation is that there is no longer any such thing15    as the waters of the states.16              QUESTION:  I can understand.  I don't think -- I17    can understand the position that says waters of the United18    States means the navigable waters, but that's not your19    position.  You're saying it includes anything that flows20    into navigable waters.  I could understand the position21    that says waters of the United States means whatever22    Congress can legislate on under the commerce clause, but23    that's not your position.  That's their position. What I24    don't understand is the position which, I take it is25    yours, which says that all non-navigable waters which flow                                   5 1    into a navigable water is within the statute, and that 2    apparently according to the amici brief, is about 80 3    percent of every backyard pond. 4              But those which flow into waters under the 5    ground rather than over the ground which I guess are 6    excluded on your theory, just because they go under the 7    ground.  That isn't the small ones; that includes Crater 8    Lake, the Great Salt Lake, huge bodies of water.  It isn't 9    the big ones.  It's some small ones, some big ones, 8010    percent, the only difference being that they happen to11    flow into the stream that's navigable under the ground12    rather than over the ground.13              So what conceivably could Congress have had in14    mind on your interpretation?15              MR. BISHOP:  Just one question.  We're not16    taking a position on groundwaters.  The circuits are in17    conflict on that.18              QUESTION:  Maybe you're even saying that some of19    the ones that go under the ground are within the statute,20    but others aren't.21              MR. BISHOP:  Some courts have held that22    groundwaters that are connected to the -- that is, flow23    into the navigable waters of the United States, serve as a24    source.25              QUESTION:  Or into the Fox River, isn't that61 right? 2              MR. BISHOP:  There is no evidence of that. 3              QUESTION:  My question you see, is I can 4    understand their interpretation, I can understand a narrow 5    interpretation, but I don't understand what any human 6    being would want to accomplish by writing your 7    interpretation that would in fact exclude somewhere 8    between 5 and 20 percent of the bodies of water in 9    people's backyards.10              MR. BISHOP:  I think what the Congress had in11    mind in borrowing the common law and prior statutory12    meanings of these terms was that it did want to protect13    water, but it was also very cognizant of states' rights14    and retained rights under the 10th Amendment to regulate,15    and wanted to maintain limits on the scope of the16    jurisdiction.171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, is your position on thisissue influenced in any respect by our decision inRiverside versus Bayview Homes?          MR. BISHOP:  Clearly I have to accommodate thatposition, and that is one that Congress addressedspecifically as the Court noted in Riverside Bayview.  Itpointed out that the adjacent wetland abutted and drainedinto the navigable waters.          I think what Congress had in mind, when you read                             7 1    the legislative history, in the context of the statutory 2    language and the history of these terms is not, as the 3    government says, the commerce -- the effects of commerce 4    jurisdiction, but the channels jurisdiction.  It was 5    interested in expanding Federal jurisdiction over the 6    water as a protective matter as far as it thought it7 could. 8              QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, if that's so, then how do 9    you explain Section 404(g) of the statute, which allows10    the states' governments to submit to the EPA a description11    of a program involving discharging into waters that are12    other than navigable or adjacent to navigable waters?  Why13    would Congress give the governors permission to do that if14    those were to be excluded?15              MR. BISHOP:  It's clear that what that refers to16    is tributaries.  The only thing excluded in the state17    program are traditional navigable waters narrowly defined18    as waters navigable in fact, navigable with improvement,19    and wetlands adjacent thereto.  That leaves a vast array20    of navigable waters of the United States as set forth in21    this Court's understanding.  XXX the finally, secondary,22    tertiary tributaries.  As Justice Breyer pointed out, what23    is excluded, we believe, are the small proportion of24    waters that are totally isolated, that do not flow into25    the tributaries.81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  404(g) would not cover such --          MR. BISHOP:  It would not cover isolated waters.It clearly does allow states to regulate tributaries, thatis, traditional navigable waters of the United States,under for example, the Rivers and Harbors Act or the 1948version of the Clean Water Act.          QUESTION:  And presumably, states can regulate,under your theory, these isolated waters that don't flowinto navigable waters.  It's within the states'10    jurisdiction.11              MR. BISHOP:  That's right, Justice O'Connor, and12    the State of Alabama in its amicus brief set out a long13    appendix with state statutes. It's clear that virtually14    all states, if not all states, regulate isolated waters15    and protect them.16              Here the State of Illinois and Cook County17    carefully investigated our project over many public18    hearings, over many months, and concluded the project19    would not impact the waters involved here in any way.20              QUESTION:  What about lakes or ponds,21    intrastate, that don't flow into navigable waters but22    which can support rowboats or small sailboats or something23 like that?24              MR. BISHOP:  This Court's definition in25    Appalachian Electric of a navigable water included one9 1    that could be used by small noncommercial vessels on the 2    theory that that indicated the potential of the water body 3    to be used for commerce, and we are not objecting here to 4    the Court's claim of jurisdiction over waters that are 5    navigable in fact, even by small vessels.  We are 6    objecting solely to the taking of jurisdiction over 7    isolated water bodies that do not support commerce or 8    boating and that do not flow into and therefore affect the 9    quality of navigable waters over which the Corps has10    always had jurisdiction.11              QUESTION:  I don't quite understand your12    position as to why if it's a small lake entirely within13    the boundaries of the state that you don't object to14    Federal jurisdiction there.  Even if it's navigable,15    that's not interstate commerce, it's local commerce.16              MR. BISHOP:  Right, but we're not objecting -- I17    mean, that is not our case, Justice Stevens, so I can't18    claim to -- you know, I don't want to state a definitive19    position on this.  It's not unreasonable in our view for20    the Corps to have regarded small lakes that support21    intrastate commerce as part of the flow of commerce around22    the nation.23              QUESTION:  Would this case be different if the24    United States could prove that people used rowboats to go25    fishing in the pond that we're talking about here?  It's10123456    about?7              MR. BISHOP:  Well, there are a number of ponds.8    When I was out there originally, there was no water on the9    land.10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  How big is the biggest one?          MR. BISHOP:  I think in the record they sayseveral acres.          QUESTION:  Several acres.  So you could row backand forth across that one.  Two feet deep, I'm told.          MR. BISHOP:  They're very shallow.          QUESTION:  If you could, would that make adifference to you?  Say it was ten feet deep instead oftwo feet deep, and people regularly went out in rowboatsin it?          MR. BISHOP:  The position that the Corps hastaken, which we do not object to --          QUESTION:  I'm asking your position.          MR. BISHOP:  Yes, anything that supports -- ourposition essentially is anything that supports, couldsupport commerce, and that would include the intrastate11several acres in size, I think, isn't it?          MR. BISHOP:  These ponds are very tiny andshallow.  There is nothing in the record.  It's privateland.  They have never been used.QUESTION:  How big is the pond we're talking1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425portion --          QUESTION:  I'm just asking specifically, if itcan support people going out in a rowboat and rowing backand forth across the lake, that would be sufficient inyour view?          MR. BISHOP:  I find that implausible, but thatis what the Court said in --          QUESTION:  But I would like to get an answer tomy question, if you could please.  What is your view onthat hypothetical?          MR. BISHOP:  Yes, I think you have intrastatewaters if they are navigable, that is, if a boat can go onthem and move.          QUESTION:  This would be a different case if thegovernment could prove that rowboats could go back andforth across the water?          MR. BISHOP:  Or if they could prove that -- yes,that's right.          QUESTION:  Well, I don't see why you keepreferring to, you know, supporting interstate commerce.  Ithought the whole core of your case is that when youreferred to navigable waters, you're not talking aboutinterstate commerce, that there is one basis ofjurisdiction which is the commerce clause, and there isanother basis of jurisdiction which is navigable waters,121    and if you interpret navigable waters to mean waters that2    are navigable, whether they are navigable interstate or3    not, it would necessarily include lakes big enough to4    float a rowboat.               MR. BISHOP:  That's right, Justice Scalia, but56 -- 789          QUESTION:  Why do you keep referring tointerstate commerce?                MR. BISHOP: Because I believe there is a10    connection.11              QUESTION:  That's part of the navigable waters12    clause?1314    talks about navigable waters, particularly in the expanded15    sense that grew up over the hundred years after the Daniel16    Ball, they had in mind the channels power, and that that's17    how it reaches tributaries and things that affect the18    navigable waters.  Clearly many of the waters that are19    covered under the tributaries language of the statutes are20    not navigable in fact and could not support even a small21    rowboat.22232425MR. BISHOP:  No.  I believe that when Congress          QUESTION:  But they affect navigable waters, andso Congress' authority over the navigable waters, it givesthe Congress the authority to protect navigable waters.MR. BISHOP:  Absolutely right.                  13 1              QUESTION:  So what is the source of the 2    Congress' authority over navigable waters?  Is it the 3    commerce clause? 4              MR. BISHOP:  Yes, I believe it's the channels 5    power under the commerce clause, but it is not what the 6    government has taken here which is the effects of 7    commerce.  Congress by 1972 knew very well how to invoke 8    the effects commerce power.  It did so, for example, in 9    844(a) of the criminal code, which this Court considered10    in Lopez, where it specifically invoked that power.11              It did not do so in the Clean Water Act. It used12    these traditional terms, navigable waters of the United13    States, and under any plausible understanding of those14    terms, historical or just common sense, and certainly15    reading the legislative history, there is absolutely no16    indication that Congress meant to reach isolated ponds17    that can have no affect on the quality of navigable18 waters.19              QUESTION:  Mr. Bishop, I don't mean to belabor20    this but I'm looking at the text of 404(g), and it seems21    that this provision addresses permits on the application22    of the governor of any state to things that are not23    navigable waters, not tributaries, not adjacent wetlands.24    They seem, this section seems to fit the category that you25    say is outside the statute.  Perhaps you can look at the14 1    text of 404(g) and show me where I am wrong. 2              MR. BISHOP:  No, you are right, but the statute 3    does not define the limits of what is being allotted to 4    the states.  The Corps -- Congress is only allotting to 5    the states that which is left over from the 404 permit 6    program once traditional navigable waters have been taken 7    out.  It is our position that there is nothing else in the 8    statute that gives the Federal government power over 9    isolated waters with no impact on the navigable waters of10    the United States, and therefore the only thing that11    404(g)(1) reaches are the tributaries which are part of12    the navigable waters but which are not part of the13    traditional Corps meaning of navigable waters in the14    Daniel Ball, Appalachian Electric sense.  That seems like15    -- I mean, the statute does not say isolated waters; there16    is nothing in there that even hints that isolated waters17    are part of what is left over.18              QUESTION:  Adjacent wetlands are not left over19    because that's specifically mentioned --20              MR. BISHOP:  Wetlands adjacent to that are21    navigable in fact or navigable with improvements, not22    waters that are -- wetlands that are adjacent to23    tributaries, which are left to the states.  That leaves an24    enormous amount of regulatory power to the states over25    tributaries and their adjacent wetlands, but nothing in15 1    there suggests in the least that isolated waters are 2    included in that package, and isolated waters are 3    traditionally regulated by the states anyway. 4              There are principles of statutory interpretation 5    here that even if there were any ambiguity in the 6    statutory language, which we don't believe there is, there 7    are principles of statutory interpretation which require, 8    we believe, our reading as opposed to the government's. 9    The first of those is the DeBartolo principle that a10    statute or in this case a regulation, the bird rule should11    not be read so as to create constitutional problems.12    Whatever one's conclusion about the constitutionality of13    the bird rule, it seems beyond question that it does raise14    serious questions.15              QUESTION:  Well, are you asking us, counsel, to16    just focus on the bird habitat final rule or to focus on17    the regulation in 33 Code of Federal Regulations,18    paragraph 3328.3, defining waters of the United States?19              MR. BISHOP:  I believe that that regulation,20    Justice O'Connor, does not satisfy our view of the21    statutory language and therefore should be set aside.22              QUESTION:  Is the one 3328.3, the one defining23    waters of the United States?24              MR. BISHOP:  Right, the one defining waters of25    the United States.161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  You want us to focus on that and inyour view it is too broad and covers things the statutedidn't authorize?          MR. BISHOP:  That is true, it does not.          QUESTION:  Isolated, intrastate pond?          MR. BISHOP:  What it does is to extend thegovernment's jurisdiction to the limits of the effectscommerce power.  We don't believe that that's what theClean Water Act says.  Now, having said that I would liketo add, however, that the only --          QUESTION:  So the bird habitat regulationdoesn't have anything to do with it, or it does?          MR. BISHOP:  Well, the government has -- thesole basis on which the government has claimedjurisdiction in this case during the past -- since 1987when all this started is the bird rule.  They have nevermentioned another rule.  In their brief --          QUESTION:  I didn't quite understand.  The solebasis is what, Mr. Bishop?          MR. BISHOP:  The sole basis is the migratorybird rule.  That is what they stated when they tookjurisdiction in the first place.  It is the only basis ofjurisdiction that is stated in the 404 permit denials.Having said that, we obviously don't want to go back downand find ourselves caught on some other provision of the17 1    other waters regulation. It seems to us that the other 2    waters regulation is wholly inconsistent insofar as it 3    reaches any water, any isolated water that has any 4    conceivable effect on interstate commerce. 5              That is incompatible with the plain language of 6    the statute and the legislative history, and so although 7    we -- the migratory bird rule is the only basis on which 8    jurisdiction has been asserted in their briefs to this 9    Court, the government does retreat from that and rely on10    the activity itself, which I think is an intent to rely on11    the other waters regulation.  And so we would like the12    Court to address that to save another $30 million in13    public money which is what we spent dealing with the Corps14    for the last 13 years.15              I was talking about the principles of statutory16    regulation which we think support our interpretation.  One17    is the DeBartolo principle, but a second one and one the18    Congress had very much in mind as Section 101(b) of the19    statute makes clear is that it was concerned not to20    trample state powers over land use and over the21    environment, and there is no doubt that that trampling22    occurred here.  The Corps put together a 47,000-page23    record over the course of seven years of permitting, and24    in doing so overrode the considered determinations of the25    State of Illinois and Cook County.18 1              When it does a 404 determination, once it has 2    taken jurisdiction, it doesn't just keep its eyes on the 3    isolated waters.  It roams far and wide, using a public 4    interest standard.  The elements of that public interest 5    standard include, for example, whether the project meets 6    the needs and welfare, the general needs and welfare of 7    the people.  It includes review of economics, aesthetics, 8    an array of other things.  It is general land use 9    regulation at that point, and we believe that that is both10    inconsistent to stretch the jurisdiction as the Corps has11    through its rules, to stretch the jurisdiction to impinge12    on state regulation in the face of a clear statement in13    the preamble of the statute that Congress intended, had a14    policy to preserve the primary jurisdiction of state and15    local government over these matters, and that it is16    inconsistent with the clear statement principle that this17    Court has applied which requires that if Congress is going18    to impinge on the reserved rights of the states that it19    should say so clearly. Far from saying so clearly in this20    case, it said that it wished to preserve to the extent21    possible the rights of the states.2223    that?24              MR. BISHOP:  101(b), Your Honor, section 101(b),25    1251(b), which is probably quoted on the first page of our19QUESTION:  And where are the words that say1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011    state?12              MR. BISHOP:  I don't believe that the Federal13    government may regulate these ponds under the interstate14    --15              QUESTION:  So instead of -- if they discovered16    that mosquitos are flying all over the place, infect17    birds, and people are dying in different states because of18    a pond that is not appropriately sprayed, Congress lacks19    the power in your view to tell the states or to tell20    individuals to spray their ponds or not to use certain21    pesticides that are killing people in other states.  Do22    they have that power?23              MR. BISHOP:  Not under the commerce clause, ut24    they clearly can use treaty power.  You have to understand25    that birds are --20blue brief.          QUESTION:  First page of the blue brief?          MR. BISHOP:  Yes, Your Honor.  It is the policyof Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect theprimary responsibilities and rights of states to prevent,reduce, and eliminate pollution and to plan thedevelopment and use of land and water resources.          QUESTION:  Could Congress regulate these pondsto prevent them from serving as nesting places, say formosquitos that carry West Nile disease from state to1              QUESTION:  No.  I'm talking about under my2    hypothetical; there is no treaty, as I know, on West Nile3    mosquitos?4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BISHOP:  West Nile disease is spread bybirds and kills birds, and under the migratory bird treatyact Congress can clearly take birds by --          QUESTION:  What I'm trying to ask with myquestion, if you can just -- suppose that it's discoveredthat birds are causing diseases or suppose that pesticidesare dangerous to people.  Can Congress tell you that youcannot use a certain pesticide in your backyard pond oryour backyard tree because the effect of that is to spreaddisease from state to state?  Do they have that power?          MR. BISHOP:  Congress can certainly regulateanything that is commercial, including --          QUESTION:  So if the pesticide is shipped ininterstate commerce, they could regulate it on that basis?          MR. BISHOP:  Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  Could it affect only people inIndiana and not people in Illinois, so that Illinoisdoesn't care about it?  I mean, is this a real problem?If it's a national problem, are these mosquitos just goingto bite Indianans and not people from Illinois, so thatIllinois would have as much interest in preventing that asthe Federal government?  You would think they would have211    more interest.23 -- 45678910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BISHOP:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  There is no          QUESTION:  My question is whether or notCongress has the power to regulate local products in localponds on local trees that would spread diseases from onestate to another.          MR. BISHOP:  And if you can find a commerceconnection, for example, because the product --          QUESTION:  I said what the hypothetical is.          MR. BISHOP:  If there is no commerce connection,the answer is no.  And the framers of the Constitution didnot intend that the Federal government have power overevery problem just because it was national in scope.  Itintended that the states have reserve powers to deal withproblems as well, and --          QUESTION:  But why isn't there going to be acommerce connection?  I mean apart from the ChiefJustice's suggestion, it seems to me that the hypotheticalthat Justice Breyer throws out is a pretty good predicateto substantial effects on commerce.          MR. BISHOP:  Well, but I don't think thatsubstantial effects on an end user -- here the claim isthat the birds, because they fly interstate and at somepoint may get shot by or watched by people who are221234567 me. 8 910111213141516171819202122232425crossing state lines and spending money, that is asufficient interstate commerce connection.  If thatconnection --          QUESTION:  I don't think that was thehypothetical, was it?          MR. BISHOP:  That doesn't seem very different to          QUESTION:  That wasn't the hypothetical.          MR. BISHOP:  That doesn't seem very different tome from the hypothetical.  But some end user commerceconnection is not enough.  If you get there then there areno reserve powers left to the states, everything is withinthe enumerated powers.          If I could, I would like to reserve theremainder of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Bishop. Mr. Wallace,we will hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. WALLACE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The Clean Water Act states its goals as torestore and maintain the chemical, physical, andbiological integrity of the nation's waters and to attainwater quality which provides for the protection and23 1    propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife.  The 2    operative provisions at issue here prohibit discharges of 3    pollutants into certain waters -- we'll get into what 4    those are in just a moment -- without a permit.  Those 5    provisions regulate human conduct, usually commercial in 6    nature, and certainly commercial in this instance, in 7    order to avert harm to natural resources, wildlife, or the 8    environment, and in common with similar antipollution 9    provisions in other Federal environmental statutes, these10    prohibitions on conduct do not purport to assert any11    special Federal domain over the place where the conduct12 occurs.13              QUESTION:  I don't understand exactly what that14    means, Mr. Wallace.15              MR. WALLACE:  Well, for example, in the act16    commonly known as RCRA, another environmental statute, the17    Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a permit18    situation, a permit system is set up for the treatment,19    storage or disposal of hazardous waste, which occurs in20    privately owned land ordinarily, without any reference to21    waters whatsoever.  The Endangered Species Act prohibits22    harm to the protected species, whether that occurs on land23 or water.24              QUESTION:  You're saying there are a lot of laws25    like this one?241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. WALLACE:  Well, I am saying there are manyprohibitions on conduct that pollutes or endangers thenatural resources of this country or the wildlife of thiscountry that are enacted under the commerce power and thatare not commonly thought of or thought of in the law asasserting a special Federal domain over the place wherethe conduct occurs.          QUESTION:  That's true, but unlike those otherstatutes, this one is limited to the navigable waters ofthe United States.          MR. WALLACE:  As defined in the statute, that's          QUESTION:  As defined in the statute.          MR. WALLACE:  That's exactly what I'm going toturn to now, but I have to speak first, as I tried to do,to the argument that there would be a constitutionalproblem if the conduct prohibited occurred in one placerather than another.  The conduct --          QUESTION:  The assertion was that if there wasno commerce clause connection, it would beunconstitutional, and that's what the discussion wasabout, a sufficient commerce clause connection.          MR. WALLACE:  I guess  --          QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, when a justice is askingyou a question, I suggest you remain quiet until he25101112    --13141516171819202122232425 1    finishes, if that isn't too much trouble. 2              MR. WALLACE:  Thank you.  Sorry.  I'm just 3    trying to help with the inquiry.  I'm sorry.  In any 4    event, let's turn now to the question of what waters the 5    statute addresses.  The first thing to be said about this 6    question, before turning to the statute, is that this 7    Court has already spoken to this issue, not in detail, but 8    quite clearly in an opinion in which it was an important 9    part of the Court's reasoning, and I'm speaking of a10    carefully crafted opinion of the Court in International11    Paper Company against Ouellette which dealt with a very12    difficult issue.  This is in 479 U.S., which dealt with a13    very difficult issue of implied preemption under the act14    in light of the meaning of two savings clauses.15              And an important part of the reasoning of the16    Court in concluding the scope of preemption of17    escape-based causes of action, it happened to be a18    challenge to a discharge that caused harm in an adjoining19    state, but an important part of the Court's reasoning was20    consideration of the comprehensive scope of the Clean21    Water Act.  And the Court stated at page 486 of 479 U.S.22    in describing the case first that the act applies to23    virtually all surface water in the country, and it had a24    footnote at that point citing its decision from the25    previous term in Riverside Bayview Homes which had                                  26 1    described the Corps' regulations that extended to isolated 2    waters so-called.  And then in the legal discussion in its 3    opinion several pages later at 479 U.S. page 493, the 4    Court reasoned, As we noted in Milwaukee 2, Congress 5    intended the 1972 act amendments to establish, quote, an 6    all encompassing program of water pollution regulation, 7    unquote.  The act applies to all point sources and 8    virtually all bodies of water, and it sets forth the 9    procedures for obtaining a permit in great detail.10              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, if you would turn to the11    language in Riverside Bayview that you cited in passing,12    that does say that the word navigable in this statute has13    a, quote, limited office.  As I understand what you're14    telling us now, which you put forward in your brief, it15    has no office at all, that the statute would mean what you16    say it means if the term navigable were not in there so17    that you give no effect whatever to that term.  Am I18    correct in so understanding?19              MR. WALLACE:  Well, the term is defined in the20    statute, so it has effect as a reference to the21    definition, but it's a term of art in the statute, and22    it's defined as waters --23              QUESTION:  What does it have to do?  In other24    words, would the statute do anything more or less in your25    view if the word navigable were not there and there were27 1    just the words waters of the United States?  In other 2    words, does navigable have any function whatever, not has 3    it been defined away? 4              MR. WALLACE:  I believe the answer is that the 5    use of the word navigable in the statute, as a reference 6    to the definition of what navigable means for purposes of 7    the statute, does not have any independent significance. 8              QUESTION:  May I suggest why it could have some 9    independent significance?  Now, Congress has many10    authorities under the commerce clause.  It seems to me11    clear that this statute was appealing to one aspect of12    Congress' commerce clause powers, that aspect which has to13    do with the control of navigable waters.  And to leap from14    that and simply ignore the navigable waters appeal and15    just say all Congress is doing is exerting its broad16    commerce power in all its aspects simply -- just seems to17    me to ignore a very precise appeal to one aspect of the18    commerce clause power.19              MR. WALLACE:  The word navigable appears in the20    statute in that spot but not elsewhere.  The statute does21    not deal with navigability problems. The statute deals22    with a water pollution crisis that was --23              QUESTION:  I understand, but Congress was24    limiting its control over that problem to navigable25    waters, and even the definition which means waters of the28 1    United States, that can be explained without making the 2    word navigable totally useless in the statute, by simply 3    saying that was meant to make it clear that when Congress 4    said navigable waters, it meant the broad definition of 5    navigability, which had been apparent in our cases, so 6    that it includes wetlands adjacent to navigable waters and 7    includes even tributaries that go into navigable waters. 8    But it seems to me to blink reality and to say that 9    Congress was relying upon a general commerce clause power,10    which is what the government's position is.11              MR. WALLACE:  Well, this is the main law12    governing conduct that pollutes surface waters in this13    country, and it's comparable to the Safe Drinking Water14    Act which protects aquifers and underground waters more15    directly.  But to answer your question more directly, as16    we explained in discussing the '72 act and then the 197717    amendments, the act started off and was called the Federal18    Water Pollution Control amendments of 1972, and it used19    the definition navigable waters, which was left over from20    prior legislation, including the Rivers and Harbors Act,21    but in the course of the development of the '72 act,22    dissatisfaction was expressed with the idea that the act23    would apply too narrowly and the definition of navigable24    waters was changed from navigable waters of the United25    States to just the words waters of the United States, and29 1    the committee report reporting it out at that time said it 2    was meant to exert the full constitutional authority of 3    the Congress under the commerce power. 4              QUESTION:  What it didn't say, Mr. Wallace, is 5    what, for example, 16 USC Section 817 says, a different 6    statute.  That imposes requirements on water projects on, 7    quote, navigable waters of the United States and other 8    waters, quote, over which Congress has jurisdiction under 9    its authority to regulate commerce.10              Now, you're essentially saying that's what this11    statute says.  But if it says it, it says it in such a12    roundabout way.  I mean, this is a very easy way to say13 it.141516171819202122232425          MR. WALLACE:  Well, it --          QUESTION:  Water projects are navigable watersof the United States and other waters over which Congresshas jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce.          MR. WALLACE:  It can be said quite plainly, Imean, Congress could have spoken with greater clarity thanit did.          QUESTION:  Well, isn't that a problem under anyclear statement analysis?  I understand, I think Iunderstand your argument, and I can see that it ispossible to construe the language as broadly as you do,but when literally any farm pond in the United States is30 1    going to be subject to Corps jurisdiction on your analysis 2    and Congress has not spoken any more clearly than it has 3    here, isn't that a reason for construing the statute more 4    narrowly rather than as broadly as you are here? 5              MR. WALLACE:  It arguably is a reason, although 6    the Court in Riverside Bayview -- 7              QUESTION:  A good reason. 8              MR. WALLACE:  -- said the deference to the 9    Corps' interpretation was appropriate, because Congress10    had not directly spoken to the issue.11              QUESTION:  We do here seem to have -- and maybe12    we did there for that matter, but we seem at least to have13    a conflict in principle because we have the deference14    principle and then we have some clear statement notion15    when the results get to the, sort of to the bizarre point.16    So which principle do we choose?17              MR. WALLACE:  Well, I have to take issue with18    whether the result here gets to a bizarre point that19    implicates a clear statement rule, but I do think that20    we're talking precisely on the issue on which Congress21    focused in the 1977 amendments to the act.22              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, it's at least unclear23    enough that the Corps of Engineers didn't come to this24    interpretation until quite late on. They didn't interpret25    it this way originally themselves, did they?  That's how311    at least unclear it is, not to say clear in the other2    direction.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WALLACE:  They did not interpret it this wayoriginally but were reprimanded by several court decisionsfor misinterpreting the act.  EPA, which has the primaryauthority to interpret the act, did interpret it this wayoriginally, and the Corps came around after conductinganother rulemaking proceeding as it was ordered to do by acourt that had said its view of the authority was toonarrow to accomplish the purposes of the act that Congresshad in mind, and the two agencies reached the sameconclusion by the time Congress was considering the 1977amendments which focused very specifically on the questionof whether the jurisdiction over so-called isolated watershad gone too far.          The House of Representatives --          QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, had the EPA taken thisposition before 1977?          MR. WALLACE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And so that position was in aregulation at the time Congress acted in 1977?          MR. WALLACE:  That is correct.  And it was alsoin the interim rule that the Corps had come to, and indeedthe Corps adopted its final rule during the course ofconsideration after the House had passed its bill but32 1    before the Senate had voted. 2              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, this comes to us as a 3    sort of as-applied challenge, I guess, and in the context 4    of provisions imposing criminal penalties.  Does that 5    influence our interpretation at all?  Is there any rule of 6    lenity concerns or anything of the sort because we are 7    dealing with statutes imposing criminal penalty? 8              MR. WALLACE:  Well, that was an issue that the 9    Court addressed in its opinion in Babbitt versus Sweet10    Home in footnote 18 of that opinion, where in a civil11    proceeding a similar concern was raised.  And I think the12    answer given in that footnote that in a civil context of13    litigation where the agency interpretation has been made14    clear, that there's no occasion to invoke the rule of15 lenity.16              QUESTION:  So the statute can mean one thing if17    it's prosecuted criminally, and something different if18    it's prosecuted civilly?  That's extraordinary.19              MR. WALLACE:  We don't take that position.20              QUESTION:  But that's what the footnote you21    appeal to would seem to suggest.22              MR. WALLACE:  It's a footnote by this Court.23              QUESTION:  Well, even so.24              MR. WALLACE:  We do have mens rea questions that25    we and the courts have been struggling with.331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  The point of the footnote, as Iremember it was, if the matter is cleared up in the civilproceedings, then the rule of lenity doesn't applysubsequently because there is no longer the ambiguity thatgives rise to the rule of lenity problem.          MR. WALLACE:  Very well stated.          QUESTION:  Which raises the different problem ofwhat the statute means depends upon whether the first caseprosecuted is a criminal or a civil case, is that thegovernment's position?          MR. WALLACE:  Well, we're very cautious aboutnot bringing what we think would be an unfair criminalprosecution.  We're mostly -- we mostly try to confinethose initiatives to scofflaw situations where we thinkthat we could prevail and where that kind of sanction is10111213141516    appropriate.17              But to get back to the 1977 controversy, the18    House did pass a bill, and a similar bill was sponsored by19    Senator Bentsen in the Senate, but both bills made clear20    that they were not repudiating the broader scope of21    authority for EPA in regulating toxic discharges into all22    waters of the United States as they had been interpreted23    in the regulations, but only addressed the Corps'24    permitting activities with respect to dredge and fill25    activities.34 1              The Congress indicated in detail that it was 2    very familiar with the agency interpretations by both 3    agencies, and even then the Senate refused to pass the 4    House version or the Bentsen amendment, and it decided 5    instead to retain the existing scope of the geographic 6    authority stated in the regulations that had been adopted, 7    but to counterbalance that with this new provision that 8    Justice Ginsburg has been averting to, 404(g), which 9    provided authority for the states to adopt their own10    programs over what were called in the Corps' new11    regulation and the Senate report, very specifically12    referred to this as Phase II and Phase III of the13    expansion of the Corps' permit program, and we have quoted14    the Senate report that uses precisely those terms on page15    25 of our brief.16              The committee amendment does not redefine17    navigable waters.  Instead, the committee amendment18    intends to assure continued protection of all the nation's19    waters but allows states to assume the primary20    responsibility for protecting the waters outside of the21    so-called Phase I waters, which are the navigable waters22    and those adjacent and then the wetlands adjacent thereto.23    Under the committee amendment the Corps will continue to24    administer the entire Section 404 program in all navigable25    waters until the approval of a state program for Phase II351    and Phase III waters, and the Phase III waters which the2    Corps was planning to get to in a couple of years time are3    the waters at issue here.4              So the whole premise of the Senate bill, which5    is what the conference committee adopted, was that the6    extension of jurisdiction to these Phase III waters would7    be retained, but the states would be given the option of8    administering the program.  Two states have chosen to do9    that, New Jersey and Michigan.  New Jersey was one of10    eight states that have filed a brief in our support in11    this case.  Only one has filed a brief on the other side,12    I hasten to point out.  And the Senate also13    counterbalanced the retention of the broad jurisdiction by14    providing for certain exemptions, including an exemption15    of certain agricultural activities because of precisely16    the concern that Justice Souter suggested might raise a17    question of bizarre authority and also have --18              QUESTION:  That is in the statute, Mr. Wallace?19              MR. WALLACE:  That is in the statute. That was20    part of the 1977 amendments that certain exemptions were21    added.2223242536          QUESTION:  Could you give us -- is it in yourbrief somewhere?MR. WALLACE:  Yes.  Yes, it is.QUESTION:  Could you tell us where? 1              MR. WALLACE:  It's Section 1344(f) of Title 33. 2              QUESTION:  Thank you. 3              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, how -- I'm trying to get 4    a quantitative idea from what one of the amici briefs 5    suggested.  Your view is that all the water that affects 6    interstate commerce, maybe the word is substantially 7    affects or significantly affects, whatever the 8    constitutional test, but think of that set of water, all 9    the water that significantly affects interstate commerce10    is included.  I take it that they agree that all the water11    that affects interstate commerce is included provided it12    also is either navigable or if not navigable, it flows13    into navigable water, and I thought they were talking14    about flows on the surface.15              There is an amicus brief that says well, there16    is only about 20 percent left over.  Is that right?  Now,17    I think maybe today -- I'm not sure.  I think maybe they18    said it also includes the water affecting interstate19    commerce that isn't navigable but flows underground, in20    which case I would think that takes care of everything21    else.  Maybe there is a tiny little bit that actually22    doesn't flow underground, and I take think it this23    particular place, the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA24    think it does flow into the Fox River underground, and25    they think it doesn't flow into the Fox River underground,37 1    so I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.  I'm trying to 2    get an idea of what the -- what we're talking about. 3              MR. WALLACE:  Well, one of the rules specified 4    by the Corps in its elaboration of its regulations as to 5    what waters can affect interstate commerce are those that 6    are used as habitat by migratory birds protected under 7    bird treaty acts or that migrate between the states, which 8    happened to be the basis on which jurisdiction was 9    asserted here, on the basis of the factual showing that10    was made to the Corps by an Illinois state agency dealing11    with birds.12              And perhaps if we get away from this particular13    cite for a moment, much of the battle would be about the14    so-called prairie potholes in the Dakotas and adjoining15    states where about 50 percent of the waterfowl in this16    country breed.  Under petitioner's position, as I17    understand it, the commerce power would enable Congress to18    protect the winter habitat of duck species and other19    waterfowl in the Chesapeake Bay area with all of its tidal20    waters and navigable rivers and et cetera, but not to21    protect the summer breeding habitat of these same22    waterfowl.23 24 25          QUESTION:  I don't think that's his position.  Ithink his position is not that the commerce power doesn'tallow you to protect them. It's that the navigable waters38 1    aspect of the commerce power doesn't allow you to protect 2    them, and if Congress wants to come back and exert its 3    commerce power generally, it would be a different issue. 4              MR. WALLACE:  That is a statutory argument, but 5    he also is making the argument that that interpretation is 6    one that should be adopted because otherwise there would 7    be constitutional doubt about the authority of Congress to 8    protect this bird habitat, and of course any scientist 9    would look at this question and say, well, it's futile,10    it's ineffectual to be able to protect the habitat that11    they use in one season but not to be able to protect the12    habitat that they use in another season, the breeding13 season.14              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, just to be clear on one15    thing, it is the Corps' position, is it not, that the16    Phase III water, their power to regulate the Phase III17    water applies whether or not the isolated ponds have an18    underground connection to navigable waters?19              MR. WALLACE:  That is correct, and the so-called20    prairie potholes are perhaps the prime example of that.21    The waters here, that's a more difficult inquiry.22    Certainly they serve as storage for what would otherwise23    be flood waters during periods of heavy rain that would24    cause overflow. That was part of what the Corps had to25    deal with in dealing with this application.                                  391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Do the states exercise any regulationover the prairie potholes?          MR. WALLACE:  They do.  This whole area is oneof concurrent and overlapping authority between the statesand the Federal government, as the states that have filedamicus in our support have pointed out.          QUESTION:  Maybe the Federal government wascontent to protect the navigable waters from pollution andto leave the problem of the pollution of waters that don'taffect the navigable waters to the states.  It's aperfectly rational approach.          MR. WALLACE:  Well, that is exactly contrary towhat the Senate committee said in adopting the 19771011121314    amendments.1516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But I mean, this case, it seems tome, does point up the problem that petitioner's counselraised quoting from page 1 of the blue brief, it is theprimary responsibility of the states to eliminatepollution and to plan development and use of land.  Hereyou have a 47,000-page report, did I hear that correctly,that the Corps of Engineers issued?          MR. WALLACE:  This was a very --          QUESTION:  It seems to me that this illustratesthat the way in which the Corps has promulgated itsregulation departs from the design of the statute.40 1              MR. WALLACE:  Well, the Corps grants all but 2    less than one percent of applications each year, and about 3    85 percent of the permits that it issues are issued under 4    general permit programs which are streamlined and do not 5    require individual inquiries into the categories that they 6    fall, if certain conditions are met in the application. 7              QUESTION:  I don't see how that should affect 8    our determination. 9              MR. WALLACE:  Well, what we had in this case was10    what turned out to be a very complex inquiry, although11    petitioner characterizes that it's trenching on local land12    use planning functions, but local land use boards seldom13    have to deal with a project of this magnitude, and its14    potential and long-range effects on the people who will be15    affected by it in their posterity, which is why the states16    supporting us say that the special expertise of the Corps17    and of the other agencies, state and Federal, that weighed18    in in this process, and of course responses were received19    from petitioner and its supporters, were so important,20    because what was implicated here was not only dangers to21    migratory birds but a question of possible contamination22    of an aquifer used by thousands of people for their23    drinking water.24              QUESTION:  Has Illinois showed no interest at25    all or concern about this particular site?  Is this a41 1    situation where the state has just turned its back and 2    said, we don't care? 3              MR. WALLACE:  The state agencies participated in 4    the Corps proceeding.  It's true that they initially 5    licensed a plan to which many mitigation measures were 6    added by the state so that the plan would have been a much 7    better one if the Corps had approved it than what 8    petitioner started with. 9              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace. Mr. Bishop,10    you have four minutes remaining.11              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP12                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER13              MR. BISHOP:  Justice O'Connor, the State of14    Illinois rejected our first permit application, made us15    reapply.  We filed a 1700-page application, there were an16    additional set of public hearings. They subjected the17    project to 51 conditions before they would let us proceed.18    Cook County engaged in the largest, longest permit19    proceeding it had ever engaged in over this project.20              Let me say that the act is not open ended. It's21    not that any connection will do.  The Corps -- and one of22    the amicus briefs on the other side from the wetland23    scientists claims that isolated ponds are in fact somehow24    connected on the surface or through groundwater to the25    navigable waters, but the fact is any change made in the42 1    landscape will make some -- have some effect on the flow 2    of water.  I just switched the gutter on my garage so that 3    it drains onto an impermeable surface where the water 4    evaporates rather than onto the garden where it goes down 5    into our water table and ends up in Lake Michigan. 6              The Corps cannot use this language which 7    requires some physical connection to the navigable waters 8    to extend its jurisdiction in the same way that it's now 9    extending it endlessly through the effects commerce strand10    of the commerce power, so -- and as to groundwater, I did11    not and certainly do not mean to suggest that the Corps12    can regulate any water that flows into groundwater.  The13    law is clear in the 7th Circuit that the Corps does not14    have jurisdiction over groundwater.  Other courts, the 5th15    Circuit, for example, has held that if the groundwater16    recharges surface water, there's jurisdiction.  That's17    simply an issue that is not in this case, and I do not18    concede that if there is any connection to the groundwater19    here that that would be jurisdictional. And the record in20    this case which is 47,000 pages long contains no basis of21    jurisdiction, no sourcible authority at all other than22    presence of migratory birds on these waters.23              The parade of horrors that Mr. Wallace has24    trotted out should also not be believed.  The Clean Water25    Act is not out there by itself protecting clean water, or43 1    birds.  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act which is authorized 2    under the treaty power gives Congress the authority to 3    protect birds and their habitats. The spending power has 4    been used to great effect in the prairie potholes region 5    whereas this Court considered in the South Dakota case, 6    the Federal government has either acquired outright or 7    bought easements over more than a million acres, and this 8    is 20 years ago, more than a million acres of prairie 9    potholes.  So taking out this strand, the bird rule and10    the other waters rule, this strand from the Corps'11    jurisdiction will have and should have no impact on what12    Congress can do under the other statutes.13              If you address this case as a statutory rather14    than a constitutional case, it would also want to address15    the question whether Congress can come back with a16    different plan to protect clean waters. What we don't17    believe the government can plausibly assert is that the18    terms navigable waters defined as waters of the United19    States, given the history, given the legislative history,20    given the historical usage of those terms, in this Court21    and other statutes, extends to isolated ponds regulated by22    the states.23              And finally on the -- as to the rule of lenity,24    I would recommend that the Court follow the --25              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Bishop.441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BISHOP:  Thank you, Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)45
