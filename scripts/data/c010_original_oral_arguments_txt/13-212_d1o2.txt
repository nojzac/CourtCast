Wurie.      Welcome back.      (Laughter.)     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBENON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      The facts of this case, United States v.Wurie, I think, illustrate why any categorical rule thatwould preclude searches of cell phones incident toarrest would be inconsistent with historical practiceand detrimental to law enforcement.      This is a case where what the officers didwas see a phone ringing.  On the outside screen, thecaller was identified as "my house."  The officersopened up the phone, pressed one button to see that thecall came in from "my house" and pressed another to seewhat the phone number was.  That's all they did.      That kind of a search serves valid,time­honored functions in the search situation ofhelping to ascertain the identity of the offender.  Thiswas a crucial fact because a few minutes later, WurieAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial4￼1 lied about where he lived, which was relevant to the2 police ultimately obtaining a warrant to search his3 house. They didn't know where he was. They would not4 be able to ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not ­­ I'm not6 sure. If he was at the precinct, they could have gotten7 a warrant, and once he lied about his arrest, they would8 have known he wasn't living there and would have gotten9 a warrant.10 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, you could11 almost always say in search­incident­to­arrest cases12 that the police could have gotten a warrant. It's ­­13 I'm not talking about cases where somebody is carrying a14 gun and the police take the gun off them and ­­ and they15 secure it that way. But in all of the other cases that16 you could imagine that involve searches for evidence,17 letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds,18 which have been discussed here, once the officer has it,19 you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in20 it because that could be done under a warrant. There's21 no time constraint. There's no destruction of evidence22 constraint.23 Here, in fact, there actually is a24 destruction­of­evidence threat with respect to the25 general category of cell phones, and that's what thisAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial51 Court has been asked to look at, the general category,2 cell phones and smartphones.3 We discussed earlier the threat of remote4 wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter5 to that. There is the other threat that I think is even6 more critical to law enforcement today, and that is7 encryption. Because if the phone turns off and becomes8 encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for9 a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if10 they can break through the encryption and actually11 obtain the evidence.12 So to the extent that the traditional13 destruction­of­evidence rationale justified the search14 of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional15 items, it applies even more strongly with respect to16 cell phones than it does with most of the items that17 might be seized from a person.18 So Wurie, I think ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please tell me about20 encryption, because I know people can encrypt, but I21 thought they had to do that when they put the22 information in the phone.23 MR. DREEBEN: No. As best I understand it,24 Justice Sotomayor, many smartphones today are equipped25 with built­in encryption. Apple has hardware encryption￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial6￼1 and software encryption. Samsung and HTC and other2 brands are quickly following with strong encryption.3 The encryption is deployed in a way that if you don't4 have the key, the data that's on the phone is useless.5 The key is often stored in memory and it's accessible6 only when you can get into the phone.7 Now, if the phone is on and functioning8 because the person has been arrested while they are, for9 example, making a phone call, you can get access to the10 phone and you can attempt to get information from the11 phone without the encryption key being an obstacle. But12 if the encryption is deployed, that can sometimes be an13 insuperable barrier even to the manufacturer.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how on the15 scene the police are going to look at everything in a16 cell phone anyway. They've got to be doing something to17 save it. If the encryption can be ­­18 MR. DREEBEN: Well, no. The ­­ the evidence19 is ­­ the information on the phone is encrypted ­­ this20 is my understanding, Justice Sotomayor ­­ but the phone21 itself has the key to decrypt it because the user22 obviously wants to get access to the information.23 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you have a problem.24 Apparently, neither you nor I actually have this on25 their phone, as far as I know. So I'm imaginingAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial7￼1 something. Maybe you have it. There is some kind of2 system that once it goes "bzzz," you never can get the3 stuff again except after eight months, and when this4 "bzzz" happens, is it happens at least ten minutes after5 the arrest and not before, so the policeman would have6 time to look at it. But the ­­ by the time you get to7 the stationhouse, the "bzzz" has already happened, so8 now nobody else can. Maybe there is such a thing. I've9 never heard of it before this minute or before the10 briefs. Well, why wouldn't ­­ you see I'm similarly11 incredulous about it from my tone of voice because I12 don't see why somebody who wanted to "bzzz" actually to13 keep the police away wouldn't do it after 30 seconds.14 MR. DREEBEN: So if you have an iPhone,15 Justice Breyer, and I don't know what kind of phone that16 you have ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't either because I18 can never get into it because of the password.19 (Laughter.)20 MR. DREEBEN: It's encrypted. And that's21 the problem. The phones are set up to protect the data22 and I think this is something also revealing about ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: My point is, somebody who24 really wants to go to all that trouble will surely have25 it turn off after 30 seconds and the policeman won't beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 able to look at it either.2 MR. DREEBEN: Not all criminals are so3 clever that they manage ­­4 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Well, but the dim5 criminal who is thinking about the magistrate at the6 station but not thinking about the policeman. I mean,7 you see what I'm doing with my questions?8 MR. DREEBEN: I think ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm casting a little cold10 water on this as a rationale.11 MR. DREEBEN: Yeah. And I ­­ my response to12 you is that having tried to ascertain the empirical13 reality of this problem, it is greatly feared by law14 enforcement. We've documented that by the numerous15 studies, the National Institute of Standards and16 Technology study that talks about the grave concerns17 that encryption's raised. It's not the biggest problem18 if you get the phone in an active state and you can19 begin to look through it. It does have unpredictable20 capabilities of becoming encrypted if it's turned off or21 if certain apps are deployed on22 reason ­­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:24 phone going anyway till you can25 do something with it.it.  And for thatBut you have to keep theget to a place where youAlderson Reporting Company8￼Official91 MR. DREEBEN: A lot of these searches occur,2 Justice Sotomayor, at the side of the road where the3 officer opens ­­ in the Riley case, the officer opened4 the phone right on the heels of the arrest and he5 immediately saw evidence that the individual was a gang6 member, something that he hadn't had personal knowledge7 of before, because every letter K was preceded by a C,8 which indicated to him it meant Crip killer, which9 indicated he was a member of the Bloods gang. So it's a10 very common thing for officers to take advantage of the11 information that's on a phone just the way that they12 would take advantage of the information that's on a13 person to find out who they are dealing with.14 And I think it was asked in the Riley15 argument whether there were instances in which phones16 have been used to trigger dangers. And there are17 instances in which people have used their cell phones18 right before an arrest to call in a posse of their19 accomplices to basically attack the police. And by20 looking at the cell phone quickly, if it's available to21 the ­­ to the officers, they can look quickly and see if22 there was a text sent in the last five minutes or a23 phone call that might actually protect their safety,24 which is another one of the traditional justifications25 of search incident to arrest.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial10￼1 This is a categorical exception, as the2 Court recognized twice last term, both in Maryland v.3 King decision and in the McNeely decision, the Court4 recognized that search­incident­to­arrest was a5 categorical exception to the normal warrant requirement.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, something7 that you said about the encryption. What ­­ what is the8 experience of the police? Isn't it so that most cell9 phones when they're found on a person are not open,10 that ­­ that they are locked?11 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I would not12 be able to answer a question about what condition most13 cell phones are found in. The fact that this issue has14 arisen repeatedly in cases across the country indicates15 that at least in a significant number of cases, the16 phones are not locked and the officers are able to17 obtain access to the information.18 Now, if they are not able to obtain access19 to the information, I want to tie this back to things20 that could give the Court some comfort if the Court were21 concerned about the possibility for police searching too22 much evidence in cell phones that's not relevant to the23 crime for which the person is arrested or his identity.24 Now, we talked earlier about the crime of25 arrest limitation, which I think would screen out aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial11￼1 great many, not all, minor crimes. The Court has, at2 least in the Welsh v. Wisconsin case, talking about3 exigent circumstances justifying an entry into the home,4 distinguished between serious and minor crimes. That's5 another possible line that the Court could explore. I'm6 not as much in favor of that one because I do think that7 the officers have an interest in determining, no matter8 who they have arrested, who that person is, because the9 person could pose an unknown threat even if they are10 stopped only for a traffic violation. Ascertaining11 their identity through their cell phone is a useful way12 to do that.13 There are also potential duration limits on14 a search­incident­to­arrest. As its name indicates,15 it's incident to the arrest, and this Court's decisions16 have described the lowering or reduction of expectation17 of privacy of an arrestee as occurring for a reasonable18 time and to a reasonable extent after the arrest, then19 other Fourth Amendment doctrines kick in. So to the20 extent that most of these searches are going to occur21 either at the scene of the arrest ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Once we put in that23 limit, you'll just download the phone at the station and24 everything, their medical records, their tax returns,25 even when they're not relevant to the crime, will beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial12￼1 part of your database.2 MR. DREEBEN: Okay. Well, that ­ that is my3 last potential limiting principle. This Court need not4 consider in this case the consequences of downloading5 the entire contents of a cellphone to a UFED, a6 universal forensic extraction device which the briefs7 have talked about. That didn't happen in either of8 these cases. These cases involve manual searches of the9 information that's available to the user of the phone.10 Once the information has been captured into11 an electronic database separately in an extraction12 device, there is at least an argument that at that point13 the evidence is preserved and potentially the warrant14 requirement would have a different application, at least15 if the search of that forensic database was going to go16 beyond ascertaining identity and verifying officer17 safety considerations.18 The Court does not need to examine that in19 this case. It may well be that expectations of privacy20 do not exist as to information that the user himself can21 quickly access on a phone, the kind of thing the police22 are likely to look at when they make an arrest because23 they are interested in developing evidence that relates24 to the crime, protecting their safety and ascertaining25 identity. They are not really interested in goingAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial5 MR. DREEBEN:6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:7 you tell the difference?8 MR. DREEBEN:9 something that officers would have to develop protocols10 based on changing technology to address. We do not11 claim here the authority to use the phone to access data12 that is not on the phone, in the cloud, and it may well13 be that in the future more information will migrate to14 the cloud, less will be on the phone, and that may shift15 what the officers can actually do.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought the whole17 ideas of smartphones, Mr. Dreeben, and increasingly so,18 was that even the user doesn't know what what's on the19 cloud or not.20 MR. DREEBEN: So to the extent that that is21 true, Justice Kagan, law enforcement officers, to ensure22 they're complying with the Fourth Amendment, would have23 to take the phone off the network. And that is best24 practices. It's discussed in all of the forensic25 manuals that we cited to the Court. You want to takeYes.      Could you tell me howWell, I think that would beAlderson Reporting Company13￼1 through all an arrestee's medical records and2 photographs and so forth.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief suggested a4 limitation with respect to access to the iCloud.Official14￼1 the phone off the network to avoid the remote wiping2 problem, to avoid corruption of data through new data3 coming in. It's sound forensic practice to do that and4 it also serves what we think is a limiting principle.5 Again, the Court doesn't have to decide that limiting6 principle in this case. There's no claim that any cloud7 data was accessed in this case. We're only saying that8 the search­incident­to­arrest doctrine serves a valuable9 function, serves a particularly valuable function with10 cellphones, because they are so commonly used as the11 medium of the commission of crimes. They are carrying12 the same kind of information that the individual13 previously would have carried in paper and it seems14 somehow a little odd to say that because information has15 migrated from paper onto a smartphone that the officers16 have a critical need to obtain ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think it's odd to18 say that we're living in a ­­ in a new world. Justice19 Kagan's questions point out the fact that someone20 arrested for a minor crime has their whole existence21 exposed on this little device. From your argument, you22 want us just to adopt a categorical rule, it's in the23 custody of the police, they can search it. Do you have24 ­­ do you have any limiting principles that we should25 considerate at all as a fallback position?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial      JUSTICE KENNEDY:an expired license.      MR. DREEBEN:necessarily ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:were under the hood in the other case?MR. DREEBEN: In the Riley case, the guns were under the hood and the arresting officers found a green bandana and some red and white Converse shoes, I believe.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The crime of arrest was the expired license.MR. DREEBEN: No. The crime of arrest was the firearms in Riley. It was only after they found ­­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's correct, after thestop, yes.MR. DREEBEN: ­­ the firearms in the impoundsearch did they actually conduct the arrest.  And at    Well, that ­­ that was forSo I don't think it'sAlderson Reporting Company­­ or is it the guns that15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do. The first one that I think has been discussed in both arguments and Justice Scalia has brought it up as well, is that the evidence to be searched, unless there's some exigency, should be relevant to the crime of arrest and the Court can articulate that in a way that would prevent roving searches or speculative searches.Official161 that point the ultimate search that occurred was because2 there was a known propensity of gang members to document3 their use of firearms in pictures. And so that's what4 the arresting officer was looking for. It's no5 different than what he would have looked for on the6 arrestee's person in his wallet. So it wasn't the kind7 of cloud­based search, search into health records. It8 was a scope­focused search.9 So I think that there are limiting10 principles, Justice Kennedy, that you referred to. One11 is when the officer is looking for crime of12 arrest­related material and there is evidence that can13 be plausibly said is crime of arrest­related material on14 the phone, he can look for that.15 The Court could couple that, if it wasn't16 satisfied that that was a sufficient limitation, with a17 scope­based limit which would say that you can't look18 everywhere on the phone where there's no realistic19 chance that there's going to be evidence related to the20 crime of arrest. You can't just rove through the phone.21 You need to keep a scope focus. And that can be22 enforced and would be enforced by defendants, I can23 assure you, through post hoc litigation and suppression.24 And the police would have to conform their conduct to25 the constraints of the Fourth Amendment in conducting￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial17￼1 the search.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by scope? You can look 3 at e­mails but not something else? What would the scope 4   limitation be?5 MR. DREEBEN: It would depend on the crime. 6   So if you were looking for evidence related to the crime 7   of possession of child pornography, you could certainly 8   go through photographs.  If you were looking for another 9   crime, potentially drug trafficking, you would look for10   things like drug ledgers, recent contacts, lists of11   customers and not necessarily in videos.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very hard to13   see how that limit would be applied.  You can see and14   the police would be able to articulate why almost every15   application, every entry in a cellphone would reasonably16   be anticipated to have evidence of a particular crime.17   Obviously e­mails, obviously call logs.  Even, you know,18   Facebook.  I mean, if it's a weapons crime, maybe they've got19   pictures of themselves with guns.  I mean, I have20   trouble imagining what application, what entry police21   could not say it's reasonably likely that there would be22   evidence of the crime.23 MR. DREEBEN: So, Mr. Chief Justice, to the24   extent that you think that's an inevitable25   generalization and there is a certain way of looking atAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial181 it in which that's correct, then the interposition of a2 warrant requirement would do nothing because the warrant3 would say, search the cell phone for evidence related to4 drug trafficking and then the phone would be searched in5 exactly that manner.6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, the point of a warrant is7 that a person who is not involved and is objective8 listens to what the policeman is saying, knowing that9 sometimes, like me or any other human being, a policeman10 can get a little carried away. So if, in fact, he does11 show the warrant, that there is this basis, you issue12 the warrant. Many, many ­­ and if he doesn't you don't.13 It isn't because they're different legal questions.14 It's just you want that third dispassionate mind to15 review what the facts are.16 Now, if that's a purpose of having a17 warrant, how long does it take to get a warrant in the18 mine run of these cases? Is it not a matter of hours in19 most places?20 MR. DREEBEN: It may be in some places and21 not in others.22 JUSTICE BREYER: In some places I'm sure23 it's difficult. But I'm saying most places, major24 cities, et cetera, my guess was ­­ and I want to be25 corrected if I'm wrong ­­ it's a matter of a few hours￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial191 and you could do it more quickly if you needed to. Am I2 right about that?3 MR. DREEBEN: I don't know that you are,4 Justice Breyer.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you are in a6 department that keeps track pretty much. You're much7 more expert than I. And therefore I would like your8 best guess on the mine run of things of a range of time9 to get a warrant.10 MR. DREEBEN: So, Justice Breyer, it varies11 considerably in the 50 States and the Federal Government12 depending on where you are, the availability of13 magistrates, the complexity of the case. I would14 differentiate this from the McNeely case, where the15 Court was pretty confident that you could get a warrant16 quickly. The reason that the Court could be pretty17 confident about that is drunk driving is a very simple18 crime, and the officer has very simple observations in19 order to validate it and there are forms that can be20 prepared to get a warrant.21 With the great ­­ we're talking now about22 every crime for which people are arrested.23 JUSTICE BREYER: I see your point. I see24 your point.25 MR. DREEBEN:￼And the facts are going to beAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial20￼1 more complicated.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Assume a range. But my3 question I'm trying to get to is this. What, from what4 you've said is the harm in saying, yes, you need a5 warrant, but remember, there are exigent circumstances?6 So where is someone ­­ the bell rings on the phone.7 Depending on the kind of crime, it may be pretty8 important to let the policeman answer to find out where9 it's coming from, because it may be other people on the10 gang who are coming with weapons. Or alternatively, if11 you're right on the technology, it may be someone about12 to push a buzzer that will erase the information.13 So remember we have the exigent14 circumstances. If your view of the technology is right,15 they will perhaps be used with common sense and caution.16 But you don't need a special rule other than the rule,17 get a warrant. How will that hurt?18 MR. DREEBEN: That is a special rule for the19 search­incident­to­arrest content. It's ­­ we've20 discussed a variety of special rules, but that rule21 completely compromises the interests in search­incident­to­arrest,22 because they have always assumed that the23 interest in police discovering evidence that could help24 them in the prosecution, that could protect their25 safety, and that would avoid destruction is paramountAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial1 given the reduced expectations of privacy of the2 arrestee.3 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you work with exigent4 Circumstances. Why?5 MR. DREEBEN: No. And this is why I ­­ I6 hope that I can make this clearer, because the encryption7 problem is what makes it impossible for the police to be8 confident that you can take the time to go and get a9 warrant and you won't lose the data forever. Encryption10 kicks in when the phone is turned to a setting that11 automatically will occur on most modern cell phones that12 turns the phone off and then the phone's contents become13 encrypted and that's when you need the password to open14 it up. And if you don't have that password, you're not15 going to be able to do it. And law enforcement's16 forensic labs aren't going to be able to get around it17 in ­­ except with extraordinary efforts and18 extraordinary time.19 So we're not talking about the difference20 here between two minutes to21 at the information. It may22 advantage of looking at it.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:get the warrant and lookingbe months if you don't take    How do you stop it from24 going off?25 MR. DREEBEN:Now, it ­­ I think that one ofAlderson Reporting Company21￼Official221 the interesting things that Petitioner did in the Riley2 case was append to the back of his brief a couple of3 pictures of Apple's iPhone 5 on how you could go into4 the phone, if the phone is configured in the way that it5 was in the pictures that he took, and disable the auto6 lock feature. What Petitioner did not do was provide7 similar information for the 500 or so other phones that8 are on the market and that will be on the market in the9 coming years so that police officers will be equipped10 with a manual that will probably be as thick as the New11 York City telephone book with the various procedures12 that are needed to prevent any phone from going into an13 encryption mode and becoming inaccessible. They don't14 know that at the time they seize the phone, Justice15 Breyer, and that's why exigent circumstances, unless16 it's done as a categorical rule, because I did not know17 whether this phone would encrypt, I searched it, unless18 you do that, then you are basically putting the officers19 at the mercy of technology, which will increasingly be20 able to defeat their ability to conduct the kind of21 routine searches that they have always conducted in the22 past.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they've got24 their own technological front in this battle, too, and25 that's ­­ I mean, to the extent there are flaws in the￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial23￼1 Faraday bag, I wouldn't be surprised if that's not2 improved over the next months or years or whatever.3 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, it's an4 arms race between the forensic capabilities of law5 enforcement labs and the abilities of cell phone6 manufacturers and criminals to devise technologies that7 will thwart them. And they will leapfrog each other at8 times and there may be periods when law enforcement has9 the advantage and there may be period where ­­ periods10 where those people who want to protect against11 revelation of data on the phone will succeed.12 And my only point here is that it would not13 be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on14 today's technology and reasonable projections of15 technology, that the police will just easily be able to16 go and get a warrant, because my experience from the17 people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones18 are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state19 and it's very tough to deal with that. And if the Court20 does have concerns, as many members of the Court have21 expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the22 traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and23 compromise positions.24 This case, I think, as California pointed25 out, both this case and Riley, don't really involveAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial241 totally unpacking somebody's life from their smartphone.2 And I'm not suggesting that the Court should resolve3 these cases by announcing a rule that's just limited to4 the facts of the cases. But if the Court is looking to5 preserve some areas for protection, we've talked about6 limiting the justification for a search, limiting the7 scope of a search, limiting the duration of a search,8 and limiting the intensity in the sense of confining it9 to what can be found manually on the phone.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you ­­ do you see11 was trying to do with the word "exigency?" I was12 to figure out if that's a way of dealing with the13 unknown here, which is your problem. That if, in14 technology is such that the policeman, it's really true15 if he has five minutes to search, he can get this16 valuable evidence and if the technology is such that it17 doesn't even give him five minutes, or if it's such that18 it gives him four or five hours, or if it's such that he19 can press a button, or if it's the opposite and they can20 just cough and encrypt it, well, all that will be fed21 into the word "exigency," which we wouldn't have to22 decide now, but rather, you could make your arguments23 about the real exigency for preventing the destruction24 later in the context of ­­ of what turns out to be the25 technology of the time. That's what was going on.￼Alderson Reporting Companywhat I tryingfact,Official251 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, the reason why2 Robinson adopted a categorical rule is it concluded that3 such case­by­case adjudication for officers in the field4 is completely infeasible. And when balancing the5 important law enforcement interests against the reduced6 expectations of privacy, Robinson struck a categorical7 balance. Reverting to an exigent circumstances analysis8 here would unstabilize all of the law under Robinson.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about a plain view10 analysis? Turn on the phone, see if there's been a11 telephone call within a reasonable amount of time of the12 arrest or ­­ or any message that was sent at the time of13 arrest. That's sort of a plain view situation. It14 would take care of your person with the picture of him15 or herself with guns. It would take care of the call to16 the confederate. It would take care of the ­­ of the17 imminent destruction of the phone.18 MR. DREEBEN: So, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not19 entirely sure how to articulate that principle, but if20 it fits within the crime of arrest plus identity21 principle, then I think it would be a reasonable22 fallback position.23 If I could reserve the balance of my time.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.25 Ms. Mizner.￼Alderson Reporting CompanyORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTOfficialMS. MIZNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I'd like to first talk about the encryptionAlderson Reporting Company26￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6   that we've been discussing.  It's not an issue in this 7   case.  It was not an issue in Riley.  It was not 8   litigated below.  And the government has just now said 9   that there are a lot of phones arriving at a lab in a10   locked state, but do we know whether they're in a locked11   state because they were locked at the time that they12   were seized or did they lock subsequently?13 The number of password­protected phones that14   are open at the time of arrest is pure speculation.  And15   if they're not open at the time of arrest, the16   government's argument about locking is irrelevant.  The17   number of password­protected phones that would be18   inaccessible at a later time is also an unknown and ­­19   and speculative quantity.20 There are devices that can break passwords.21   Technology advances on both fronts.  The government has22   capabilities of breaking the more typical passwords, the23   four­digit, four letter passwords within 15 minutes.  There24   are ­­ you can obtain assistance from manufacturers in25   obtaining the passwords and ability to ­­Officialhouse"?MS.

MIZNER: But what makes the ­­ the10 privacy interest and the associational interest in11 simply the call logs, which the government has talked12 about in Mr. Wurie's case, is that it does contain more13 than simply the numbers dialed. You have the14 associational information that's created by the user.15 In this case, it was linking my house to a particular16 number.17 It can go well beyond that. You can link18 names and nicknames to ­­ and places to a number. You19 can link e­mails to a name and a number. You can link a20 relationship to a name and a number. Doctor, shrink,21 mom, dad. You can link a photograph to a number. You22 can link your number ­­ you can link it to text23 messages. You can link it to other numbers.24 So you can provide pattern ­­ and also25 patterns of calling that provide additionalAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial291 associational data and could indicate the closeness of a2 relationship. How often calls were made, when are they3 made, what's the time of the call, when did it start or4 stop, the length of the call. You can link notes,5 either general or about a particular phone call.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think,7 if the phone rings, can the police answer it?8 MS. MIZNER: The cases that have addressed9 answering the phone have been in the context of search10 warrants for houses where, as the police are searching11 the house, the phone has been ringing. And the courts12 have said that ­­ lower courts have said that where13 answering the phone can be viewed as being within the14 scope of the search warrant, it is permissible for the15 police to answer the phone.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about17 this case where there isn't a search warrant?18 MS. MIZNER: They didn't answer the phone.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The number's in20 plain view. I mean, is answering the phone ­­ can you21 do it or not? You know what number is calling. Is it22 like someone ­­ you're conducting a search on the house23 and somebody knocks on the door? You can open the door,24 right?25 MS. MIZNER: Yes. And they perhaps could￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficialAnd if you ­­ the policeman candoesn't mean that the person onrespond.

MIZNER: Yes. I believe for the associational data and reasons that I have just articulated, that there is an expectation of privacy in the call log.JUSTICE ALITO: But the cell phone company has all that information, doesn't it?Official32￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425alone, but the call log is not limited to that list ofnumbers.

We have my home, which you said is in plain view, my house, and then you have the call log.      What else do we have?MS. MIZNER: That was all that was accessed. We're talking about the phone number that allowed the police to get to a particular premises.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the call log, the numbers called, is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy, and my house is not covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy, then where is the search?MS.

MIZNER: But you wouldn't know that it8 was my house absent the information that the owner of9 the phone had put in.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Why ­­ why is that11 so and maybe I don't understand the facts.12 If ­­ if a phone rang right now and you look at the call13 log and you see what call came in at 12:13, and you know14 that the call came from my house, and you see the number15 from ­­ of the call that came in at 12:13, wouldn't you16 know that that was the number from my house?17 MS.

Well, what is your argument for the proposition, look, when you search a phone, sometimes what you come up with is perfectly public information; sometimes what you come up with is private information. Now, you want to say the absolute rule should be no.      But what's your argument, rather than tryingto say sometimes if you get the private information, no;but if you get the public information, yes, et cetera?MS. MIZNER: Because everything is soAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial391 intermingled on a cell phone or a tablet or a computer,2 you don't know what you're going to be getting when you3 push those buttons and start rummaging through the4 digital contents of the phone.5 JUSTICE ALITO: In determining whether the6 examination of information on a cell phone is ­­7 constitutes a search, what do you think we ­­ we are8 doing? Are we trying to ­­ to ­­ are we answering an9 empirical question, what is the reasonable expectation10 of privacy of a ­­ of a person in 2014 who has a cell11 phone in his or her ­­ on his or her person? Or are we12 legislating what we think is a good privacy rule?13 MS. MIZNER: I think the Court is14 determining whether or not in 2014 an individual has a15 reasonable expectation of privacy against government16 intrusion into a device that carries around an17 increasingly large percentage of somebody's personal and18 private information.19 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Well, a lot of20 that ­­ part of that is the person must act ­­ people21 must actually have that expectation. That must be the22 expectation of people at large in 2014, that they think23 that everything that's on their cell phones is private,24 or they think some of the information on the cell phones25 is private, or they think nothing on the cell phone is￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial40￼1 private. Where do you think we should look to answer2 that question about what people in 2014 think about that3 question?4 MS. MIZNER: I think from the fact that5 people carry them with them in ­­ in a pocket or in a6 purse, that that exhibits an expectation of privacy.7 You don't expect people to be rummaging through your8 pockets or ­­ or through the items you're carrying.9 JUSTICE ALITO: But why is that so? Cell10 phones are different. I'm not going to say for a ­­11 suggest for a second that there are like things that12 existed in the pre­digital area. But in the pre­digital13 era, presumably people didn't have a reasonable14 expectation of privacy in papers, letters, things like15 that that they had, of photos in a billfold, numbers,16 addresses, things that they might ­­ they might be17 carrying on their persons.18 MS. MIZNER: You ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: So how do we determine what20 the ­­ what the new expectation of privacy is now?21 MS. MIZNER: I think people did have an22 expectation of privacy in those items until ­­23 JUSTICE ALITO: Then why was it not a search24 when ­­ when you ­­ you searched the pocket of somebody25 who was arrested and you found the address of someplace?Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial    I believe it is a search,a question of whether it is ajustified by an exception to thethe ­­ the scope ­­ or thethe search incident to arrest.10 category of information that is contained on a cell11 phone?12 MS. MIZNER: Because of the13 interconnectivity of the data, I don't think you can say14 a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in this15 app, but not that app, because you don't know what is16 linked to any other part of the cell phone. So the rule17 that provides the security that the Fourth Amendment is18 intended to give an individual would be to say ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are ­­ are you ­­ I ­­20 I ­­ I'm assuming that what you're saying ­­ you just21 said it a minute ago ­­ the Fourth Amendment, the22 searches incident to arrest are an exception to the23 Fourth Amendment?24 MS.

I thought that that was a given, that incident to the arrest, the police could take the phone. The question is whether they can search it without a warrant.MS. MIZNER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I was responding in terms of just a general expectation that people are not going to ­­ if you ­­ because you're carrying a phone in public, it doesn't mean that you expect that people are going to walk up and remove it from your belt or remove it from your pocket and start searching its contents.Official47￼1 That's exactly the question.2 MS. MIZNER: Because ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have a reasonable ­­4 our rule has been if you carry it on your person, you5 ought to know it is subject to seizure and examination,6 and that's been the rule.7 MS. MIZNER: It's the scope of examination8 that we ­­ that is at issue with a cell phone. A cell9 phone is fundamentally different from a cigarette pack.10 You can open the cigarette pack, you see whether or not11 there is something that is subject to destruction.

If you are18 arrested, we ­­ we can seize it and examine it.19 MS. MIZNER: The question is what is the20 scope of a permissible examination. And when you're21 talking about a cigarette pack, you're looking at22 another physical object. You're not looking at the23 contents of somebody's home.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand.

This is somebody in an area selling drugs where the police have told us they typically use cell phones to arrange the deals and the transfers, and this guy is caught with two cell phones. Why would he have two cell phones?MS. MIZNER: Many people have more than ­­ have multiple cell phones. I ­­ there was no ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really?

MIZNER: That's probably true.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Particularly sincethey're in their pockets, right?      Well, it ­­ does ­­ do you ­­ is itinsignificant, in your view, that the cell phone was amethod for which criminal transactions were typicallyundertaken in this area and that the fellow had two cellAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial501 phones rather than what I would have thought is the more2 normal one?3 MS. MIZNER: Yes. I don't believe that that4 should be a criteria justification for searching either5 cell phone. The ­­ it may be convenient for the police6 to get information related to a crime by ­­ by searching7 without a warrant, but this Court has said repeatedly8 that convenience and efficiency don't override9 individual constitutional rights.10 And sanctioning a general evidence gathering11 search of the entire contents of his cell phone, given12 the current expansive nature of those contents is an13 unwarranted expansion of a traditional search incident14 to arrest, because we are not talking about the kind of15 traditional containers that holds limited, finite16 quantities of ­­ of usually other objects.17 And there is nothing ­­ a seize­and­secure18 rule protects both the individuals' expectations of19 privacy and security and the government's right to20 obtain evidence consonant with the protections of the21 warrant requirement, giving the neutral magistrate an22 opportunity to determine whether there's probable cause23 for the search of the cell phone and to define the24 limits of that search.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben, you￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial51￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have four minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBENON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      A search incident to arrest has always beenconsidered a reasonable search within the meaning of theFourth Amendment, and I think this case illustrates whythat principle well applies to a cell phone.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is a very big confusion of the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment doesn't permit reasonable searches without a warrant.It says you need a warrant for ­­ we've created exceptions to that, but not because a search is reasonable. Virtually every search could be reasonable without a warrant. If you've watched somebody selling drugs, it's very reasonable to go into their house, but absent the exigent circumstance of the drugs disappearing, you can't. So I don't talk about reasonable searches. I talk about ­­MR. DREEBEN: So Justice Sotomayor, the Fourth Amendment doesn't actually say you do need a warrant. It does protect the right against unreasonable seizures, and it describes what warrants must contain.JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only thing itAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial52￼1 prohibits is unreasonable seizures.2 MR. DREEBEN: That's exactly right. That's3 the textual prohibition. This Court has created4 language in its jurisprudence that prefers warrants in5 certain circumstances, but as the Court recognized in6 McNealey last term and in Maryland v. King, the search7 incident to arrest doctrine is a categorical exception8 and this case illustrates why.9 The information that was found on the phone10 was very time sensitive and important to law11 enforcement. It helped fulfill the typical purposes,12 the categorical purposes of the search incident to13 arrest doctrine. It helped verify identity, it helped14 solve the crime that ­­ for which the individual was15 arrested, and it was done in a reasonable and16 nonintrusive manner. There was nothing about this17 search that exposed reams of private data to view.18 To the extent that the data was not in a19 call log really subject to a reasonable expectation of20 privacy at all, it was discovered in a search but I21 think that underscores why the search was limited and22 reasonable. So this case really, I think, exemplifies23 why a categorical rule that respondent urges in this24 case would not be appropriate, and we submit that this25 Court should reverse the Court of Appeals.
