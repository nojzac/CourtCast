Pardon me.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. ZIEVE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasenow in No. 00-6567, Larry Dean Dusenbery v. the Unitedthe Court:          The issue in this case is whether the proceduresused to serve notice of forfeiture of petitioner'sproperty satisfied due process.          The Federal Government forfeited Mr. Dusenbery's$22,000 in 1988 after mailing a notice to him at theFederal prison where he was incarcerated.  It is notdisputed that he did not get the notice.          The -- the Government argues that its 1988procedures satisfied due process whether or not the noticewas received.  However, in light of the circumstancespresented here, including the Government's control overthe prisoner's location and knowledge of the prisoner'slocation at all times and its control over prisonprocedures, due process requires the Government to useprocedures that offer assurances of delivery to the inmate31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425addressee and not just to prison personnel.  Suchprocedures --          QUESTION:  Well, you take the position that it'snot sufficient that there be staff at the prison whodeliver mail to the inmates?          MS. ZIEVE:  That, in and of itself, is notsufficient.  The -- the procedures need --          QUESTION:  A procedure whereby a prison employeedelivers certified mail to prisoners is inadequate inyour --          MS. ZIEVE:  That -- that, in and of itself, isinadequate as -- although --          QUESTION:  Is in adequate?          MS. ZIEVE:  Is inadequate, although thoseprocedures --          QUESTION:  How can that be under any of our caselaw, that that would be in adequate per se?          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, the -- under this Court's caselaw, what's required when the notice is served isdetermined by a consideration of a balance of factors inlight of the circumstances.  And that --          QUESTION:  Well, we've never required actualnotice in any case, have we?          MS. ZIEVE:  No, although there is somesuggestion of that in -- in a couple cases, for instance,4 1    Phillips Petroleum.  But in -- in the cases discussed in 2    the briefs, there is not a requirement of actual notice, 3    but at the same time, the Court assumes that the mailed 4    notice or the form of notice will be received, and the 5    Court hasn't considered a case where it was uncontested 6    that individual -- an individual was entitled to notice 7    and yet the notice wasn't received. 8              QUESTION:  Well, but that's going to happen 9    sometimes with any sort of notice except the requirement10    of actual receipt by the individual, and we've never felt11    that destroyed the validity of the notice.12              MS. ZIEVE:  That's true, Your Honor, but in the13    circumstances presented here, consideration of the balance14    of factors leads to a requirement the procedures that15    would satisfy those factors would also lead to actual16    notice.  For instance, today the Government uses17    procedures under which, after the mail is received by the18    prison, there's not just some vague distribution process19    at the prison, but the mail is signed for.  In the mail20    room, there's a log book kept, and when it leaves the mail21    room a log book is kept that is ultimately signed for by22    the inmate.  And this chain of receipts helps to ensure23    that there's extra care and attention paid with the24    delivery of the notice.25              QUESTION:  Would you be satisfied with that if51    that had been the case here? 2 3    followed. 4 5    was going to say even though there was no receipt 6    signature, but I guess under the procedures now, the -- 7    the prisoner would have signed a log.  Is that right? 8              MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, he would have signed a log. 9    And if he had a challenge and he has a signature, he's10    going to lose, and if there is no signature -- excuse me.11              QUESTION:  The procedure that was in place for12    certain kinds of mail that was labeled special mail -- if13    that had been -- if that had applied to notices in this14    category -- special mail, as I understand it, could be15    opened only in the presence of the prisoner?16              MS. ZIEVE:  That's correct.17              QUESTION:  And if that had applied, that old18    rule had applied to this category of mail, you would not19    object to that, would you?20              MS. ZIEVE:  Well, the special mail opened only21    in front of the prisoner happens after it's delivered to22    the prisoner.  I think it's helpful that the FBI and the23    DEA, in recent years -- the Government writes in its24    brief, in recent years, have considered forfeiture notices25    and labeled those as special mail, but the procedure still6MS. ZIEVE:  Yes.  If those procedures had beenQUESTION:  Even -- even though there was -- I 1    needs to be adequate to get to that point where you're 2    standing in front of the prisoner opening the mail. 3              QUESTION:  Ms. Zieve, I'm -- I'm not sure what 4    -- what is the general principle of which you assert the 5    rule that you urge upon us in this case is -- is just an 6    exemplar.  Is the general principle that when the 7    Government is in charge of the delivery system, there must 8    be actual notice evidenced by a signature of whoever it's 9    delivered to?10              MS. ZIEVE:  Your Honor, that's one important11    factor, but the case here is even easier because there are12    -- there are numerous --13              QUESTION:  You're not urging that when the --14    that the distinctive factor is that the Government is in15    charge of the delivery system because that would have been16    the case in the old post office when -- when the post17    office was actually part of the Federal Government.  So,18    that's not the principle.  Right?19              MS. ZIEVE:  That's not the only factor.  Here we20 have not --21              QUESTION:  What -- what is the principle?  When22    the Government is in charge of the residence?  Right?  So,23    we would need a similar rule for all members of the armed24    forces.25              MS. ZIEVE:  There are several key factors here,71    and I don't think you can separate out one circumstance2    from the rest.  The inmate --3              QUESTION:  Well, you said the first one isn't4    it.  Right?  I don't understand.  If neither one alone is5    enough, I don't know why all in combination turn out to be6 enough.7 8 9                MS. ZIEVE:  Because that's the circumstances.      There's a body of circumstances presented here.  The      inmate's location is not just easily ascertainable by the      Government, but determined by the Government.  The      procedures used for --                QUESTION:  Well, that would apply -- that would      apply to all members of the armed forces.                MS. ZIEVE:  The procedures used for delivery are      also determined by the Government, and --                QUESTION:  That would also apply to the armed                MS. ZIEVE:  And the Government is in an adverse19    position, which I think requires additional cross checks20    in the system to ensure that care is taken because the21    Government doesn't have incentive to identify and rectify22    inefficiencies on its own.23              QUESTION:  You really think that that's24    realistic here?  You would not urge us to apply this rule25    in a civil action where your client was being served a81011121314151617    forces.181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9paper by -- by someone who is not the Government.          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, if the -- if the serving partywere not the Government, then the person doing the servicewould not be the person who was also in control of thedelivery procedures.          QUESTION:  I understand that.          MS. ZIEVE:  So --          QUESTION:  So, you have not urged the rule in      that case, only when the Government is -- is the opposing10    party.1112131415161718192021    property.22              QUESTION:  You can answer this yes or no.  Do23    you assert that your rule would apply in that situation or24    not?  All of the circumstances are the same.  The only25    difference is the complaint was not filed by the                                   9          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, I'm not trying to be evasive,but it's hard to answer without knowing all thecircumstances there.  For instance, what would be the --          QUESTION:  All the other circumstances are justlike this one except that the complaint was not on behalfof the Government.  It was behalf on a private individual.          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, then the private individualwouldn't have control over the procedures.  It might bethat mailing wasn't -- wasn't adequate in thatcircumstance.  It might have to do with the value of the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Government, but by a private party.          QUESTION:  Say it was for an ordinary debt, thatthe prisoner owed money and the creditor brought suit.          MS. ZIEVE:  It might not apply in thatcircumstance, but whether or not it does, this is aneasier case.          QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you.  I -- I takeit you begin from the premise that mailed notice isadequate for a civil suit, or do you?  I'm going to askthe Government the same thing.  I -- are we supposed towrite an opinion that -- that says that mailed notice isadequate in any civil suit?          MS. ZIEVE:  No.  The -- in fact, under rule 4(d)mailed notice is not adequate under civil suit -- for anycivil suit.  But I don't think --          QUESTION:  From a constitutional -- I know what4(e) says, but from a constitutional standpoint, is mailednotice adequate in any civil suit?          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, I think it's probably notadequate in any civil suit.          QUESTION:  All right.  What is -- what is itabout this that makes mailed notice adequate whereasapparently there's another class of cases in whichpersonal service is required?          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, this case --                            101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  You -- you begin I -- I think withthe assumption that mailed notice would be adequate, andthe question is, are these mailing procedures adequate inthis case?          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, no, Your Honor --          QUESTION:  But I'm -- I don't want to have youtake a position you don't take.  But it -- it does seem tome that that is the baseline assumption from where youbegin the argument.  Am I correct about that?          MS. ZIEVE:  Not exactly, Your Honor.  This caseis not really a mailed notice case because the proceduresthat are inadequate are the procedures that happened afterthe mailing.  The mailing is the first step in thedelivery chain, and the question here is the adequacy ofthe procedures after that.          QUESTION:  But I'm asking why is mail adequateat all?  You seem to assume that, and that's fine.  We candecide the case on that basis.  But you make theassumption that if the mail were received, the mailednotice would be adequate.          MS. ZIEVE:  If the mail is received by the          QUESTION:  Yes.  And I want to know why that is.I'm going to ask the Government.  If we have to write thiscase, it would seem to me that at least an argument could1110111213141516171819202122    inmate?2324 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7    forth. 8              But I want to know what your -- your beginning 9    principle is for the due process, elementary, minimum10    standards of service.11              MS. ZIEVE:  The mailed notice is any form of12    delivery -- any form of notice is adequate as to that13    individual if it's received.  The mailed notice is14    adequate when it's received, and in this case, the15    Government's procedures used certified mail so that you16    know that the mail was received.  If the Government had17    mailed the certified mail to the proper prison and it had18    not been received, the certified mail slip never came19    back, then I don't think the mailed service would have20    been adequate.21              QUESTION:  Have any of our cases ever required22    certified mail?23              MS. ZIEVE:  Well, the first case where the Court24    considers whether mailed notices is constitutional in Hess25    v. Pawloski, the mail at issue was certified mail.12be made that personal service is required --          MS. ZIEVE:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- in any civil case.  And then weask if this is a forfeiture or there's some old hangoverfrom the in rem idea that is still somehow affecting useven though we don't talk about in rem anymore and so 1    Subsequent to that, the Court hasn't made a distinction 2    between the form of mail. 3              The Court also hasn't considered the case where 4    mail was sent but not received.  And the Court's cases in 5    Mennonite Board and Tulsa Professional Collection 6    Services, in the cases discussed in the briefs, the 7    question was whether an individual was entitled to notice 8    in addition to publication or posting, not whether -- the 9    Court had no occasion to consider what would happen if the10    notice was mailed but never got there.11              QUESTION:  It seems to me one of the12    difficulties I find with your position, Ms. Zieve, is that13    this inquiry can come up, you know, months and maybe years14    after the actual notice took place or didn't take place.15    And it's one thing to say we have a -- you followed a16    system and that system affords due process, but to have17    every case turn on perhaps an argument between the person18    who's seeking to set aside the service -- I never received19    it -- and someone else saying, yes, you did receive it, I20    think is rather unsatisfactory.21              MS. ZIEVE:  Well, that's why the procedures22    should require proof of verification which the23    Government's procedures do today.  If Mr. Dusenbery was24    served with a forfeiture notice today, he would be25    required to sign for it and there would be no question131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425later about whether or not he received it.          QUESTION:  Was he not --          QUESTION:  Your --          QUESTION:  The question I'd have is we all seemto agree now that the question -- the Government has toprovide reasonable procedures.  Reasonable meansreasonably calculated to give actual notice.          MS. ZIEVE:  Under the circumstances.          QUESTION:  Well, don't say -- there's no suchthing.  There's no such thing.  Under the circumstancesdoesn't add anything I don't think.  You say is itreasonably calculated to give actual notice.  I haven'tfigured out your qualification, how that would work.          But why wasn't this precisely?  Precisely what'swrong with these procedures in your opinion?          MS. ZIEVE:  The --          QUESTION:  Why are they not calculated to giveactual notice reasonably?          MS. ZIEVE:  The 1988 procedures did not provideassurances of delivery because what happened after themail reached the mail room is -- was vague andundocumented.  And as the Government acknowledged --          QUESTION:  I always thought the procedure -- Ithought the -- what -- what -- tell me precisely.  I thinkthe procedure is, A, mailed to a prison.  B, it comes to a14 1    prison, and a person who works for the prison signs for 2    it.  Then the procedure required what?  C.  What was it 3    required?  And then what should it have required? 4              MS. ZIEVE:  The procedure was that the mail room 5    employee picked up the mail and signed the certified mail 6    receipt at the post office, brought it back to the prison, 7    where he entered it in a log book.  A prison employee 8    testified that in 1988 the procedure then would have been 9    that a -- a housing unit staff would have signed when he10    took the mail -- the certified mail out of the mail room.11              QUESTION:  Yes.12              MS. ZIEVE:  He also testified that he didn't13    know what the procedure was after that.14              QUESTION:  All right.  I guess after that -- a15    reasonable person would think the procedure after that is16    you give it to the person it's addressed to.  Now, is -- I17    mean that would be normal in life.  Is there any testimony18    that that wasn't the procedure?  No.1920 that. 2122    procedure, and now you tell me what, in your opinion, is23    wrong with that procedure.24              MS. ZIEVE:  The procedure doesn't require25    verification of delivery and that --15MS. ZIEVE:  No.  There was no testimony aboutQUESTION:  Okay.  Now, we've described the 1              QUESTION:  Okay.  So, in your opinion, it is 2    unreasonable not to have an additional step that the 3    prisoner signs for it. 4              MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, and the reason is this. 5    Because the documentation -- the improved documentation 6    improves delivery.  The -- the Department of Justice Board 7    of Prisons memorandum that the Solicitor General lodged 8    with the Court both in 1999 and 2001 -- it ties improved 9    documentation to improved delivery.10              QUESTION:  Then -- then whenever there's a11    requirement or -- a requirement -- procedure for service12    by mail, it should be certified mail so the person signs13    for it in every case.14              MS. ZIEVE:  In --15              QUESTION:  Ms. Zieve, you couldn't say every16    case because in Mullane regular mail was adequate in that17    under the circumstances, which was heavily emphasized by18    Justice Jackson, those words, under the circumstances.19              MS. ZIEVE:  In Mullane and in some cases where20    there's a class of interested parties where everyone has21    this same interest, it might not be necessary for all22    interested parties to receive the notice.  As the Court23    recognized in Mullane, because there were many24    beneficiaries of a 113 different trusts and they all had a25    identical interests --16 1              QUESTION:  All right.  Then I'll -- then I'll 2    amend my question.  In a case where there is only a single 3    defendant and service is permitted by mail, it must be by 4    certified mail. 5              MS. ZIEVE:  Well, that would likely be 6    reasonable since the burden of doing so is so small and 7    the increased -- the decreased risk of it not reaching the 8    addressee would be -- 9              QUESTION:  You don't mean that it might10    reasonable.  You mean it isn't reasonable not to do it.11    That's your argument.12              MS. ZIEVE:  Right.13              QUESTION:  It isn't reasonable not to do it.14    And I guess a person who thought it was reasonable not to15    do it would say, well, we can't think of everything, and16    you know, it's in the prison, and prisons normally do17    work.  I mean, they're not great, but they have a -- a18    fairly disciplined order.  And so, it's good enough.  And19    your response to that is what?20              MS. ZIEVE:  It wasn't good enough in -- in these21    circumstances.  The Government has shown us --22              QUESTION:  Well, they might -- they might say23    more than that.  They might say we have no reason to24    believe that the prison delivery system is any worse than25    the post office's delivery system.17 1              And I -- I guess it's your -- I guess it's your 2    contention that even if the reason your client never 3    received the notice was -- had nothing to do with the 4    fault of the -- of the prison.  It was the Postal Service 5    that lost the -- the notice on the way.  That would still 6    -- that would still invalidate the service.  Right? 7              MS. ZIEVE:  It would still mean the forfeiture 8    was done without adequate notice. 9              QUESTION:  So that -- so -- which would not be10    the case, I suppose, unless you're going to adopt the11    certified mail rule, which would not be the case for an12    ordinary citizen who is not incarcerated.  If notice is13    sent to an ordinary citizen and the post office looses it,14    unless you adopt the certified mail rule, that would be15    adequate notice.  But in the case of an incarcerated16    person, if the post office looses it, it is not adequate17    notice.  Right?1819202122232425          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, I don't know that it would beadequate notice to serve someone by mail out of prison ifit's not received.          QUESTION:  Well, what is -- what is thestatutory requirement in your view for forfeiture as -- asfar as notice is concerned?          MS. ZIEVE:  The statutory requirement?          QUESTION:  Yes.181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. ZIEVE:  Is publication and notice to theinterested party.          QUESTION:  By mail?  What is the generalstatutory requirement on these forfeiture notices?          MS. ZIEVE:  I believe the statute says by mail,although the Government always does it by certified mail.And it does that --          QUESTION:  Is it in the materials we have in thebriefs?  Is there some copy of that provision somewherethat you're aware of in the briefs?  Don't take a lot oftime if you don't know.  I just thought perhaps you knew.Is in your brief at all?          MS. ZIEVE:  It's on page 3 of the Government's          QUESTION:  Page 3.1011121314    brief.151617    party who appears to have an interest.18              QUESTION:  See, that's why I don't know how to19    do it because, I mean, suppose there's a ship, for20    example.  Take the other extreme case.  People forfeit21    ships.  People have tort actions against ships, and you22    could have ships that are owned by thousands of people,23    for example.  And where you bring the action against the24    thing, it's fairly normal that you don't actually have to25    get the signature of every person who has some interest in19MS. ZIEVE:  It just says, shall be sent to each 1    that ship, for example.  Now, I think, am I not right, or 2    do you have to get the signature? 3              If -- if, for example, you're bringing an action 4    against a thing and the thing is owned by millions, 5    thousands, or hundreds, does the -- do you have to 6    normally, under the rules -- forget the Constitution for 7    the moment -- you have to get the signature on a -- on 8    that notice, a return receipt requested of each person who 9    has an interest in that thing?10              MS. ZIEVE:  Under the statute?11              QUESTION:  Yes.12              MS. ZIEVE:  Now, you've asked a sort of13    complicated question because the statute for an in rem14    judicial forfeiture requires publication, but the15    Government, based on this Court's case law, gives notice16    by certified mail.17              QUESTION:  But I take it your argument would be18    that even if all the signatures are not required in the in19    rem case, there is -- there is a fairness in the procedure20    that would not require actual notice and signatures to21    every ship owner because the owner of the ship at least22    has some right to control the ship.  So, you say, look, if23    -- if they don't pay attention to what's happening to24    their ship, we -- we can tag them with that.25              But the difference between that case and this,20 1    as I understand it, is there is a period between delivery 2    of the letter and what should be the point of receipt by 3    the prisoner when the prisoner is not in control of the 4    process.  The post office has finished its part.  So, if 5    we assume regularity on the post office is normally 6    enough, that isn't enough here because there's a hiatus 7    between where the post office stops and the point at which 8    we hope the prisoner gets the delivery. 9              And I take it you would be satisfied in this10    case, even without a rule requiring actual signature, if11    the Government were required to show, with a greater12    detail than you say it has here, that there was a regular13    procedure, at the time involved here, that makes it just14    as probable that the letter would have gotten from the15    front door of the prison to the prisoner, as it is16    probable that the letter mailed in the box gets to the17    front door of the prison.  You'd be satisfied with that18    kind of a rule, wouldn't you?19              MS. ZIEVE:  Yes.  I'm not -- it's not -- it's20    not important to petitioner how the procedures --21              QUESTION:  How he wins the case as long as he22    wins.  I realize that.23              (Laughter.)24              MS. ZIEVE:  No.25              QUESTION:  I mean, you would -- you would be                                  21 1    satisfied if -- if we had the -- I take it, the same kind 2    of demand for proof of regularity for the period between 3    the front door of the prison and the prisoner's cell that 4    we do from the mailbox to the front door of the prison. 5    That would be a reasonable system.  And -- and you'd be 6    satisfied with it, I would take it, as a general rule. 7              MS. ZIEVE:  Probably. 8              QUESTION:  It would be nice to have a signature 9    requirement, but basically we -- we would have the same10    kind of rule then that we have with -- with respect to11    mail delivery in general.12              MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, but the reason that I emphasize13    the signature is because, as the Bureau of Prisons has14    since recognized, the -- the signature does help to15    improve delivery.  It helps to make sure that this letter16    is treated with some extra attention and care.  It ensures17    that it's not going to get misdelivered to Larry Smith two18    cells over.19              QUESTION:  What do we do with prisoners who20    won't sign?21              MS. ZIEVE:  Well, actually the Board of Prisons22    procedures deal with that, and I think effectively, which23    is on the log book, if the prisoner refuses to sign, then24    the person delivering the mail signs for it stating that25    the prisoner won't sign, which I think is comparable to a22 1    process server giving a contemporaneous statement that 2    service has been completed. 3              QUESTION:  You know, it seems to me we need to 4    focus on some kind of a test, and I thought I understood 5    you to argue for a test that says in these prison cases, 6    there has to be actual receipt by the prisoner.  And I -- 7    I know the Third Circuit and probably the Fourth have a 8    different sort of test, which is that the Government just 9    has to show that internal prison delivery procedures are10    adequate.  Is that an acceptable general statement of the11 test?1213141516171819202122232425          MS. ZIEVE:  They have to be adequate.  My viewis that under this Court's -- the analysis that this Courthas used in its cases, in its due process cases, thatapplying that general statement leads to the same resultthat I'm arguing for here, although if the Court --          QUESTION:  You say it isn't adequate unlessthere's actual receipt.          MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, because those procedures are --it's entirely practicable to do that.  There's -- it isnot difficult to --          QUESTION:  Well, in the event we don't agreewith you, what's your fall-back position?          MS. ZIEVE:  Well, even under the Third Circuit'sformulation, the Court, looking at the 1988 procedures in23 1    the record, such as they are -- those procedures were 2    inadequate.  It's uncontested that he didn't get the 3    notice, and the procedures as described, are inadequate, 4    although for the same reasons as I think lead to actual 5    notice, even if you don't want to go that far. 6              QUESTION:  Why is it that a procedure is 7    inadequate if the procedure is that if we get certified 8    mail, we -- we deliver it to the prisoner?  What's 9    inadequate about that as a procedural standard?10              MS. ZIEVE:  Again, it doesn't provide the11    assurances of delivery that both are feasible because, if12    you're going to deliver it, it doesn't take that much to13    just get the signature, and because I think it's important14    to have cross checks to make sure that the Government --15              QUESTION:  Do we look back at Mullane or at16    Mathews v. Eldridge for our guidance here in establishing17    a standard?18              MS. ZIEVE:  I think either one, Your Honor.19    Mullane states -- sort of states the test in one sentence,20    but I think summarizes the three-part framework that21    Mathews articulates later.  Either way you can reach the22    same result.  The value of the property at stake, the risk23    of erroneous deprivation, the valuable -- the value of24    additional procedures, and the burden on the Government,25    the factors to consider, all lead to same -- to the result24 1    here that the prison should have done more and could have 2    and should have ensured actual notice to inmates in its3 charge. 4              QUESTION:  -- apply this rule to any -- anything 5    other than prisons or are you talking about the 6    circumstances of someone incarcerated by the Government? 7    Is there any other setting in which you would require not 8    merely that certified mail be sent and signed for by 9    someone, but in-hand delivery?10              MS. ZIEVE:  There may be other cases, though11    there also may not be.  This is the easy case.  If there's12    any circumstances where actual notice is required, it's13    got to be these where the Government is both the sender14    and sort of the recipient for later delivery to the person15    who it knows where it is --16              QUESTION:  Why is it the easy case?  It is the17    case, I take it from your argument, because you haven't18    suggested that there might be another setting other than19    where the Government has someone in confinement.20              MS. ZIEVE:  No, I haven't.21              QUESTION:  Is it any part of your argument that22    we should be suspicious of prison officials because they23    may use a refusal to follow their procedures for24    vindictive reasons or anything like that?25              MS. ZIEVE:  That may occur, Your Honor, but our25 1    argument does not rely on any malfeasance on the 2    Government's part. 3              QUESTION:  That's not your argument. 4              QUESTION:  Well, if that's not part of your 5    argument, I don't see why your situation is any different 6    from the military situation where, unless -- unless the 7    serviceman or woman is AWOL, the Government knows right 8    where that person is and the Government is responsible for 9    -- for where that person is.  I don't know why you10    wouldn't have the same rule.11              MS. ZIEVE:  Well, to be honest, I hadn't12    considered the military situation, and maybe there's more13    parallels.  However, there's still the -- the inmate is14    still special in that he has no control over his property.15    There are no proxies looking out for him, for his16    interests.  And the mail, even when it's sent to the17    military, my assumption is that if you get certified mail,18    the soldier is going to sign for it.  The officer will19    sign for it and not someone for later delivery to him20    without any proof or documentation about what happened in21    the interim.22              If the Court has no further questions, I'd like23    to reserve the balance of my time.24              QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Zieve.25              Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. MINEAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This Court has repeatedly held that the noticerequirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied by amethod of notice that's reasonably calculated to provideinterested parties with notice of the proceedings.          The Government's method of providing notice inthis case, this forfeiture case, satisfies that test.  Themethod was by the use of certified mail.  And petitionerdoes not dispute that mails generally are satisfactory forpurposes of notice.  Rather they draw the distinction thatonly in the case of prisoners is that method unwarrantedor unconstitutional.          Petitioner is asserting a constitutionalviolation.  It therefore has the burden of proof ofestablishing the procedures the Government used are10111213141516171819    unconstitutional.202122232425          And I'd like to clarify a point with regard towhether notice was received here or not.  The Governmenthas not submitted that notice was not received.  We simplyare unable to prove that it was not received.          QUESTION:  So, why not just put the burden onthe person who was supposed to get it to prove he didn't271 get it? 2              MR. MINEAR:  Well, that is in fact what the 3    court did.  It didn't -- there wasn't a test it required, 4    but the inquiry was made, and the court concluded that 5    whatever the protestations of the defendant might be, or 6    the prisoner in this case, nevertheless the method that 7    was used here was reasonably calculated to reach him.  And 8    that is all that Mullane requires. 9              QUESTION:  No, no.  Look, what I take it that10    she's arguing for is there's a step missing here and it11    should apply not just to prisoners, apply to anybody who's12    going to have their property forfeited, and that is, you13    give them notice by certified mail so they have to sign14    it.  That's the point.  So, it would apply to everybody,15    armed forces, everybody.  And what's wrong with that?  It16    isn't that hard to do.  It protects pretty thoroughly17    against losing your property without even knowing about18    it.  So, do it.19              MR. MINEAR:  The problem --20              QUESTION:  That's -- that's basically, as I21    understand it, the argument.22              MR. MINEAR:  The problem with that position is23    it's contrary to 50 years of this Court's precedence,24    which has consistently recognized that mailing alone --25    not certified mail -- but ordinary mail, is sufficient to281 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425provide parties with notice.          QUESTION:  Where did the Court hold that?          QUESTION:  Have we ever said that with referenceto a simple contract or tort action?          MR. MINEAR:  No.  All of the cases in which thisissue has arisen in this Court's jurisprudence haveinvolved special procedures.  Nevertheless --          QUESTION:  Well, that's why I'm asking becausein Mullane and subsequent cases, we have tended to saythat the in rem/in personam distinction is -- is not tooclear a line.          Are you arguing for the proposition that, again,in a standard contract or tort case, notice by mail wouldbe sufficient?          MR. MINEAR:  We are certainly willing to defendthe proposition that the Federal Rules of Procedure, whichprovide --          QUESTION:  No.  I'm talking about -- I'm talkingabout due process requirements now.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  And -- and with regard to theFederal Rules, they do recognize that service can beeffected through mail -- through the notice of waiverprovisions that are set forth there, and we would defendthe constitutionality of those provisions which allow theparty to, in fact, accept service by notice.29 1              QUESTION:  If this Court writes a due process 2    opinion, can we say that mail, routine mail, is always 3    sufficient, or are there some cases in which you must have 4    personal service? 5              MR. MINEAR:  Well, the Court can certainly do 6    that.  We might caution that it's not necessary to do that 7    in this case. 8              QUESTION:  Well, I want to know what the 9    principle is that you're -- that controls our case, the10    beginning principle here.11              MR. MINEAR:  The Court has drawn these12    principles largely from common experience and knowledge13    about the instrumentalities that are used for purposes of14    service.  And if we looked at the Mullane case, the Court15    cited that the mails had, through common experience, been16    determined to be a reasonable means for providing service17    in that type of proceeding.18              Now, whether the Court would want to take the19    step of saying that the mails are always adequate in any20    proceeding is a step that's not necessary for the Court to21    take.  And so, I'm hesitant to suggest to the Court that22    it ought to do so.  It certainly does not need to do so in23    this case because this case involves procedures that are24    very similar to Tulsa, to Mennonite, to Schroeder, to --25              QUESTION:  All right.  So, then you are relying30 1    on the fact that this is a forfeiture case and we're -- 2    there's this voice of the past of in rem versus in 3    personam hanging over this -- this argument of yours. 4              MR. MINEAR:  Well, actually no, Your Honor. 5    It's not the in rem nature of the proceedings, but rather 6    it's a -- it's an intersection of two factors. 7              One, this type of proceeding is similar to the 8    proceedings this Court has dealt with previously that are 9    not necessarily in rem.  For instance, probate claims are10    not necessarily -- would not necessarily be treated as in11    rem I think under -- under traditional law.  But it's --12    it's the intersection of the fact that these proceedings13    are similar to proceedings elsewhere that the Court has14    already ruled on and the fact that this Court can draw on15    its long experience the mails are, in fact, as a practical16    matter, a reasonable means for providing service or17    providing notice.18              QUESTION:  I'm just very puzzled by your19    reliance on Mullane when Justice Jackson took such care to20    say this procedure, common trust fund, so many21    beneficiaries, some unknown, some addresses lost -- if we22    use regular mail, the chances are it will get to many, if23    not most, people in the group, and that's good enough for24    that kind of case.  Here we're talking about some $12,00025    that once belonged to an individual, not 113 trusts31 1    combined together in a common fund with hundreds, even 2    thousands of beneficiaries. 3              QUESTION:  Your Honor, Mullane has been extended 4    beyond the facts of its individual case.  And this case 5    is, in fact, quite similar to the Court's most recent 6    decisions, such as Tulsa Professional Services.  In that 7    case, I believe there was some $12,000 in medical fees 8    that were in dispute.  The -- the creditor in that case 9    couldn't count on other claimants, as in Mullane, to10    perhaps make the arguments that that creditor might --11              QUESTION:  Well, but that was with the probate12    proceeding.  And as Justice Ginsburg's questions point out13    and what I've been trying to -- to explore with you, this14    is a case where a person has an ownership interest.  It's15    not that much different from an ordinary contract or tort16 action.17              MR. MINEAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  And we think that18    this case is similar to Tulsa and ought to be treated as19    such.  I'm simply reluctant to urge this Court to go20    beyond the facts of this case and to deal with the21    question of a civil complaint and whether ordinary --22              QUESTION:  I suppose -- I suppose in probate a23    claimant, a debtor claimant, is in much the same standing24    as a person who sues in contract on that claim before the25    person dies.321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MINEAR:  Well, yes.  But probate is verysimilar to the situation here, that the notice that isbeing provided is simply to ascertain whether there areany claims outstanding to the property at issue.  And if aperson does make a claim, then that initiates a judicialprocedure in which further process would be necessary.          But this case is --          QUESTION:  Here there's no doubt about theperson who has the interest.  It was not like sending outa notice:  any interested people come forward.  TheGovernment knows who the person in the world is who has aclaim to this $12,000.          MR. MINEAR:  But, Your Honor, the same could besaid, for instance, in Mennonite with regard to themortgagee, that the person who is -- that -- that was asituation in which there was an interest in -- inforeclosing on a property and selling it at a tax sale.Now, the Government in that situation certainly could haveidentified the mortgagor and simply provided notice bypublication.  This Court said that notice by mail wassufficient.  It was the minimum that was necessary and itapplied in that --          QUESTION:  -- better than publication generally.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- publication is the least33 1    effective, and the Mullane case that you rely on so 2    heavily makes that point. 3              MR. MINEAR:  Yes, and that's the reason why the 4    Government in these situations provides notice by 5    publication, also by notice to the person's last address, 6    and also notice to his current address if it can be 7    ascertained.  In this case, the Government, through 8    reasonable diligence, was able to locate the individual 9    and send notice to his place of incarceration.10              The only thing that distinguishes this case, in11    fact, is that the mails are being directed to a prison,12    and the only real question here is whether the prison13    system is reliable.  And what we established at trial was,14    in fact, it was.  There were procedures in place to ensure15    that the mails were delivered to prisoners.16              QUESTION:  Fine.  Then you would win even under17    their rule because then the prisoner would be unable to18    prove that he didn't get the notice.19              So, assume that that's the rule.  The prisoner20    has to prove he didn't get the notice.  Anyone who doesn't21    -- who actually gets notice loses.  Assume that.  What I'd22    like to know is, assuming that, what is the argument23    against saying where it's a forfeiture case and where the24    forfeiting -- the person who's going to get the property25    knows the address of the individual who would forfeit the341    property, that person has to use certified mail?  What she2    said was the Government does that anyway in forfeiture3 cases. 4          MR. MINEAR:  The argument against that, YourHonor, is that the Due Process Clause simply specifies theconstitutional minimum.  The Government can make adecision to provide more process than is necessary.5 6 7 8 91011 it?12              MR. MINEAR:  The reason -- there -- there are13    several reasons for not recognizing this as a -- a general14    constitutional standard.  One is the fact that it would15    have to be applied to other analogous situations at least16    by a parity of reason-­17              QUESTION:  All right.  And the reason that18    that's wrong is because?  I mean, the harm that it will do19    it other analogous situations.  Give me an example of some20    serious problem that would be caused by such a rule.21              MR. MINEAR:  The rule would, first of all,22    require, for instance, as the Chief Justice has pointed23    out, similar service on the armed services.  It also would24    apply to other situations that might not be documented in25    the record.  For instance, it's my understanding that the          QUESTION:  Fine.  And my question is, what is --if you're in the Government, aside from -- well, it's alittle easier.  Is there any policy reason for not doing35 1    Postal Service delivers mail to dormitories and 2    residential halls in bulk for distribution to the people 3    that live in those halls.  So -- 4              QUESTION:  So, I want an example, since you're 5    writing the address anyway -- I want an example of the 6    problem that would be caused by saying you not only have 7    to write the address, you also have to send it certified, 8    whether it's to dormitories, armed forces, prisoners, or 9    anyone else in the world.  What's the actual practical10    problem that would cause the Government?11              MR. MINEAR:  Well, I cannot say that the12    Government cannot overcome that difficulty, because it13    does in fact use certified mail.14              But the problem is should the Court erect that15    as a constitutional standard, and the difficulties with16    erecting that as a constitutional standard, as I pointed17    out before, is it will be very difficult to cabin that to18    a wide variety of other situations --19              QUESTION:  With certified mail, you have to get20    a signature from the recipient, whereas with ordinary21    mail, you can put it in the slot in your mailbox.  In22    other words, it's often difficult to obtain the certified23    mail signature in a way that it wouldn't be to get the24    ordinary mail slot.25              MR. MINEAR:  That's correct.  And, for361 example -- 2              QUESTION:  But shouldn't it be difficult if 3    you're going to take $20,000 away from them? 4              MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, but again, this case is 5    on -- on par with other cases that involved similar 6    amounts of money. 7              And with regard to the signature -- obtaining 8    the signature, my suggestion is it might be that the 9    litigation will shift from the assertions that we think in10    many cases are -- are untrue, that the person did not11    receive the notice, that, well, a guard signed for me and12    never actually -- I did not refuse to receive it and a13    guard simply signed and said that I refused.14              What we're trying to do from a policy15    perspective, from the Bureau of Prisons' perspective, is16    to eliminate the sort of wasteful litigation that takes17    place over assertions.18              QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, the Third Circuit has19    apparently adopted a test that requires the Government to20    show a little more than that it dropped a notice in the21    mail, and that, in fact, the Government must show that22    procedures at the receiving facility, the prison, were23    reasonably calculated to deliver notice to the intended24    recipient.25              MR. MINEAR:  Yes.371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Is that a -- a standard that theGovernment would find satisfactory?          MR. MINEAR:  We disagree with that, Your Honor,for the reasons set forth in Judge Alito's dissentingopinion on -- on that ground; namely, that it imposesburdens that are not necessary.  The burden is on theperson who's raising the constitutional challenge to showthe deficiency in the procedures, and no deficiency in theprocedures has been shown.          QUESTION:  But your -- your argument, it seemsto me, is premised on the fact that forfeiture is like anin rem proceeding and it's just different.  Assume with me-- I'm not sure that this is -- assume that there's aconstitutional due process requirement for personalservice unless there's some showing of unavailability inthe routine case for contract and tort.  Why should thisbe any different?          MR. MINEAR:  The reason -- the reason why --          QUESTION:  That may be an heroic assumption.I'm not sure that's true.  I think -- let me go back.          Do you know of any State which in an ordinarycivil action allows service by mail as a routine matter?          MR. MINEAR:  I don't know of --          QUESTION:  Absent unavailability or the factthat the person is avoiding the process server or38 1    something like that? 2              MR. MINEAR:  I don't know of any State that 3    allows ordinary mail.  I believe that a number of States 4    have adopted certified mail with return receipt requested. 5    I believe that California follows that pattern.  And in 6    fact, the Federal rules that provide this optional method 7    were based on that -- on that approach. 8              QUESTION:  Okay. 9              But then -- then going back to the other10    question, it seems to me your case is premised on the11    assumption that this is a forfeiture in rem type,12    different action than -- than a routine contract or tort13 action.14              MR. MINEAR:  Well, we certainly do think it15    falls on the side of the -- of the line that this other --16    the other cases of this Court demarcs, namely probate17    proceedings, tax sales, condemnation proceedings, notice18    of forcible entry and detainer proceedings, which are19    basically ejectment proceedings.  All of those types of20    proceedings have involved situations where this Court21    indicated that notice by ordinary mail would be22    sufficient.23 24 25          Now, we go beyond that.  We do provide certifiedmail as -- as a matter of policy.  And it serves animportant policy --391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  May I ask you?  This is prompted byJustice Scalia's question.  Does the Government have anyspecial procedures for people in the military?          MR. MINEAR:  I'm not aware of any specialprocedures that -- that we provide in those situations.For instance, if there was forfeiture --          QUESTION:  And I should think there's a lot ofmail that might -- addressed to a serviceman that might besigned for by the mail orderly or something.  He may neverget the mail.  I'm just wondering if the -- there'snothing in the record about that, is there?          MR. MINEAR:  No.  There's nothing in the recordand it's not clear to me at all that if there was aforfeiture that was directed to a serviceman, it would betreated any differently.          QUESTION:  What about the -- the immunity whilethe person -- there's an immunity that governs people inthe military during the time.  Is it -- what is that10111213141516171819    statute?2021 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  The Soldier's and Sailor's CivilRelief Act.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes, and I'm not sure how thatwould apply in this situation.  It might very well tollthe type of requirement --          QUESTION:  It would toll the statute of                            40 1    limitations because the person could assert immunity for 2    the period that they're in service. 3              MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  I'm simply not certain how 4    that would apply.  But I do know that for general civil 5    procedures -- for civil forfeitures, the regulations of 6    the FBI do provide mechanisms such as mitigation and 7    remission that can ameliorate some of the hardships, where 8    a party can actually show that there was nonreceipt. 9              QUESTION:  But can I ask you a question that10    puzzles me about this?  The -- even before the current11    regulations, there was this special mail category and12    several things fell into it, including letters that the13    prisoner would get from the attorney.  Those have to be14    opened in the presence of the prisoner?15              MR. MINEAR:  That's correct.16              QUESTION:  And then there was this category17    called law enforcement.  And why wasn't a notice of this18    character categorized as law enforcement and therefore put19    within the special mail category?20              MR. MINEAR:  I think for a short while the DEA21    and the FBI did follow the practice of denominating22    certain mails as special mail.  I'm not sure if the23    special mail category existed in 1988.  I don't think the24    record is clear on that.25              I would point out, however, that under the41 1    Bureau of Prisons operations memorandum, there is more 2    protection to providing it by certified mail rather than 3    by special mail, primarily because of the long period of 4    retention of the log books for certified mail.  And so, 5    the practice for -- the current practice of BOP -- 6              QUESTION:  That applies to the Federal system, 7    but the rule we're working with today would apply to State 8    forfeitures as well, the State prisons and the like.  So, 9    your rules don't necessarily tell us what would happen in10    a -- to a State prisoner.11              MR. MINEAR:  No, they do not, although I think12    that the -- the Court can -- can safely assume that State13    prisons do, in fact, provide for mail delivery to their14    prisoners.15              QUESTION:  Would you just comment on the16    suggestion that your opponent has made, in effect, that17    there really ought to be a special rule for people who are18    in the custody of the Federal Government?  And I assume19    with Justice Scalia that would include military personnel20    too.  Is there -- would it make sense to say that when21    they know darned well where a person is, there's no reason22    to have three publications in the local newspaper?  You23    just make sure you get it to -- to where the man is.24              MR. MINEAR:  Well, there's no reason to depart25    -- that's certainly -- the fact that we know where the42 1    person is, certainly does dictate that we contact the 2    person by mail, and that's inconsistent with Mullane and 3    its progeny, that where the address is reasonably 4    ascertainable, the person should be contacted by mail. 5              The fact that we have the person under our 6    control I don't think adds anything to that.  The basic 7    question is, is this notice reasonably certain to reach 8    the inmate?  And if it does, it doesn't really matter if 9    he's at a location of our choosing or some other location.10    It's simply what's important here is, is this method, is11    the procedure reasonably certain to provide actual notice?12              QUESTION:  Is there any court action -- if you13    accepted your -- your points and said, look, they send it14    to the prison.  It's signed for in the prison.  So, up to15    there, it's certified.  And then a person regularly picks16    it up, and this person did, and then delivers it to the17    cell.  Suppose the picker-upper either maliciously,18    negligently, or deliberately didn't give it to the19    prisoner.  Would the prisoner have any kind of claim under20    the Tort Claims Act?21              MR. MINEAR:  I think not under the Tort Claims22    Act because it does exclude intentional torts.  There23    might be the -- the opportunity for either seeking redress24    through the prison administrative remedies or through a25    Bivens type action.  But certainly the problem there --43 1              QUESTION:  -- Bivens type action.  It must be 2    that there's a constitutional right or -- I mean, that's 3    -- but -- but is under the Torts Claims Act negligence? 4              MR. MINEAR:  Under negligence?  There is 5    conceivably an opportunity to seek damages based on 6    negligence, although you'd have to show an absence of -- 7    of due care.  In the case of the Government, the 8    regulations here do certainly provide the sort of 9    reasonableness that we think compliance with would --10    would satisfy the standard.11              QUESTION:  Let me make sure I understand your12    position on one point.  Is it your view that that even if13    you had not use certified mail in this case, but just used14    regular mail and an affidavit by the Secretary that it was15    mailed and so forth, that that would be constitutionally16    sufficient?17              MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  It's our view that that would18    be constitutionally sufficient.  The procedures that we19    use, with regard to certified mail, are something that we20    do beyond constitutional requirements in order to --21    primarily to ensure that we can disprove false claims of22    nonreceipt.23 24 25          QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, am I correct that the --that the current method of simply providing written noticeis -- you -- you maintain that that is method that441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Congress has specified in 19 U.S.C. 1607(a)?          MR. MINEAR:  The method of -- the requirement ofproviding written notice I believe is in 1881, on page 3of our briefs.  And all that Congress has specified isthat -- oh, excuse me.  It is 1607(a).  I'm mistaken.Written notice of seizure, together with information --          QUESTION:  This is on page 3, Mr. Minear?          MR. MINEAR:  On page 3, and the -- at the end ofthe first indented paragraph.          It provides that written notice of seizure is tobe provided.  It does not specify mail --          QUESTION:  Shall be sent.          MR. MINEAR:  Shall be sent.          QUESTION:  Shall be sent.          MR. MINEAR:  To each party --          QUESTION:  What do you think that means?  Howdoes one normally send things?          MR. MINEAR:  Well, normally by mail, and wethink that it's --          QUESTION:  It doesn't say shall be sent bycertified mail.  I think it's -- a fair reading of whatCongress thought was adequate was -- was by mail.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  I think that by ordinarymail.  And I think -- as I say, the certified mailprocedure is something that the Bureau of Prisons and the45 1    agencies have adopted in order to disprove false claims of 2    nonreceipt.  That's its principal purpose. 3              But it's our position that ordinary mail is 4    sufficient here as it would be in the wide variety of 5    other cases, comparable other cases, this Court has 6    addressed. 7              QUESTION:  How do you think the Sixth Circuit 8    standard differs from the Third Circuit's and the 9    Fourth's?10              MR. MINEAR:  I think as a practical matter, Your11    Honor, there's primarily a question of the burden of12    proof.  Under the Sixth Circuit's standard, we are simply13    -- if we are challenged, if there's a challenge to whether14    mail was -- was received or not, it's the obligation of15    that party who's raising the challenge to prove the lack16    of reasonableness.17              QUESTION:  Well, but here the Government is18    seeking to forfeit property from someone.  Maybe it's not19    unreasonable to think that the Government has the burden20    of proving that notice was given or reasonably calculated21    to be given.22              MR. MINEAR:  Well, the Government met that23    burden in this case, but again, we don't think that that24    should be the test.  Rather, we think that it's the25    obligation of the party to show that -- what defects are46 1    necessary.  And in this case, the only defect -- the only 2    proof of inadequacy that petitioner showed was his claim 3    that he did not receive the notice, and we in return 4    indicated there were procedures in place that would have 5    ascertained the mail. 6              Now, because the issue is joined, it's likely 7    the Government would be required or would find it 8    necessary or useful to put forward information about 9    procedures.10              But the problem with the Third Circuit standard11    is it requires that we, ex ante, at the very beginning of12    the process, go through and determine what procedures are13    in various prisons.  And that doesn't seem particularly --14    that seems particularly inappropriate with regard to State15    prisons where we think it's reasonable for us to send --16    to mail the receipts to the prisons with the expectation17    that those State prisons will forward the mail18    appropriately.19202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, we have a smattering ofcourts of appeals cases addressing the issue that we'vegot today, but beyond that, I don't know how muchlitigation there is about this.  Do we have any indicationof how much time in forfeiture cases is spent litigatingthe question of notice?          MR. MINEAR:  I don't know the answer to that,                            47 1    Your Honor.  As we point out in the brief, in the year 2    2000, the Government, the DEA and the FBI, sent out 3    roughly 9,000 notices of forfeiture to their incarcerated 4    prisoners.  Now, how many of those are contested, I don't 5    know the answer to that, but certainly there is the 6    possibility of a substantial clog on the courts, 7    particularly over claims of nonreceipt which are so easily8 made. 9              QUESTION:  Well, except that I -- I don't know10    that the -- that that argument really favors you.  There11    would be certainly some questions of -- of adequacy of12    signature and so on.  But if there were a -- a certified13    mail kind of signature requirement, I'm guessing that14    institutionally it might be of some help to the courts15    because I'm -- I am assuming that in most cases there16    wouldn't be any contest.  If the Government had the17    signature, it would go forward.  If it didn't have the18    signature, it would wait until it got one.  So, I am -- I19    am assuming that, knowing nothing, if I don't know any20    facts beyond what I know now, that there might be an21    institutional advantage in a rule that required the -- the22    kind of proof that -- that your friend on the other side23    wants.24              MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I think that -- you25    know, that the Department of Justice, and the Bureau of48 1    Prisons in particular, has tried to be helpful in that 2    regard with -- with regard to providing this type of 3    process.  But we simply do not believe that it's required 4    by the Due Process Clause and was not required to be in 5    place in 1988 when this case arose. 6              QUESTION:  But would you -- would you agree that 7    there can be an institutional consideration in a closed 8    case in deciding what due process does require? 9              MR. MINEAR:  That certainly is a factor that the10    Court could weigh, but again --11              QUESTION:  Well, you'd have no problem if we --12    if we held the way you've asked us to hold.  I mean, that13    -- that institutional problem would disappear if you put14    it in the mail and there are prison procedures in place,15    as there are in every prison, everything is okay.  Right?16              QUESTION:  There wouldn't be any litigation17    about that.18              QUESTION:  There wouldn't be any litigation.19              MR. MINEAR:  Well -- well, no.  No, there isn't,20    but there are also State prisons that do need to determine21    what procedures they would follow.  And my guess is there22    are a large number of State prisons that follow the23    practice that was in place in 1988, namely that certified24    mail may be signed by the -- by the prison officials, but25    they may not have recorded signatures with regard to the491 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112    problem.13              MR. MINEAR:  Well, no, we wouldn't.  At the14 same --15              QUESTION:  But if we -- if we said that because16    there is a gap between mail delivery to a prison and17    delivery to a prisoner and, for that reason, there must be18    some indication of the procedure for getting the mail to19    the prisoner, then you might have a -- a problem and there20    might be an institutional advantage in a signature rule.21    Wouldn't there?22              MR. MINEAR:  Well -- well, that's correct.  But23    again, I think that the baseline, the constitutional24    baseline, here should be that ordinary mail suffices, and25    it's left to the --50actual receipt by the inmate.          QUESTION:  And you think it's not reasonable forthe Government go assume that the State prison proceduresare adequate to get mail to State prisoners.  You don'tthink that that's reasonably calculated to get mail toState prisoners.          MR. MINEAR:  We think it is reasonablycalculated.  Exactly, yes.          QUESTION:  So, if we held that this is areasonable -- sending it by mail is a reasonable way to doit, you wouldn't have any more of an institutional 1              QUESTION:  I don't understand why it's -- it's 2    intuitively obvious that ordinary mail suffices when we 3    have a situation here which is different from the 4    situation covered by the -- the ordinary mail.  In the 5    ordinary mail situation, the mail is delivered to 6    someone's post office box or -- or a mailbox, and that box 7    is under the control of the addressee.  We don't have that 8    here.  We have a -- we have a gap between that point and 9    the point at which the mail gets to a prisoner.  And10    that's why it doesn't seem obvious to me that merely11    adopting an ordinary mail rule is appropriate to these12    circumstances at all.  What am I missing?13              MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I think what -- what14    you see here is the proceedings below validated the fact15    that ordinary mail would suffice, the fact that there are16 mail --17              QUESTION:  The proceedings below didn't -- as I18    understand it, did not stop with proof that the letter was19    mailed.  The proceedings below involved an -- an20    indication of what the prison did with the mail when it21    got it in order to get that mail to the prisoner.  Isn't22    that correct?23              MR. MINEAR:  Well, perhaps the answer to your24    question, Your Honor, is that this Court can certainly25    affirm the decision below and say that the procedures511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425below were adequate.  It would be our view, though, thatthe Court ought not to foreclose the possibility thatordinary mail would suffice.          QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, are there -- do you knowwhether there are more prisoners incarcerated in prisonsthan there are college students living in dormitories towhom the mail is not delivered personally or -- orindividuals living in high rise apartment buildings wherethe mail is -- is sorted downstairs and not delivered bythe -- by the postman to their -- to their own room?          MR. MINEAR:  I do not know the answer to that,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  That's a problem for all thosepeople, just as it is for prisoners.  They have to rely onwhatever institution they're in getting the mail to them.          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  Although I would draw adistinction between the apartment building whereoftentimes the mail is provided -- is sorted by the mail-- by the U.S. Postal Service, put into individual boxes,and the dormitory residential hall.  I think the PostalService does draw a distinction between apartmentbuildings and dormitories in that regard.          QUESTION:  Mr. Minear --          QUESTION:  What about a hospital?          QUESTION:  -- there was a period when mail was521    not always routinely delivered to prisoners.  Sometimes it2    was censored and all the rest.  Would you say that3    ordinary mail would have been sufficient in that period of4 time?5 6 7 8 9          MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  Well, we think -- again,there are --          QUESTION:  The warden could just put it on theshelf and not even give it to the prisoner and there wouldbe no remedy at all.          MR. MINEAR:  Obviously, if there is -- if thereis reason to believe by the party that's sending noticethe mail will not -- that ordinary mail will not suffice,then due process may require that additional steps be1011121314    taken.15              QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, in the -- in the hospital16    setting, the Government has a claim against someone, knows17    that person is hospitalized, sends ordinary mail to the18    hospital for the contract claim, the tort claim, whatever.19    Is the Government saying that for an individual it is20    enough that mail is sent to that person care of an21    institution, no return receipt requested, that will do to22    satisfy due process notice requirements?23              MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I think that it would24    for this reason, that if a return address is provided and25    the mail is not delivered by the hospital, we can expect53 1    the hospital to send the mail return it to sender.  Upon 2    learning that, the Government may be on an -- under an 3    obligation at that point -- 4              QUESTION:  But suppose the hospital doesn't? 5    Suppose all we know is that this mail -- well, I think 6    your time is up. 7              MR. MINEAR:  Okay.  Thank you, Your Honor. 8              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear. 9              Ms. Zieve, you have 2 minutes remaining.10 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE11 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER12              MS. ZIEVE:  First of all, I'd like to address13    the -- the suggestion that these cases are about false14    claims.  Mr. Dusenbery actually made claims -- tried to15    get return of property of eight categories of forfeited16    property in this case and in the one cited at 201 F.3d17    763.  As to seven of the eight categories, it was proven18    that he didn't get the notice either because it wasn't19    sent at all or it was sent to the wrong place.  So,20    there's no reason to think that he's lying about the21 eighth.22              In addition, this is not a mail notice case.23    We're not talking about the adequacy of mail notice to a24    mortgage company or a creditor of an estate.  This case is25    more comparable to a situation in which you have a process54 1    server go out and you prove that you gave the notice to 2    the process server, but you don't ask him or her to ever 3    give you any verification that it was served. 4              Certified mail -- counsel suggests it could be 5    above the constitutional minimum, but applying this 6    Court's framework, this Court's test for assessing the 7    adequacy of notice, we know it's not above the 8    constitutional minimum because it will reduce the risk of 9    erroneous deprivation at minimal burden, and we know it10    reduces the risk because it can only be -- the notice can11    only be delivered, if their signature is required, to the12    addressee.  It will not be sent as in a private residence.13    It won't be misdelivered to your neighbor's house if you14    have to sign for it.  In a prison, it's not going to be15    misdelivered to the next cell or bundled with something16    else.  The inmate is going to have to sign for it.17              And finally, the Third Circuit, which did not18    require actual notice, did so only because of concern19    about the evidentiary burden it would place on the20    Government to have that standard, but the Government's21 current --22 23 24 25QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Zieve.MS.
